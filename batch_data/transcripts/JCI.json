We have joined this morning with a very, very long call to the microphone by Alex Molinaroli, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Alex is actually joining us from Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the World Economic Forum. So it\u2019s -- there is a little bit late here there because of the resistance here, so we are in different places. But Alex will join us of course for the call here and he will give an overview of the quarter and then we will be followed by Bruce McDonald, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for a look at each of the business segment and an overall financial view, followed then by your questions-and-answers ending somewhere near the top of the hour. And with that, we\u2019ll head over to Switzerland let me turn it over to Alex. Alex Molinaroli : Well, good morning, everyone. I am glad everyone could join. It\u2019s actually warmer here than in the Milwaukee. I -- first thing I want to do and I will come back to it at the end is acknowledge all the hard work, there has been also lot of accomplish in the short period of time. We have been able to accomplish some things that some things that we can about here and some things that are strategic while from an operational perspective could be enable to keep our eye on the ball. So the team -- when I say the team, all of our colleagues around the world are working hard and very focused. So let\u2019s talk about the environment a little bit, because I think it\u2019s important, if you go to slide three is where I am starting. We are benefiting from the North American volume increased. We will talk about -- we will talk about Europe and what we are doing. But we are seeing in Europe at least right now some stability in the market. It shows a, you should see a 2% increase in volume in the industry production, but I think that the 2% is not as important as stability is for us right now and hopefully, we can maintain that for the rest of the year. And then China, we had significant growth, we keep talking about and hear about 7%, 9% growth. What we saw was 14% growth in the quarter as relates to OE market. When you look at battery demand, we finally got the cold weather there we are looking for. We got it late November and throughout December, and so we were able to get, we have got some orders because of that, we will talk about that North America. Unfortunately and as I can attest, believe it or not, Europe having the warmest winter that had in a hundred years, so we can win for losing. But, so what you are going to find is we are little soft in Europe but we are going to see -- we are seeing the demand grow in North America which is we\u2019d prefer to have it there anyway and we will actually see more benefit going forward because it's continues to be cold and hopefully, what we will see is our customers haven't restock more than once this winter. And then we have seen a note about commercial HVAC demand improving. I think what I would say that, we're seeing an increase. I think a lot of it has to do with share. But we are gaining some share. We're seeing more activity. But mostly on the negotiated side, if you look at the architectural indexes, it would tell you that, we still a ways off before we see a strong commercial recovery. But we have, our pipelines are growing now and we are seeing more and more opportunities. And then in China, I am really happy to say that, we have been had a franchise business both in A/E and B/E and Power Solutions is making lots of strides and had their best month ever in December. So we\u2019re seeing growth in China across all of our businesses. If you go slide four and we just kind of recap the quarter. The way I would say this is, we did what we said we were going to do and I think that we did it in a way that was -- what -- it was a good quarter, strong operational performance. I think that, we can find opportunities that we could do some things, we could do some things better and some things we are surprised, how well it went. But we are particularly happy with how well the automotive business did and I'm sure Bruce will cover that later. But if you look at what we said in December, we did what we said we are going to do and that\u2019s really important to us. We are very focused on the near-term in making sure that we have a cost structure in place so that when the market comes back we can benefit from it. And I\u2019d say that, if you look at our restructuring activities, all the things that we've done in order to get ourselves positioned well for the future are on tracking and when we saw the benefits of that. And in particular you look what happen in our metals business, in our European business for automotive, significant changes and those guys are feeling good, this year they have done a great job. If you look at our second quarter outlook, EPS $0.64 to $0.66, see that\u2019s up 45%. Now, Bruce, will go over, we have some counting changes. So Bruce will go over some of that to make sure you understand what that means with the accounting changes, we went from -- we went from LIFO to FIFO in our Power Solutions business. So it has a significant quarter-to-quarter impact with our numbers. Our segment income, a 15% is a fully -- is continuing to be our full year outlook and we're sticking with the range that we gave you in December, $3.15 to $3.30. I do want to go through a couple things that that strategically important. We talked about our portfolio in December. We continue to talk about that. We\u2019ve talk about how we want to manage our capital in a different way at least our allocation of capital. And we have made, we have been very consistent in our behaviors of the things that we are doing, consistent with what we told you we are going to do it and you continue to see that. We are happy that we are able to get our agreement with Visteon, sell the rest of the electronics business. We increased our dividend 16%. We did finish our share repurchases for the year because of the accelerated plan that we had. We announced the joint venture with Hitachi. It\u2019s a very important -- it's very important to us because it\u2019s going to bring some products particularly mini-splits and VRF into our portfolio which are very important globally and become important to North America. And we announced that we are looking at strategic options for our interiors business. We don\u2019t have anything to talk about at that point but there is something that\u2019s ongoing. And then the building efficiency business, I mean this is a real big win. We have a largest contract ever and largest performance contract ever with the State of Hawaii Department of Transportation. It\u2019s over $150 million and over time that contract will grow. So big win for building efficiency and overall if you look at their numbers, month -- quarter-to-quarter we continue to see growth. We still don\u2019t have our backlog above last year. We did think we would at this point. But we\u2019re on track to continue to build that backlog. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce and he\u2019ll give you some more color on the segments. Bruce McDonald : Okay. Thanks Alex. So just starting on page -- on Slide 6, I\u2019ll go to Power Solutions first. You can see overall our sales in Power Solutions were up about 6%. If we were to sort of adjust for foreign exchange mainly the euro in lead, our underlying sales would have been up about 3%. In terms of unit production, and this is one of the reasons, we have a little bit of pressure in terms of our margins here. Overall shipments were up 3% and within that we saw OE volumes up 12% and aftermarket up 1%. So this -- we tend to be more profitable on the aftermarket side of our business and the fact that OE was up significantly and aftermarket was relatively constant here, did depress our margins little bit here in the quarter. Geographically, you can see the information here, North America or the America is overall 3%, our Asian business up 22% really reflecting the share gains that we\u2019re making in the Chinese market and then the Europe market down. What you would sort of see within Europe was the OE side of our business, is up about 7% and the aftermarket part of our business was down about 5% to 6%. So again little bit of a negative mix shift in our European partner business. As Alex indicated, just we\u2019d have sort of look at our shipments by months, we started the quarter little bit soft in North America although our aftermarket volumes picked up significantly in December. We did see double-digit increases in some of our PLS data from our customers and so our order backlog going into the second quarter, North America is very strong. However, that\u2019s not fully but it\u2019s largely offset by coming into the quarter with a pretty weak outlook in the aftermarket side in Europe due to the unseasonably warm weather. Just commenting on AGM and with this why we have note when I talk about the regional number that includes the AGM in there but -- but it stripped our AGM overall with up about 26% to about 1.6 million to 1.7 million units in a quarter. Look at the segment income here, come in at $308 million, up 12% from last year. Generally speaking, our results were favorably impacted by the higher unit shipments, which obviously helps our plant absorption. We\u2019re getting the benefits of in-house lead recycling versus last year, you recall we\u2019re flanking up our forest smelter and that\u2019s now fully online. And we saw -- we continue to see very strong operational performance from the Power Solutions plant. Margins overall were up about 90 basis points. I would point out from the early within some of the early notes -- within Power Solutions in the quarter, we did have $19 million non-recurring gain in here associated with an increase in our equity position of an equity and joint venture in South America. We went from 40% ownership interest to 90% ownership interest. So that business became consolidated in the quarter and that resulted in a $19 million non-recurring gain. Turning to Building Efficiency, you can see sales are little bit soft here, down 4%. If you were to back out the impacts and divestitures that we made last year, particularly in Europe and foreign exchange, our sales were down about 2% on a year-over-year basis. If you look at things geographically, little bit of mix back here in North America, the residential and light commercial business or UPG, it is sometimes called, they are up double-digit 11%. Asia was up marginally about 1%. Our North America systems and services business overall were constant versus last year. Then where we saw the weakness on the other hand was in the Middle East where we\u2019re down 30% -- 31%, Europe which was down 17% and then if you were to look at our global workplace solutions business, we\u2019re down about 5% globally there. We talked a little bit about our backlog and Alex did comment to limit the quarter of $5 billion and again adjusting for FX and divestitures down about 1% year-over-year. So we start to climb back but still down year-over-year. On the positive side, we can see orders, we talk about being up 5% in the quarter and again kind of a mix by here in the Middle East, up 16%; North America was our biggest market, we\u2019re up 11%. Europe, even though our revenue is soft in Europe, we\u2019ll start to see up orders. So Europe was up 3%. Asia was down 3% and the biggest area of softness is Latin America, it is down 17%. Segment income in BE at $146 million, was down 15% versus last year. We will need to adjust for couple of items. One is in the current quarter, we had about $20 million of non-recurring charges associated with curdling out some aged contracts and last year, if you would look within our GWS segment, you would have seen a $22 million benefit on a contract settlement in U.K. last year. So if you would have sort of equalized our year-over-year earnings with the gain that we recorded last year and the charge that we recorded this year, what you\u2019d see is our underlying earnings were up about 6% on the revenue decline, so got about 50 or 60 basis points of margin expansion on an underlying basis. In terms of Slide 8, our automotive experience, we clearly had an outstanding quarter here. We\u2019ve suffered through some long period here of difficult launch performances and some operational challenges, which you\u2019ve seen over the last sort of second half of 2013. It's pretty strong year-over-year earnings momentum and that really gathered pace here in the first quarter where you can see our earnings are up more than double versus last year. Look at our revenues and we like to kind of look at revenues in light of production, but North America, we're up 11% versus the production being up about 5%. So 2X times the market. In Europe, we have 9% versus the industry at 2%. That really reflects the -- the European performance really reflects our backlog coming on stream. So we have a higher percentage of our business that\u2019s on newer platforms and if you look at our custom exposure, we tend to be underexposed to a couple of customers that are losing share. So we have a healthy customer mix versus the market right now. That's benefiting our topline. In China, and Alex touched on this in his comments but it is great momentum in our business here are reflecting ongoing share gains. Our overall revenues, which is primarily a non-consolidated joint ventures in the quarter was $1.9 billion, which is up about 33% against the 14% increase in passenger car production in the quarter. So terrific quarter in China and we see that momentum carrying through here into the second quarter. In terms of our segment income, it more than doubled to $232 millions, which is up 130%. It benefited clearly from higher volumes but the real story was the operational improvements that we saw in our metals business, our European business and I guess to a larger extent in South America. Most of our restructuring initiatives were geared towards automotive and generally speaking, we are in line with our plans and tracking losses with the benefits that we expect here in 2014. In terms of our margins in auto, at 4%, we are up 210 basis points with our seating business, which is the biggest piece here of margins that looks like 1% and a 190 basis points higher than last year. If you look at our geographic profitability, North America was about 5.7%, which is consistent with last year. Asia was up 150 basis points with 13.6% and Europe was nearly at a breakeven level and about a $97 million year-over-year improvement. So a terrific quarter for our automotive businesses really drove the bulk of favorable year-over-year performance level of the company. Let\u2019s get into the slide 9 and go through with some of the financial highlights. Maybe I will just expand a bit on Alex comment in terms of the impact of changing from a LIFO to FIFO in Power Solutions. So for the year and for the first quarter and the fourth quarter, the impact is negligible less than a $0.01 a share. But it does change our second and third quarter previously reported numbers. So for the second quarter of 2013, last year ex-items, we reported earnings of $0.42. When we would make the LIFO to FIFO adjustment that becomes $0.45. So the number when we report our second quarter earnings here that we are comparing to, it is $0.45 ex-items not $0.42. And conversely in the third quarter, last year we reported earnings per share of $0.78 with LIFO change reduces back to $0.74. I know that\u2019s out by about $0.01 but it\u2019s all of the rounding and the full year impact is zero. So when we talk about our second and third quarter numbers on a go-forward basis, we are going to talk to those two adjustments. Turning to the first quarter, you can see our revenues that overall were up about 5%. If you take out the impact of the euro, which was positive and the yen which was negative for us then our underling growth was 4% excluding currency effects. We were pleased to see our gross profit improved by 70 basis points to 15.2%. We saw higher margins in all three of our businesses and that reflects the benefit of higher volumes and the cost reduction and initiatives associated with some of the manufacturing operations. In terms of SG&A, as a percentage of sales declined by 20 basis points to 9.9% from 10.1% last year. We continue to invest in some of our key growth initiatives and infrastructure in Asia, some IT systems implementation and R&D and advanced battery investment in particular. But despite that we were able to offset some of those increases with restructuring benefits. Our equity income line was up 33% to $113 million. What you will see in there basically is the $19 million non-recurring gain that we talked about earlier in Power Solutions and stronger profitability from the increased revenues in our automotive businesses in China. When I look at on our segment income here at 6.3%, very pleased to see a 100 basis point improvement in our underlying margins on a year-over-year basis. On slide 10, I will just comment on few line items here. In financing, we came in at $55 million, down about $6 million versus last year. And generally speaking, borrowing costs are around the same as last year, the benefits really flowing as a result of the just lower averaged debt levels in the quarter. Income tax rate of 20%, consistent with last year in our guidance. Income attributable to non-controlling interests up about $6 million versus last year, that\u2019s really just due to the higher level of profitability in some of our consolidated automotive joint ventures. And then lastly, if you look at our diluted earnings per share, it came in at $0.69 versus $0.52 last year, so up about 33%. We did get the benefit of our share buyback here, although the fact that it got completed kind of late in the quarter, our averaged share count was a little bit higher than the $670 million that we guided to in our Analyst Call here in the first quarter, but $670 million is probably good number for [Qs 2 to 4]. But we had about one set headwind associated with slightly higher share count here in the first quarter. Before I open it up for questions, I will just borrow a summary here. We were very pleased with the solid start to the year here. We had a couple of little bit near within our numbers with the one-time gain in Power Solution and that charges. And we have some contracts in BE but it was largely not out. So, I think -- if you look at the underlying $0.69, it\u2019s a strong number. Looking at some of the momentum that we have, the way our businesses are performing and the traction that we are making on our restructuring programs, we feel pretty confident about our second quarter outlook here. And at the midpoint of our guidance here, we are talking about Q2 earnings growth of about 45%. I don\u2019t think we have anything to be apologizing. For us, it\u2019s a pretty strong number. I don\u2019t think we are going to see a lot of companies out here with 35% earnings growth here in the first calendar quarter of 2014. After the first quarter in terms of our dividend, our buyback, in terms of divestiture activity, the Hitachi announcement and some of the work that we are starting to do with Interiors. And in terms of the full year, generally playing not as we expected, we are maintaining our guidance at $3.15 to $3.30. We commented about free cash flow for the year at being $1.6 billion and we think we are on track for that, even though we kept seeing our very large outflow here in the first quarter associated with some seasonal working capital factors and our buyback. We are going to work on getting our cash flow back to the number that we talked about here and we feel good about our margin expansion opportunities. So generally speaking, a very good start to the year and with that we will open it up for questions. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah, Toni, we are ready to take questions as soon as we can. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question came from the line of Mr. [Ryan Rickman]. Sir, your line now is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thank you. Could you talk about what is allowing you to make the market share gains in China that you aren\u2019t ceding with non-consolidated revenues up 33% in the industry, maybe 18% or so? Is that because of just -- which auto markers you lever to that they are gaining share or are you gaining share within those automakers and kind of continue? Alex Molinaroli : I will start that and Bruce, if you can add some more commentary to that. First off, I just think we are partnered with the right people and our partnerships with the local Chinese OEs and their partnerships happen to be with the right mix of customers, very similar to what you see in Europe. So we\u2019re outperforming the market because we happen to have the right partners with the right products. And not to mention that they are gaining share themselves, meaning our venture partners. So it\u2019s a little bit of both, we\u2019re unfortunate to have the customer mix and we are gaining shares. Bruce McDonald : Yeah. And I would, Brain, I\u2019ll maybe just add a couple of things. One is, we are seeing the benefit of our metals investment in China. So if you recall when we made the KEIPER and Hammerstein acquisitions, we -- one of the things we talked was the fact that we are significantly underrepresented metals in China and that business is now up and running and demonstrating strong growth. And the other sort of tailwind that we have is a lot of the Chinese own brand companies are putting more money to work in their interiors in an effort to compete with some of the European and North American brands. And so there, what we are seeing a little bit of the shift away from Chinese, independent Chinese-based suppliers in our ceiling business and to some extent interiors and that\u2019s shifting to western suppliers, so they can compete on into quality and power lift with the Western European and North America. So there is just kind of two factors in addition to what our factor that our customs are gaining share that I would point too. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thanks. Maybe update on the performance of GWS, how that division did in 1Q relative to our expectations and relative to what you would need to see to either want to dispose off or retain that division? Alex Molinaroli : (Inaudible) Bruce McDonald : The question was about GWS performance for the first quarter relative to our expectation I think, right? Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. And relative to what you would want to see to support your decision to either keep the division or dispose it, perhaps? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. So, as you\u2019ll recall the GWS is going through a transformation around its delivery mechanism. And I think that, unfortunately because we had year-on-year one-time issue, it doesn't really demonstrate the kind of progress they\u2019re making. They are making good progress against their objectives. I don't know it\u2019s going to -- it\u2019s not going to get easier for us, they\u2019ve done of a lot change in a very short period of time. Our customers are not only acknowledging the changes but they\u2019re helping us make these changes because it benefits both us and them. So at this point, I would say that they\u2019re pretty much on track. But it\u2019s early, we\u2019ve only been in this for three or four months, so it's early, but I would say so far so good. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Ravi Shanker. Sir, your line now is open. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Ravi. Bruce McDonald : Hi, Ravi. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley : Just the question on the Power Solutions business, I think, it\u2019s an interesting trend that you are seeing the strength in North America with the weather being so severe, but it\u2019s weakest in Europe. Anything in particularly we had to keep in mind from either capacity utilization or slices of business or mix that\u2019s going to cause that to be a net headwind or tailwind when you will have this? Alex Molinaroli : I\u2019ll start, Bruce, then you can give more information. I -- in generally, just from my knowledge of that business. Our volumes overall are higher in North America, particularly in the aftermarket. So if we had to get cold weather in one region and warm weather in another region, it would be exactly how it\u2019s happening here. So I think that the Europeans will have to make sure that they flex which is little tough in Europe, but in North America we\u2019re going to see continue significant gains. So if I had to pick the weather pattern, I couldn\u2019t get cold everywhere, I pick it the way it with. It\u2019s more the tailwind than headwind I think. Bruce McDonald : Yeah. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley : Understood. And also on the smelter capacity, is there any more tailwind or dry powder you have there on margins in term of just squeezing more capacity utilization out of these smelters? Alex Molinaroli : You are speaking anymore upside on the margins, is that you said? Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley : Yeah. Just from that, yeah. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. I think, well, we can't speak to -- I can\u2019t give you that answer completely. I'm sure there's going to be incremental improvements. We are still -- we\u2019re not starting up anymore but we are still, when you think about these plans. There\u2019s still lots of efficiency to be gain. But nothing like this coming online new. I think one of the opportunities that we found is that, now that their extra capacities in the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing the secondary totalers come to us looking for longer term contracts and in a much different way than they did five years ago. So there might be some benefits that we see that are outside of their own totaling just from and what we purchase. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley : Got it. And just lastly, one housekeeping question for Bruce. Just want to confirm that your 2Q and your full year guidance include the electronics business and it gives us 670 share account? Bruce McDonald : Yeah. Yeah. You are right. It does. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks Ravi. Operator : Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Rod Lache. Sir, your line now is open. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Good morning, everybody. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Rod. Bruce McDonald : Hi, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Just a couple, it would be real helpful if you can help us understand some of the puts and takes in the Power Solutions margins year-over-year. You had a $13 million increase in earning extra gain? It -- I think the middle of last year, you implemented that 3% to 4% price increase in the U.S. which is maybe 45% of Power Solutions and applied to the aftermarket, which is the majority? I would have thought that that alone would have maybe been more than that $13 million gain, maybe closer to $20 million and you also are talking about the benefits of I think previously you said 50 basis points per year from smelters and obviously some width from AGM batteries, which were up really strong. So just can you help us spread out a little bit on what we\u2019re seeing on the year-over-year basis? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Bruce McDonald : We\u2019ve could given the numbers so you are propping on net again. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019ll take that, Rod. I think, let me comment, in the kind of early notes there is a lot of, I feel a lot of questions about power and margins. And maybe let me just kind of give little bit extra step back. We -- if you look at our guidance that we gave for this year, we talked about Power Solutions margins being up 50 basis points for the year, roughly speaking. If you look at where we are here in the first quarter and Rod, if you take out the non-recurring gain then what you would see is margins are roughly comparable to where they were in the first quarter of last year. So we\u2019ve got little bit of the headwind to get to our full year number here. Now a couple things I would just point out in the first quarter. One, we -- that I talked about in my comments was we did see mix being a relative negative here in Q1 with OE being up substantially, aftermarket being largely flat. We don\u2019t see that continuing for the balance of the year and so that\u2019s as we sort of get flex back to normal mix here that will be headwind for us. We also do have higher -- offsetting some of the price increase or some of the investments that we\u2019re making out of business. So the price increases that we implemented which were generally positive. We put in place to offset higher lead totaling cost. Some of the increase costs that we have to incur to be compliant with some of the new emission standards. And look at our own business, we -- in the first quarter, we have some charges associated with implementing new IT system. And we continue ramp up our investment on a year-over-year basis in battery -- in advanced batteries. I would also point out that generally speaking, if you look at our incentive compensation cost that we started off last year in whole. And on the year-over-year basis, incentive compensation in battery is little bit higher. And then lastly, we talked about the South American joint venture that we consolidated. So last year in Q1, every quarter we had equity income. This year that\u2019s been necessarily consolidated. So you can think about our ownership right from 40% of that business to 90%. So last year, we had 40% of the profit and zero of the sales. This year, we have a 100% of the sales coming in than the corresponding profit. That business is a little bit dilutive to our margins but if you also factor in, the fact that\u2019s what we are essentially doing is picking up 100% of sales and only 60% of profit, it\u2019s a little bit of a headwind. Now that was in our guidance but I think those are the main issues I would say in terms of Q1. But our full year outlook at 50 basis point increase is stuff that we are still comfortable. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Okay. So just to clarify, if we think about it in terms of dollar changes of your basis rather than margins, which obviously can get thrown off by the OE versus after mark. You are saying, basically at this point at least, the volume increases the pricing adjustments and that big increase in AGM was offset by investments and comp generally, is that right? Alex Molinaroli :  More or less, more or less. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And are there some significant adjustments, as we look out in Q2 and Q3 when we think about the year-over-year comparison for this accounting change? Alex Molinaroli :  Well, what you are going to see as a result of that accounting change is a quarter similar to this one in the Q2. So you will see -- now when you make this accounting change, but it also -- what it does for us is because the length of a FIFO is out of the equation. Now, we can, I would say more efficiently run our factories and kind of more level load them because enough to worry about the volatility associated with buying and lead raw materials and things like that. So we can be more efficient in Romania at our plants operations. But what we are seeing here us Q2 and Power Solutions will be comparable to last year. We\u2019ll see a big benefit on the other end of the spectrum and see a much, much bigger improvement in Q3. And the seasonality that will show this year would be kind of the mid norm, so nothing exciting in terms of margins in power in Q2. You will see the benefit really in Q3 and Q4. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : All right. And just lastly, seating revenue was up 10% than first quarter and your guidance for the year was up 1% to 2%. Are there some big program roll offs in the second half, or are the numbers in fact coming in better than you were expecting? Alex Molinaroli : The number are coming in -- I didn\u2019t comment on our revenue. But I would tell you if you look at the first quarter here, probably 2% or 3% better like in aggregate than we saw with the bulk of that coming through in the auto space. So, I think if I was updating our revenue guidance, I would probably up auto and probably take a little bit off of BE at this point and for the company, we had a little bit of a tailwind here. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Great. Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Brian Johnson. Sir, your line now is open. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions. Alex Molinaroli : Hello, Brian. Brian Johnson - Barclays: First, could you just maybe, Alex, walk us through the kind of sales new battery shipments cycles U.S. aftermarket, just so we get a feel when this battery replacement line, that actually is close to shipment. And the second is I just want to follow-up on the seating equity income and kind of various puts and takes there. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. So, I will let Bruce handle second one. So in the battery business, especially in North America, we have liner side all way to the point of sale to our retail customers. So we are able to see what their point of sale is and then obviously what their order pattern is going to be got. As a rule of thumb, if we don\u2019t get a cold blast in December, if we don\u2019t get a good cold in December then we are probably going to get one restocking if that. If we get the kind of colds that we got here, we could get -- I never get a full turn but we are going to get the benefit of them of the retailers in particular having to stock more than once. So that\u2019s probably what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re going to see with little pushing out things like the lawn garden shipments, that will probably get pushed out little bit because the demand is going to push out much more than it was in the past, so we are going to have to restock at the end of the season. So, I would say that that\u2019s the rule of thumb and I can\u2019t give you the numbers, but I could tell you that it\u2019s more of a normal pattern, at least normal prior to the last couple of years. Sales from some of those customers were up 15% to 20% and we are shipping some of those batteries today. Brian Johnson - Barclays: And does the primary replenishment come for this kind of late January cold or January cold, would it come in your 2Q or in your 3Q? Alex Molinaroli : It will come in Q2. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Okay. And then on the equity income, when you back out the special gain, it looks like your equity income was $96 million, yet your commentary was very positive on China, which is primarily avoid income. Can you kind of educate us on the other puts and takes in the equity income line, or is it the case that China is going well but the equity income isn't quite keeping up? Alex Molinaroli : The equity -- there\u2019s a lot of investment there. What I would tell you, if you sort of look at AEs equity, let\u2019s just talk about our seating business first. What you would see is our equity income there is up about 25%, so a little bit diluted there. We do have -- and you would say it kind of wires that. I mean, there\u2019s a couple of larger joint ventures where we\u2019ve got significant startup costs. As you know, there\u2019s a lot of new production coming on with Volkswagen and Audi and Ford and others in the western part of the country, so building new facilities there. So that\u2019s a little bit of a dilution for us. Interiors, our equity income was down couple million and more really just reflecting on customer mix. The other adverse thing I would point out is we did have equity income associated with this Power Solutions joint venture that went away. So when I said, we have $90 million gain. Last year, we had $2 million or $3 million of equity income. So, I guess the net year-over-year was about $16 million versus $19 million. So it\u2019s really just investments that we are keeping that aren\u2019t quite keeping up with that topline growth point grow, but I think we are pleased with where we stand, are we doing on some startup, some new startup JVs in there too as well. Brian Johnson - Barclays:  Okay. It would be helpful if we could just get China equity income and seating broken out at some point. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Okay. We can follow-up with you on that, Brian. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Patrick Archambault. Your line now is open sir. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : A couple of follow-ups from my end. Just kind of taking I think where Rod was going with his question, kind of more in aggregate for the whole company. If you look at what was done in fiscal Q1 and what's implied by the guidance for Q2, it does imply fairly backend loaded increase in margins in subsequent quarters. And I know some of that is seasonality. You did highlight kind of a mix benefit and some operational comps on the battery side. But maybe you can just help us understand how we kind of get up that backend loaded margin curve a little better? Bruce McDonald : Well, I think, I'm not sure. I agree with you, but maybe -- let me try my best here. If you look at the guidance that we've given for this year, so we said 315 to 330, which played against about I think we end up last year 260 or something like that. So if you think about up sort of euro and you look at kind of Q1 were up 33% so we\u2019re front-end loaded on that one in Q2, up 45%. So the back -- the earning -- the year-over-year earnings growth that we have in the second half is lower than the first half. So I would say that the -- our earnings growth is front-end loaded not backend loaded. Having said that, if you look at our seasonality of the company, really because of Building Efficiency what you tend to see it, who earns about 65% to 70% of profit in the last couple of quarters, that's really what drives the year-over-year improvement. But maybe only other thing I could -- I would point to is if just look at Q1 and you said we'll take out the impact in December shutdown or let\u2019s say the December shutdown in Auto, that's probably worth $0.05 a share in the current quarter. So I think I feel pretty good about our phasing here and maybe I'm just missing your question, Patrick. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Yeah, it was more reflective of margins rather than just absolute EPS level. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Okay. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : And if you just go through the segment, it does imply, I think pretty much across. Unless, I'm missing something I think it does imply the margin increase sequentially. I think you just sort of explain the seasonality of Building Efficiency. Alex Molinaroli : Yes. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : And then, I guess automotive to your point I guess is sort of has the shutdown. And then I suppose maybe it\u2019s -- those are two items, right. The mix, the benefit in batteries and in some of the operation cost that you explain maybe that's the rest of it I suppose? Bruce McDonald : Yeah. And I guess maybe I don\u2019t think when the one point out would be that we're going to ask only thing, benefit from the restructuring activity. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. I would say that's probably, if you look at the pattern, the pattern is the same. If we make we make in first quarter guidance and we make the numbers that the guidance that we\u2019ve given you for the second quarter. Is that itself for the right pattern if you look at our historical patterns. One difference this year that will give us more margin is our cost basis is dropping because of the restructuring. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then kind of another follow-up, I mean I know this was addressed at your Analyst Day, but kind of the general. I just have to think the flat top line guidance right for sort of the longer term that you guys provided for the seating. It seems conservative right especially given what you're seeing now. I mean you've got kind of cyclical recovery in Europe that\u2019s starting China has strong momentum. It sounds like your customer exposure is favorable and then there is maybe the backlog is the key question. So maybe we could just revisit that a little bit just given the strength of that business unit this quarter? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Let me start and Bruce can give in the backlog information. I think one another things that you have to recall and go back and look into your notes is what assumptions that we put in for the automotive business and what assumptions for Europe and North America. We probably didn't talk because it\u2019s not top line so much about the China assumption or at least it's not a part of the top line conversation. I think what we saw in the first quarter, you could tell about our comments we were surprise as how strong it was everywhere. I personally don't believe that Europe is going to continue at that kind of strength. I think it's going to bump along, but I don't -- we're not predicting that it's going to continue to grow. We hope it does. But I think what you -- if you say conservative -- being conservative, I hope we were, but it was based on the assumptions that we gave you. And I would say that our ongoing backlog is going to become flatter, because we are going to not -- we are not going to invest the same -- at the same level we did in past. So you should see our margin improve which you actually see the kind of the growth that we saw in the past, because we're not going to make those investments. That's going forward. Bruce, I\u2019m going to get something to add to that. Bruce McDonald : Yeah. I think whether than -- or if I just look at our -- look at the guidance that we gave for 2014 in particular. We said North America we have 6% for the year, about 5%. We said -- we saw Europe will grow 2% for the year, it\u2019s up 2. China we said -- we saw it will be up 11 and that was up 14. So generally speaking I think we\u2019re generally above, clearly getting some -- we are getting some lift from our customer mix about those better than expected Patrick. And we are continuing to see clinically in Europe not that luxury car segment doing better than we thought. And so I just -- that would be hard for us to say I don't see, I think those things may not continue. So like I said to one of the early question, we probably have some revenue upside in Auto when I look at things in aggregate here. On the other hand, I would say BE revenue is probably little bit weaker than we thought. But in aggregate, we probably got some revenue upside here in the balance of the year. That -- I'm not back away from that. Glen Ponczak : Brett, it\u2019s Glen here. I think you're looking at through 2018 number being sort of flattish top line, remember most of our growth of the China and those sales are not consolidated. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Right. Bruce McDonald : So, it's really more a comment on, to Alex\u2019s point earlier, about the level of investment in North America and Europe, I think, what they\u2019ve been used to be. Then the growth in China being pretty good but you're not going to see it consolidated sales line. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. That's really helpful. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Italy Michaeli. Your line is now open. Italy Michaeli - Citigroup: Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Italy Michaeli - Citigroup: Just wanted to drill down on cash flow little bit. Bruce, you talked about the working capital headwind. Looks like most of it or all of it really came from accounts payable and accrued liability. Hoping you could drill down a bit more into the detail there. Then typically historically you've always also been cash flow negative in Q2 of the year without -- should we expect the same this year or perhaps given the extent of the burn in Q1 -- Q2 actually turn positive for you? Bruce McDonald : Yeah. Maybe I just give a little bit of some comments on the working capital. So you're right. We typically do have an outflow in Q1. Although, this was higher than in the previous year and a little bit of a disappointment actually coming out of the blocks here. So just look at where we finish the quarter, we had an outflow about $945 million, that\u2019s about 700 million higher than last year. And I want to tell you, really look at the main items in there and kind of point to four things. One is timing of tax payments. So we probably worth about $300 million, a lot of tax planning and payments and sort of things delayed refunds on VAT and things like that, I see that all coming back, $300 million. And we do have, our fair share of some customers with December 31st year end, where I would say our, we did not get a payment in on by December 31st. We got in the first week of December. I would say in aggregate and that typically happens to us but in aggregate that\u2019s probably about $100 million higher than the last year. Inventory for us here in Q1 was we kind of made a decision because of the clear weather that we are seeing in power to -- you saw continued over, I would say, overproduced, so even though we really good shipments out, we have $100 million more inventory than we have in the past in Power Solutions. And then, 2013, if you look at just the payments that we had associate with sales incentives and balances and things like that about $150 million higher outflow in Q1 than the prior year and again that will be, that\u2019s all timely. So when I kind of go through all those items largely and this is pretty good about it being time and regulator, our full year guidance when we talk about being about $1.6 billion of free cash flow, we were forecasting a full year outflows of $200 million to $300 million. So my expectation here is in the second quarter some of these timing things will start to unwind and I think what you will see better cash performance in the second quarter than we had in the past. Italy Michaeli - Citigroup: Perfect. Thanks so much for that detail, Bruce. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks. Bruce McDonald : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. [Brett Coperson]. Your line now is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Good afternoon, Alex. Good morning, Bruce and Glen. Bruce McDonald : Good morning, Brett. Alex Molinaroli : Hi. Unidentified Analyst : I wanted to start off the automotive business and Bruce, I was hoping you could just give us a sense of the margins by geography, maybe on a year-over-year basis, I know in slide eight you kind of gave us a flavor for it. I was hoping and in the past, you've kind of talked a little bit about your margins were in Europe last year versus this year and so on and so forth? And obviously, it would be great if you could maybe adjust for some of the divestitures that you've made? Bruce McDonald : Yeah. Well, it would be, if I was, but if you just look back the old segment, here is what the answer would be. So North America last year 5.7, this year 5.7 flat, that\u2019s where you will see the impact of HomeLink heading us, only and it has a little bit of impact in the Europe, but generally speaking most of the dilutive impact of the HomeLink sale would have depressed North American margins and if I was sort of running that off to top of my head, I would say that\u2019s probably 80 to 100 basis points. And Europe last year, I don\u2019t have the margin on this I know last year we lost $105 million. In Q1, this year our lost is, which mainly associated with the shutdown. So in Europe overall we lost $8 million, so that we touch about $97 million improvement. And in Asia, we are at 12.1% last year, 150 basis points to 13.6% this year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s kind of an old segment, new segment basis. Unidentified Analyst : And then as you kind of think about that margin progression through the remainder of the year, I mean your automotive is around 4%, your guidance is like around 4% to 4.2%, it kind of changes adjusted to margins, it\u2019s going to be roughly pass through the remainder of the year? Bruce McDonald : While we talked about the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year for Auto in aggregate was 70 to 90 basis point improvement with seating being up somewhere between 100 and 120. We\u2019ve been -- in terms of -- let's forget about electronics because that\u2019s where the HomeLink in and out, it is kind of really confusion. But let\u2019s say, if you looked at our interiors business, we talked about that business going from a minus 0.3 last year to a range of 1% to 1.2%. Interiors had a great quarter. That\u2019s the probably the business that\u2019s furthest along in terms of the restructuring because we sort of started at earliest. And so we probably had some upside in terms of our interior\u2019s profit. But I think where we see seating come in that quarter 4.8% to 5%, number was -- I think we feel pretty good about that. If you would have probably take our Q1 number, just trying to think what I talked of both seating here. With 4.1 in the fourth quarter, we still had some -- obviously some loan figure on our medals improvement, I mean we are in the big year. We have improved. We got a lot of opportunity of, say, in the future quarters here. Unidentified Analyst : And then switching gears to Power, over the past year or two, we have been talking about little bit weaker aftermarket demand, the winter cold snap here potentially driving little bit higher demand but if you kind of reflect back on the potential impact of maybe strengthening demand in the aftermarket battery business and Power Solutions business, how do we think about that from a revenue standpoint, in other words, is -- does normalized demand drive $10 million of incremental revenue in that segment or is it more like $100 million of incremental revenue, I mean, what kind of order of magnitude would you characterize that as? Alex Molinaroli : Hello. This is Alex. I\u2019d be afraid to give you that number because some time we can take a look at and give you -- I just don\u2019t. I -- most of you know on top of the head, Bruce and I was pretty close to it. I just -- I don\u2019t have that number. Bruce McDonald : No. I don\u2019t have that one. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then finally just on the share repurchase standpoint, $3.6 billion over three years, you did $1.2 billion in the first quarter. How do we think about the pace of share repurchase going forward? Alex Molinaroli : We are going to only do a $1.2 billion this year. So we decided and I think I may have talked about this when we had our November call. But we really think we decided it because it was quite a departure in terms of our past that we would front-end load. I would suggest that we should not do it sort of equally through the year but get out and have it back stronger here and do it all in Q1. We have not decided yet or even talked about as we get into the F\u201915, \u201916. We can always combine on Q1. We are going to spread it out. We don\u2019t have any answer for that yet. But I think the main thing is we are -- we did want to maintain some flexibility to look at M&A at some point in time here. For now, the $1.2 billion that we\u2019ve done here in Q1 is all that we are planning on doing for this year. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks very much. Perfect. Bruce McDonald : Thanks, Brett, I think we are out of time. Operator, I will be around for the balance of the day, certainly meeting tomorrow to answer any questions I didn\u2019t get answer out. So any final signoff from Davos? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Just going to give you a couple -- I'm incredibly proud. As I said early on about what our teams accomplished. And we talk an awful lot here about what\u2019s going to happen next quarter, some of the bridges from the first quarter and how conservative we are for the full year. I hope as we continue to go -- continue to ask questions about how we are changing the company, changing the portfolio of the company, profile of the company and how we are going to run the company. And I hope we continue to have that conversation because we made substantial progress in a very short period of time of getting some momentum and getting our team aligned. So, I just want to thank all of our employees. They are working extremely hard between restructuring to operational improvements and some of the changes that we are trying to make as far as how we operate and run the company. It\u2019s a lot of change, very fast and they are responding well. So thanks to the employees and I appreciate all the good questions. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Johnson Controls disclaims any obligations to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation. And with that, let's get started Alex. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to start by recognizing that the quarter was fantastical draw, I\u2019m really pleased with our results. And even with some of the mixed results as it relates to the top-line, operational improvements are really across all of our businesses. So, we are exactly where we wanted to be, in spite of some of the markets not helping us so well. So, I\u2019ll just jump right in on the second quarter, some of the highlights or some of them, what\u2019s happened in the industry. What we saw was a stronger Europe market than we anticipated, continued strength in North America, and we\u2019ll talk later about China but the marketplace in China remains around 9%, but you\u2019ll see later that we\u2019ve outperformed the market. In the battery business, we had great results in North America, the aftermarket we saw demand increase due to the cold weather particularly in the Midwest and North East. And then, but unfortunately in Europe, we see demand continue to drop and it\u2019s specifically in Northern Europe, you look at Russia, Northern Europe meaning Germany and the Baltics, Russia and Turkey. In the HVAC market, the commercial markets we\u2019re still awaiting for a rebound that we haven\u2019t seen. And unfortunately it continues to push and in spite of that we have been able to have great bottom-line results, but it\u2019s bit frustrating that the market hasn\u2019t turned on us yet, but we\u2019re ready when it does. And then all of our businesses, we are still seeing strong markets across the China region. So let\u2019s talk about our results. For the quarter, our revenue is up for 4% and our segment income was up 36%, a little growth (inaudible) the operational increases which were significant and then our earnings per share was a little bit better than what we expected overall up 52% shows that the segment income increased, the operational income increases along with some of the other non-operational items. Our Q2 results are at the high-end of what we guided and we will talk later about what our future guidance or the guidance for the rest of the year. I would to just say that execution remains our number one priority, but all that being said, we have been pretty busy on our strategic initiatives trying to keep everyone updated on our portfolio changes. And that known I\u2019d like to remind you this is the slide where it is we\u2019re going and where we\u2019ve been. We have list here just reminds everyone of things that we are working on or have completed over the last year. And specifically there are two things that over the next quarter are two we should see close is the ADT acquisition we hope that closes in the next quarter and the closing of the Electronics deal that will certainly happen this fiscal year. If you go to the segments, let\u2019s talk about Power Solutions. So sales were actually up just a (inaudible), so basically flat sales in Power Solutions. And if you look at it outside of [LatAm] we actually saw a 4% increase. Unfortunately all the great news we had in North America in the aftermarket was offset to a large extent by Europe. Specifically it\u2019s Russia, Germany; the Baltics is the bulk of it. There is a few things that account for that, weather is one, our AGM penetration sales is another one. Our AGM penetration is up 24% in the quarter. And then we are also seeing some of the effects of the downturn on the first replacement cycle, the downturn in \u201808 and \u201809. If you look at their results, the bottom-line shows that the results we retrieved 5%, but what you need to keep in count is the footnote we have here that we had a legal settlement last year that [popped-up] the numbers of $24 million. So what we are seeing is; we are seeing the margins at what we expected; we are still seeing the operational improvements and hopefully we will continue with that and get some additional volume. We should see some good improvements in the third quarter. If you recall last year, the third quarter is when we started having some of our difficulties in Power Solutions. If we move to Building Efficiency, probably the most frustrating part about this business is the commercial HVAC markets, particularly the high-end particularly the institutional segments continue not to grow. We are seeing some pipeline growth, so our orders secured is still tough but we\u2019re seeing projects go in our pipeline at an increasing rate. So hopefully that will turn into growth in the future but I am a little shy to start talking about that until I start see anything move to the pipeline. So, if you look at sales being down 2%, and when you take out GWS and divestitures, you can see that Asia was up 5%, North America was down 4%, and orders in North America were down 2%. The Middle East was down 31%, the Middle East being down 31% has a lot to do with very large projects we had in the pipeline last year. And then workplace solutions were down 8%. If you look at the operating performance, it has to do with all of the initiatives that we\u2019ve had in place; the restructure we\u2019ve had in place; and also the separation of GWS, strong operating results considering the lack of volume. And GWS specifically is really benefiting from the restructuring charges and the operational initiatives we have. The backlog is about flat to last year and then orders down 2%. So, we\u2019re hopeful that that will turn as we continue to see some toughness in the markets we participate in. Automotive experience is really a great story, not only are we participating in the growth, we\u2019re giving the pull through on the income side. If you look at our revenues in North America, Europe, Asia, China all sales are up. And if you look at the sales of 25% in China, that shows you that we\u2019re benefiting and gaining share continually in China. The production numbers are really to remind you. The segment income is also a great story. In fact, pretty pleased that metal performance is one that went from an unprofitable business last quarter to a profitable business this quarter. And so we continue to see improvements in our metals business. Our margins are up and both in the interiors and our automotive business and both have done very well. If you look at our interiors business, they\u2019ve gone from a loss making business last quarter -- last quarter of this year -- last year this quarter to a business that\u2019s now making money. So all-in-all, not a lot of help to top-line except for automotive, some incredible results. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce and then I\u2019ll close up. Bruce McDonald : Okay. Thanks Al. Yes, just on slide 9 here, I\u2019ll just talk about the financial highlights. And these are from continuing operations, so maybe just before I -- some of the early notes that there is some confusion around those in and out. But electronics for the quarter, we pulled out of our numbers, if you were to sort of add it back in the quarter, the sales were about 344 million and segment income was about 18 million. So, those sort of get collapsed and just reported net of tax on the discontinued operations line. So, that\u2019s kind of how things shake out versus probably what was the most analysts\u2019 model. We\u2019ve also had some one-time charges in this quarter and the prior year. This year we had non-cash tax charge of about $0.27 and last year, we had three non-operational items that resulted in net charge of $0.20. And as I go through the numbers, I\u2019ll back those out. So I\u2019m going through the adjusted numbers. So let\u2019s start with revenue, we\u2019re up about 4% to $10.5 billion. You can see our gross profit here up about 50 basis points. Here we\u2019re really seeing the benefits of the automotive operational performance and the impact of higher global revenues in the auto space. SG&A. Here as we will start to see the benefit of a lot of the restructuring cost reduction initiatives, so on a slightly higher sales level you receive SG&A expense were down 10%. So, that we can see the impact that had on our segment margins. Equity income, a little bit higher than last year about $8 million, we benefited from improved profitability of our automotive joint ventures. And we can see our segment income margins of 6% were 140 basis points higher than the 2015 Q2 number. On slide 10. Might I just draw your attention to financing charges that were down about $10 million versus the prior year, really, really benefited from really lower interest rates. So borrowing levels were slightly lower than last year, we had more of our debt in shorter term commercial paper which has a significant lower interest rate. Tax rate in the quarter is just above 19% and roughly in line with where we were in the second quarter of last year. There is a tweak to our tax rate associated with the reclassification of electronics and discontinued operations, our blended rate is 20%, but continued operation a little bit lower and the electronics rate to discontinued operation is necessarily higher. So, the average about 20%. And EPS for the quarter came in at $0.64 which is up the 52% that Alex referred to and including the impact of the discontinued operations our total to diluted earnings per share were $0.66 which is at the high end of our guidance. Slipping to slide 11, I just spend a minute on the balance sheet and cash flow, and we are sort of pleased with how the balance sheet sort of smack back this quarter, you recall with a fairly large outflow in the first quarter really around some of the seasonal working capital factors and the $1.2 billion buyback that we completed. So if you look at this quarter our cash flow from operations was $730 million, you can see that\u2019s nearly club (inaudible) versus where we were last year. Our net debt in the quarter came down almost $400 million and we are sitting here right now with the net debt to total capitalization of about 34%. Our trade working capital was source of cash in the quarter. If you look at that and we define trade working capital\u2019s payables receivable inventory which is now about 6.9% of sales, down about 80% basis points from where we were last year. In terms of CapEx on a year-to-date basis where we thought would be are half way through in a $1.2 billion that we have guided to. Really pretty confident in the second half cash flow, our cash flow is back end loaded with our earnings and we remain on track to deliver the $1.6 billion free cash flow target that we set at the beginning of the year. And lastly on slide 12. I just touched on our guidance. I just want to be clear in terms of what we are saying and what we said. So if we go back to the guidance that we have provided on December analyst meeting in New York, we talked about a range of $3.15 to $3.30 including Electronics and Electronics perhaps within that range was up $0.10 to $0.12. So on an apples-to-apples basis that we were to pullout Electronics, our guidance back then would have been $3.05 to $3.18. And so what we are doing here today is we are tightening and slightly raising the midpoint of our guidance to a range of $3.10 to $3.15 without electronics so it\u2019s continuing operations. And then from the third quarter we\u2019re introducing earnings range of $0.81 to $0.84 which as we compared to last would be an increase of between 13% and 17%. And we talked a little bit about air distribution technology and the impact it would have on our 2014 numbers, excluding any transaction related costs we think it\u2019s going to be fairly neutral to our Q4 earnings estimates. And so I will turn it back over to you Alex. Alex Molinaroli :  Yes, before we get the questions there is a couple of things I would like to point out where I think there might be some concerns. First I will give you some, my take on B/E, if you look at our share which is something that we can only control, we can\u2019t control the marketplace, we are maintaining or increasing our share. If you look at our profitability, I will just give you an example, I go to North America, if you look at our profitability in North America with sales being down 4% our earnings are up 22% a quarter, 12% year-to-date. So we have got operational improvements that are put in place, we are not losing share and when the market comes back we are going to be in a position to take advantage of that. So I want to make sure it puts it in a context that we are very pleased with what\u2019s going on and we just wish the market was coming back quicker. And in Power Solutions we are increasing our share both in the OEs if you look at it this time versus last year and the aftermarket unfortunately in Europe the aftermarket is not helping us, it is helping us in North America. Along with increasing share our AGM growth is continuing and we are very pleased with our China growth. So if you look at our strategic initiatives and what we have been saying with what we can control, I am very proud of what the team has done. Last thing that I will leave you with, if you look at the portfolio moves we still have ways to go but I am also pleased with how quickly the team has been able to get their heads wrapped around and get some actions put in place in order to meet some of our portfolio changes, so all-in-all I am pretty pleased with what we\u2019ve accomplished so far. With that Glen I think we\u2019ll take the questions. Glen Ponczak : Yes. (Inaudible), we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Brett Hoselton. Sir you may now proceed. Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc: Good morning gentlemen. Alex Molinaroli : Hi Brett. Glen Ponczak : Good morning. Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc: Two things here, related to the automotive segment. First, can you provide your guidance while you\u2019re looking at CD margins coming at high 4% or 5% range? And I am wondering how are you tracking, how are you feeling about that (inaudible) a little bit of pressure on their margins versus their previous expectations, but how are you feeling about the margins kind of in the short-term relative to your guidance? And then kind of longer-term where do see that segment potentially moving to you? Bruce McDonald : Yes, Brett it\u2019s Bruce here. Well, we\u2019ve always talked about we think our margins are to be in the 7% to 8% range, if you look at this, the quarter that we just did our ceiling business was 5.2% and that\u2019s off of a depressed, our metals business a lot better than it was, but still not anywhere close to where we think that business should be from a longer-term margin perspective and obviously Europe is pretty fast. So I would tell you right now our, if you look at where we are through these six months our ceiling business, our interiors business and the Electronics business are all performing ahead of our plan, both in terms of our top-line and margin performance, so we're pretty pleased. Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc:  And then on the interiors business, can you provide us with an update as to your latest thinking, I know you\u2019re doing a strategic review of the interiors business. Is there anything new that you can share with us with regards to future of that business? Alex Molinaroli : Unfortunately we\u2019re not in a position to share yet. I could tell you that we're heavily engaged in activities and I\u2019m hopeful and I told our employees that over the next quarter or so we should be able to talk about it, so that\u2019s where we are today. Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc:  Okay. Thank you very much gentlemen. Alex Molinaroli :  Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Sir you may now proceed. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank :  Good morning everybody. Alex, so speaking you might be willing to just kind of revisit your thoughts on the long-term goal for the building efficiency, auto experience and power solutions and whether those have changed? Just in the context of what we\u2019ve seen here building efficiency down, it was down last year and year before was weak. I think long-term you\u2019ve been talking about 5% to 6% growth there. I think you sort of intimated that automotive experience would be kind of flattish, but here it\u2019s been running up over 9%. And similarly for power solutions, there was originally like an 8% to 9% long-term growth expectations, but that\u2019s been running a little bit lower. So you get a couple of years here of different performance than what the long-term plan was, is that kind of factor into your thinking about the long-term now? Alex Molinaroli : Well I think we\u2019re going through cycles. The automotive cycle is better than what we expected and we certainly want to take advantage of that long-term, but haven\u2019t really changed our view. Building efficiency, unfortunately we just have not seen in the commercial market especially the high-end come back. Our recent acquisition of ADT is going to help us not only with other distribution that participate in the broader in the market, but also in some of the products that are more down market. So, we can have a broader participation in the marketplace. So, I'm still bullish on BE long-term, frustrated with where we're at. So, we'll continue to invest particularly in North America and China, but we think that long-term that's the best place to invest in our dollars; the Hitachi JV is an example of that. And as far as our power solutions, I think we're finally getting some traction in China. And as you know, the AGM growth just happens quick as we wanted to. But we're maintaining the share and keeping share in that business. So that business is one that we can't control necessarily what's going to happen on the ground, but what we can control is make sure we maintain share. But I would tell you that my long-term view of where we're going to invest has not changed. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : And you\u2019re still expecting kind of a secular growth rate in building efficiency. Is that what you are referring to as more of the cyclical part, but in the past you've talked quite a bit about some of the savings opportunities there and why that should grow on a secular long-term basis? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, I expect to outperform the marketplace. And we're certainly getting our cost inline and I think this will make us not only more competitive, but put us in a position to take advantage of the upturn. So, I would expect that we're going to outpace the market, not only because we have a good cost position, but because we're adding to our portfolio. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And in auto experience, could you just give us a little bit of detail on what the profitability looks like right now and structures and what's the gap to your target. And I don't know sounds like you don't really want to give us a lot on the interior sale process, but is there any kind of broad framework that you can convey on valuation or what you are thinking that you can get out of it at this point? Bruce McDonald : Well, I think we\u2019ve said organic sales in terms of the interior just got to be pretty (inaudible) but in terms of our structuring business, I can tell you that we were profitable in the quarter, so we are profitable in fact every month. I don\u2019t have that top of my head, however the margins, I would say it\u2019s probably in the 1% to 2% type range and it\u2019s a business that when we look at our metals business overall should be normally 8% to 10% range. And we\u2019ve talked in the past about what are sort of things that we need to do to get there, it\u2019s not going to be a -- right now we are benefiting from fixing a lot of our launch problems, but to get to the target that I talked about, we really have to accomplish two things; one is getting our plants converted over so they are all making the 2b technology and right now we have a eight plus four of technology that came from the three businesses before. And then we are working on some initiatives to spend on some of our [product] technology as well, standardize how we make things. So, once we kind of get through that and it\u2019s going to take two to three years working with the customers this product stays out and the new 2b technologies phase in. And we\u2019ve been encouraged that the underlying problems that we\u2019ve had in that business are not reoccurring and the benefit of the longer term plan that we\u2019ve put in place are all performing as we\u2019ve expected. Alex Molinaroli : Yes. And this is Alex. So I think that probably after another quarter or so not only do we have confidence, but everyone has confidence that fixing is behind us. We\u2019re going to start talking more about the future of business, which is exactly what Bruce said. We have an opportunity to grow that business. We have a great position technology wise and then we have also extended our position in China. So I hope we could start talking about what we\u2019re doing to grow that business and make it more profitable in the future now that we are getting operations issues behind us. Bruce McDonald : Yes, I\u2019d probably should just clarify my comments are rolled our North American, European business. One of other initiatives was growing that business in China so that we have made the investment and then that\u2019s the business that we expect to be pretty close double-digit this year. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Great, thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks Rod. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next is coming from Mr. Mike Wood. Sir you may now proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking my question. In building efficiency things maybe, could have been impacted by a pull forward from the Energy Policy Act expiration at the end of last year and also weather in North America. Can you give us a sense of how the orders exited the quarter? Alex Molinaroli :  Let me make sure I understand the question. Is it relates to what orders we have in place or what happened at the back-end of the quarter? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, the back-end of the quarter, I just feel like the beginning of the quarter may not be representative, so it would be interesting to know what run rate you exited the quarter at? Alex Molinaroli :  I think that you are there is couple of things; I think there is problem asking that type of question. We are obviously going to see a seasonal benefit on a year-on-year basis, we are seeing some improvement and quite interestingly one of the things that\u2019s really growing is our service business, service contracts and our repair business which is high margin business is benefiting more than the marketplace. So, there are lots of signs but we\u2019re skittish. And until we have more than a month or so we\u2019re not going to be really bullish talking about growth. But you\u2019re right, it was back-end loaded in the quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And also can you give us a sense of the European vehicle production forecast that you have embedded in 2Q, we had another supplier reported this morning had 2% forecast for next quarter wondering if you\u2019re seeing the same moderation, despite the vehicle registration that\u2019s been strong there? Bruce McDonald : Yes, it\u2019s Bruce. We\u2019re in that I\u2019d say 2% to 3% is what we\u2019re sort of seeing. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Italy Michaeli. Sir you may now proceed. Italy Michaeli - Citigroup: Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Bruce McDonald : Good morning. Italy Michaeli - Citigroup: Just a follow-up to maybe to Rod\u2019s question I was hoping you can just update us on what you\u2019re expecting for revenue by segment just the growth rates that you led out for \u201814 by segment? Bruce McDonald : In terms of our guidance here, yes\u2026 Italy Michaeli - Citigroup: Yes, you\u2019re talking now with post electronics and just with the B/E kind of numbers in the quarter just kind of what your significant 1% to 3% growth in building efficiency in \u201814 and about 7% to 8% in power solutions? Bruce McDonald : Yes. I\u2019d say right now if you kind of look at it, we\u2019re looking at I don\u2019t have the numbers at the top of my head. But I can tell you directionally B/E is going to be flattish to slightly down in terms of just given our backlog performance because there are not very lot we can do to move the needle in terms of whether pick up and its impact on the second half of the year. Power solutions, it is difficult to get some visibility around the aftermarket trends, but they are probably slightly down, maybe 1% to 2% lower than we said before. And automotive will probably be stronger even, the underlying growth in our seating and interiors is stronger. What I -- I can\u2019t do math in my head here quickly in terms of how that translates into striping out electronics. Italy Michaeli - Citigroup:  Okay. So sure, that\u2019s helpful. And just two follow-up balance sheet questions, one, pretty impressive, you are able to maintain the free cash flow guidance for the year, just maybe talk about what\u2019s going right there. And then two, I think your prior guidance was to end \u201814 with about 23% or 25% in net debt to cap ratio, I was hoping you can update us on that and if you have a pro forma for where that would be after the recent acquisition announcement, those would be great. Bruce McDonald :  Yes, the free cash flow and just maybe to help you out of couple, our earnings tend to be our backend loaded, so there is more cash flow that comes through because of the earnings seasonality and that\u2019s (inaudible). Secondly is we tend to have a inventory build towards the first half for the year around some of the equipment and building efficiency that sort of winds back in the second half of the year. In our guidance, we\u2019ve got the proceeds of the electronics divestiture which is 265 million coming in. We also in the second half of year get our dividends from our equity accounted for Chinese joint ventures, those around couple of hundred million. And those would be the -- those would sort of be the main factors that drive us to the skewing there. And then your second question in terms of the balance sheet, it\u2019s around 400 basis points to 500 basis points increase, as a result of the financing, the $1.6 billion, the debt that we\u2019ll take on for the ADT acquisition. So, around 29 to 30, I think is the number. Alex Molinaroli : Could I address something before you hang up, just to make sure you get kind of what we look at as it relates to the rest of year on building efficiency. When we start talking about the backlog number, which is flat to last year; that just gives you an indicator of what\u2019s going to happen over the next six months; that usually brings pretty true. Italy Michaeli - Citigroup: Right, absolutely. Great. Thanks for that clarification Alex and the detail, Bruce. Thanks. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Rich Kwas. Sir, you may now proceed. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Good morning everyone. Alex Molinaroli : Hi Rich. Bruce McDonald : Hi Rich. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : On building efficiency, just on the margins here you\u2019ve been able to do pretty good job driving the margin without revenue support. Alex, where are you in terms of the restructuring benefit, as you look at the balance of this year and into \u201815? Can you still drive margin higher without volume looking out 12 months or so, or do you -- when do you start to need to see the volume come through? Alex Molinaroli : Well, we\u2019re certainly going to benefit the rest of the year. And we\u2019ll benefit on a percentage basis even more, because remember the revenues will increase. And we\u2019ve taken, both SG&A and cost of goods sold out. So the margins would probably be at low end of where the margins will end up at the rest -- end of the year because the volumes will pick up. And then over the first couple of quarters and next year, we should continue to see benefit. Because we\u2019re -- particularly in North America, we\u2019re getting close to our target. In fact, in some ways it\u2019s actually more than our targets because of the pressure on the backlog. Bruce McDonald : Yes, and I\u2019d maybe add to that, Rich, the other thing is I would say, I think on the cost side going to 2015 and then towards the backend of \u201815 and \u201816 and we\u2019ll start to see the accretive benefits of the ADT acquisition that\u2019s accretive to the margin. Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s right. And fortunately, I can\u2019t tell you when the Hitachi JV will be completed. We\u2019re working diligently on it, but long-term -- mid-term, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re bullish on the [BE] with the a little bit of help, we could be dangerous. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Okay, all right. And then on GWS with the sales down, the margins up, is that business you are walking away from in terms of just less profitable business or is that just fundamental weakness of the business? Alex Molinaroli : So a little bit of both. I\u2019d say there was a period where we weren\u2019t securing work, I would say it\u2019s probably a 12 month period because we are working on their own cost basis. We\u2019ve changed our cost basis, you can see that it\u2019s reflected in the numbers; you are seeing it come through. In fact we are only seeing part of it come through because we give a bunch of that back to our customers. So you see the profitability in that business improve, imagine that we are giving at least half of more than half back to our customers as we change current contracts. When we look at our pipeline, it\u2019s getting stronger and stronger. Last time we met with GWS folks a couple of weeks ago, the pipeline, they are cautious, but the pipeline looks pretty strong both in the near term and long term. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Okay. And just the last one from me on China with power solutions, do you expect to be profitable in China power solutions by year end, is that still the target and what\u2019s your confidence on that? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, go ahead. Bruce McDonald : Yes. I think I will hang myself on this one for [Brian]. No, it\u2019s -- the issue was if you just were to look at the business that we have today that [profitability] is improving. We are going to see in May we are launching our second plant, so that\u2019s going to start up and then we are going to start work on sites watching things like for our next plant in China. So, I would say the business will flip to profitability but we are going to make some investments that are going to offset that. So what I think and I have said this before, and we probably just need to bring more visibility to it. The way that we look at it because of the lumpiness is our plant economics, what is our plant economics, how does that stack up with the rest of our portfolio. The fact that it\u2019s in China, it means it has a little higher overhead because we don\u2019t have the footprint in place yet. So, we\u2019ll probably bring some more visibility to that, helps people understand where we are. But if we just looked at the profitability, it would be hard for us to add these plants. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo : Okay, thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Ryan Brinkman. Sir you may now proceed. Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe one just on the automotive in China, the revenue growth of your unconsolidated JVs there, it\u2019s really been outpacing the industry for a few quarters and a lot again this quarter. So maybe just comment on the drivers there, is it because your levered to the right auto makers that would seem not quite sufficient to explain that proper or are you expanded into new automakers or what, I mean how much longer can we expect this type of outperformance to start in here? Alex Molinaroli :  So I will start, this is Alex, and then Bruce can clean it up. One of the things that we are fortunate is that we do have the presence across the board but what you see is our transplants are doing better than the locals and our share with the transplants is very, very high, particularly you look at the European transplants. So if you look at our mix of business, our customers are doing well plus we are gaining share. So if both are happening, we certainly have the right customers. Bruce McDonald : And then I absolutely agree with that. Three other factors I\u2019ll point to, one is our components growth. So we touched on metals but we really weren\u2019t there and we\u2019ve made some investments, so we\u2019re growing there. And then secondly would be if you look at the market SUV, penetration is rising and we\u2019re gaining a lot more dollar content there. And the third factor would just be we\u2019re seeing increased interiors content in the vehicle market there as particularly China brands try and compete with the transplants. So we\u2019re up contenting the interiors to compete with the transplant vehicles. Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. And then just last question on GWS, starting to post some better operating results there despite the top-line headwind, kind of how the -- and presumably on restructuring and expenses and sort of how the turnaround to automobile began and maybe sort of where you\u2019re given out for couple of quarters in building efficiency apart from GWS? So does this change at all your thinking relative to sort of hold versus sale decision you face there? Alex Molinaroli : I don\u2019t think it impacts our decision because our decision, we knew we were going to get this business fixed. That was never a question. What we need to make sure is strategically does it fit with our portfolio moving forward. So that\u2019s we\u2019re certainly going to make it more profitable, it\u2019s good for our customers, it\u2019s good for us, but it doesn\u2019t really impact our decision of what we\u2019re going to do with that long-term. And by the way, there is a lot more profitability to come there, they\u2019ve done a great job. Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan: Good to hear. Thanks for the color. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks Ryan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Brian Johnson. Sir you may now proceed. Alex Molinaroli : Brian? Brian Johnson - Barclays: Brian Johnson. I just want to go - hello, hello? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Just want to go back to some of your comments on decline in segment in particularly the mix differences as you know a large competitor of yours reported this morning with commercial, HVAC revenues up single-digits and reported decent demand growth in North America. So when you talk about share is that in the overall market or is that in the segments at the upper end you are competing in and also just as you bring in ADT, is that going to give you more exposure or perhaps more cyclical small and mid commercial where other competitors might have more of the mix currently? Alex Molinaroli :  So let me answer the last part of that question, first, absolutely. So the ADT acquisition has two things, one is the products go across all the segments of the market place, low to high complexity, but it also has a distribution system that\u2019s lower cost and touches those customers, so it gives us both from that standpoint. Now obviously I didn\u2019t get listen to the call, but what I looked at the release both the today\u2019s release and yesterday I saw that when they talk about commercial HVAC revenues would be flat with the quarter and first quarter commercial bookings being low. So I think we're pretty consistent, we're not losing share I just think we have a bad mix. When I looked at some of the numbers that came out, they are comparable for us, so we're not losing share, in fact at our UPG business is growing more actively, but we just don\u2019t have -- it is just not as large as our competitors. Bruce McDonald :  Yes, and maybe just put some the number around that Brian. If you look our EPG business in the quarter, we are up about 12% on a revenue perspective. Brian Johnson - Barclays:  EPG meaning, unitary? Alex Molinaroli :  Yes. Bruce McDonald : Yes. Residential, residential like commercial, which I think is a smaller percentage of our business than our competitors\u2019. Brian Johnson - Barclays:  Right, I mean is it, as you just kind of look two or three years out, would it be fair to say some of the large institutional markets are not growing as fast as you might have thought? And we can all think of fiscal budgets, pressures on academic institutions, healthcare. And that you want to pick it up more in the mid and small commercial? Alex Molinaroli : So, here is how I would look at it. It's certainly going to be last end cycle to come. So, you\u2019ve got residential like commercial and you are seeing it in the numbers are growing quicker. And then within the segment that we are strong, you are seeing the commercial space grow quicker than the institutional. From a long term debt, the institutional market\u2019s right place for us to be. But what you are also seeing is that like the acquisition and investments you are going to be in products and channels to sure up our lower-end. So we're not kept on the high end market, but we're planning to keep our share, because it will come back. So, as you see we're making moves in the lower end in marketplace. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Colin Langan. Sir, you may now proceed. Colin Langan - UBS: Great, thanks for taking my question. Any color on why auto experience is so much stronger than you're expecting the original guidance for 1% to 2% for the year and I think year-to-date you are up 11%. I mean it doesn't seem like some of production forecasts or is that materially better, I mean is this the customer mix factor or there is something, it was the 1% to 2% including the divestiture of Electronics? Bruce McDonald : No, it would be -- the markets are better than we have thought, so that has certainly an element there. And then the mix, we have got a pretty favorable product mix particularly in Europe. So, I mean I don't think going into the year, we envision Europe being up double digit. And it's just we have -- I guess what we\u2019re seeing now is the downside and having a lot of launches over the last two years [compass] in our P&L. But we have a higher percent of our sales of our newer vehicles that are performing well in the marketplace with consumers. Alex Molinaroli : And I also think we probably gave our guidance earlier because of our fiscal start at the 1st of October and I could recall we didn\u2019t expect much at all. We were talking about being at the bottom and hopeful. So, it\u2019s really outperformed what we thought. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. And then any comments on the seating business, you keep focusing on the multi-industry. Is that still a core business or is that something you\u2019d consider selling overtime at the right way? Bruce McDonald : Seating business is core. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. And on power solutions just a quick question. And it seems like a pretty steep decline in Europe on the aftermarket, down 15%. Is that due to tough comp or is that almost sounds like it could be a record low type number; I mean any context on how tough it is in Europe right now? Alex Molinaroli : I probably wasn\u2019t very clear in my remarks, this is Alex. If you look at that business four years ago, you would flip it and you would see the OE business being down 15%, 20%, 25%. Now what we are seeing is the first wave of replacement being down because the vehicles are there. We are also seeing the impact of the AGM mix and that\u2019s something that we expected and then the weather is not helping. So I think that there is a lot of things that hit us at once and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so severe. I\u2019m also having a little concern because Eastern Europe is where we are growing and places like Russia and there is a little uncertainty there today. So, we are not losing share, but we are suffering with the marketplace. And the market will come back, because sales in Middle East came back. So, it will come back overtime, but unfortunately it\u2019s offsetting all of the growth we\u2019re having in other places. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. David Leiker. Sir you may now proceed. Unidentified Analyst :  Hi, good morning. This is Joe [Vruwink] for David. Alex Molinaroli :  Hey Joe. Bruce McDonald : Hi Joe Unidentified Analyst : Just looking at building efficiency EBIT, I am wondering how much the ability to grow with the revenue declines is more belt tightening in a difficult end markets versus actions that actually are going to widen your incremental margins later on, because if I just, if I think of your long-term targets, the goal was there about 50 bps on margin annually, you did more than that this quarter with a revenue decline I would just think that going forward when growth returns the margin gains should be bigger? Alex Molinaroli :  So, I will take this, this is Alex. So, I would talk about B/E in a couple of ways. First off, we have retrenched in Europe and I think that that will continue to be the position that we will, we want some profitability in Europe, but not make a lot of investments. Where we plan to make our investments is Asia specifically China and in North America where we think the market is only going to be stronger, but it\u2019s going to be longer lasting and less cyclical. We are going to expand our footprint with the type of buildings that we approach and the channels that you see in that that\u2019s evidence of that that\u2019s happening today, but we also think that our cost position, which is not just SG&A, but our operational cost will benefit us in the future in gaining share in the markets we already participate in. We\u2019ve taken $100 million of cost out of the channel in North America. And I think we are more efficient and more effective than we were in the past. We\u2019ve really streamlined our service to our customers. So, I am pretty bullish, I just need some market to participate in. Unidentified Analyst : So those efficiencies, cost actions those are things you carry forward as the volumes come back, so it just seem to me like the incremental to be as much better is something higher than kind of the 50 bps to that\u2026 Alex Molinaroli :  I would tell you yes with one caveat. As the market grows, we will be adding to our direct sales force. And that will be a direct P&L hit, that\u2019s not a capital investment. So, when the market comes back we will see the benefit operationally, but we\u2019re committed to grow with the market and we\u2019ll need to add some sales cost, but you\u2019re right overall. Bruce McDonald : Yes. I think for the -- and we\u2019ve talked about this on previous calls. If you think about B/E business we wanted the people business we have to invest ahead of the curve. So once you see our order intake climbing we have to start to make investments. And we have said in the past that time is when we\u2019re in a no investment mode, we\u2019ll have opportunity to grow our margins quicker than 50 basis points. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re kind of seeing right now is (inaudible) adding the investments we\u2019re getting all of the leverage from the cost saving initiatives, but it\u2019s not sustainable. Alex Molinaroli : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then switching over to automotive, there was a lot of talk during the Analyst Day about just being more discipline and going after new business really rationalizing the backlog. But as you see the returns step up in that segment, you certainly start rebidding on things and maybe weren\u2019t meeting your ROIC targets before suddenly they do it and so maybe automotive is a faster grower in the future? Alex Molinaroli : We\u2019re not going to change our discipline I think that\u2019s probably the economist in the past. So we\u2019re going to make sure that we are obtaining work not only with the right margin, but the right customer. So I think when we go after work in more aggressive way, there will be a strategic reason to do it. But certainly we\u2019re going to leverage the footprint we already have and we\u2019re going to make sure we can maximize the investments we\u2019re making in Asia. So, I think that you can see us continue to keep our discipline in place because the good times are always here. Unidentified Analyst : So longer-term the view that seating is basically a no growth but better return as a whole? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. The no growth is what we said, it was based on some market growth projections, which right now we're seeing better than that. So, based on what we projected in the market to be that will be true. If it continues to be stronger that won\u2019t be true, we\u2019ll benefit from the growth. But you will see is if this is a pie chart, you will see our business moving more and more into Asia over the long-term from a percentage standpoint. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Jeff Sprague. Sir you may now proceed. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Thank you good morning gents. Alex Molinaroli :  Hey Jeff. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Alex, I was wondering actually if you could maybe sort of find a point on the overall kind of strategic vision as it relates to multi-industry. And the nature of my question is that in essence you are a multi-industry company, you\u2019ve got improved segments plus or minus a billion dollars of OP. So, does your vision really (inaudible) and at some point you need entirely new wag although that meaning that the return profile in these businesses just needs to be much higher to really put you in a different lead relative to kind of pure type company? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. Here is how I would answer that. I think we need to rebalance our portfolio whether that requires another wag or not. Today, just like if you look at ADT acquisition, we're staying near adjacent where we feel comfortable, overtime that may change. As it relates to our automotive business, we can only get so much margin on our business, it has a theoretical cap and we want to get the most that we can. And we're not sure what the cyclicality of that business, if we\u2019re over weighted in the auto that we\u2019ll look get the benefit of being the multi-industrial. So, that\u2019s kind of the perspective that I have and continue to see investments outside of automotive and thus making sure that we\u2019re rational in what we do in automotive. And in particular, we have a great position in China and we\u2019d be silly not to take advantage of that. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Do you have a view of how much auto is just right not too much that you\u2019re not penalized for auto? Alex Molinaroli : No, I guess you guys are going to tell us that. But what I would tell you is we feel mostly the margins go up, because China will grow and we will limit our investment to other places. So, I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but I do think we have some, I know it\u2019s less than what we have today. That\u2019s what I know for sure. And as I\u2019ve told everyone and I answer the question earlier little flip it, seating is not on the table, but what is more important long-term, I\u2019m committed to be a leading multi-industrial. But today seating is not on the table, but we have clear plan to do in order to meet our objectives. Bruce McDonald : Yes, it\u2019s important to think about the investments that we\u2019re making in Hitachi and ADT and the ones that sort of making clear in electronics, I mean that\u2019s quite a major shift and it\u2019s just lifted our revenue profile. Alex Molinaroli : So far what I would tell you, we\u2019re doing pretty much what we said and in some ways, I think we\u2019re ahead of schedule. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. Thank you for that additional color. Just a quick little clean up, the repatriation tax is non-cash, is that the whole idea of the repatriation taxes, what that were in fact cash, that\u2019s why people don\u2019t repatriate cash often? Bruce McDonald : Yes, and I can help with that one. You are absolutely right, there is a cash tax payable on repatriation of [foreign] earnings. We have foreign tax credits that we can use to offset that tax, so we have the book charge and we have foreign tax credit that are on deferred tax assets that offset the cash tax payment. It\u2019s a book charge but not a cash charge. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. And then just finally on the balance sheet, obviously you need to finance ADT, but as you noted Bruce you also are kind of under short end of the curve, should we expect any kind of financing headwinds term out some of the CP from a near term either separately or as part of the ADT transaction? Bruce McDonald : Well, the ADT call we talked about we were going to sort of go out there along, so we are looking at, I think at the call I talked about assuming it\u2019s going to be a blended 4%. So as that stands right now, obviously subject to market conditions, we would think about now the substantial portion of financing being 10 and 30 (inaudible). Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners : Okay, great. Thank you very much guys. Alex Molinaroli : We have time for one more call. Operator : All right. Our next question is going to be from the line of Mr. Ted Wheeler. Sir, you may now proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, good morning all. Alex Molinaroli : Hi Ted. Unidentified Analyst : You gave us a little detail on building efficiency North America. I wondered if you could give us some more detail on the other segments in the BE for the quarter. Bruce McDonald : As far as regions? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, well I guess it\u2019s regions right, you got North America, you got this Asia other and GWS if I look, the units that you put in the filings? Bruce McDonald : Are you interested in sort of orders\u2026? Unidentified Analyst : I\u2019d love anything you can share but I just\u2026 Bruce McDonald :  Okay. Unidentified Analyst :  Revenues and margins if you could. Bruce McDonald : We will have those in the in our filings; I don\u2019t -- again we don\u2019t have those with us, we kind of just talk about the business. But I mean I can go through the geographically if you look at our orders, when you out exchange it is down about 1%. So on that basis what you would see, the Europe was actually up a bit 2%, Asian orders were flat in the quarter, North America is down, Alex commented on the fact that service orders are up and equipment and controls were down, then where we are really seeing pulled out from an order perspective is Middle East and Latin America which tend to be lumpy in terms of large jobs and those were down by 27% and 29% respectively. Alex Molinaroli :  The way I\u2019d look at those two is, when we say we are up 30% in the Middle East, I won\u2019t get excited about it and we say we are down 30% in the Middle East I won\u2019t get excited about that because these projects, one project could be almost the size of the entire backlog; these are very large and very lumpy. Bruce McDonald : And maybe just to help you out a little bit on the margins, some margin, sub margins (inaudible) North America and Asia, we did see good margin. I don\u2019t have the numbers at the top of my head. On slide that Alex went through on building efficiency, you see that we did reference the fact that we continue to have some contract charges in the Middle East it\u2019s what we have had some in the previous quarter that will pull down the profitability of that segment, now we have headwinds in the quarter of a $0.02 this year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And I guess Global Workplace Solutions, I think you gave us a number, I guess we had last years and would you say the profits, could you refresh me? And you said, I think you\u2019ve said Global Workplace Solutions profit is good. Alex Molinaroli : We said the profits were up 24%. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. I\u2019ve got the other. Alex Molinaroli : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for the color. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Bruce McDonald : Okay. All right thanks Ted. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. So, I want to just wrap up. I appreciate everyone\u2019s great questions. And I wanted to once again thank our employees. There is a lot of opportunity for distractions in our business, a lot of the change going on but our employees\u2019 number one focus on execution and I think you see that in results. So we\u2019re going to continue to execute; we\u2019re going to continue to meet our commitments and that includes changing our portfolio and meeting our strategic objectives. So, I appreciate all the calls and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Glen Ponczak : Okay. Thanks Alex, thanks Bruce. And thanks to all on the call for your interest. If you got any further questions, feel free to email or call me at 414-524-2375. Enjoy the rest of your day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

Alex? Alex Molinaroli - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, good morning everyone. Welcome to our call and I\u2019d first want to start and thank our employees of strong quarter and not only a strong quarter, but with some of the conditions, particularly in our buildings business what we are able to accomplish and then all the distractions we have internally with all the changes, I am very proud of our organization. Let\u2019s start and talk about the environment. What we see in the automotive business is the market remains strong. I am really pleased to see that Europe continues to incrementally get better and we are seeing some benefits from that. Bruce will go over the actual numbers, but overall very happy with how the markets improving. We talk about demand for the battery business. We are obviously seeing the high OE demand following the \u2013 and we are gaining share. So, we are following the strength in the market. And our aftermarket demand is finally picking up in North America, Indonesia, specifically China and outside of Asia. And in Europe, we are still having demand problems, but I think that what we have seen is that the inventory levels with our distributors is starting to decline. So, hopefully, we are getting through the worst of that. We will talk about later, but we have also had some pretty good wins in our battery business. In the commercial buildings segment, where we have been struggling or the market has been struggling on our own pipelines, but our improvements in our pipelines that we are seeing forward-looking mirror the marketplace. The biggest challenge that we have is within the federal government business, because of the marketplace. And then in China, the market remains strong. It\u2019s not the same as it was a few years ago. It remains strong in each one of our markets. I will talk about the buildings market specifically. As you know, our institutional customers, local government, state, federal, healthcare, higher education, those customers is a large part of our business in North America. It\u2019s always been our sweet spot. And just to give everyone a flavor for what our team has been dealing with over the last two years, you can see the construction starts are down significantly since when we peaked in 2008. And if you look at this decline that we saw in our secured business, this is really attributable to mostly federal government and in particular we called it out last year, we had a very large contract last year in the third quarter. It was a $70 million VA Hospital job. The other thing that I would point out is in the quarter last year we were beneficiary of two very large airports, infrastructure airports in Brazil and also some stadium work. So what we saw last year was a little bit abnormal, what we see this year if you look under the numbers I feel better than what the numbers look like. But right now we just need to make sure we see it on a consistent basis. We tried to break our numbers out a little bit more from equipment standpoint because as you know we are in the contracting business, so we wanted to show what we are doing within our equipment business as you look at the applied equipment. We are 9% up in a flat market, so we are gaining share. In our light commercial we are almost up 11%. We are pretty much moving with the marketplace. And in ADT acquisition just for everyone\u2019s note it is exposed across the market, but it gives a lot more exposure to the commercial market and the light commercial market. So we should see improvements going forward. And then in the residential business we are flat with the market year-to-date. Our quarter was actually down and I think there are a couple reasons. One is last year we saw an incredible increase because of some of the Sandy work. We were very stronger in Northeast is going through a change in distribution in Texas and Florida. And any other thing that happened is April 1 we put a price increase in place. And our margins for the quarter are up 3.5% in that business. So we will move on \u2013 let\u2019s talk about the overall business. With the revenues being up 3% over last year and the segment income up 15% we see the benefit in the EPS of our buyback with $0.84 per share. I am pretty pleased that I have talked earlier about where our results are particularly when you look on the right size of this page and you see that we have awful lot of work that\u2019s being done on our portfolio. We closed the ADT transaction. We closed the Electronics transaction here a couple of weeks ago. We announced and started working on the joint venture with Yanfeng for interiors. And so with all this going on, our team is still able to perform. So we are pretty proud of what they have accomplished. If you go to the marketplace specifically, let\u2019s talk about some of that. On Page 6 we have \u2013 we have been awarded $3 billion in new metals programs. And I think if we were talking 3 to 6 months ago, we weren\u2019t talking about growing that business, we were talking about how we are fixing that business. But $3 billion and that business is a significant amount of business over the period and a lot of that is in the China, which is consistent with our strategy. We also \u2013 we are able to get a Comcast order, a new order with BMW. And you can see its annual revenues are $325 million, it\u2019s also in China. And the feedback we are getting from our customers around the interiors JV has been extremely strong. Our customers see the value in what we are doing and they are anxious for us to get this completed. In building efficiency, let\u2019s first talk about GWS. We are seeing improvements at the bottom line of GWS. They had a very, very strong quarter from an earnings perspective. And they will also begin to win work. So we have some great projects in the pipeline, but we can talk about Standard Chartered Bank, 22 countries. And it\u2019s the largest contract we ever had in Asia. So we are pretty happy with that. What it shows is we cannot only get that business fixed, but getting our cost structure right and our team is not distracted and our customers are confident and our services we are being able to grow that business again. And in our UPG business, we have announced a new product called Prestige. And the reason why that\u2019s important to us, this product is a drop-in replacement of not only for our units but for our competitors\u2019 units. And that allows us to give access to share of the replacement market that we haven\u2019t had in the past because our market share traditionally hasn\u2019t been as strong. So we are pretty happy that that gives us an opportunity to expand the marketplace for our salespeople and our dealers. And in power solutions lots of good news there, our OE business in China is expanding both traditionally and in our AGM business. I think we have made a couple of announcements on that. We are starting production in 2016. So we are localizing our production. And in the United States, Europe and Japan, specifically in the United States we have captured two very large retail customers where we are now sole source. And with the wins we have in both Japan and Europe, it\u2019s about 3 million units, and 3 million units is a significant amount of wins for the power solutions business. So I am very happy with what we\u2019ve accomplished. With that I will turn it over to Bruce and he will go through each one of the segments. Bruce McDonald - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Thanks Alex. Good morning everyone. So starting off with power solutions here on Slide 7, you can see for the quarter our sales were up about 6%, lead prices were actually lower year-over-year and if you were to adjust that put them on a constant basis, our revenues were up about 8%. In terms of units, you can see the geographic mix. Overall, we are up 5% with North America and Asia up more than that and Europe down, really reflecting some destocking of the channels. OE was up 31%, aftermarket and Europe was down about 5%. So we did see our European volumes towards the end of the quarter start to show some year-over-year improvement. So we are hopeful that the destocking is sort of behind us here. In terms of the aftermarket \u2013 AGM volumes you can see they are up about 17% to just below 2 million units here in the quarter. In terms of segment income we have a big improvement of 43% versus last year, up to $193 million. We are seeing the benefits of not only higher volumes, a richer product mix associated with the AGM units and continued strong operational performance impacted our segment income here. In terms of building efficiency, we were able to improve our margins by about 10 basis points despite the fact our revenues were down about 4% here in the quarter. At 3 point \u2013 if you were to sort of adjust for divestitures and you recall, we divested a year ago our commercial refrigeration business in Europe, if you adjust for that BE sales were down about 1%, GWS sales were down about 4%, so that\u2019s how that would shake out. Looking at that geographically for building efficiency North America was down 4%, Europe was down to 9%. Again if we adjust the European number for the divestiture it was actually up 6%. And in the Middle East and Latin America we saw double-digit declines. If you look at our backlog you can see adjusted for FX and divestitures it was down 6% where we really saw softness here was in Latin America and that\u2019s really the rolling off of some of these larger infrastructure jobs that Alex referred to, that was down 37%. Asia and North America were down 5% and 3% respectively. And we saw slightly higher demand in Europe in the Middle East. In terms of orders, we touched on \u2013 we talked about our orders being down about 8%. Alex referred to both the VA Hospital job and some of infrastructure projects in the Middle East if you were to adjust for those items, what you would see is our underlying orders were down about 3%. Around the same levels, they were last year. Geographically, if you look at our order activity, down 7% in Europe and 9% in North America, again the VA Hospital contributing to that, Asia down 10%, Middle East and Latin America down 1% and 38% respectively. I would note that if you looked at in our service orders, we did see an increase of 8% in our service order in the quarter, so that sort of bodes well for seeing some signs of improvement in some of our project work. In terms of segment income at $306 million, we are down 3%. And as I said before our segment margins were up 10 basis points. To look at the margins in BE about 10.3%, that was down 40 basis points versus last year, primarily because of the lower volumes. And we did have transaction-related costs within the segment income number here associated with the work that we are doing with Hitachi primarily. And in GWS, you can see a significant increase in our profitability here up 46% where we started to see the benefits of some of the business model changes that the team are making there and also with the benefits of some cost restructuring. In terms of our automotive experience on Slide 9, as we mentioned in our press release last quarter, our automotive electronics business we have reclassified as a discontinued operation. So, our numbers here just like in Q2, exclude electronics. The other thing I would note before I talk about the numbers here as we did complete the divestiture of our loss-making headliner and sun visor business in the quarter and this was previously part of our automotive interior segment. If you look at the sales, you will see, we are up about 7%. Both seating and interiors were up about the same. If you look at the markets, you can see North America here up 4%, Europe up 1% and China up 11%. And again on a revenue basis, we are able to exceed the market production levels in all three of the main regions. In terms of China, which we \u2013 as everyone knows we largely compete through non-consolidated joint ventures. Our revenues in the quarter were up about 28% to about $1.8 billion. In terms of profitability, our segment income here was $295 million, up 22% versus last year. Here we are seeing the benefit from operational improvements, primarily in metals and in our European businesses, both in seating and in interiors, the benefits of cost reduction initiatives and also the higher volumes. In terms of profitability, our margins in seating were up 20 basis points to 5.6%, some big improvement in interiors, where our profitability was up 240 basis points to 3.5% in the quarter. I guess, overall sort of takeaway in automotive is we are delivering on the incremental revenue and our restructuring and cost improvement actions are tracking in line with sort of aggressive expectations that we set at the beginning of the year. In terms of the financials and maybe just before I get into the numbers, we are adjusting it for a number of one-time items, primarily $162 million restructuring charge, which is largely around the retained business operations as part of the interiors joint venture that we talked about in May. And $140 million from the loss on some of the businesses that I talked about that we divested and then other transaction-related cost associated with the acquisition on ADTI, which closed in June 16 this quarter. So, I am going to exclude those items as I talk through the columns here on the left side of the page. So, in terms of revenue at $10.8 billion, we are up about 3%. Foreign exchange was a slight headwind for us \u2013 a tailwind, I am sorry, for us in the quarter accounted for about 1% of the 3% increase here. In terms of our gross profit, you will see we improved by 50 basis points to 15.4% versus last year. Here we are really getting the benefit again of mainly the automotive improved operational performance. SG&A remained well-controlled, is up 2% or slightly less than sales. So, we are seeing it tick down as a percent of the sales by about 10 basis points. And you see a big improvement in terms of equity income and that\u2019s really been driven by the improved profitability of our automotive joint ventures, again primarily in China. So, from a segment income point of view, we are pleased with the margins here at 7.3% were up 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Turning to Slide 11, I\u2019d maybe just comment on the net financing charges. You can see we are sort of comparable to year ago levels at $67 million. You see that at the bottom of the slide, we did issue $1.7 billion of long-dated debt associated with the ADT acquisition. That included most of the debt was 10-year, 30-year and 50-year paper. And so when we sort of rolled at it from a modeling perspective on a go forward basis, our financing costs are going to be in the $75 million to $80 million per quarter. In terms of our tax rate, it was 19.8%, a slight decrease from our guidance and that\u2019s really because with repositioning electronics as discontinued operations, it has a obscure impact on our underlying rate, because electronics the tax, a slightly higher rate. And that compares to 17.2% rate in the third quarter of last year. So, overall, our earnings from continuing operations, excluding items you can see here at $0.84 was a 17% year-over-year improvement. And then just lastly in terms of the balance sheet and our guidance, we are pleased with our cash generation in the quarter. We generated cash of just over $700 million from operating activities. Our net debt at the end of the quarter was $7.3 billion. And I sort of just put a bridge in here, you can see the $1.7 billion we added to finance the ADT acquisition and $400 million net debt reduction in the quarter from operations. That\u2019s how we get to the $7.3 million at the end of the quarter. Working capital as a percentage of sales or trade working capital, which is payables receivable and inventory at 7.4% was up about 10 basis points. Here the slightly dilutive impact of the ADT acquisition which is generally higher levels of working capital, we are going to work on that and we expect to offset that headwind as we go forward here. When you look at the balance sheet that we attached to the press release, just a few comments on ADT, what you will sort of see overall is an uptick in goodwill and intangible about $1.6 billion. And then the working capital and fixed assets associated to that business about $300 million. And then lastly in terms of our guidance for the fourth quarter here, we are looking at a guidance of about $1 to $1.02 per share, which will be a record for us. If you look at that guidance in context of what we said last quarter, we are coming in at sort of the high end of our previous guidance. And just as I have noted on here, we are going to start to encourage some transaction related costs associated with the integration of ADT and the formation of our joint venture with interiors, and we are excluding those from the guidance that we are providing here for the fourth quarter. And we will provide some more color with that on our Q4 call. So with that I will turn it back over to you Glen. Glen Ponczak - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks Bruce. Angela I think we are ready to take questions. And while compiling a queue here, just to remind you to get people \u2013 more people a chance to ask the question here. Please limit yourself to a question and a follow-up. If you got more, you can get back in line again if you can get through a few of the folks who want to talk to us this morning. Angela we are ready. Operator : Okay. Our first question is from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Hi, everybody. Alex Molinaroli : Hi Rod. Glen Ponczak : Hi Roc. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank :  A couple of things, but first of all could you talk about the 20 basis point margin improvement in seating, it looks like you had good organic growth and typically incremental margins are in the teens and you had an equity income increase, so was there an offset to that that limited the margin improvement to this level\u201d Bruce McDonald : This is Bruce here, hi Rod. I don\u2019t really think so, I think when I look at some of our commercial settlements, I know we reached an agreement with one of our customers and we had to make a year-to-date true up and we had some supplier retro-settlement. So I would say probably on the commercial side if I was looking at year-over-year, is probably unfavorable muted the margin improvement. So I would view that as timing within the year not structural by the way. Alex Molinaroli :  Rod just - this is Alex, if you look underlying numbers, metals continue to improve and Europe continues to improve. So, I can\u2019t point to what you are asking, it\u2019s a good question, but the underlying operating margins are improving. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And at the beginning of the year actually late last year you were talking about more modest growth for seating going forward 1% to 2% flattish through 2018, do you have any updated thoughts on just given some of the wins, how we should be thinking about that business. And similarly for the building efficiency businesses given where your order rates have been falling, do you have any kind of early view on how we should be thinking going forward as you look out to next year? Alex Molinaroli : I think we are probably, we see the same thing you are seeing. I am not ready to give those numbers, it\u2019s a little complex. And I mentioned it in the building efficiency conversation. We are seeing pipelines that are improving, but I would like to be able to see that a little bit more so maybe next time, we get on the call we will be able to talk about that. We just have been burned a few times, so I just want to make sure we don\u2019t kick that can again. But we are seeing underlying orders improved. And then obviously that market is a little different than automotive than what we expect and we had lower expectations for Europe. Bruce McDonald : Yes. Rod, I would say on the auto side, we have been, if you sort of look at this year, we have been pleased with our mix. So, if you look at the vehicles that were on, they have done well on the market generally speaking, the customers that we have high exposure to have done well, particularly in Europe on the premium side. If you \u2013 Alex talked about the metals wins, I think we probably have quite a bit of the different view I would say in terms of the growth of our metals business versus a year ago. So I think we have been very successful capturing some components business here on the metals side. And that\u2019s enabled us the sort of pull-through seating business wins that we hadn\u2019t expected that China BMW is a good example. We really won that business from a competitor, because of our metals capability in the region. So, it\u2019s probably not going to affect \u201815 or maybe even \u201816, but I think going a little bit further out, I would say, we feel more positive about the components growth in that business being more than the market. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead. Your line is open. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Hi, good morning everyone. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Rich. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Alex, just a bigger picture question with the residential performance here and given your position in the market and now with the acquisition of ADT, how do you see yourself playing out on the resi light commercial side longer term. Can you grow this business organically apart from the cycle or are there things you have to add potentially to make it a more robust position? Alex Molinaroli : It\u2019s a good question, Rich. I don\u2019t see how we can make significant changes in market share. I think our cost position actually is pretty good. And I think our product is doing well. We have seen our fixed cost dramatically lower, but we have a business that has been under shared for a long, long time. So, when you look at the replacement market, your disadvantage around channels and some of the actual footprint replacements. So, I think we are going to have to do something little more structural. I mean, that\u2019s the best I could do for answering your question. We will continue to make incremental improvements, but we need to give them some structural help. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And then just on Hitachi, could you just provide us an update on potential timing for that, I know you continue to work on that with the negotiation? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. So, our teams are working hard together. They are now getting to the point where we are having real conversations about the numbers that we said that we couldn\u2019t see we now can see. And so, we are vigorously working together to see if we can make this happen as soon as possible. So, I guess the good news is we are getting close. We are really talking about making this happen sooner versus later, but I still don\u2019t think as we are going to see this until maybe first quarter \u2013 our first quarter and probably the end of that. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, alright. Alex Molinaroli : From a signed definitive agreement. Bruce McDonald : Definitive agreement, yes. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. Bruce McDonald : Well, probably like financially speaking, it\u2019s probably back half of 2015 type transaction. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. In terms of actually closing? Bruce McDonald : Yes. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Yes, okay. And then just quick one, Bruce on buybacks, so you move through the balance of the year, you are going to generate lot of cash here in the fiscal fourth quarter, you still have the authorization, plenty left under that, what\u2019s the level of commitment at this point? Bruce McDonald : Well, we \u2013 what we talked about was doing $3.6 billion over three years and we have done \u2013 we frontloaded that this year. And so I think we are committed to doing what we said we are going to do. We are not looking at bringing it slower if that\u2019s your question and we are not thinking about deferring it. But I think what you are going to see is as we get in, we are going to \u2013 we are not probably going to do what we did this year, which is buy $1.2 billion in Q1. I think we are going to get into more of a normal pattern and acquire stocks throughout the year. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. Bruce McDonald : The action here that we did in 2014 was really because of such a big change in strategy. We decided to put our money where our mouth was and announced the buyback at do it at the same time. Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities : Great, understood. Okay. Thank so much. I will pass it on. Alex Molinaroli : Take care. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Barry (Susquehanna Financial Group). Go ahead, your line is open. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group : Hi guys, good morning. Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group : So I just wanted to clarify what the bottom line message is here on BE, is that you are starting to see some early signs of a potential inflection point? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. So this is Alex, what I would \u2013 here is what I would talk about. We do a very good job of tracking our pipeline with our direct sales force. We have done this for over a decade, probably decades. And so what we are able to do we track our pipelines based on the previous year just like we would do anything else. And our models because we have been doing it so long are fairly accurate. And what we have been seeing is and that\u2019s how we talk about our forecast we have been seeing is it just continue to be trending down and trending down. What we are seeing for the first time is a couple of months of some larger projects in some of the institutional markets. The reason I am hedging my bets is after we have had this long downturn I don\u2019t want to say the market is back, I am just saying that we are starting to see some good news which I haven\u2019t see in the past. So I know that that sounds a little bit of weasel, but I think at this point we kind of earned because the market has been pushed along. So it\u2019s good news, that\u2019s all I can say, I just don\u2019t know \u2013 I can\u2019t for sure if it\u2019s a trend, but we are watching it closely. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group : I mean during the quarter did the orders improve or was it bumpy? Alex Molinaroli : No, the orders didn\u2019t improve what we are seeing \u2013 so that would track more like the architectural index because what we are talking about tracking projects as they become developed. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group : Yes. Over the question of when they convert into orders is very uncertain. Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s right. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group : Yes. Alex Molinaroli : I think maybe one thing that we had in our slides just to be pointed out is with the ADT acquisition we have doubled our exposure on the light commercial side. May and if you were to talk about the light commercial excluding residential we have probably quadrupled it. And so that part of the market is showing the most signs of life. And so we have gone from having say $300 million or $250 million exposure there to now versus here at about $1.3 billion of exposure there. So I think if \u2013 I am hopeful that as we get in the fourth quarter that we see having more exposure to that sort of the market, that sort of gives us some tailwind. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group : Could I just on clarify on that comment about the applied HVAC being up 9, is that North America and how do you define that market that you are calling flat, is that only in the verticals where you have exposure or is that..? Bruce McDonald : No that would be as reported through AHRI and that is North America. I think it does include Canada. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: Yes, good morning. Just following up on the same theme when you look at those kind of maybe the pipeline, is there any signs \u2013 is there signs of improvement at all in that institutional business which you do show in the chart on the upper right of Page 4 potentially growing in terms of construction forecast. Alex Molinaroli : I am sorry go ahead. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: Yes. My question was within you have improved what you are seeing in the pipeline for maybe the improvement, is that coming out of the North American institutional business, which you do show up ticking in 2015 but also showed an uptick in 2014 in the construction forecast and that doesn\u2019t seem to be flowing through to your business? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, it is, not all of the vertical. So, it\u2019s in some more than others like healthcare still seems to be stretched up. But some of the government business seems to be improving state and local government, federal government we are seeing those pipelines improved significantly. And that \u2013 and we are also \u2013 what that also means is if there are larger projects. If you dig underneath the numbers we cut things between below $750,000 projects and above $750,000, where we have actually gained business although we have grown is in under $750,000 things that we are creating ourselves. What hasn\u2019t been on board are these large, large projects. And so what we are seeing is some of the large projects come back. And that\u2019s what really drives the backlog and sometimes the lumpiness of the backlog. And that\u2019s the good news that we are seeing because the large projects have been gone for quite sometime. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: And sort of a follow-on I guess two things around ADTI, one, how quickly can you ramp up HVAC equipment sales through that channels and two, you mentioned something around excluding some 4Q integration costs, I think are those operational costs or are those sort of more banker fees or maybe consultant fees or something that truly kind of is one-time? Alex Molinaroli : Well, we have program costs. We will have some restructuring. We will have costs that are related to the integration. So we are getting at it pretty fast. As it relates to what products, how quick we are getting the products to go through, I think we will have more information on that but where we are starting is the products that we can essentially swap out or easily move through the channels. They will obviously have the other products that we will have to do some development or tailoring for the channels, going both ways. So I think we will start seeing it fairly quick. But obviously, it\u2019s going to have to ramp. We have to get our customers and our distribution chain to be able to sell these products. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: The improvement we are seeing now is more just the existing ADTI portfolio, just getting deeper? Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s right. Yes, right. Participating in the markets that we haven\u2019t participated before. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: Okay. And just when could you get significant HVAC sales through there by year out or year and a half out? Alex Molinaroli : We will although start seeing some synergies next year, I am sorry I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me, but they are on the workflow, they are going to see some growth during the fiscal year, next year. But quite frankly the biggest advance, the biggest integration savings we will have next year will be more on the operational and cost side because that is easier to get after. Bruce McDonald : Yes. I think Brian the quickest things that we are going to see from a revenue side will be they make things that we buy. So switching our buy on things like filters, grilles and registers and things like that to ADT that\u2019s going to happen pretty quick and those things are on new work are being sort of specified right away. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: And vice versa? Alex Molinaroli : Vice versa they already \u2013 basically controls that they already buy that they put on the units. Bruce McDonald : The channel things like us selling some of our \u2013 their products through our branch or vice versa. It takes a little bit of time as we \u2013 there are some branding issues and there are some training of our sales both sales people. And so that\u2019s underway and I would think we would start to see that towards \u2013 it\u2019s not like years, it\u2019s few quarters out. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: Okay. Thanks. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Wood - Macquarie: Alright. Thank you. You talked that ADT increasing your exposure to the lighter commercial, can you talk about what the impact of the Hitachi JV would have in terms of the tonnage and the vertical exposure and would your future M&A strategy in building efficiency be kind of geared at continuing this switch to keep a more broader exposure there or would you look to take advantage of the more weaker larger institutional verticals? Alex Molinaroli : Well, so I will answer, this is Alex. First, I think that our opportunity to grow is not in the institutional markets, not because of the market because we have such a strong share and so what we are doing is we are writing the market right now. But our share in the institutional market is significant in North America. And so what we need to do is broaden our channels and broaden our product line. ADTI gives us both products and channel, Hitachi gives us products. And I would say it\u2019s sort of a mid-market light commercial access, it\u2019s not really residential and that becomes a story unto itself. I answered the question earlier that we still would have to do something different in order to grow in the residential significantly. But all the stuff that we are doing is expanding our reach within the marketplace. Mike Wood - Macquarie: Understood and on the ADT acquisition where you are saying you are now buying things from them, had you been buying from them previously or will you need to spend some money to increase their production capacity to handle your new demand? Alex Molinaroli : They have capacity, they have open capacity. And we do buy from them mostly dampers, but we do buy some other things, but there is lots of opportunity for us purchase more. Mike Wood - Macquarie: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your line is open. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs : Thank you and good morning gentlemen. Heading back over to building efficiency, you have noted improving pipeline. Can you speak to the cadence of quoting activity? Has the order to backlog to revenue timing continued to extend or be pushed out or have you seen a contraction since earlier quarters in the year? Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s a great question. I think that we are so early in the pipeline moving up. I don\u2019t know that I can answer that. But when we see things happen in the pipeline, it\u2019s a forward look around six months, that\u2019s what we track. I mean, we track other things, but that\u2019s the framework. So, a year ago, we would have tracked a six months forward pipeline. Today, we are tracking a six month forward pipeline. And then they factor that based off of what the probabilities are of us winning and the project going ahead. So, I think that, that\u2019s sort of taken care of, what\u2019s not taken care of is how fast it will revenue. What\u2019s taken care of is through our pipeline is it really measures year-on-year the same timeframe for when we can secure the project. So, from a quote to secure I feel good about the numbers. From a revenue standpoint, I can\u2019t really speak to that yet. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs : Understood. But if I am correct, you have noted in the past that, that\u2019s been extended, right? It\u2019s moved from kind of one quarter in order to one quarter in backlog to one quarter being revenue and it\u2019s been pushed out a little bit in some or a little bit more? Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s right. Yes, that\u2019s because of our focus on large, large projects. And so what\u2019s happened as our \u2013 the bad news is we have had less large projects, because they haven\u2019t been out there. The good news is that our churn rate around our revenues is actually go up right now. So, when we secure something smaller, we can see that revenue quicker and that\u2019s one reason why you see our revenues not as bad as our sales secured, because we are flowing quicker, because we don\u2019t have the large projects. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs : Understood. And then just on the battery business, can you speak to the cadence of growth in the Stop-Start AGM battery technology and the adoption trend? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs : I see for the year, volumes have seen decelerating year-over-year growth from Q1 to 3Q now with 26%, 24% and 17%. Do you kind of anticipate that to continue or is there an inflection point in the near term? Bruce McDonald : I\u2019ll give you a little bit color. I am glad you asked the question underneath the numbers. So, that 17% was for the quarter, 22% for the year. You are right this quarter seems to be a deceleration. What\u2019s really great to look at the numbers you look underneath the numbers, we had almost a \u2013 if I can do the math there, almost a 15-fold increase in the only purchase of these batteries in North America. And so we are finally starting to see and I think if you look at just watch the television or watch what\u2019s being announced. Start-Stop is becoming standard on a lot of products, both Chrysler and their Jeep, the Focus, the Malibu. You go across our portfolio our customers here are starting to use the product and so we are seeing that. So, even though we are getting more moderate growth now in Europe, because it\u2019s become more standard, where we are really seeing the growth is from a small base is in North America. So, I think we are going to see the rate continue, it will be less dependent on Europe and more dependent on North America and China. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs : Understood. Bruce McDonald : It\u2019s good news, because we have been waiting for that to happen. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs : Okay. So basically a shift in region there for growth going forward? Bruce McDonald : That\u2019s right. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs : Alright. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question is from David Leiker with Baird. Go ahead. Your line is open. David Leiker - Baird: Good morning, everybody. Alex Molinaroli : Hi. David Leiker - Baird: On ADT, I didn\u2019t think there are any questions left here, but as ADT ends up going into the backlog, what kind of impact does that have? What share of that backlog comes out of ADT and what\u2019s the timeline of when it goes into backlog and hits revenue? Bruce McDonald : That\u2019s a good question, David. It has \u2013 we do have orders in ADT, but it\u2019s very short cycle. And so there is \u2013 we are still sort of deep diving this, but right now, our expectation is there will not be an awful lot of backlog if any. Alex Molinaroli : Yes, probably closer to zero. It looks more like our equipments business. We are not, except where we add product to our branch channel, where we wrap our installation around it, that\u2019s usually where we have a backlog. Like I talked about earlier, equipment orders are up 9% and it really doesn\u2019t show up on our backlog. That\u2019s ordered from the factory and this will be very similar since it\u2019s going through reps. Bruce McDonald : But we don\u2019t have any \u2013 like in our quarter end number, we have no backlog included for ADT. David Leiker - Baird: Okay, great. And then the other question here is if you look on the power side, you had mentioned some comments about inventory, but as we came through the winter selling season, where do you think we stand from an inventory perspective as you go into stocking here from the fall? Alex Molinaroli : I think if you look at our inventory, I would say we are bloated, we have some inventory, but that\u2019s more of a management issue and operational issue. I think the channels when I talked about what was happening in Europe, I think the channels are not extended. I think we are in pretty good shape from a channel standpoint. So assuming that, with whatever normal is I think we are going to be fine. It\u2019s pretty hard for me to figure out normal anymore, but whatever normal is, they are not overstocked. I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual about the inventories in the channel. Bruce McDonald : Yes. My comments are around the European aftermarket inventory channel has come down. Alex Molinaroli : Yes, yes. David Leiker - Baird: Is there a way to look at the last selling season North America and Europe, what the battery demand ended up being over the course of the season? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. I don\u2019t have those numbers. Yes, we can get those. That\u2019s something that we have readily available. David Leiker - Baird: Okay, great. Thank you much. Alex Molinaroli : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Jeff. Bruce McDonald : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : I just wanted to come back also to BE and on the light commercial up 11%, is that also strictly a North America comment? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. The numbers that we have that are most robust will be North America. And for us, we are heavily weighted in North America than we are certainly in Europe, so that\u2019s a North American number. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Yes. So, Alex, I understand your reservation on calling a turn given how tough it\u2019s been, but you just posted a quarter with applied up 9% and light commercial up 11%. I mean, that actually sounds pretty decent. I mean, was there something unusual in that sales pace in the quarter, timing or something? Alex Molinaroli : No. No, I think that if you remember the last call I was a little bit frustrated, because I think you guys were frustrating, because we haven\u2019t been able to or haven\u2019t either been able or haven\u2019t really showed the numbers underneath. Our equipment share has been growing and growing. So, this is not unusual. We are gaining share in the equipment business. We are adding new products in our light commercial and we have been gaining share in the heavy equipment business, but unfortunately, that\u2019s not the large part of the market. So, the largest part of the market is what we are trying to participate in the commercial. So, our branches and our direct selling force is doing great. Our products are doing well. That\u2019s not so unusual. Maybe next time we can talk about what our share improvement has been in that part of the market. That\u2019s what leaves us to say we just can\u2019t screw down much further. We need to keep working on the other channels in the lighter products. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Right. But then on a headline basis, North America is down 4%, so you have got weakness in what energy, energy retrofit and the\u2026 Alex Molinaroli : Yes, right. You have our performance contracting orders which as you know are very lumpy. They are a little bit soft and then we have that large construction project, very large $70 million that\u2019s VA Hospital, we call that out last year. And so those words become very lumpy. So, what you are seeing is the equipment orders are fine, but when we wrap it with our construction services that are building services, that\u2019s where it\u2019s been softer, where we do integrated systems for customers on performance contracts, those kind of things. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Yes. And your performance contract would be more tied to institutional and governmental also? Alex Molinaroli : Exactly, exactly. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : And then just shifting gears quickly, so it sounds like GWS is kind of getting a new lease on life. I am just any comment there and maybe more specifically, what if anything has the business done different with the standard chartered contract has, I would guess, secured better forward margins on that project? Alex Molinaroli : Well, what we have done is and that what the team has done is we have been able to substantially lower their cost structure. And now we can take advantage of that in our quoting going forward. So \u2013 and I think it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s probably the best indicator. I think that our biggest concern going into the year is we thought fairly confident we can get the cost out. And in fact we are seeing improvements of I think it was over 40% improvement in the quarter and earnings. So, we are really seeing the earnings story improved. What we didn\u2019t know is could we translate that into orders. And so we have got this, this is indicative, not only this project is very large, but there is other projects they are working on. So, I have turned where we are having trouble growing in some of these segments or the market is not participating. I am feeling better and better about GWS. And it has a lot to do with the fact that they have got their cost structure in line. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : But it\u2019s cost structure accruing positive margin of the year not just allowing you to\u2026 Alex Molinaroli : Absolutely, we are \u2013 we will double those margins and then hopefully improve on top of that for the overall business. Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Colin Langan with UBS. Go ahead. Your line is open. Colin Langan - UBS: Great. Thanks for taking my question. This time last year you were talking a lot about changing the portfolio mix of the business, obviously you have done a lot of strategic actions, I mean where do you think you stand now I mean are we done with divestitures at this point, should we expect since you have taken on some large transactions, acquisitions to pause here, any thoughts on where you stand in that process? Alex Molinaroli : This is Alex. I guess what I would say is we are \u2013 I don\u2019t think we are \u2013 this is going to be ongoing process. I would say that it\u2019s not going to be a one-time where we review our portfolio. I think as we understand better and better where we add value. There is more and more opportunity and where we can grow and where we can make more money for ourselves and for our shareholders. So I would say that we are not done, we are never done. I can\u2019t really get into specifics but I think we have got some work to do yet. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. And then just one follow-up on the metals business within auto experience, any color on how that\u2019s progressing, I know it was losing money over a year ago I think it ended last year breakeven, are you close to the 8% to 9% levels that I think you were before everything fell apart? Bruce McDonald : Yes. If I look at the underlying profitability of the metals business, in China we have made great progress there. And just maybe to quote some numbers before we made the acquisitions, our seating market share there is in let\u2019s say 40%, in our metals market share we talked about being 2% or 3%. If you look at the business that we have won there what were in the 15% to 20%. So we have taken our share up from say 2% or 3% to 15% to 20% and that business we have launched a brand new facility and it is up earning double digit returns. If you look at the metals business that we have and this would be a combination of the JCI, the Keiper and the Hammerstein in aggregate outside of China. So in North America and Europe in the quarter our return on sales was just a shade below 2%. And if we looked at this quarter last year we were in the red. There it\u2019s a longer \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit of a longer path. Colin to get to the target we talked about because we have got and we have talked about this before is what we have got to do is we got a lead tool our plants to get to standardize the manufacturing process. We got to standardize around the 2D product. And so we are working our way through I would say we are probably half way through the process of rationalizing the plants, getting the process standardized on the 2D products and trying to switch over some in-flight customers to our go to product line. So we are about halfway through. We are not sort of behind how long we thought it would going to take to do that. But that\u2019s sort of the timetable because we have got to roll things off before we get to those targets. Alex Molinaroli : I will give you a live example of that. One of the things that we are working quickly on is tracks. And what we see right now, the only thing that\u2019s in our way is to make sure that we got our customers comfortable with it. And we are largely there. If we get all of our customers that doesn\u2019t help us a whole lot to get 80% of your customers \u2013 if we can get all of our customers to switch we don\u2019t have to wait for new models. And if we saw some progress on that great progress and so I think we are going to start seeing at least in some of the components, but that\u2019s what we are having to do right now. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks for fitting me in here. I just want to make sure I understood on the light commercial side it sounds like it\u2019s very short cycle, so everything converts pretty quickly and that\u2019s what we should expect of ADT as well. So, orders are not really something that we should be tracking. Bruce McDonald : The backlog? Alex Molinaroli : You won\u2019t even see the backlog. There maybe a little backlog, but you won\u2019t even see it. So, what will happen is our business will get more and more disconnected from our backlog. So, when Bruce talked about our service going up, that doesn\u2019t run through our backlog or lot of it doesn\u2019t run through our backlog. We sell parts. That doesn\u2019t run through our backlog. We sell to distribution like residential and like commercial. That doesn\u2019t go through our backlog. So, what happens is as we go down market through distribution or the type of products we are going to have is we are going to have to start talking about little bit differently, because our backlog is really relates mostly to contracted work. And that\u2019s mostly large projects. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. So then can you give I guess some indication of orders or recent trends on ADT on an apples-to-apples basis? Alex Molinaroli : I don\u2019t have that. I just don\u2019t know the answer to that right now. Bruce McDonald : I know the orders that we saw and they are relatively small, because we only had them for two weeks, but when I was looking at the numbers prior to the closing, we are really looking Joe at something like around upper single-digit year-over-year order growth. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. On Global WorkPlace Solutions, obviously a great win here this quarter. Do you think some of your prior commentary around the future of that business has hurt you at all in the bidding process? And is that at all impediment and are you able to overcome that? Alex Molinaroli : I am sure it comes up. I mean, it would be na\u00efve to think it doesn\u2019t come up, but we have obviously continued to be engaged in that. And I think people understand that it\u2019s a great business with great capability. So, I don\u2019t \u2013 I think in the end it hasn\u2019t cost us anywhere as I am sure that we have to do more explaining that we have been asked, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hurt us. I think what\u2019s hurt us has been our cost structure. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then last one real quick, can you just remind us of where we are in the China battery capacity rollout and sort of where we are going to be in a couple year\u2019s timeframe? Alex Molinaroli : So, where we are now is we have two plants. So, we have filled one and we are filling the other. We are also converting the first plant that we put in place to some of that volume will now become AGM volume. So, we will go through a little bit of a change there, but essentially we have 14 million units capacity right now. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets : And the goal is still 20 million plus, right? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, closer to 30 million. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Alright, thanks a lot guys. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Glen Ponczak : Angela, we have got time for one more caller. Operator : Okay. Our last question will come from Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc. Go ahead. Your line is open. Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc: Alright, made it in, thank you, gentlemen. Alex Molinaroli : Alright, no problem Brett. You got a full buzzer. Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc: Yes, so obviously a lot of talk about M&A activity going on in the automotive industry with Zed-F and TRW and so forth. It\u2019s raised a lot of speculation that maybe a Lear or somebody else might get taken out, which then begs the question, how core is your seating business? I think in the past you have talked about it being a very core business, but yet you have also referred to it as we are always reevaluating our portfolio and so forth. So, how should we think about your seating business? Alex Molinaroli : Well, I am pretty happy with the growth that we are having in seating business. I like our China position. And I\u2019d like to get the profile of that business to where we see has been growth-oriented, particularly because of the China exposure. And I am hopeful that everyone just like myself will see that as core. Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc: Excellent. Thank you very much gentlemen. Have a great day. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Alright, thank you Brett. Glen Ponczak - Vice President, Investor Relations : Well, thanks everybody. Before we close here, Alex, do you have a couple of words to say? Alex Molinaroli - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. I just want to close by saying that I have made a big effort to make sure that we are as transparent as we can and we talk about the market as we see it. And I know we hedged our bets a bit on the building efficiency. I do believe that we are starting to see something, but I am just not willing to commit that the market has turned completely, but I do think we are well-positioned. And so as we keep making the investments that we are making, it just strengthens our position in the building efficiency business. I am pleased with the progress they have made in the market that\u2019s not growing. And when we come back, a good example is the UPG margins being up 3.5% for the year. That bodes well for our future. So, I want to thank our employees and I just want to make sure that everyone understands it. We are going to continue to meet expectations. And over a period of time, I think we are going to be happy with the top line. That\u2019s it. Glen Ponczak - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks Alex, thanks Bruce and everyone on the call, thanks for your interest. If you have got further questions, feel free to send me an e-mail or I can be reached at 414-524-2375 and enjoy the rest of your day and weekend. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

Alex? Alex Molinaroli : I'm pretty excited to be here today. We've finished our first year \u2013 my first year and I'm really proud to talk about our record earnings from our continuing operations and also our earnings per share. At the beginning of the year, we talked about the way that we thought the building market would work and even the battery market. And we were surprised \u2013 I think all of us were surprised with the tough market and the slow recovery. Of course, on the upside we were surprised, all of us, about the production levels really across the globe from an automotive perspective and all that being said, if you look at our margin improvement across the board regardless where we had great growth or not. I'm really proud of what the team has accomplished. The effectiveness, efficiency and quality of the products that we're putting in place, the processes are in place, are coming through and the results. You look across the board; everything from automotive which is at a record net income, almost 6%. I don't think we've ever done that in our history. I'm extremely proud. In fact today I'm in Plymouth with our automotive team. So if we're a little bit clumsy today, the rest of the team is in Milwaukee. Let's talk about some of the things we did because what makes me so proud of the team is that we were able to accomplish all of this while we had so much going on. And I don't know \u2013 I've only been with the company 30 years. So I don't know what happened before the 30 years, but I could tell you in the 30 years that I've been here. I don't know that we've tried to undertake as many things as we've done in the last year. And we've done that without skipping a beat on our operations. In fact, our operations have improved. I would like to go through a few of the things. We've changed some of our capital allocations philosophy and we started our share repurchase program. We increased our dividend; we began implementing the Johnson Controls Operating System. We'll talk more about that when we see you in December, but essentially that's leveraging our best-in-class manufacturing, our integrated supply chain capabilities, our purchasing scale and capabilities, commercial excellence programs, across the enterprise and we've had a tremendous amount of success and in fact, I think are further ahead than what I expected at this particular time. So a lot of things happened in our portfolio, with the acquisition of ADT, the increase in BE's products and channels to market, it's going very well. I have the opportunity to sit in with that team and the ADT integration is going at or better than the pace that I expected from the standpoint of the team being on-boarded. Our new employees seem to be well integrated and our new customers seem to be very happy with Johnson Controls being part of their solution. It seems like a long time ago when we divested the electronics, but it wasn't that long ago, so we were able to complete that this year. We set up the MOU with Hitachi. It's very important to us to be able to acquire some of the technologies that we need for our building efficiency business. We announced our joint venture with the interiors, one of our partners in China and taking that global joint venture which will be the largest and most profitable interior business in the world, taking that globally and we look forward to closing that in 2015. Recently we announced some reorganizations, particularly within the building efficiency business. We separated the field operation in North America from the products and channel business and we put Bill Jackson in charge of the building efficiency business, and I will come back to that in a few minutes. And then recently we announced our decision to divest the global workplace solutions. I will also make sure that you understand not only did we have that distraction going on within the business, but they were able to have one of the best years in the history of that business not only on the bottom line, but they've been securing orders here in the last few months. Around our operational improvements, the metals, month-after-month, quarter-after-quarter seems to be on a path to continuous improvements, and the interiors improvement is really not \u2013 it's almost breathtaking what they have been able to accomplish. It's a real turnaround and it makes our joint venture arrangement much easier and much more successful as we come together with our partner. And if you look at our profitability in the automotive business, I referenced that we've never seen these profitability levels. And we're not done. The team is confident and moving forward. I feel really good about what we've accomplished in our automotive business. Let's talk about the management changes, with all this going on, I think we\u2019re at a place in our organization that we need to take advantage of the strong bench that we have. We have got great leaders and I think that our ability to take advantage of that leadership will help us keep on pace to make sure that we can transform this organization while we meet our annual budget. Let me go through these changes. I announced that Bruce McDonald would be Vice Chairman and if I talk about what Bruce is going to do, Bruce is probably one of the best CFOs in the Fortune 500, but he's really become CFO plus and I think the folks that know him know that Bruce has always done his job and a little bit more. And so what we\u2019re trying to do is make sure we take advantage of his capacity and not only his capacity but the fact that we have good succession planning. So Bruce will be managing our corporate development group, our M&A activities. He is consolidating our purchasing activities across the company. He will be managing our discontinued operations and he's leading our multiyear, $1 billion ERP system implementation. He will also provide additional operations support and oversight for the organization and I'm really happy to have a partner like Bruce on the team. We couldn't do that without a great CFO. I think a lot of you know Brian Stief. Brian has been with us for four or five years, but before that he was off and on our partner with PWC. This is going to be a seamless transition and you'll get more and more exposure to Brian as we move forward. I referenced Bill Jackson. I think that Bill's resume, even just talk about what he's done since he's been at Johnson Controls. I think he's the right guy for the job. He was very successful in turning around both our electronics and our interiors business. He was a part of the GWS transformation activities. I think that Bill is going to hit the ground running. He is more than pretty excited about the role that he has and I expect great things from Bill and the team at building efficiency. And then last but not least, we talked earlier in the year announced about Beda Bolzenius [ph] moving to Shanghai to lead not only the automotive business which is becoming more and more centered in Shanghai, but also becoming the Vice Chairman for Asia Pacific as we put our second headquarters there allowing us to make the kind of investments in the future that we need to maintain our leadership position. Let's talk about the fourth quarter, it's pretty obvious, I'm pretty happy with what was accomplished, 3% growth on the top line. I wish it was more, but the markets weren't helping us. But in spite of that, you can see that our segment income, up 11%, all-time record and then our EPS due to our operations and our buyback up 14% to $1.04. I'll just keep saying it; the amount of change that the organization has gone through and our ability to stay focused is something to be proud of. I would like to spend a little bit of time on building efficiency. It's been the one thing that's been a frustration and nagging at us, at least over the last year and really for the last few years and I haven't been willing to make a whole lot of commitments about when we were seeing the turnaround in the marketplace, but I have a smile on my face just so you know. I would like to talk about what we saw in the quarter. Our sales for the applied equipment was up 22% versus Q4 in 2013. The industry grew at 10%. So we gained some share, but the industry growth is probably the most important part of this for us. And we've seen it across the board. It's not just in the commercial markets. Not all the institutional markets, but if you look at healthcare, local government, the federal government \u2013 we're seeing projects \u2013 not only are we securing projects, but we're also seeing projects on the Board and our pipelines are improving. In the light commercial, I really wanted to highlight our ADT growth. We\u2019re in-line with the market and in-line with our expectations. At this point, I think that's the right message, because we just want to make sure that we are able to integrate everyone effectively and assure our new customers that they will be taken care of well. And one part of our business that didn't perform from a top line as we hoped it would was our residential business. Our sales were flat; the market grew for the quarter. A big part of that was the fact that we've changed some distribution in some of our key markets. So as we get through that, we\u2019re going to have a period here until we come out of that change. I would like to come back about our secured, first time no matter how you slice it up, first time in a year that we've seen growth, 2% growth ex-FX \u2013 ex-FX ADT. We're seeing the billings from Architectural Monthly AIA go up. You can see that on the chart and if you look at our pipelines which are usually looking out six months, we're seeing some significant projects on the board. So, for the first time \u2013 and you know I've been reluctant \u2013 I feel like there is some momentum in the business and unless something external happens, I think we've hit the bottom. So let's talk about going into next year. We've got great momentum. I do think that this year will be a year of execution. We have many things going on within the businesses around improvements, around continuous improvements, around integration of activities and we also have portfolio changes and different initiatives that are happening at the enterprise level. We continue to invest in our long term, but we need to keep working on this margin expansion and when we get to talk to you in December. We will have more about that, but I'm pretty bullish that we will continue to expand our margins. And the last thing I would like to leave you with and this is important, is that I'm not looking for any portfolio changes, significant portfolio changes particularly as it relates to divestitures. I guess that's the way to talk about it; over the near term, over the next few years. We right now are pretty happy with the businesses that we have. We look across our portfolio, we have great businesses and we have some platforms whether it be technology or regional for growth. We do need to add value to those platforms, but we do think we have great platforms moving forward. So with that I'm going to turn it over to Bruce and he can give you some more fourth quarter highlights. Bruce McDonald : Okay. Thanks, Alex and good morning, everyone. So let me just start on slide 9, with automotive. Maybe just to comment, as I talk through the business results, I'm going to exclude the number of nonrecurring items that we had in this year and last year and Brian will take you through those in his comments. But just starting with automotive, I think it's probably fair to say we just couldn't be more pleased with the results that we saw for our automotive businesses both here in the fourth quarter and also for the full year. We saw strong improvements in our metals business in our European operations, in South America and certainly last but not least, our interiors business and if you look at our margins in the fourth quarter and the full year, significant year-over-year improvement. The other thing I would note as it relates to automotive is we did maintain a disciplined approach to quoting new business during the year. We've talked about focusing on winning customers, focusing on higher growth markets in China and we were pleased to talk to \u2013 for the full year, we booked a record amount of new and replacement business as we saw our customers really take advantage of the fact that we've got differentiated technology that we can offer. We have a global, low-cost footprint. We've got global launch and program management capabilities and we just continue to be pleased to get the recognition from our customers with significant new business awards. And the areas where I would really point to would be metals. We have won a number of large metals, huge contracts, huge multi-year, multibillion-dollar contracts that we thought was going to happen in the industry as customers commonize their seating metals platforms. We were really able to take advantage of that with the footprint that we have. In China, our metals business \u2013 we started a couple years ago at low single digits. Our market share now is nearly up to the 20% level. Interiors, we talked on our last call about new business wins in our interiors business as the customer is really embracing the joint venture that we're putting together with Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems. In North America I would note in the quarter we won our first BMW. They've been a long \u2013 this is the interiors side, our first BMW order. We've done business with BMW for a long time in Europe and in China, but this was our first award in the interior side in North America. We will talk a lot more about our backlog at the December analyst meeting, but I thought it was important just to sort of share with you the tremendous success we've had on the customer front here. So if you just look at the numbers, you can see from an automotive perspective our sales were up 3%. Each of seating and interiors were up 3%, respectively. If you look at our geographic revenue mix, in North America we were up 6%, so a little bit below the 8% uptick in the North American market. In Europe, our revenues were down 1%, generally speaking in-line with the industry reduction. You can see here and as we noted on our slides in China, we continue to see really strong momentum in that market as we gain share. As you know, most of our business is through nonconsolidated joint ventures and you can see in the fourth quarter here we are seeing our sales were up 17% to $1.8 billion which substantially outpaced the 8% improvement in estimated production for the region. If you look at China for the year, we really hit a milestone this year. Our sales grew by about 25% to slightly over $7 billion, so that's a huge year-over-year increase and really reflects the share gains that we have in that region. Turning to profitability, you can see in the fourth quarter our segment income of $261 million was up 27% versus last year and our margins were up 100 basis points. We continue to benefit from strong operational improvements in metals and interiors and our cost reduction initiatives and get the benefit from a contribution level of higher overall volumes. In terms of margins, seating was up 20 basis points to 5.2% and interiors was up significantly 360 basis points to $3.9 million. I didn't really talk about South America earlier, but a lot of industry comments and I know some of those left in the auto sector are having real difficulties down there. We've been focused on turning around our South American operations all year. We're really pleased to be able to exit 2014 here with basically a breakeven business in North America. So we are really getting performance from the automotive team in the quarter and for the year. Turning to building efficiency, fourth quarter you can start to see the impact of ADT or Air Distribution Technologies, being in our numbers. So with that acquisition, we have significantly increased our exposure to the light commercial sector and it's really opened up for us the independent distribution channel. As Alex mentioned in his comments, the integration is on track. Our fourth quarter numbers were right in-line with our expectations. Importantly, I think from a sales perspective, even though its early days; we are already starting to see some of the benefits of cross selling. And in the quarter, we had about $1 million of combined, cross selling orders that came through our numbers. So it's not a big number, but it's good to see that the thesis behind this investment was really driven on revenue growth and positioning us in higher growth markets and so it's good to see the sales synergies come through in such a quick pace. So when you put ADT into BE here, it just transforms our business. We're now seeing top line, bottom-line and margin expansion and we expect to see that accelerate here as we go forward. If you look at the fourth quarter, you can see our revenues were up about 1% to $3.9 billion. If you take out ADT, which was about $240 million of revenue in the quarter and adjust for FX, our sales were down about 3%. If you look at that, geographically what you would see is that Asia and Europe were up 3% to 4% respectively, North America was down 5% and the Middle East and Latin America were down double digits for us. In terms of our unexecuted backlog, you can see at $4.8 billion, we're up about 1%. This is the first increase we've seen in over a year. Again, as Alex mentioned, our backlog was up about 1%, with softness in Latin America, we're down about 30%. Europe we are down 8%. Asia was down 3% and it was offset by higher backlog in the Middle East. In North America I would just comment our backlog was up 1%. Turning to orders and, again, if I adjust these for currency, they were up 11%. Again, taking out ADT and it was up 2%. If you looked at that geographically, we would see North American orders were up 5%. So that was the strongest area for us in terms of orders, Asia was up 4%, Europe was flat to down 1% and again, Middle East and Latin America were down double-digits. So I think the important thing for us here is the big markets, North America and Asia, we are starting to see sequential improvement in orders and quoting. Our overall numbers though are being dragged down by pretty big declines in the Middle East and Latin America where we really have tough economies. So it was good to see those markets starting to turn positive. In terms of segment income, you can see a pretty significant increase, about 11% year-over-year to $393 million. If you take a look at the margins ex-GWS, they were 11.8%, up 20 basis points versus last year. Here's where we are starting to see the benefit of improved results in Asia, the acquisition of ADT and the benefit of SG&A reductions. In terms of GWS, you can see here as we've noted, a huge improvement in our profitability \u2013 $61 million in the quarter more than double last year, a 290 basis points improvement. And I would sort of like to add in to Alex's comments in terms of GWS's performance in the year. We saw significant improvement in both our profitability and our margins. On the customer side, we won an awful lot of new business particularly in the second half of the year and if we look at the backlog for GWS which is not to be confused with the backlog that we quote in BE, it's the backlog of won customer contracts over the life of the contracts. It's up 47% versus last year. So I think, just with the business improvement, the improvements we\u2019ve made in the operating model, the customers are recognizing our ability to provide a global solution. And it has positioned the business really nicely in terms of our divestiture. We are not going to really get into the details of that. I would just comment that we're working with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We've got a robust process in place and we've got a lot of interest, but it's very early days. We've been at it for just over a month now. And lastly, turning to power solutions for the fourth quarter, you can see sales were up about 5% over last year. Lead levels were comparable, so sometimes we've got big adjustments because of year-over-year lead, that wasn't really a factor for us this year. In terms of unit volumes, we\u2019re up 4%. Geographically we\u2019re up 6% in North America, 10% in Asia and Europe down 3% where we're still seeing some destocking and if you were to look underneath those European numbers, you would see that the aftermarket was down 5%, whereas OE was up about 4%. In terms of AGM, as we noted on the slide here, we\u2019re up about 23% to just over $2 million in the quarter. We've added several new customers during the year in power solutions, as we've talked about on previous calls. And if you look at our market share, what you would see is in the Americas \u2013 I'm being inclusive of South America, Central America and North America \u2013 in aggregate we improved our market share by 200 basis points to 55% this year and our European market share, despite the fact that we saw some destocking in the aftermarket side held steady at about 53%. In terms of our segment income at $329 million, we were comparable to the level last year, although our margins were down about 100 basis points. I think the key thing to note in terms of our margin performance in power solutions was we talked about changing from LIFO to FIFO inventory accounting and that really changed the way the timing and the amount of lead that we purchased and some of our inventory stocking and destocking on a quarterly basis. So when you adjust that out, we had a little bit of choppiness in terms of the overall quarters as it flowed through in 2014. But I think the key takeaway that I would like you to remember here is, if you look at our full year margin performance we went into this year with an expectation that power solutions would deliver a 50 basis point improvement in our margins and we came through with a 60 basis point improvement. It could have been a little bit better had we seen the aftermarket be a bit firmer, but overall we\u2019re pleased with the performance coming out of power solutions this year and the best 60 basis point margin expansion was a little bit better than our expectations. So with that I will turn things over to Brian. Brian Stief : Okay. Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. Page 12, fourth quarter highlights. As you'll note in our press release, our Q4 results included four nonoperational items which resulted in a net charge of $0.58 in the quarter and I would like to just touch on those. There was a restructuring and impairment charge for about $162 million related primarily to our building efficiency reorganization, about half of that charge is cash and the other half is noncash. The second item would be there is our annual Q4 noncash mark-to-market adjustment related to our pension and OPEB plans. Given the decline in interest rates year-over-year, that charge in the current year was $290 million. The third item was transaction and integration related costs associated with the number of portfolio activities that we've got going on. It was $23 million. And in the fourth area, there were three significant tax items, discrete tax items, in the fourth quarter that netted down to $18 million. So, the aggregate of those four items is the $0.58, and as I go through my discussion of the financials here, I will exclude those items from my comments. Overall, fourth quarter revenues were up 3% to $11 billion, driven primarily by the automotive and power solutions businesses. Gross profit for the quarter of 17.2% was in-line with last year and what you really see there is that growth in our gross margins for the automotive seating and interiors business, GWS and building efficiency in Asia that Bruce referred to were offset by declines in BD North America and declines in our power solutions business of the 100 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, SG&A declined by about 2% which was a result of some aggressive cost reduction initiatives that we continue to implement across our businesses. Equity income of $122 million was $28 million higher than year ago levels which reflects the improved profitability from our automotive and building efficiency joint ventures in Asia. And I would point out that about half of that gain in equity income resulted from a nonrecurring gain associated with the buyout of one of our joint venture partners. Overall, fourth quarter operating income was strong, up 11% versus last year and segment margins of 9% were 70 basis points better than 2013, so overall a very strong performance. Moving to slide 13, net financing charges of $66 million were up $12 million versus prior year levels and these higher financing costs are simply the result of the financing of the ADT acquisition in June of 2014. As far as a tax rate, our effective rate for the quarter was 19.6%, a slight improvement from the 20.6% that we had in the fourth quarter last year. Income attributable to non-controlling interests was a charge of $37 million in the fourth quarter of this year which is slightly higher than last year which is a function of the higher profitability in the automotive and building efficiency joint ventures that we\u2019ve globally. But overall a very strong quarter with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.04, which is up 14% versus the $0.91 a year ago, so very pleased with the performance. I would like to spend a little bit of time on slide 14, going through some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the year. Our fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion which allowed us to generate a net debt reduction in the quarter of $1.1 billion. Trade working capital as a percentage of sales was 6.1% which was a 30 basis point improvement from last year, but I would point out this area of working capital is something that we need to focus on as we move into 2015. We still aren't at a position that we would like across our businesses, so that's going to be an area of focus of mine as we move forward here. Capital spending of $1.2 billion for the year was in-line with our expectations. Free cash flow for the year inclusive of the electronics divestiture proceeds of $265 million, approximated $1.5 billion. And in the current year, we doubled the cash return to our shareholders through our buyback programs and dividends to $1.8 billion in 2014 from $900 million in 2013. So as we move into 2015, we are very pleased with our balance sheet position. I think we're very strong as we enter the year. Our net debt to cap ratio ended the year at 35.7% which is a 260 basis point improvement from the end of the third quarter and obviously up from last year's 26.5% level due to the share repurchase that we did in Q1 for $1.2 billion and then the $1.6 billion acquisition of ADT in Q3. As far as our pension and OPEB liabilities, we are 86% funded as of the end of this year which was a bit lower than last year which was at 88%. And the delta there is really due to the lower discount rates. I would like to point out that during the fourth quarter we completed a lump sum buyout of certain current retirees in our U.S. pension plan which was $300 million, and as you may recall, last year in Q4, we offered a lump sum buyout to certain of our deferred vested plan participants for $450 million. Now the funding of that $750 million in buyouts obviously comes from plant assets versus Johnson Controls. Lastly, from a weighted average debt maturity at the end of 2014, it's 14 years which is up from nine years at the end of last year and this really is reflective of the opportunity that we took in connection with the ADT acquisition in Q3 to term out some of our debt and lock in the benefits of today's low interest environment on a long term basis. And then finally I would say that, just to point out, when you look at the balance sheet, we have taken our GWS business and our interiors business and we've now classified those as assets held for sale in our year-end balance sheet, given the pending transactions with both those businesses that we expect in fiscal 2015. So moving to slide 15, overall our fourth quarter performance was strong and provides us confidence as we enter Q1 of 2015. We continue to expect strong volumes in the automotive business to continue. As Alex and Bruce mentioned, our pipeline supports continued order improvement in building efficiency and some of the reorganization actions that we have taken in Q4 of this year we expect to see some early benefits as we enter fiscal 2015. Power solutions is expected to once again deliver year-over-year improvements and one other item that I had just mentioned relative to Q1 is we've got $1.2 billion in share repurchases that we are planning for all of fiscal 2015 and about $600 million of that will likely occur in our first quarter. We continue to make progress with the previously announced portfolio activities which would be the GWS divestiture, the Hitachi JV and interiors JV. As we sit here today, our targeted completion for those is the second half of fiscal 2015. In addition, as Alex mentioned, the ADT integration activities are well underway and progressing in-line or possibly even in excess of expectations. So as far as Q1 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be $0.74 to $0.77 which is up 12% to 17% year-over-year. And, again, that would exclude transaction and integration costs just given the level of activity that we've got in that area and that impact on a quarterly basis could range anywhere from probably $0.01 to $0.03 depending upon how things play out timing wise with those transactions. And then lastly, I would say we will provide full year guidance at our December 2nd, Analyst Meeting in New York. So with that Glen, I will turn it over to you for questions. Glen Ponczak : Great. Thanks, Brian. So we've got about 25 minutes until the top of the hour here and so to give as many people as possible a chance to ask a question, please limit yourselves to a question and perhaps a short follow-up and then get back in the queue if you've got more. So with that Madison, we will turn it over for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Colin Langan of UBS. Sir, you may now begin. Colin Langan \u2013 UBS: Just one sort of maintenance question, Brian, I just wanted to clarify, your guidance for this year, does that include \u2013 you mentioned that the GWS and interiors are moved in discontinued ops for the balance sheet, but your guidance does include that and until it actually officially happens from an earnings perspective? Brian Stief : That's correct. Carol Lowe : Okay and then just one strategically, seating margins seem pretty solid here for the last couple of quarters. Obviously there is some help with equity income. What are the next steps to getting through your longer term targets for the business? What are the major drivers of getting margins higher from here? Alex Molinaroli : A lot of this is more of the same. We\u2019ve a lot more opportunity in metals just in the program that we have today and the other thing that is important to note is, as our backlog changes in metals, in particular we are moving from 3 to 4 different product lines because of the different companies that are being integrated to one set of SKUs and product lines for each one of the components. And that's going to lower our costs on an ongoing basis, that will be further down the road, but that's an expectation we have as the metals continues to evolve. The other thing is \u2013 and we talk about equity income and that's where a lot of our growth is going to be in the future because of the fact that the growth in China and where we're going to make the investments and with our partners. We want to maximize that as much as possible, and we just still have \u2013 because of our pricing discipline, we\u2019ve the opportunity to continue to increase margins in our mature markets. So I think there is not one single thing. Our equity income is going to continue to increase at a fairly rapid rate, but I also think there's still improvement within our business, our core business, particularly around components and in Europe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Sir, your line is now open. Robert Barry \u2013 Susquehanna: Just to Alex, I wanted to dig in a little deeper on the increased confidence level in BE. Obviously nice to see the orders inflect and it sounds like the pipeline is full, but are you seeing more sustainable \u2013 what you think will be sustainable willingness to convert all of the pipeline activity into orders going forward and what do you think might be driving that? Alex Molinaroli : Well, it's interesting that you asked that question. Actually I would turn what you\u2019re calling convert if you look at our pipeline to hit ratio, that is how our team would look at it and that has actually gone up. We do a fairly good job of making sure that we filter out our opportunities. So one of the things that has happened is our hit rate has gone up and that makes me believe that the pipeline is very healthy. Also, the reason around it I think is sustainable. When you start seeing the institutional market and the larger projects start to get on the board. I think you\u2019re starting to feel some confidence that the market is going to respond. To be real specific, all the verticals institution, with the exception of the state government and I think that has to do mostly with the fact that we had this huge Hawaii project in our pipeline last year \u2013 have increased, some more than others. In particular we\u2019re seeing a rebound in healthcare which has really hurt us over the past few years. So I guess I'm not going to \u2013 the confidence level I have is I'm making sure that everyone realizes I do see a significant change in what's happening. We're not out of the woods yet, but the fact that we are able to see what we saw on a continual basis over the last three months and what's happened in our pipeline. I just feel a heck of a lot better about it. Robert Barry \u2013 Susquehanna: Yes, maybe just a quick follow-up on the offset to the equipment side, sounds like the equipment sale is looking very good. Maybe you can comment a little bit on what's happening on the service and performance contracting side. Maybe your comment about state government ties into that, but just curious about the thoughts and the outlook there. Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Actually the one thing underneath everything is our focus on services increase, as you would guess because of the lack of capital projects. So our service business has been growing at a fairly good clip, particularly our planned services. Our retrofit business is growing, the pipeline is pretty strong. Our pipeline is about equal \u2013 just to make sure you understand, our pipeline is about equal in our energy solutions business, but you\u2019ve to remember we had the largest project ever of that we secured in December of last year with Hawaii. And so with Hawaii and last year compared to the pipeline we\u2019ve today with no project like that, it's about at the same level. So really pretty much across the board we're seeing some strength. Robert Barry \u2013 Susquehanna: Can you quantify the Hawaii impact? Alex Molinaroli : Well, the Hawaii impact, it was over $100 million. I think it was around $120 million. It ended up being a $140 million project, but I think we had discounted about $120 million in our backlog. So, that's a good question, because when we see the results of our quarter, if we're able to secure similar to what we did last year in BE. I would say that the real growth in that, you'd have to take that $100 million project and discount what you see in the numbers. But the pipeline supports that we will have a continued growth throughout the year, but we won't have a $100 million project. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Johnson of Barclays. Sir, your line is now open. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: So, I want to drill more into the BE segment in a few questions. You put together through a price increase my understanding in BE. Could you maybe clarify how broadly that was? Is that in the new services business or in the equipment business and will that be helpful to the margin going forward? Alex Molinaroli : So there was a couple price increases over the year. The UPG segment had a price increase back in the spring and then we announced another price increase which was really much across the board. Now, it wasn't \u2013 every channel and every product didn't get the same price increase, but pretty much across the board we went for a price increase and what we're seeing so far for the most part, that the industry is following us. Right now we have tempered our expectation, so we've discounted a little bit of volume because of our price increase. But our expectation \u2013 and it will be in our guidance, in our plan \u2013 is we built in the net effect of the price increase. We do think that there could be some discounting down the road, but right now things seem to be sticking. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: Okay. And are you seeing any benefits yet from splitting services and products? And maybe just talk strategically about what that was meant to accomplish and then what we're seeing on it and does it open up even in the U.S. broader distribution for what you are making beyond your traditional branches? Alex Molinaroli : Yes and we will cover that in some detail in December, but the bottom-line for that was that we had a business that was becoming very dependent on our branches for decades. And in order for us to be able to support multiple channels, we needed to disconnect the two organizations and make sure we built a world class product and distribution company. The core of BE and that we continue to focus our branch business and being a great service and delivery organization and a channel for our BE products. So it was built to give ourselves some transparency and our ability to manage more effectively the products that we put in the portfolio and the new distribution that we are putting in place. So that's the strategic rationale. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: Okay, and any impact yet on the backlog or margins or we will have more in December? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, I don't know that there would be any impact yet, but I can tell you from an internal perspective, people are asking questions that they've never asked before, because there is a whole different set of dependencies or lack of a codependency that there used to be in the past. So I expect really good things. I expect us to be more efficient and I expect us to be able to pick up our pace as it relates to new products and our ability to support our channels, but I can't really say that anything has happened yet, but I feel really good about the change. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: Okay and final question, just very quickly. Metals, big year-over-year dollar improvement, are you getting close to that 10% margin I believe you talked about in the past? Alex Molinaroli : No, we're not there. Yes, we've got a ways to go which is I'll treat that as opportunity. We won't get to those levels till we get through, first, making sure that the backlog that we\u2019ve that we\u2019re as effective as we can and then as we start transitioning our product line to a single product line where we\u2019re able to get the real cost efficiencies. So that's going to take a while, but we've got that opportunity in front of us. Bruce McDonald : Yes, I would maybe just add to that, Brian to Alex's point, we're probably in the lower 2% \u2013 3% right now from a North American and European perspective because we are working that through. But if you look at our metals business that we have right now in China which is about a $500 million or $600 million business, that business where we do have the 2B product portfolio and we have the manufacturing processes standardized. So we don't have the integration, we started it fresh, that business is at the 10% \u2013 11% margins right now. So we're confident we can get there. We're there in China, but it takes a long time for these customer programs to roll-off and for us to retool our metals facilities. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays: Okay. So that's a long term margin improvement glide path? Bruce McDonald : 3 to 4 years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Sir, your line is now open. Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 CLSA: I wanted to ask you \u2013 so global workforce solution is now officially for sale. How is the process going so far? What sort of interest and from what type of buyers are you seeing? And then more fundamentally, I completely agree with the rationale of it not being core, but at the same time removing it will obviously will remove a little bit of earnings power. Are you saying to divest it in a way that still creates some shareholder value or is it really just more strategically it makes sense? Bruce McDonald : Okay. Like I think I talked about earlier, it's pretty early in the process. We're working with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We've put together you can say an offering, memorandum and we've met with a number of folks that are interested and we're coming up to the point in the process where we're going to get expressions of interest and then decide on a shorter list who are going to go forward in the process. But it's very early days and I think we are in good shape. There is a lot of interest. The business has performed well, so we got I think a lot of good things going for us. And from a timing perspective, we are probably 3 to 6 months \u2013 it's probably late Q2, I guess I would say is when we hopefully get to be in a position where we announce something and then, depending on who the buyer is we\u2019ve to go through the normal regulatory process, but that's the timeframe. In terms of your question then about is there any shareholder value implications, I think clearly with some of the people that are interested in the business that are already in that \u2013 the strategic players that are already in that space, what it does provide as you think about the reason we got into the facilities management business was to provide a channel for our products. And so to the extent we sell GWS to another strategic buyer it broadens the channel that we\u2019ve available to us to sell our products to. So, as we're thinking through this divestment and particularly with the strategic buyers, then structuring an arrangement where we would have access to their expanded portfolio of real estate and customers is a key thing that we are looking at. So, we hope to get that, but we may not. And then I think second part of that question would be how we choose to redeploy the cash and I guess we haven't really commented publicly on what we're going to do with the money. Right now I would say we're focused on getting the money. Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 CLSA: And then just one follow-up on another update of a deal, can you maybe tell us how the Hitachi negotiations are progressing and the late estimate on when we may see a conclusion of that? Alex Molinaroli : We've gone it a long way since the last time we had a chance to talk about this. In fact, I will be heading over there myself in a couple weeks. We've got a few things that we need to work through, but I think we're pretty close to hammering out the few issues that we have. It's been a lot slower than we expected. I think it was much more complicated than it was when we got involved. I'm still a little bit leery about giving you a date, but I'm just hopeful when we get together here over the next couple of months, we are able to talk about a date. But we're getting \u2013 it's closer than it was yesterday and I apologize I can't have better information. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Murphy of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a question around the seating and interiors business, the way that you are discussing it and the business is developing. It sounds like you're much more committed than a lot of people think to that business and certainly much more committed to it than some of your competitors are alluding to. And just curious if you can comment on that and then as we think about margins going forward, if you could remind us what your targets are there for seating and interiors and how new business or what level of new business is rolling on as far as margins? Alex Molinaroli : From a strategic standpoint, in fact you're right. I wanted to make it very clear that at this time we're not making out any other major portfolio moves and the seating business, along with our interior joint venture that we have are core to us being successful in the future. And when we talk in December, you'll understand some of the rationale. First off, the China opportunity for us is outstanding and it's based off our relationships with our partners and so we don't want to \u2013 we want to take advantage and exploit that and I'm not sure we get the fair value for that in the first place. I'm not sure we're getting fair value today for that to be honest with you. And then the second thing that's really important to us is that we make sure that we take the expertise that we\u2019re getting out of the automotive business because of the demands of our customers and leverage that across our enterprise. So, one of the things that the automotive business brings to us around program management, our purchasing and engineering capability, our manufacturing capabilities and supply chain work, is world class because it has to be. And we're able to take those resources, take those people and take those processes and put it across our enterprise. So when you think about that business and what value it brings to Johnson Controls. I think we\u2019ve to look past just the seating business and in the interior business and what value it creates regionally with our footprint and what value it creates intrinsically inside our organization. Bruce, you can give them some of the numbers that we are looking to get. Bruce McDonald : Well, I could just comment mainly on the segment income margins. The plan is to take that to 7% or maybe even a little bit above 7%, but as we sit here today, that's been kind of our stated goal for a number of quarters and that still continues to be the case. So I would say around 7%. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So it would be fair to say that new business is rolling on at that level or much higher to offset some of the older legacy business? Bruce McDonald : Yes, I would say that. I'm not suggesting we are necessarily going to get that level in fiscal 2015 here, but that is certainly our goal over the next few years. Alex Molinaroli : One of the things that's happened is our mix is changing. As Bruce talked about our metals backlogs, our backlog is shifting from just being jet business to being components business, particularly metals and that mix is favorable as it relates to our overall margin. So it's not only margin improvement in our business, it's a mix improvement. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just to sneak in one, just on proceeds that you are going to raise ultimately from some of these asset sales. Could you just run us through the funnel of where those proceeds may be allocated as far as acquisitions or returning value to shareholders or reinvestment in the core business? Alex Molinaroli : I will talk at that from a strategic level. We're not really ready to talk because GWS will be the first place where we see some cash coming in. We're committed to our share repurchase program at this point. There is no reason with our cash flows that we can't continue on that program and so we've got a couple more years to go with that. As it relates to the use of proceeds for GWS, we\u2019ve a significant amount of ideas, more ideas than we have resources. In a way they help continue to transform this business from an operationally capable business into adjacencies and other markets that we can support that are going to be outside of automotive. So I'm hopeful that we\u2019re going to redeploy that cash in a way that helps us build more growth platforms, that's what we need. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open. Rich Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo : Two questions, Alex, on building efficiency, so applied sales up nicely in the quarter year-over-year, Ex GWS, the margin is up 20 bps. It seems like the margins could've been better given that should be pretty good mix for you and I'm just curious if there is anything unique in the mix this quarter or from a regional standpoint that affected the limited leverage, if you will. Alex Molinaroli : Yes. So, I actually don't have the numbers in front of me. One of the things that's been a drag to our margins all year is we've had some nagging large contracts in the Middle East and that has distorted our numbers off and on during the year. Brian, you probably have a view of that right now \u2013 but that's one of the things that I would look for. And the other thing that we weren't happy about is you saw our residential business didn't perform at the same levels and that's a high margin business, too. Those are the two things I would point at, but the business that we are getting in the applied side is a good margin business, but it was in our backlog. Rich Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay, all right. And then I know you\u2019re going to give more detail in December, but if we take a step back and look at the world, currencies have weakened or the dollar has strengthened and other currencies have weakened and global auto production is slowing down. You've got some self-help certainly factored in for next year that could help nicely, but if we take a step back, how should we think about the longer term earnings growth profile for the company? You had a good earnings growth year \u2013 this year. What are kind of the puts and takes that you think were broadly for '15? Alex Molinaroli : So if I look at 2015 and see what we're dependent on, the external market, I think that we still, even though there is a bit of a slowdown in China. We're outperforming the market in China. I think that will continue. We have lots of opportunity there. I think we have been very smart, very clever and judicious on how we've allocated our resources in the mature markets for our automotive business. So I think our margins will continue there. The backlog is pretty much known and I think if something \u2013 absent something that happened a few years ago, I think we'll be fine. Our power solutions business, one of the things that's really interesting is that we almost sold 1 million units of AGM batteries in North America, that may not seem like a lot of units, but if you remember last quarter, I think \u2013 I can't remember what I said \u2013 that we were up some godly amount of percent but we were up another 300% this quarter. And so if that starts to take off, the mix is going to help in power solutions. It won't just be a European story. And I think that the China story is still intact as it relates to power solutions. That opportunity is there. It's just right there in front of us, we need to grab it. And in building efficiency, I'm really bullish \u2013 we need the market to help us \u2013 but I'm really bullish that we're going to fix a lot of the issues that we had for us in places like the Middle East and the other thing that I'm bullish about is the changes that we have made in the organization are going to help us regardless of what the market does for us to be able to pull through on some of the products that we currently have in our portfolio. So I think next year \u2013 I'm not saying it's all in the bag but I'm more worried in the long term about the growth than I'm about next year. Glen Ponczak :  We've got time for probably one more, Madison. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Just for me, wanted to just focus on power solutions a little bit what you were talking about. You were up I think 60 basis points you said in terms of your margins this year. However in the quarter there was some noise relating to that change over from LIFO to FIFO. If I remember well, you had outlined a plan to run at similar levels of margin expansion over the next couple of years and wanted to get a sense of what the main drivers are, how much of this LIFO adjustment carries over if anything and maybe just fitting those pieces together for us. And then I have one follow-up. Bruce McDonald : I think what we said about power solutions at our Analyst Day last year was we felt we had a couple hundred basis points of margin expansion left in power solutions and that the pace of that was going to be around 50 basis points a year. I know there is some analysts that think the pace should be faster than that 50 basis points a year, but I would point to the fact that we are stepping up our investment in some of the advanced battery things and particularly the micro hybrid and dual voltage 48 volt type systems. So we\u2019re spending more money here because as we look longer out beyond say, a three year or a four year period that that could be an important growth driver for us. So, we\u2019re investing in that area. The LIFO accounting change, maybe I have confused folks with that in the past. We've normalized each year from an accounting perspective, but we talked about the fact that we made that accounting change. We did some things because we are on LIFO that were not how you would optimally run that business and so what you are really looking at is two different years' results under the same accounting treatment. But in the prior year, we ran the business one way in terms of when we procured lead cores or when we have run our inventory of cores low versus when the market price was high or low. Now we can take advantage of when there is market seasonality in lead prices and buying more inventory when it makes the most sense and the same thing with our production. We can smooth our production more in-line with seasonal demand, and so the choppiness that we've seen this year is really those two items that have sort of confused things-- It's really just going to be where are we going to get the other 150 basis points which we still have headwind against us I would say in terms of investing in advanced technology, but our China business continues to be \u2013 it's an area that we\u2019re investing in to add more footprint and so not dilutive to our margins. And then the other point that Alex referred to is the increasing mix shift that we\u2019re going to see as AGM becomes a bigger portion of the pipe. Alex Molinaroli : Yes, so I think the simple answer on that as it relates to the \u2013 it's actually smoother now than it was as compared to something that wasn't so smooth. I think this was kind of the new normal about how the quarters will flow. So we shouldn't see that as much of a whipsaw this coming year as we did last year. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs : If I can just do one follow-up, you had fairly mild temperatures during the summer. How does that impact your battery demand going forward? Is there a restocking effect that might be something to think about as we get into the fourth quarter because people's batteries lasted longer or is that immaterial? Alex Molinaroli : In the end, I think it's really not going to matter. What will happen \u2013 the only thing that can happen if we don't get strong early sales is there will be one less cycle at the end of winter. This weather thing has been killing us the last few years. And so I think what we have done is smartly try to manage our inventory and not forecast sales and historically try to get where we are forecasting sales in a much more conservative way because we haven't been able to predict. If you\u2019ve a good way of predicting the units, I would be open to it, but our tried and true methods haven't worked the last couple of years. Glen Ponczak : Okay. Thanks, Patrick. Alex, a few closing comments? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, so I just want to close \u2013 I want to thank our 170,000 employees. It's an outstanding accomplishment. I couldn't be more proud to be a part of this team and lead this team. The folks that you hear on the phone and all the people that support us that really do the work. It's been outstanding, particularly with all the distractions. All the anxiety and distractions inside this organization and this team has stayed focused, proud to be a part of it. Look forward to the coming year and I look forward to seeing you folks in December. Glen Ponczak : Thanks, Alex. Thanks to Bruce and Brian and thank you for your interest. Operator : Thank you and that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Bernstein & Company, Inc Operator : Welcome to the Tyco First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco\u2019s first quarter results for fiscal year 2015 and the press release issued earlier this morning. With me today are Tyco\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar. I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we\u2019ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides, which George and Arun will refer to can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC Form 10-Q later today. In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items and these metrics is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.48 billion declined 1% year-over-year on the reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% and a 1% benefit from acquisitions was more than offset by a 4% negative impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.38 and included net charges of $0.11 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.49. Now let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella. And good morning, everyone. We are off to a solid start as we enter the final year of our initial three-year plan as a new Tyco. Although the economic environment in certain regions is shaping up to be a bit more challenging than we had initially expected, the execution of our growth strategy and our disciplined capital allocation position us to accelerate top line growth, expand operating margins, and deliver a strong earnings growth in 2015. Our growth strategy is supported by internal initiatives within our control, driven by our transformation into an integrated fire and security operating company. We have a proven track record of delivering productivity and are beginning to change how we do business by leveraging technology within our direct channel to deliver a sustained growth over the long-term. Over the last two years, we have taken the holding company structure of multiple segments with multiple businesses operating independently with a lot of variation across work streams and processes and have streamlined into an operating company structure. This has allowed us to leverage our depth and expertise across fire and security so that we could simplify our structure, create speed in how we support our customers, free up resources to reinvest in the businesses, and deliver strong margin improvement. We have made significant progress and the Tyco business system has enabled this transformation. As a result, we have a coordinated and aligned strategy that is deployed by business and by region. As we enter 2015, we now have all of our leaders across the company accountable for their total type of performance, not just their individual business units, embracing a one Tyco mindset driven by top line growth supported by continuous operational improvements. We've had a very productive start to 2015 with lots of progress on a number of fronts, including innovation, innovative solutions and M&A, which is summarized on slide 3. As discussed during our recent Investor Day, we have made significant progress in our ability to enhance our service and productivity with the launch of Tyco On, our integrated data and smart services platform. Tyco On provides a set of software-enabled Internet of Things capabilities that enhance safety and security systems using open standards to connect a wide range of intelligent devices, systems and services, enabling customers from small businesses to large multi-nationals to improve their operations. I am pleased to share some examples of how we are delivering differentiated solutions to help address customer needs. First, our ExacTech solution improves efficiency through a service application already in use in our installation and services business. ExacTech allows a single technician to perform fire alarm testing, eliminating the need of a second technician to complete the procedure. By using a mobile application, the technician can test detectors throughout a building and connect remotely to the system's fire panel. In the future, this application will offer cloud enabled the storage and access to testing documentation, providing a more cost effective solution that would appeal to a broad base of customers. Second, we are enabling more complex smart solutions that leverage data from varied devices and systems and apply advanced analytics to reveal insights that lead to better decisions, faster execution, and transformational business outcomes for customers. For example, in over 4,000 retail locations, we are helping retailers tied together data from our RFID tags, video, electronic article surveillance and traffic centers, transforming it into actionable intelligence through our latest release of TrueVue software. With these insights retailers can optimize their inventory management, deliver a more pleasant shopper experience, and maximize revenue. Lastly, we continue to build our global library of system and device integrations. Our integrated solutions platform is now incorporated into our fire detection system certified for European markets. It enables real-time visual verification of fire alarms, allowing immediate and appropriate response and action, providing compelling customer value. In addition to the great progress the team has made, I am very pleased to have Daryll Fogal join our management team as our Chief Technology Officer. Darrell has global responsibility for executing our technology strategy, including the capabilities and operations needed to support the development of products, services, and solutions. Darrell recently joined us after a long career at Honeywell, and most recently Eaton where we he was Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Engineering for their electrical sector. I am very excited to have Darrell join us in this critical role as we evolve into a growth and innovation company. Turning to M&A, we continue to be very active on the M&A front. During the first quarter, we signed or completed five acquisitions focused on key areas of growth, including a building on our services platform, expanding our presence in growth markets, and growing our product portfolio with all of them strengthening our technology platform. Let me give you a brief summary. Within the UK, we acquired First Choice Facilities, or FCF, which designs, installs, commissions, and maintains a wide range of integrated fire and security solutions. FCF has a strong installed base with a very robust service delivery model, which strengthens our regional footprint and increases are recurring revenue. This acquisition will be reported within our rest of world install and services segment. The remaining four acquisitions are within our global product segment and span across the three platforms of fire protection, security products, and life safety. Within fire protection products, we acquired Shanghai Jindun, a fire suppression products business in China, which complements our organic investments and quickly accelerates our position in a large and expanding Tier 2 market. In security products, we made a majority investments in Qolsys, an IOT developer of the industry's most advanced interactive intrusion platform, supporting life safety, energy management, and other functions. In Life Safety, we acquired ISG Infrasys, a world leader in the design of thermal imaging technology with a reputation for top image quality. Coupled with our Scott brand and customer base, we can significantly leverage ISG's technology. Additionally, within life safety, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Industrial Safety Technologies, or IST, a leading player in the gas and the flame detection industry. This is the largest transaction to date post separation, and is expected to generate annualized revenues of approximately $140 million. The addition of IST to our life safety product portfolio will bring our customers a full range of safety solutions across both fixed and affordable detection. This acquisition is not only a natural extension of our product portfolio but significantly expands our product offerings within life safety, which can now provide a full breadth of products in flame, gas, and open path detection. IST is a high growth, high profit business with leading technology. We expect to leverage our global sales force and distribution channels to pull through additional IST products. Over time, we intend to expand IST's service footprint which accounts for approximately 25% of its annual revenue. We expect to close the IST transaction towards the end of our second quarter. Altogether, these five acquisitions total approximately $470 million in purchase price, with annualized revenues of $240 million. Subsequent to the quarter end, we signed three additional small bolt-ons for a total purchase price of $45 million, including a service business in North America, a leader in wireless fire detection technology, and a provider of integrated RFID solutions. Together, these three acquisitions are expected to generate annualized revenue of approximately $25 million. For fiscal 2015, we expect these eight acquisitions to add an incremental $175 million to revenue and $0.03 to EPS, excluding the one-time impact of inventory step ups primarily related to the IST acquisition which will be reported as a special item. We still have several nice opportunities in our M&A pipeline which we will continue to work on during the year. These acquisitions along, with the internal investments we continue to make in technology, accelerate our strategic priorities, with a focus on technology platforms that form the foundation of new and innovative solutions, which our direct channel can utilize to solve the problems of our customers. Before we get into the details of the first quarter, I thought I would provide an update on what we are seeing in the significant geographies that impact our performance around the world. Starting with North America, we are continuing to see acceleration in order activity in our earlier cycle fire business. We are also seeing a nice pickup in orders in security, with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 marking the highest install order quarter since separation. It is important to recognize that since separation our North American security business has undergone a significant transformation in strategy and execution. Given recent order activity in both fire and security, we expect our North America install and service business to be a larger contributor to growth in the second half of this year. Turning to Europe, we continue to expect a sluggish environment which continues to bounce along the bottom. Additionally, the added headwind related to the strengthening US dollar is and will continue to put pressure on our businesses. Given our significant restructuring actions over the years, as well as our sourcing and productivity initiatives, we feel well-positioned to continue to expand margins in a relatively low-growth environment. In Australia, we started to see some larger orders come through at the end of our fiscal year, which made us feel somewhat optimistic that we had hit the bottom and would start to see a bit of stabilization. However, the last few months have proven to be more challenging and we are now expecting a mid-single-digit decline in organic revenue for the year, with significant pressure on service revenue. Our team continues to stay close to the market and take actions required to maintain the fundamentals of the business despite the downturn. But in the meantime, this will have an impact on our rest of world install and services results. Turning to our growth markets, we continue to expect double-digit growth in 2015. What is critical in driving this performance is taking the success that we've had in our mature markets, including our depth and expertise, and localizing it so that we can deploy our products and services successfully within these markets. Our organic investments are enhanced by our M&A activity which helps accelerate our ability to develop a local footprint. A perfect example of this is the acquisition we completed this quarter in China, which I spoke to earlier. Let me give you a quick overview of our results for the quarter and Arun will focus on our results for each of our segments. Overall, I am pleased with our start to fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on our fourth-quarter earnings call, the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was a very strong quarter for us, driven by a stronger than normal retail season with a favorable mix. Organic growth of 2% was led by a phenomenal growth quarter in our product businesses which grew 10% organically. Segment operating margin expansion of 30 basis points was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, even after offsetting a 20 basis point headwind related to a labor matter. Earnings per share before special items of $0.49 was at the high end of our guidance and represents a 17% increase year over year. Overall, a solid start to the year. Now let me turn it over to Arun to go through the details of our performance. Arun Nayar : Thank you, George. And good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance starting with slide 5. Let me start with an overview of our results for the first quarter. Revenue of $2.48 billion declined 1% year over year. As George mentioned, organic revenue grew 2%, led by 10% growth in global products. Within our installation and service businesses, service revenue resumed growth in both North America and rest of world, for a total organic service growth of 1%. Installation revenue was relatively flat year-over-year. Acquisition growth of 1% was more than offset by a 4% headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Before special items segment operating income was $326 million, including an $11 million headwind related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the operating margin was 13.2%. Higher product revenues and the benefits from sourcing, productivity, and restructuring initiatives were partially offset by a legal charge resulting in net operating margin expansion of 30 basis points. Earnings per share before special items increased $0.07 or 17% year over year. Operationally, we delivered an incremental $0.04 of earnings, driven by strong revenue growth in products, along with continued productivity initiatives. The remaining $0.03 of incremental earnings was primarily driven by the benefit of share repurchases during the quarter, offset by $0.02 related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the $0.01 legal charge. Turning to orders, on slide 6, as I've often mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth, particularly in our installation business, is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Orders in the quarter grew 2% year-over-year, with 6% growth in North America and 7% growth in products. Rest of world declined 5% due to pressure in Australia, as well as a tough compare with the prior year. Backlog of $4.8 billion increased to 3% year-over-year and 2% on a quarter sequential basis. Now let's get into the details of each of the segments. Starting first with North America installation and services on slide 7. Revenue in the quarter of $951 million decreased 1% on a reported basis, driven by the weakening of the Canadian dollar. Organic growth was relatively muted in the first quarter as 1% growth in service was offset by a 1% decline in installation revenue. We expect organic growth to increase in the second quarter and accelerate from there in the second half of the year. Before special items operating income in the quarter was $131 million and the operating margin was 13.8%. Operating income included an incremental charge related to a labor wage claim which impacted the operating margin by 60 basis points. Despite unfavorable mix, and the incremental legal charge, the operating margin improved 30 basis points year-over-year, as the impact of these items was more than offset by productivity and restructuring benefits. Overall, orders grew 6% year-over-year in North America installation and services, with installation growth of 13%, driven by a few large orders in security and service growth of 1%. Total backlog of $2.5 billion grew 5% compared with the prior year and increased 1% on a quarter sequential basis. Turning to slide 8, rest of world installation and services revenue of $917 million decreased 6% year over year, driven by a 7% unfavorable impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Organic growth was relatively flat, with modest growth in both service and installation revenue. Acquisitions contributed 2% to revenue growth, which was partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Before special items operating income was $90 million and the operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 9.8%. The benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the mix of businesses contributing to growth, a lower percentage of high-margin service revenue, as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Turning to order activity in rest of world, total orders declined to 5% year-over-year. Service orders increased 3% and installation orders declined 12% compared to 16% install order growth in the prior year. Backlog of $2.1 billion increased 2%, both on a year-over-year and quarter sequential basis. Turning to global products on slide 9, revenue grew 8% in the quarter to $611 million. Organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by strong growth across all three platforms, led by security products and life safety. A 1% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was more than offset by a 3% decrease to revenue related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Before special items operating income was $105 million and the operating margin was 17.2%. The 130 basis point expansion in operating margin was driven by increased revenues, favorable mix, as well as the benefit of productivity and restructuring initiatives, product orders increased 7% year-over-year. Now let me touch on a few other items on slide 10. First, corporate expense before special items was $55 million for the quarter. We expect corporate expense in the second quarter to be at a similar level. Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.5% for the quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the second quarter to be in the range of 17% to 18%. As it relates to share count, we repurchased to 10 million shares for $417 million during the first quarter, resulting in a weighted average and quarter-end diluted share count of 427 million shares. Turning to foreign exchange on slide 11, the US dollar has continued to appreciate over the last several months, putting additional pressure on both the top and bottom line. From our November earnings call to now changes in foreign currency exchange rates have put an additional $0.09 of pressure on earnings per share, on top of the $0.07 of pressure we have previously forecasted. Our 2015 guidance now includes a $585 million headwind to revenue which equates to a $0.16 headwind to EPS related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Lastly, I would like to touch on the progress we have made on our restructuring and repositioning plans for this year. To date, we have taken restructuring and repositioning actions resulting in $75 million of charges, and we now expect to be closer to the $150 million estimate we had provided for the year. As these actions are largely related to workforce reductions, the benefits of these actions will be reflected in our results in the second half of this year. We continue to have a strong pipeline of projects that are being executed to simplify our structure and improve operations. Now let me turn things back over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to slide 12 for our earnings guidance for the second quarter starting with the top line. As we move into the second quarter we expect organic growth to accelerate from the 2% we saw this quarter to approximately 3%. Additionally, recent acquisition activity is expected to add an additional 1 point of revenue growth. Given current exchange rates, we expect growth in revenue to be offset by a 6 percentage point or $150 million year-over-year headwind related to changes in foreign currency. Taking these factors into account, we expect revenue in the second quarter to decline approximately 2% year over year on a reported basis. I also want to remind you that the second quarter of last year included a $21 million insurance recovery which was reported within our rest of world install and services segment. If you refer to slide 13, you can see that the insurance recovery benefited the rest of world operating margin by 220 basis points, and benefited total segment margin by 90 basis points. Additionally, this recovery contributed a $0.04 of earnings per share. Looking at the second quarter of fiscal 2015, on a normalized basis, we expect the segment operating margin before special items to expand 50 basis points to approximately 13.5%. Turning to slide 14, we expect operations in the second quarter to contribute approximately $0.05 of incremental earnings year-over-year. Additionally, our expected weighted average share count of 428 million shares in the second quarter is also expected to contribute an additional $0.05 of incremental earnings. This earnings growth is expected to be partially offset by the $0.04 benefit in the prior year related to the insurance recovery and a $0.03 headwind related to foreign currency exchange rates. Taking all of these assumptions into account, we expect earnings per share before special items in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.50, a 4% to 9% increase over the prior year. Compared to a normalized earnings per share of $0.42 in the prior year, this represents a 14% to 19% increase in earnings per share before special items. Moving to our expectations for the full year, on slide 15, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4%. However, adjusting for current exchange rates, and including recent acquisitions, we now expect revenue for the full year to be similar to last year on a reported basis. Additionally, we continue to expect the segment operating margin before special items to expand 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. While we continue to deliver a strong operating performance, the continued strengthening of the US dollar is putting additional pressure on our results. Our initial earnings per share before special items guidance for the full year of $2.35 to $2.45 has fully absorbed the expected $0.07 headwind related to changes in foreign currency with accelerated productivity and restructuring actions. Current exchange rates have resulted in an incremental $0.09 of foreign currency headwinds which we are able to partially offset with an expected $0.04 benefit from recent acquisitions and additional productivity. As a result, we are updating our full-year earnings per share before special items guidance to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, which represents a 16% to 21% increase year-over-year. Thanks for joining us on the conference call this morning. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Deane. George Oliver : Good morning, Deane. Arun Nayar : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : First question, just for George, right where you left off on the 2015 guidance update. And really appreciate all the detail you've given here on the currency exposures on slide 11. That's going to be a great reference. But my question is, on that $0.04 offset, the benefit of acquisitions and productivity, just give us a sense that I would hope you haven't burned all your contingency or potential upside for that offset there. But where else that might direct you to the higher end of your guidance, that $2.40, what has to work well and go in your favor to be at the high end? George Oliver : Deane, we've been working, when we provided the initial guidance back in November, we've been working on contingency because at that time we saw a lot of headwind coming at us from an FX standpoint. So, we've been accelerating our restructuring, accelerating some of the productivity initiatives that has given us some benefit in the second half of the year. Arun talked about it in his prepared remarks, that we accelerated some of the planned restructuring in the first quarter and we're going to see some benefits from that. We also have been executing very well on our growth strategy, continuing to execute not only organic growth but also working on the acquisitions. And the benefits now from the acquisitions that we've been able to complete, we now see $0.03 of benefit in the second half of the year. And so we're going to continue to work. As we laid out our plan, we get about $150 million of productivity on an annualized basis that supports the significant reinvestment in growth, while we're continuing to expand our margins 80 to 100 basis points. And I can assure you that we're continuing to work every opportunity to make sure that we'll be positioned to deliver on the updated guidance that we provided. Deane Dray : Thank you. And then for my follow-up, and this is for Arun, just as a follow-up on that slide 11, I'd be interested in hearing what types of hedging Tyco can or cannot do. I would presume for global products you've got some transactional hedging with forward contracts but not translational hedging? And then in your answer, maybe how does Tyco's foreign domicile structure play into here in terms of what hedging you can or can't do? And then just remind me, I believe your structure also -- you don't get faced with that cash repatriation issue, and just maybe give us that update as well? Arun Nayar : Deane, let me just talk start by saying that 75% of our business is install and service where our cost structure and the currency of our cost structure is the same as the currency in which we drive our revenues. So, there is a natural hedge in place there and there is no exposure from a currency perspective. The global products, as you rightly pointed out, is where we manufacture in a few locations and ship our products around the world in different currencies. And that's where we have the transactional exposure. And we do hedge that transactional exposure pretty close to 100% across the world in all the currencies. So, we have no de minimis P&L impact from that transactional exposure on our global products businesses. Now, the headwinds that you are seeing relate to translational exposure as we translate the earnings that we have in different currencies into the US dollar for reporting purposes. That translation exposure we do not hedge. If you were to do that, it would actually create an economic risk to the enterprise. Now, one benefit that we have, keep in mind, is our Irish domicile. As an Irish domicile company we have complete access to our cash across the world on a daily basis, unlike a US domicile company which would have to give it in the cash back. So, we do not have to worry about the repatriation of cash which the US domicile companies have to. Now also, just to keep on the subject of FX hedging and exposure, there are obviously other operational things that we take into account as we look at the exposure, the translationary [ph] exposure. Basically, I look at three things. One is pricing. And particularly in high inflation countries, we make sure that our pricing stays ahead of the inflation rate so that the fundamentals of the business remain intact. The second is our supply chain network. We have a very sophisticated supply chain network, led by a big leader in Andrea Greco, and he is constantly optimizing that supply chain to make sure that we are getting the benefits of the currency movements. And the third that George and I had referred to earlier is the cost rationalization. Clearly that's another lever. You saw us pull that lever pretty strongly in the first quarter ahead of the $0.07 headwind that we had initially expected. And that lever stays in place. Deane Dray : That was great color. Thank you. Arun Nayar : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Thanks a lot. In the rest of world installation and service business, I think excluding currency your EBIT was down around 5% year on year. Maybe just talk about how much of that was Australia. And also what you expect the full-year rest of world margins to do versus last year now? Thank you. Arun Nayar : Well, Julian, if you look at our year-on-year compare for rest of world, we had a $8 million headwind from foreign currency exchange rates. So, if you look at it, the $90 million that we reported for Q1, that adds up to $98 million, and that's a pretty comparable in dollar terms to what we had last year. As we think about our rest of world business, basically Europe, which is about 50% of rest of world, is, like George mentioned in his prepared remarks, pretty stable. And the fundamentals of the business, the margins are expanding in a very low-growth environment. Australia is where we are seeing deterioration, and a large part of what you see here is really driven by Australia. And the second piece is our growth markets, which is where the growth is coming from. So, growth markets are delivering the growth that we expected but, as you know, our growth markets, the service component in our growth markets is lower than the install component, and therefore the margins in the growth markets tend to be lower. And as they're growing, we expect the service platforms to build over a period of time. But in the meanwhile, it is creating a headwind in terms of the overall results we are seeing for rest of world. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Should the rest of world margins expand this year versus last year for the year as a whole? Arun Nayar : Given the deterioration that George referred to in the Australian market, we expect the rest of world margins to stay more or less flat to prior year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then my follow-up would be on the overall service business, I think you'd guided for 2% to 3% service sales growth this year Company-wide. I think first quarter was up about 1%. So, based on Australia, do you also think that global number of 2% to 3% for the year will be difficult to hit now? George Oliver : Yes. We've taken that into account. As we look at our service growth of the 2% to 3%, if you look at it sequentially we're down 2% in the fourth quarter, first quarter we're up 1%. It is absolutely core to our growth strategy. We're making lots of investment in technology, we're embedding that technology in new solutions. And then with that base, that's given us the opportunity to be able to build new services on top of that. And, so, in spite of the headwind in the first quarter we had 50 basis points of service growth headwind because of the Australian decline. Even with that, we are positioned to be able to deliver the 2% to 3% service growth. And that's also helped by some of the acquisitions that we've been able to be successful in completing. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Morning. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the nature of what's going on in Australia. And what I mean by that is, I think about sluggish economy I would think that would be hitting install harder than service. But clearly you are intimating or saying outright that it's really the service business that's taking a hit. So, what is actually causing that? Is there new competition? Is there some other change in competitive dynamics? George Oliver : Yes. Jeff, I'll take that one. It is a big market so let me just give you the fundamentals. About 17% of our rest of world is split somewhat equally between fire and security. The difference here is we've got about 70% service revenue. And, now, as we saw the decline in mining well over a year ago, and that started last year and continued through the year, we saw a continued decline in that space, which was a big vertical segment for us. And then with the impact that that has had on the economy, it's had a more broad-based impact on the other end markets that we support. Now, I thought in the latter part of last year we started to see some green shoots with some of the new projects coming to market that we've been successful in being able to win, but the continued downturn in the overall service segment has been what has hit us here early this year. Now, what I would say is that, when you get into this situation, we do have some undisciplined competitors. And what we do is make sure that we stay focused on how we create value in getting the return for the value that we create. And as we've gone through these cycles in the past, whether it be in Europe and other distressed markets, we come out the other end better, and positioned to be able to accelerate the growth with the investments we continue to make. And so we're seeing now, we're projecting that it's going to be down kind of mid to upper single digits here in Australia. But I can assure you that the work that we're doing locally, in maintaining the fundamentals and the investments we continue to make that will support that business longer-term, it'll be well-positioned to be able to deliver profitable growth. Jeff Sprague : And then kind of shifting gears maybe to the other side of the coin, the strength in North America, can you provide a little bit more color on anything that jumps out on vertical markets driving that? And maybe a little bit of elaboration on the transition to some strength now or more strength on the security side? George Oliver : Sure. As you've seen in our orders over the last three quarters, we've seen nice pickup in installation orders in North America. And it's been not just fire. It's been also across security. So, that has been what's been building the backlog and gives us tremendous confidence in being able to now generate the revenue in the second half of the year. When you look at what's driving it, some of the key verticals for us are the commercial space, the institutional space, healthcare, as well as retail. And it's been more broad-based across the end markets that we serve. We see the order rates continuing, which gives us a lot of confidence not only in delivering the revenue. The 3% organic growth in North America for the year, but also continuing to build the backlog that will position to continue to accelerate that growth as we go into 2016. Jeff Sprague : Is price positive in North America? George Oliver : We're very disciplined on price across all of what we do. And we're making sure that as we're building fundamentals that we continue to get price for the value that we create with the type of solutions that we deploy. Jeff Sprague : And then just finally, and I'll move on, on share repurchase, George or Arun, you've got $1 billion left. You're active on M&A but it sounds like near term the pipeline's partially exhausted anyhow. Should we expect you to do something in the neighborhood of $1 billion in 2015 utilizing the balance sheet a little bit? Arun Nayar : Jeff, the pipeline is by no means exhaustive. We are still looking at a very robust pipeline of M&A activity. You saw the three deals we closed already in Q2. There are others that are near the end point of that process of completing the due diligence, et cetera. So, we are looking at a few other transactions, Jeff. And like I've said in the past, as well, this remains our highest priority. We're going to allocate capital to that. You can see the benefits we're getting even in the back half of this year. But M&A can be lumpy and if these transactions don't come through, we will use the cash that we have to buy back. Now, keep in mind, Jeff, any buybacks that we do in the balance of the year is going to have very little impact on the share count because of the way the calculation works. Jeff Sprague : Yes. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Arun Nayar : Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : I was going to ask, at ROW what are your expectations now for backlog progression through the year and just orders by the various offerings, installation versus service? Was this just a tough compare period? But when you look forward does it get better? If you could just comment on what you are seeing. George Oliver : Yes, we're projecting to continue to build backlog in rest of world. We did have the tough compare from the first quarter of last year where we had 16% install growth and then this year we showed that it was down 12%. We're continuing to build backlog. It supports overall growth of roughly -- originally we said without the downturn in Australia we'd be 3% to 4% growth. We've got backlog that we're building that supports now getting to 2% to 3% organic growth. Arun Nayar : Yes. And also, Gautam, I'd just like to reinforce the fact that you saw the negative numbers for rest of world here for Q1. But in absolute dollars, our orders have actually increased from Q4 to Q1. So, sequentially, actually, if you look at it, rest of world install orders went up 6.5% and total orders went up 3%. Gautam Khanna : Okay. That's helpful. And you mentioned you're seeing some undisciplined competition in Australia and you're trying to stick to your own discipline. I just wondered, in that backlog build, are you anticipating any net price erosion or any erosion in the margin that's implied within that? Or should it continue to trend upwards this year? George Oliver : It starts with staying disciplined to the fundamentals that we've built across the enterprise. And this has been over a number of years. If you look at the work that we did in Europe, as an example, over the last five years, we have taken businesses that were low single-digit profitability. We've got now profitability in the teens. And a lot of that is making sure that we're focused on the right projects, we're pricing those projects accordingly, we're building an install base that then presents the opportunity to be able to accelerate services. When you look at our performance in Europe today, we're gaining share while we're continuing to grow in a tough economy, and expand margins. When we look at the fundamentals in Australia, we're going through a similar cycle, that as the market turns down and there's more pressure around the current business that we have, we stay disciplined in making sure that we create the most amount of value for the customer that we serve; and that through the cycle we come out in a position that we're going to be able to accelerate the progress going forward. And the backlog, the key thing to look at when you look at margin and backlog across the board, we continue to improve the margin backlog. And across the enterprise, we're up roughly 50 basis points year on year in spite of the current environment. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And one last one and I'll turn it over. At global products, you've had fairly substantial order growth and sales growth for a number of years now. If you look forward, are there any product transitions like we had last year with the Air-Paks or anything else that would slow that product growth or accelerate it as we move forward? Because we are obviously on tougher comps as we move forward. George Oliver : Gautam, so if you look at our performance in the quarter, what I would say is across the board our three product businesses are executing phenomenally. And even with the pickup of the volume in the life safety business and the Scott business, that only equates to 1% or 2% of the overall volume in the first quarter on the growth. So, across the board we're getting a nice growth and it's across every one of our product segments. And the investments that we continue to make, we're getting good traction with those investments, we're getting good pricing, which then in turn has given us good margins and good acceleration of growth. Gautam Khanna : So, cCould you quantify what you anticipate the organic to be in this segment through fiscal 2015? George Oliver : Yes, we're still projecting that we're going to be mid to upper single digits. We're off to a great start. Like I said, the investments we're making we're getting good traction. I think what we're going to see is we've been very successful also completing product acquisitions. With these product acquisitions, when you put these within our portfolio, leveraging our brands and our distribution, we get a natural lift in how we then get additional volume not only on the new product but also the existing product. And, so, we're very excited with the progress we made with acquisitions, what that will do to extend our footprint and extend our portfolio that we'll be able to leverage organically going forward. Gautam Khanna : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. George Oliver : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Scott Davis with Barclays Capital Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Morning, Scott. Arun Nayar : Morning, Scott. Scott Davis : The labor wage claim line item, the 60 basis points, was that expected? I don't recall seeing that before, to that magnitude. And I don't think you really fully answered Jeff's question earlier on whether you're actually getting price or not, because I would assume that there be some natural inflation that you'd have in your pricing that would help offset that labor on an annual basis. George Oliver : This was a legacy labor issue that went back past the previous couple of years that's been resolved. As far as pricing, we get on an annual basis about 0.5 points net price across the enterprise. We're seeing that accelerate within the current environment. And that'll be 0.5% to 1% over the year. We're very disciplined in making sure that we are getting the traction on the price, and very sensitive to what's happening with the volatility across the globe. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. And then the Tyco On, I don't think we've spent much time talking about -- I know you went through it a bit on the investor day, but what does it really mean for you guys and how do we measure it? What I'm asking is, does it mean better pricing, higher margin? Is there a way to measure take rates or is there some other way we can think about your penetration and how your customers are willing to pay more for this service? George Oliver : What it does, Scott, is we build enterprise software that can be embedded in all of the solutions that we deploy, that gives us tremendous opportunity to expand the type of service that we provide. And I'll use a couple of examples. In the retail space, with our TrueVue software, now with the enterprise software that we're deploying, the capabilities that we're creating, our new release with our store performance solution software is going to enable our TrueVue suite to operate mobile devices with our customers, at the retail customers. This will now enable them to improve productivity of their store personnel with that type of solution. It's the enablement of that that is creating additional service and then, with that, additional productivity for the customers that we serve. Another good example is ExacTech which we talked about. Not only does it enable us to be much more efficient with how we perform the service, but the capabilities that we create with the data that we extract, and then the analytics that we apply to that data, gives us a new service that we can offer to our customers to be able to grow the top line. And then on the integrated solutions, when you look at fire and security equipment that's deployed across any one of our customer base, the ability to be able to integrate that in an efficient manner, collecting data and then being able to again apply analytics, that it gives us additional services to offer, is what enables that. And, so, it's not a standalone product that you would see revenue on but it's supporting our ability to be able to accelerate the deployment of our technology and then build new services on that technology that will accelerate our growth. And that is why, when you look at our growth, when we project growth in service, we're in the early stages of deploying this technology, but the capability that it creates for us to be able to build new services is pretty significant longer term. Scott Davis : Okay. Sounds promising. Good luck, guys. I'll pass it on. George Oliver : Thanks. Arun Nayar : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. George Oliver : Morning, Nigel. Antonella Franzen : Morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yes, thanks. A couple things. Just want to clarify a couple details on the margin guides. You mentioned flat rest of world margins. Is that flat reported or is that flat ex the insurance recovery in 2Q 2014? Antonella Franzen : For the full year, it was intended to be for the full year it'll be flat as reported. Nigel Coe : Okay. So 50 bps ex the insurance comp. Antonella Franzen : Yes. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. And then you're talking about the margin expansion same as before but excluding the impact of acquisitions, which makes perfect sense. But what sort of impact do you expect from the acquisitions? Arun Nayar : What we talked about is the $0.03 of accretion for this year. And obviously, because it's partial year and there are purchase price accounting pieces that go into it, for the run rate we expect it to be more like, it will give us $0.10 to $0.12. Nigel Coe : $0.10 to $0.12. So, the impact to margins would be about 20 bps or so? Antonella Franzen : Yes, we'll clearly have some impact on the overall segment margin related to the amortization related to the step-up of intangibles on the stock. And we're currently going through all the valuations. But the biggest significance would be in global products because that's where a majority of the acquisitions are, including the largest one, IST. So, I mean, rough estimate it could have about a 50 basis point impact on margin there, really being driven by the non-cash amortization expense. Nigel Coe : Right. So 50 bps in products. Okay. That's really helpful. And then just want to go into next level detail on the service orders and the distinction between contractual and non-contractual services. Do we only see the orders for the non-contractual services? Antonella Franzen : The service order number is all in. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s all in. Antonella Franzen : Contractual as well as non-contractual. Nigel Coe : Okay. So, I'm wondering, what is the lag between installation growth and the service order growth, because I'm assuming that a good portion of these installations come with attached service? George Oliver : It varies, Nigel, depending on the type of installation that we perform, whether it be a security installation that requires monitoring. It's immediate, we get immediate traction. If it's a fire solution that we install, and then after a warranty period then we pick up a preventative maintenance agreement. It could be two years out. So it varies, it's hard to say. And, so, what we're obviously working to do is making sure that we can embed technology up front within the installations that we perform that then gives us the opportunity to be able to create more value right out of the gate with the customers that we serve. And, so, with the new technology that we've been developing, that's going to help us be able to pick up a higher percentage right after the immediate installation of the solution. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just a quick one on the acquisition pipeline. It's been really fertile and it sounds like there's a few more in the hopper. But what's changed? We've clearly seen a big pickup in activity. Are we seeing more active sellers? Are we seeing more associates [ph] to come to the table? Are you being more aggressive internally? Are we seeing bid off spreads narrowing? What's driving that pickup? George Oliver : So, when you look at our strategy, M&A has been a core part of our overall strategy since we launched the new Tyco. We've been very aggressive in building a pipeline. As you know it does take time to build that pipeline. And, so, over the last two-and-a-half years, a lot of what is coming to fruition now are things that we've been working on, in some cases, multiple years. So, as we are building the pipeline we're obviously in the current environment, we're playing offense. And we think that from a discipline standpoint we're staying disciplined. But these have been very strategic in expanding our technology, expanding our product portfolio, enhancing the services that we can offer, and then helping us accelerate the deployment of our footprint in the growth markets. And if you look at these eight that we completed so far this year, not only do we get a pick up in the second half but it positions us well to be able to deliver on the commitments that we had made in 2016 and then beyond. We're building that base and we're very pleased with the progress we've made. We've got a very robust pipeline. With our Irish domicile we use that as a position of strength and go on offense in making sure that we can get the returns that we need with these types of acquisitions. Nigel Coe : Okay, so it's more of a timing issue than anything fundamental in the market. George Oliver : Truly timing, Nigel. We've been very active. When we launched the new company as the industry leader, with the position that we have, we have a tremendous position to continue to consolidate and differentiate with technology. So, it's a combination of consolidate, and differentiate with technology that's positioning us to be able to accelerate growth. Nigel Coe : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan, UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: By the way, the earnings release and the slides are significantly improved and really helpful, so thanks for that. George Oliver : Thank you. Shannon O'Callaghan: On the North American install orders, obviously we've seen this sharp improvement. Arun, I think you mentioned there were a few large security orders in there, and obviously these things can be lumpy. But what do you think the underlying rate is if you adjust for some lumpiness in large orders? What do you think we are really running at there? Arun Nayar : I think, Shannon, the way I've talked about it in the past, as well, is a good metric is the backlog. We're saying that the backlog in North America increased 5% year over year. That is probably a best reflection of what the underlying growth is. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. That's great. And then just on the service growth, Australia obviously continues to be -- just when you thought it was down, it's down more. This 2% to 3% service in 2015, is that an organic number or is the Australia pressure offset by the acquisitions? George Oliver : Yes. We're still targeting 2% to 3% organic. Certainly as we get additional service capability from the acquisitions that helps us because we might not have the capabilities that we need in particular regions to be able to accelerate. We look at it combined but we're still targeting to be in that range from a service growth standpoint. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And the acquisitions will kick into your organic service growth the next year because you think they'll benefit your service. George Oliver : Right. It'll be more like next year. Short-term it could incrementally help us here offsetting some of the pressure that we're getting in Australia. But longer term it'll position us very well to be able to accelerate. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Antonella Franzen : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you The final question today is from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Thanks for fitting me in. I appreciate it. Good morning. Just to clarify again, the organic growth for the whole Company going from 2% to 3%, and then implied 5%-plus for the back half of the year, is that all North America? Or how much of that is North America versus the other two units? Antonella Franzen : North America we expect for the full year to be around the 3% range on an organic basis. Rest of world is around the 2% to 3%, and then products would be in the mid to high single digits. Steve Winoker : But the acceleration I'm talking about. Most of that sounds still like North America in products. Antonella Franzen : North America and rest of the world. Steve Winoker : Okay. George Oliver : Yes. When you look at North American we pick up, Steve, on the first half of the year it's relatively low on the system, and so it was actually down a bit in the first quarter. We pick it up in the second quarter and then it continues to accelerate in the third and fourth quarter. That's the big impact on the year to deliver on the 3%. Steve Winoker : Okay. And then if you think about that in terms of the service acceleration that you used to talk about, George, obviously Australia, we've talked about that a lot on the call, is a challenge. But more broadly speaking, are you actually seeing metrics showing traction and acceleration in the service business in pockets of the world that you think you are going to be able to extrapolate to a broader part of the business? What's your sense for that? George Oliver : Yes, when you look at service historically, it's a segment of the business that we've never had high growth. On the other hand, it hasn't decreased significantly. The investments that we have been focusing on, not only in our product business but now with the enterprise software, is what's going to change the profile longer term. If you look at the investments we're making, so when you look at the R&D increase year on year, it's up about 10%, or it's roughly $35 million, $40 million. There's a high mix of that investment that's building capability so that when we install a system we're going to be much better positioned to be able to create services on top of that system with the enterprise software. So, we don't get the traction, there's not an immediate pickup in short term, but longer term, with the systems that are being deployed, it gives us a much better base to be able to solve customer problems, create value in solving those problems, and then we ultimately get paid through service. The traditional service continues to track with GDP. The acceleration of service will come through the new offerings. Steve Winoker : Okay. And then just one last one, you've used the UK as a great example of cost saves and other, and customer service benefits, of integrating across the two businesses broadly, fire and security. And that's obviously -- and we're seeing the benefits much more broadly now in this margin expansion. But are there other examples that you could point to that we could understand that are showing that you're getting that kind of benefit elsewhere in the world now? George Oliver : Sure. I'll give you a couple of examples that are close to home here. If you go to the TIS business in North America, the security business, when you look at the last two years, separating the business from ADT, standing up a separate structure, and then improving margins, we've improved that business by over 400 basis points. And positioned now to be able to be very strategic in how we go to market and build the install base that allows us to be able to then build services. Another good example would be Canada. We have a new leader in Canada. We combined our fire business with our security business, put that together into one structure, and had significantly improved the margin rate as a result. And as a business, that is actually growing as fast as any of our businesses in North America as a result of the work that we've done. We've upgraded the leadership. We put in one structure. We've developed the competencies that are required. And now we are positioned to accelerate as a result Those are two good examples in North America and we have similar examples across the rest of the world. Steve Winoker : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks. That was helpful color. George Oliver : Thanks, Steve. Antonella Franzen : I'd like to pass it over to George for some closing comments. George Oliver : So, just to wrap up, I want to thank everyone again for joining our call this morning. I want to reiterate that we're off to a solid start in 2015. Despite the macro concerns, I've never felt better about how well we are positioned and how our leaders are executing on our fundamentals. This, along with our growth strategy, gives me confidence that we are well-positioned for long-term growth and continued strong returns for our shareholders. On that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

If you have any objections you may disconnect at this point. Now we\u2019ll turn the meeting over do your host, Vice President, Glen Ponczak. Sir, you may begin. Glen Ponczak : Thanks, Mitch [ph], and welcome everybody to the call to review Johnson Controls\u2019 2015 fiscal second quarter earnings. If you don\u2019t have a copy of the presentation, you can go to johnsoncontrols.com, click on the Investors link at the top of the page and then scroll down to the events calendar section. This morning, Chairman and CEO, Alex Molinaroli, will provide some perspective on the quarter, followed by Bruce McDonald, Executive Vice President and Vice Chairman for a review of the business results and then Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief, who will review the company\u2019s overall financial performance. Following those prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions, and we\u2019re scheduled to end at the top of the hour. Before I begin, I\u2019d like to refer you to our full forward-looking statement disclosure that\u2019s in the news release and also in the slide deck, and remind you that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Johnson Controls disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alex. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning, everyone. So I\u2019m pretty pleased to speak about the earnings today because I just see it as a continuation of the success that the team has been having over the past four to six quarters, particularly when we have all of the distractions going on. I\u2019ll go through some of the highlights, but you\u2019re going to get some details from the rest of the team. And one thing that I\u2019d like you to remind yourself of is as we continue down this path of transforming the company, we\u2019ve been able to meet or exceed the expectations that we set for ourselves, not only from a company perspective but across the board. Each one of our businesses really had a fantastic quarter. I\u2019ll give you the headlines then I\u2019ll move into some of the highlights and we\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce. At $9.2 billion of revenues it is down 3%, but if you take out currency we\u2019re up 4% for the quarter. And we\u2019ll talk about where that comes from in a few minutes, and how we see the outlook moving forward. One of the things and I\u2019ll go ahead and hit it early is that we\u2019re pretty pleased with order intake. That\u2019s going be a highlight of the conversation here today. When you look at Building Efficiency back in the summer we talked about the fact that we\u2019re seeing some potential for sales secured in this quarter. And it came through and it\u2019s coming through in a big way. So we\u2019re pretty pleased and it\u2019s happening in our institutional markets. Look at our segment income, up 18%. Once again, great improvement from a margin perspective across the board. A big part of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish in this time period along with changing our portfolio and mix of businesses is the margins that we have within our businesses. And the teams have responded and continue to respond at a very positive way. As $0.73 per share, up $0.20 versus last year. When Brian gets into the discontinued operations, and we\u2019ll help unpack some of that for you but I think if you look across the board, with the exception of currency, it\u2019s the one thing that none of us predicted. I think the things are happening pretty much as we expected. If you move to the next page, we start talking about what\u2019s happening in the businesses. I\u2019ll talk about each one of our businesses, some of the things we\u2019re seeing. The commercial orders in BE, I\u2019ll unpack that in a little bit. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have some questions later but what we saw is the institutional market. I wouldn\u2019t say its roaring back but what we\u2019re seeing is a significant improvement in order intake and in our pipeline. So later on when we have a chance to talk more about the pipelines we\u2019ll see that not only we had a good quarter but we think that it\u2019s sustainable at least over next couple quarters where we have visibility. In the Automotive production, North America continues to be strong. Europe, we we\u2019re uncertain. It\u2019s staying level. At 6% growth in China, you\u2019ll see later on that our sales are much higher than that. It has to do with our mix. It has to do with our share in China. And then I was really pleased to talk about our Battery business. We\u2019re enjoying strong OE growth but more importantly, the aftermarket seems to be stable. We\u2019ve gained share. And in Europe, what we\u2019ve seen is over a 30% increase in battery sales in the aftermarket. If you recall, last year was pretty rough year for us because of the mild winter. And we were concerned that maybe there was something structural that\u2019s changed but it looks like the battery market is back in Europe at least for us. And the team is seeing the benefits from that. I think that later on we may talk about it but we\u2019re also seeing our start-stop sales increase tremendously. With a 34% increase I think in the quarter. Of AGM batteries for start-stop. So we\u2019re bumping up against our capacity and we\u2019re adding more capacity as we speak. In fact, I\u2019ll talk about that when you get to slide five. I\u2019ll just jump to talking about batteries. Some of the things that\u2019s happening in our Battery business. As the start-stop power trains moved to China, we are expediting or pulling forward our AGM capacity installation in China. Along with our Slide battery capacities. So if you look at what\u2019s happening in China as it relates to our own capacity and I think we have this in our press release, what we\u2019re talking about moving from 12.5 million to 15.5 million units. And as we add the north plant that hopefully construction will be underway soon. AGM capacity increasing to 6.4 million. I think at this point we\u2019re a little less than 2 million units. And we do expect in our own conversation with our customers and orders that we\u2019re seeing that in China will be very similar patterns to what we\u2019re seeing in Europe, is that 40% of the new vehicles by 2020 will be start-stop. That bodes well for our business, and in the end it will bode well for our brand in the aftermarket. I\u2019ll jump back to the top of the page and talk about some of the strategic things that are going on. I certainly don\u2019t want this to be missed. We were very pleased with the outcome of the GWS transaction. CB Richard Ellis is going be a great fit for our GWS business and for us as we move forward for pull through business. But if you look at that total transaction, the 1.475 for the remaining part of GWS plus the 200 million that we got from Brookfield, at one point \u2013 a little bit less than $1.7 billion is a real home run for us. And based on the response from CB Richard Ellis and from our joint customers and from the marketplace, it\u2019s a home run for them also. Also pleased to announce that the SAIC joint venture around interiors with Yanfeng, we signed the agreement. I think there\u2019s a picture right here of us in Shanghai signing the agreement last month. And that is strategically one of the imperatives that we had over the last couple years that actually is happening at a pace that I\u2019m not even sure we anticipated it could happen so quickly if you go back in time. So we\u2019re pretty pleased with that. And then a couple new products that we have in place in BE, both in our commercial business and also \u2013 or our applied business, excuse me, around chillers, and our light commercial business for our UPG business that are launching now which will bode well particularly for this time of year. We expect to see some increased sales there. The Johnson Controls operating system, Brian will talk more about some of the benefits that we\u2019re seeing from that. It is something that we\u2019ve always been operationally capable and excellent, but I think we\u2019ll be able to take this to a new level. And where we\u2019re seeing the early benefits is in our manufacturing systems, our network optimization and our purchasing activities. Brian will talk about what we\u2019re seeing, but I would say those benefits we\u2019re pulling forward even quicker than I expected. And then I\u2019ve been very busy. If you look on the right, I\u2019ve had an opportunity on behalf of the company to receive a whole bunch of awards, whether it be with General Motors or Toyota, and then some of the recognition that we\u2019ve gotten as a company over the last quarter. So it\u2019s been a busy quarter, but it\u2019s been a great quarter. Our teams have really responded in a period of potential distraction. And I think as we go through the numbers, you\u2019ll see the details. It\u2019s pretty hard to find where our team has not, in any part of the business, has not really responded well. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce. Robert Bruce McDonald : Thanks Alex, and good morning, everyone. So I\u2019ll start on slide six with Building Efficiency. And I just remind folks that we have reported GWS in the discontinued operations, so I\u2019m going to talk about sort of Building Efficiency ex-GWS on this slide here. So overall we were pretty pleased with Building Efficiency\u2019s\u2019 results for the second quarter here. You can see sales of $2.4 billion were up about 4%. If we back out the impact of foreign exchange, sales grew by 9%. If you look at that geographically, North America revenues for us were up 17%, though that was primarily attributable to the ADT acquisition. Again, stripping out foreign exchange, we saw a little bit of growth in Europe, so it was up 1%. Our Middle East business was up 9%. Asia was flat, and Latin America was down about 18%. In terms of our backlog, you can see here at $4.6 billion was comparable to the prior year, again making the adjustment for FX and divestitures. In terms of geographically if you look at our backlog, North America was up about 3%. In the Middle East we saw a good strong growth up about 21%. Asia was flat, and we see still some downward trends in Europe which was down 6%, and Latin America which was down 16%. I think the most important number here on this page for us, because it really sort of speaks to the business on a go-forward basis, is really our order intake for the quarter. So if you just look at our Q2 orders, they are 2.5 billion and up 14% year-over-year. If you strip out FX and the impact of the ADT acquisition, our order intake was 8% higher. So that\u2019s quite a turnaround from the 4% reduction that we talked about on our last earnings call. Real pleased with North America in particular. There we saw our orders up on a consolidated basis were up 11%. And where we really saw the strong growth was in the education, the local, state and federal government markets. Those were the strong verticals for us. Outside of North America and again adjusting for foreign exchange, we were up 8% in Asia. 14% in the Middle East. And down 3% and 9% in Europe and Latin America respectively. And again even though we had a good strong order intake in the month, if we looked at our quoting activity, the pipelines, we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re sort of seeing here for the next couple quarters. Just turning to profitability. A great result here. You can see our earnings were up 36% to $173 million. And you can see our margin expansion pretty impressed at 170 point points to 7.3%. Here we\u2019re really seeing the benefit of improved results in North America, Europe and the Middle East as well as the beneficial impact of the ADT acquisition flowing through our numbers here. And also the benefit of some of the SG&A reductions that we announced in the fourth Q4 of last year. So good strong performance from Building Efficiency and we feel good about that. In terms of Power Solutions for the second quarter our sales were up 2%. And if you back out the impact of foreign exchange, they\u2019re up 8%. If you look at unit shipments overall we are up 7%, with the Americas up 2%, Asia up 10%, and Europe up 21%. Really driven by the aftermarket where in aggregate our European aftermarket business was up 30%. In terms of OE volumes we split it by OE and aftermarket. Our global volumes for OE were up 3%, aftermarket up 9%. So saw good strong growth in AGM, Alex referred to, up 34% to just over 2.6 million. As Alex mentioned in his remarks, we are adding nearly another five million units of AGM capacity in China. Really to capitalize on what is kind of a surge in recent demand from our OE customers. Turning to our profitability here, you\u2019ll see we\u2019re up 13% to 264 million. I guess we\u2019re benefiting primarily from higher volumes and an improved product mix as the profit of AGM sort of pulls through to the bottom line. And from a segment margin point of view, up 160 basis point points to 16.6%. In terms of Automotive on slide eight, strong results in the quarter. Sales again up about 1% if you adjust for foreign currency. And this is our business that\u2019s probably the most heavily impacted from a dollar perspective from the euro. If you look at our geographic exposure here where revenues in North America were down 5% versus the industry being up 2%. That\u2019s really due to some of the business that we I\u2019d say commercially walked away from. So we\u2019re seeing that rolling off against us. In Europe, our revenues were up 4%. Again, comparing favorably to industry production which was flat. And in China inclusive of our non-consolidated joint ventures our revenues were up 17% to 1.9 billion which is a substantial improvement versus the 6% production growth. Just looking ahead, on the revenue side, I think we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re seeing in auto. North America, the inventories are in good shape and our production schedules look good for the balance of the year. We\u2019ve been real encouraged with the recent improvement in vehicle registrations in Europe. Which really accelerated every month into the second quarter here and that\u2019s driving higher production schedules than we had thought here in the coming into our third quarter. Look at segment income overall we\u2019re up 90 basis points. And our profitability improved to 261 million, where here we\u2019re really benefiting from operational improvements. Primarily in our South America operations and in interiors which has really had a nice turnaround here. We\u2019re also seeing the benefits in Automotive primarily some of the Johnson Controls\u2019s operating system initiatives. And Brian will talk to those more in his comments. So before I turn it over to Brian I think sort of the takeaway from our business perspective is they\u2019re all performing exceedingly well. We feel good about some of our leading indicators, the BE orders and the beginnings of strength in the Automotive production in here and Europe. It\u2019s nice to see Power Solutions volume sort of back to normal. With that Brian I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Brian Stief : Okay, thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. On page nine as you saw in our press release, with the March 2015 announcement of the sale of our GWS business to CBRE as well as the closing of two GWS joint ventures to Brookfield, we will, beginning this quarter, start reporting GWS as a discontinued operation. And that requires all prior period financial statements to be restated or revised for comparative purposes. So my comments this morning will focus just on continuing operations financial results. So our Q2 as reported of $0.68 had two items in it that were nonrecurring in nature. There was $0.03 associated with a noncash tax charge in Japan, and there was $0.02 associated with transaction integration costs related to our portfolio activities, so an adjusted EPS for Q2 of $0.73. As I talk through our continuing operations financial results, these two items will be excluded. If you look at top line revenues, as Alex indicated, they\u2019re down 3% to $9.2 million, but the underlying revenues in Building Efficiencies are up due to the inclusion of ADT. And auto experience is down by \u2013 has lower revenues as the foreign exchange more than offset the stronger volumes that we saw in the quarter. If you take out foreign exchange, all three of our businesses report a very strong results in the top line, 4% across the board. Gross margin for the quarter of 17.1% was up 160 basis points from last year. And as Alex mentioned, we are starting to see the benefits of the Johnson Controls operating system initiatives as well as just some improved operational execution across the business. SG&A expenses are essentially flat versus last year, and I think we continue to do a really good job of controlling our overall cost structure. Equity income is up $9 million versus a year ago. And that continues to reflect the improved profitability primarily of our automotive joint ventures in China. So, on an overall basis, segment income margins were 7.6% in the quarter, which were up 130 basis points versus Q2 last year. And on a year-to-date basis, our segment income margins are up 110 basis points, so a very strong performance from an operational standpoint. On page 10, if you look at the net financing charges, they\u2019ve increased $13 million year over year. That $13 million is simply the higher debt levels that we took on in June of 2014 related to the financing of the ADT acquisition. Tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 were comparable at about 19%. So, on an overall basis, a very strong second quarter with diluted EPS of about $0.73 versus $0.61 a year ago, an increase of 20%. And if you assume total diluted earnings per share, which would include GWS in 2015, and GWS and electronics in 2014 that comes to $0.77 again a very strong year-over-year improvement of 17% compared to $0.66 last year. Going to page 11, as we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, we expected to substantially offset the foreign currency headwinds that we had, which were mainly the euro at 1.15 at the time, with lower commodity prices and the benefits of our Johnson Controls operating system initiatives. Our reprised guidance reflects these additional headwinds with the euro now at 1.05, but we still, if you look on an overall annual basis, will substantially offset the euro impact at 1.05 versus our plan which had it in at 1.30. So you\u2019ll see we adjusted downward a bit our guidance for the remainder of the year to reflect the euro at 1.05. A couple of things to mention that Alex referred to on Johnson Controls operating system initiatives, they\u2019re well underway. A couple high points that are noteworthy in the quarter, we now have about 60% of our global plants under the enterprise wide manufacturing system program that resulted in about $25 million of benefits to date in 2015. And we\u2019ve got targeted to have all of our 285 plants under this program by September 2015. Secondly we centralized our enterprise-wide indirect procurement function. To standardized process and better leverage our scale globally. And that will result in about $50 million of benefits in 2015. Those two items helped offset some of the FX headwinds I talked about earlier. So let me turn to revised guidance for Q3 and the full year. Our previous full year guidance was 355 to 370 which included the GWS business of about $0.20 a share. For the third quarter, our revised guidance from continuing ops is $0.90 to $0.92 which would be an increase of 14% to 16% from the $0.79 in the prior year quarter. And our full year guidance from continuing ops again with the euro, now forecast at 105, is 330 to 345 per share which would be up anywhere from 10% to 15% versus the $3 a share in fiscal \u201814. Going to page 12, whether you look at EPS on a continuing ops basis or on a total company-wide basis we\u2019re very pleased with our Q2 performance, versus prior year and consensus. And I would have to say that consensus is a bit messy with GWS but I think once we unpack that you\u2019ll see that year-over-year very strong performance. We\u2019ve provided on page 12 the numbers for 2014 and 2015 showing continuing ops and the impact of GWS for the prior year quarters and the first quarter. And then we\u2019ve also provided an appendix for the deck which really lays out detailed reconciliations of sales and segment income as well as the nonrecurring items. So that\u2019s a quick summary from a financial standpoint. With that Glen, we can open it up for questions. Glen Ponczak : Great thanks, Brian. Mitch, I guess we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Brian Johnson. Sir, your line is now open. Brian Arthur Johnson : Yes. Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Brian Arthur Johnson : I just want to ask a couple questions. One around autos in China and the second around segmentation within Building Efficiency. Look you grew China production significantly yet again. Can you give us some commentary coming back from Shanghai on the up contenting trend in China? How that\u2019s affecting your current Seating business, whether you\u2019re seeing it in the locals or the JV partners or both? And then also as we kind of roll forward assuming that up contenting continues to happen in interiors. How the transaction that you finalized but will close on shortly, by the way nice Twitter picture, with the cigars. [Indiscernible] kind of your exposure to the China interior segments or just JV partners up to there. Robert Bruce McDonald : Yeah, I\u2019ll take that one, Brian. It\u2019s Bruce here. I guess a couple comments. Kind of your underlying sort of question around the seating is really, help me understand how we\u2019re substantially sort of 3x times the market here. A couple things. So first of all, you\u2019re absolutely right that we\u2019re seeing particularly from the Chinese owned brands, I\u2019m moved to improve the quality of the interior. And that is driving I\u2019d say a shift in the market away from traditional local suppliers to our businesses. So that\u2019s number one. Secondly, if you look at the production data, what you\u2019re tending to see is the luxury segment and the SUV segments \u2013 our SUV in particular \u2013 gaining a lot of share and we have a lot more content there. Third, the western brands are taking share away from some of the Chinese owned brand and we\u2019re benefiting from that. And then we just continue to gain share really as on the back of the investments that we\u2019ve made in metals. So our metals business, I think we talked about when we made the two acquisitions, Hammerstein and Keiper, we were sort of in the low single digits. Right now I think our run rate\u2019s about 20%. And if you look at the backlog of business that we\u2019ve won, we feel pretty good about getting to that 30% to 35% target. So those would be the seating factors. Then your comment around the \u2013 your question around the interior side of things, again you sort of saw in our release we said on a 2015 basis, we\u2019re looking at revenues being around $8.5 billion, which is about a billion dollars more than we talked about last May when we announced this joint venture. There you\u2019re really seeing the impact of China growth and the C-class launch. Those would be the two factors there. And the same comment I made about quality of the interior and the luxury segment in the SUV apply equally to interiors. Brian Arthur Johnson : Right. So is it fair to simplify it by saying when you close the interior JV you\u2019ll actually have more exposure to the positive revenue trends in interior in China. Alex Molinaroli : Yes. Absolutely. Brian Arthur Johnson : Second question over in the BE land, so you talked about the order strength coming from institutional. How did small and mid-commercial North America do in the quarter? Where are you on ADTI cross selling? And what\u2019s the next steps there in terms of boosting your distribution? Alex Molinaroli : So I\u2019ll take that. Overall one of the things with ADTI, because it\u2019s more of a \u2013 it\u2019s a shorter cycle and it\u2019s more of a book-to-bill because of how we go to market there. What we really saw was revenue. So we don\u2019t have the same kind of pipeline information that we have for our company owned or our branch businesses. I would say that the business overall was flat, maybe a little bit soft versus a year ago. One of the things I\u2019m not sure of, remember when we made the transaction a year ago, I\u2019m not sure of when we look at the comps that things won\u2019t be leveled out until we get into the summer, because we were, right before we secured the transaction, and I think there was a lot of moving parts right before we closed the deal. But I think overall the market is \u2013 you remember those products aren\u2019t just mid to light commercial. They also serve the institutional market. I think overall we\u2019re seeing the market move up. I think our exposure in the commercial market is one that has been \u2013 we\u2019ve been underexposed, so we haven\u2019t benefited from it as much. But I think that part of the market is still clipping along. I think what\u2019s substantially different though is the institutional markets. We\u2019ve even seen when you talk about it, we even saw in health care we\u2019re seeing our pipeline increase, which is something we haven\u2019t been able to say, I can\u2019t remember when we we\u2019re able to say. That\u2019s been a lot of years. Brian Arthur Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Mike Wood. Sir, your line is now open. Mike Wood : Hi. Thank you. You mentioned the Building Efficiency in Asia was flat. Curious what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of orders. And is the Hitachi portfolio you\u2019re going to be acquiring that includes some of the energy efficiency products like VRF, is that a higher organic growth portfolio than your legacy BE portfolio there? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. So I\u2019ll take the second part for sure. I mean what you see in the growth rate of when look at the mix of products and technologies, two things. One Hitachi is well positioned in Asia, particularly in China. And that part of the market is definitely eating into what we would consider our \u2013 the core of our market, more of the ducted equipment that we would see in North America. So it\u2019s very fast growing at 2X of the rest of the marketplace. That\u2019s why it\u2019s strategically important for us. And our position is very strong. Not only Hitachi direct but through our partner. Hitachi, our joint venture there, has a partner called Hisense, which plays in the light goods appliance space, a very strong player. And those two go to market channels along with our Europe brand is how we\u2019ll leverage the VRF. But to answer your question, at least 2X for the rest of the traditional HVAC market that we\u2019re familiar with. Robert Bruce McDonald : And then Mike, this is Bruce. Your question about Asian orders, so in the quarter, our order intake in Asia was up 8%. Mike Wood : Great. And then also can you just give us an update in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the China aftermarket for Power Solutions just in terms of how that market is maturing and how your share is developing there? Alex Molinaroli : I think that this is the numbers. I think we\u2019re seeing around 10% growth, probably a little less than what we expected, we\u2019re signing up tremendous amount of distributors. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 most of our growth is still happening in the OE space. So I think that we have more opportunity there. Mike Wood : Thank you. Mike Wood : I\u2019m sorry, 10% right? Robert Bruce McDonald : Yes. Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Robert Barry. Sir, your line is now open. Robert Barry : Hey, guys. Good morning. Robert Bruce McDonald : Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Robert Barry : Yeah, it\u2019s still morning here. I wanted to ask about the margins in the Building business. It looks like they\u2019ve been tracking quite good. I think above what you guided back at the Analyst day. Maybe just comments on the sustainability of the levels that you\u2019ve seen there and what might be driving that? Robert Bruce McDonald : Yeah. This is Bruce here, Rob. A couple of things : I think our margin improvement at BE is front-end loaded. One issue we\u2019ve got is the ADT acquisition. It was in our fourth quarter number last year. Its margin was included as we talked about when we made that deal, so we kind of have nice comps in the first three quarters of the year. You also recall last year we talked about having some contract charges in the Middle East in the first half of the year. So those are behind us. And so again I think it\u2019s really a question of the comps that we\u2019ve got here are easier in the first half than in the back half of the year. Alex Molinaroli : And that being said I think one of the things that as we get our backlog, we\u2019re back to level. And we get our backlog stronger and stronger we\u2019ll start to get leverage off our fixed cost. Robert Bruce McDonald : Yeah. Alex Molinaroli : So I do think there\u2019s margin improvement but certainly the comps have not hurt us from. Robert Barry : Yeah. Alex Molinaroli : From a comparative standpoint. Robert Bruce McDonald : Yeah. Robert Barry : Fair enough. Maybe also to follow-up on that, a question about pricing. On the Ingersoll call they were talking about starting to see some pricing pressure in their Commercial HVAC business in Asia. This quarter it was Asia and also Latin America. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing on pricing in particular how you feel about the pricing as a backlog in Building? Alex Molinaroli : So I think our \u2013 I\u2019ll take that. I\u2019ll have to not listen to the call. I want to make sure I don\u2019t try to make a complete comparison. I\u2019m not sure of the reference, but I can tell you from our standpoint in our backlog that there has been pressure on pricing I think for at least 24 months. And that has to do with the fact that lack of institutional work out there. We have a big focus ourselves to try to get our backlog margins up. If you track that you\u2019d see they\u2019ve been under pressure for quite some time. It\u2019s not a new phenomenon. I haven\u2019t seen any new pressure. From our standpoint if the market picks up here I\u2019d expect to see our margins and our backlog go up over time. We haven\u2019t seen that yet. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any extraordinary pressure but I haven\u2019t seen any relief either. Robert Barry : Got you. And then maybe a quick one on housekeeping item on the guidance update. So it sounds like it\u2019s mostly changed due to the currency? I would think that Commodities would have also gotten better. Is it that the currency just got worse by a larger amount? Or what\u2019s the dynamic there? Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Let me let Brian answer the specifics. I think when we \u2013 I think we had a better understanding what Commodities were going do in the last call. And so we forward-project what we thought our Commodities benefit was going be. What we didn\u2019t have the view of is how much deterioration we\u2019d see in the currency particularly in the Euro. I think what you\u2019re probably seeing \u2013 Brian, correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2013 is that that gap has increased much more than any kind of Commodity positives that we\u2019ve seen. Brian Stief : Yeah. I think that\u2019s right. I think in Commodities we had a pretty good line of sight on for the rest of the year. I think when you look at the Euro our plan and original guidance, we had the Euro at 130. At the end of our first quarter call it was at 115 and I think now going down to 105. That\u2019s probably about $50 million to $60 million worth of headwind in the second half of the year that we just didn\u2019t have line of sight to. It\u2019s really \u2013 you\u2019re right it is primarily the FX piece. Robert Bruce McDonald : And Rob I would just remind you that we do try and hedge out some of our commodity exposure so we don\u2019t get sort of the immediate benefit whereas on FX we\u2019re talking translation here not transactional. So there\u2019s a bit of a lag. Robert Barry : Right, right. Fair enough. I think you did mention last quarter that Q2 was still going be a headwind then you\u2019d see more of the net benefit then the back half. Robert Bruce McDonald : Yes. Robert Barry : Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Patrick Archambault. Sir, your line is now open. Patrick Archambault : Hi. Yes. Can you hear me? Robert Bruce McDonald : Hi Pat, yeah. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Patrick Archambault : Just one housekeeping one. Just on the \u2013 I think on the backlog you said it was up that\u2019s, like, excluding currency right? Sorry the order book. Up 8% that\u2019s excluding currency. Can you just tell us what that is including the impact of currency? Just as we think about the revenue cadence and how that compares to last quarter. That\u2019s my first question, if I\u2019m thinking about that correctly. And then can you also remind us of the timing for quoting activity, then orders and backlog? I know you\u2019ve been through this before but I think it would just be helpful as the timing allows for these things to impact the P&L. Alex Molinaroli : Let me start on that. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll have all the data that you need but let me directionally give you the information that you need. If we need to follow-up we will. First off when we talk about these orders, it\u2019s driven by North America because the size of our North American Contracting business is much larger. So the good news there is there\u2019s not a lot in translation. You\u2019re not really talking about from a booking standpoint in the U.S. anyway a lot of translation. That\u2019s where we saw the strongest order intake. In this environment that\u2019s where we wanted it. And it relates to how long kind of the cycle. I\u2019ll kind of go through the whole process for you. If we look at our pipeline, we look at six-month rolling pipeline. When we talk about what we see before we book, it\u2019s about a six-month view. That\u2019s why we talked about, we have visibility to third quarter and fourth quarter bookings. Once we get a contract in place, you\u2019re really talking about a six-month before we really see a substantial movement of the backlog. So we\u2019re still from a standpoint of being able to translate the bookings that we got this quarter, we\u2019re not going to see significant revenue on those bookings, until probably sometime in the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s a bit of a lag. The good news coming out we lag but the bad news going in we lag also but it\u2019s about six months. Patrick Archambault : That\u2019s helpful. One other quickly, if I may. The margin improvement in Automotive was certainly very good once again. Can you just remind, how much of that, you pointed to a decent production number obviously in North America, and Europe\u2019s starting to flatten out which is good. How much of that is just better leverage? How much of that is some of the structural improvements that you guys have been making along the way? Robert Bruce McDonald : It\u2019s Bruce here, Pat. I mean when you just sort of look at, we sort of gave the information here by seating and interior. So seating was up 40 basis points and I guess that business I would say it would be leverage. Interiors were up, went up from about 2.9% up 260 basis points. There it\u2019s really reflecting a couple things. One it\u2019s the structural ranges that we\u2019ve made to restructure the business. And then secondly, and we talked about this sort of for the last few years is the C-class, the Mercedes C-class. The biggest order that we\u2019ve ever got. It\u2019s about $500 million or $600 million in revenue. It\u2019s rolling out globally. So that\u2019s sort of turning from being a pretty heavy investment that we\u2019re making in terms of launching that product globally to net now where it\u2019s kind of enjoying the benefits of it rolling into production. Alex Molinaroli : The only caveat I\u2019d bring to that is we are seeing year-on-year improvement in seating in South America. Robert Bruce McDonald : That\u2019s true. Patrick Archambault : And then just as we go forward, I mean on the leverage side for seating, to your point, the information or the registrations coming out of Europe and has been better. Is that an area where you\u2019d consider there to be a little bit of upside risk given, I can\u2019t remember what number you were using in you guidance for production but it feels like there\u2019s upside risk to what IHS has out there which I think is what you\u2019re using. Robert Bruce McDonald : Yeah, I think when we talked to auto team early this week, and I would say looking at what we see for Q3 as being up 4%, 5% from production point of view. So that\u2019s better than the numbers that we had quoted. I would say that\u2019s despite the fact obviously a place like Russia\u2019s turned out worse. So net-net it is a tailwind for us here in the next couple quarters. Patrick Archambault : All right, terrific. Thanks a lot, guys. Robert Bruce McDonald : Thanks, Pat. Alex Molinaroli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Sprague. Sir, your line is now open. Alex Molinaroli : Hi Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hi. Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Robert Bruce McDonald : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Just a couple ones. Just first back to the institutional verticals. Long overdue obviously and maybe it\u2019s just kind of the way the cycle plays and it\u2019s kind of their time so to speak but is there something in particular that you can put your finger on that\u2019s actually driving it whether it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, tax receipts or something that gives you some confidence that we can kind of build on beginning another turn? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah, so I don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re getting into political season here shortly. So I don\u2019t know that I have any confidence to talk about that. But what I can tell you is that we\u2019ve seen the reserves build up and certainly state and local governments. We\u2019ve seen infrastructure spending go in place. And we\u2019ve been talking about that for some time. And I think now we\u2019re starting to see people pull the trigger. We\u2019re seeing the same thing with K-12. So you have bond issues, people are working on existing schools and adding to their facilities. I think we\u2019ve talked about for some time. I think that I don\u2019t think this is going be a short lived cycle. I think that the absent something that\u2019s happened outside of my ability to predict. I think we\u2019re going be into kind of a slow cycle of improvement. What I\u2019m not sure about but I\u2019m encouraged by it is to see the healthcare pipeline is starting to increase and I don\u2019t know if I have an answer for why that is yet. But that\u2019s one encouraging thing that we haven\u2019t seen actually come through in orders but we\u2019re seeing in pipeline. Jeff Sprague : And this may be a little touch granular but I\u2019m just wondering, do you see any negative knock-on effects in some of the oil producing states kind of second derivative impact in the construction trends or anything there? Alex Molinaroli : It\u2019s kind of lost in the numbers to me. Because if you look at where those things are and the type of business that we\u2019re in, obviously there will be a knock-on effects of some infrastructure. We have not seen that yet. And to the extent we have, it\u2019s lost in places where it\u2019s not a significant part of our business. Jeff Sprague : And then just a quick one on cash flow. Off to kind of a slow start year-to-date. Is there anything in particular that we should think kind of swings the other way in the back half? Any change to your year view there? Brian Stief : Yeah. I mean cash flow\u2019s a bit of a soft spot for us. I will say that if you look at the second quarter, we did have some tax payments related to some audit settlements that was just short of $100 million. And then we also had some estimated tax payments in the current year that we didn\u2019t have last year as well. Some of them transactional related so I would say as we sit here today, we\u2019re probably about $250 million to $300 million behind where we\u2019d like to be. But half or so of that is related to tax items and the other half unfortunately is not one or two items that we can go attack. There are a number of items $10 million to $15 million here and there globally in trade working capital that we need to go after. So it\u2019s a priority for us in the second half. Jeff Sprague : I\u2019m sorry just on the tax items, is that simply timing within the year or is that a net headwind versus what you previously expected? Brian Stief : That would not be timing because it was an audit settlement payment that was not in our plan for fiscal 2015. And then the other item was actually an estimated tax payment that I mean some of that could be timing I guess with the second half. But I guess I wouldn\u2019t necessarily view it that way. Jeff Sprague : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sir Rich Kwas. Sir, your line is now open. Richard Kwas : Hi, good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Rich. Robert Bruce McDonald : Good morning. Richard Kwas : So post yesterday\u2019s announcement regarding Kathy, is Glen Ponczak the most important employee at Johnson Controls? Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s what we were thinking. Robert Bruce McDonald : Well, you know what, it\u2019s interesting that you say that. Ever since Kathy\u2019s been on the team, things are going a lot better. Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. Richard Kwas : Then I have my answer there? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. Richard Kwas : So Bruce, in terms of the hedging activity as we think \u2013 so there\u2019s going be benefit later in the fiscal year. How should we think about benefit in 2016 with the lag, if not much changes from here in terms of pricing? Robert Bruce McDonald : Well, I mean, it\u2019s hard to say, I guess. We tend to hedge copper really around the quotes that we\u2019ve got like a quote of hedge in our backlog. So that insulates us from short term volatility. So I don\u2019t know if that really saves us. Sort of depend on pricing I guess. But fuels come down. And I expect that we\u2019ll see an increase in benefit as I think expected to flow through to next year. So it\u2019s kind of a tough one but I do think if you look at kind of a commodity benefit that we\u2019re going to have here in the third and fourth quarter it\u2019s probably indicative of a run rate into 2016. Do you have a different view Brian? Brian Stief : No, I mean, our approach in hedging is really if you look at some of our key commodities we\u2019re hedging anywhere between 60% and 80% of that on an ongoing basis. So we aren\u2019t going to see a significant bottom line benefit as a result to some of the commodity prices going down. We\u2019ll see some benefit, but we\u2019ve kind of applied that range as far as a comfortable hedging position for us. Richard Kwas : So the opportunity is really on the structural improvements regarding the operating initiatives? Alex Molinaroli : Absolutely. Brian Stief : That\u2019s right, yeah. Richard Kwas : Okay. Just a follow-up on building efficiency orders in Asia. Could you give us a China number? You know UTC was reported the other day and was a little softer in terms of what they\u2019d seen in their quarter. Brian Stief : Yeah. Richard Kwas : So how would you characterize, what was the order rate in the quarter? And then what\u2019s the landscape right now as you see quoting activity over the balance? Robert Bruce McDonald : Yeah. I don\u2019t have that \u2013 I don\u2019t have China bulking so maybe Glen or Kathy [ph] can follow-up on that one. But I would \u2013 what I would tell you is, is the \u2013 our order intake in China in particular, we tend to be largest in the equipment side. It\u2019s very geared towards financing. And so we\u2019re right now kind of enjoying a little bit of a breather in terms of their loosening some of the financing requirements. And the reason it\u2019s volatile for financing rich is because most of our orders have a significant prepayment. Richard Kwas : Okay. So some... Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Richard Kwas : So that may be some of the reason that \u2013 may be could help you. Robert Bruce McDonald : Yeah. Alex Molinaroli : And Rich, I did see numbers more \u2013 it\u2019s more of a revenue number than a secured number, a backlog number. What I did see is that we\u2019re given much more growth in our lower tonnage equipment than our high tonnage equipment. The mix seems to be shifting at least right now. So that leads you to believe around infrastructure, in the pace of infrastructure changes, versus other types of construction. So we\u2019re seeing kind of a shift in mix here a little bit. Richard Kwas : Is that ultimately a little bit lower margin? Robert Bruce McDonald : No. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s lower margin. I think that overall it will be less lumpy. But I think what it is, is for us, it could be in some ways depending how we go to market, but I don\u2019t know I would say it\u2019s lower margin. I just think it\u2019s a significant shift which leads us to make sure that we have the right products. That\u2019s \u2013 when I look at it, it makes it even more important that we have products like we are getting with Hitachi because it\u2019s talking about the mix of the type of business that\u2019s actually growing in China. It goes back to one of the questions we had earlier. Richard Kwas : Right. Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Appreciate it. Robert Bruce McDonald : Okay. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. Brett Hoselton. Sir, your line is now open. Brett Hoselton : Good morning, gentlemen. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning, Brett. Brian Stief : Good morning. Brett Hoselton : I wanted to ask you just a kind of a macro Europe question. You comment on the call that you\u2019re seeing pretty good growth in OE light vehicle sales, and certainly the aftermarket battery business is doing very well. So it kind of seems to suggest that you\u2019re seeing signs of life at least in those two areas. I didn\u2019t necessarily hear any particularly positive commentary on the BE business out of Europe. So I guess I\u2019m kind of generally speaking wondering what are you seeing in terms of general recovery in Europe, and secondly how do we \u2013 how do you think that might translate to if at all your BE business? Alex Molinaroli : So this is Alex. I\u2019ll take that. I think what you look at, if you look at our overall numbers they\u2019re down in Europe. One of the things you have to look at. We have retrenched quite a bit in Europe in two ways. One is we got out of our commercial refrigeration business last year which was, it was 200 and something million dollars a year. So that business is out of our ongoing flow. The other thing is that we\u2019ve changed our go to market in some parts of Europe where we\u2019re not as much dependent on our branches. So we have less contracting work and more product mix. I think the market is probably the same. I mean, we\u2019re probably seeing that it\u2019s not any different than the rest of our businesses. Our participation in that has changed. Essentially because part of our strategy is to not overweight ourselves in Europe as it relates to exposure there. So we probably aren\u2019t the best parameters for how the market\u2019s growing because we\u2019ve actually restructured and sold some our businesses in Europe. Brett Hoselton : All right. Robert Bruce McDonald : Yeah. And maybe just to size that, if you, in BE we\u2019re about 2.3 billion, Europe\u2019s at 300 million of it. So it\u2019s not a significant piece. Brett Hoselton : Excellent. That answers my final question. Thank you very much gentlemen. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Ravi Shanker. Sir, your line is now open. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ve had a question on Europe, this time on the battery side. Alex, you said that the European Battery business is doing fairly well. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Ravi Shanker : Especially given the comp with weather. I\u2019m surprised to hear that because I believe Europe had a very warm winter this year, as well. And if you listen to some other aftermarket companies decide they seem to have had a pretty hard time dealing with that. So what made it different for you? Was it that the channel was already pretty empty just given last year and that was refilled? What explains you guys doing better than other aftermarket companies in Europe? Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s a good question, Ravi. I think that your observation or question is right on. Certainly the first quarter we benefited from the channel being in a different place this year than it was a year ago. I also think that batteries just won\u2019t last forever regardless of the weather is and the fact we\u2019ve had two mild winters, you had 12 more months of wear. The batteries eventually need to be replaced. I don\u2019t know there\u2019s anything structurally any different than in the past. We\u2019ve had a few wins but not the kind of wins that will drive that kind of market share growth. So the channel changes are definitely one and the second is I just think we\u2019ve had a delay and of one year and being able to replace batteries. The last part is it should make it more structurally sound is remember that Europe when it went down, it went down hard from OE perspective. Now we\u2019re starting to see the first time replacements of the vehicles that came out of after the recovery started. Ravi Shanker : Understood, and one more question for Bruce or Brian. Given the moving parts on GWS and FX and lead prices and everything, can you give us an updated revenue guidance number for full year 2015? Brian Stief : Yeah, we haven\u2019t updated revenue guidance, Ravi. Rule of thumb is every nickel on the euro is $300 million top line. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Alex Molinaroli : And Ravi, just to address, we probably should follow up and get more robust numbers but lead was a revenue headwind for us up to this point. And all of a sudden we\u2019re starting to see it recover, so I think that it\u2019s not going to, if it stays at the level it\u2019s at now, it\u2019s getting back toward our plan number and back toward last year. But we need to get some more robust numbers than what we have. Ravi Shanker : Sure. I\u2019ll follow up with Glen. Thank you so much. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks, Ravi. Operator, we\u2019ve got time for one more. Operator : Our last question comes from Ryan Brinkman. Sir, your line is now open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wondering if you could update how you\u2019re thinking about M&A? Obviously, you\u2019ve done Hitachi, yen thing, GWS electronics, home link, electronics. But are you now sort of more on hold with regard to strategic action or will you continue to be opportunistic here? And then remind us maybe the businesses, the types of businesses you\u2019d be interested in and which of your end markets? Alex Molinaroli : Sure. So I\u2019ll take that. And other two can feel free to jump in. So I think with where we are from the standpoint of this whole entire process, I think our initial portfolio actions, I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re coming to a close but we\u2019ve really gotten through a lot of the things we talked about a year and a half ago at a pretty good pace and I think our ability to execute on these initiatives has been outstanding. So I\u2019m pretty pleased with where we are. As it relates to moving forward, we do want to make sure we make some investments strategically, we are looking. But we want to make sure that we\u2019re smart about it. We do see adjacencies in both our end markets around our Buildings business and our Battery business that are interesting to us, and we want to make sure if we do something it gives us a platform for growth. And remember that from a regional perspective, what\u2019s most important to us is take advantage of the strong position we have North America and the strong position we have in China and Asia. So when we start thinking about our bias, our bias is our Buildings business, our Battery business, it\u2019s really infrastructure related and our bias is North America weighted North America weighted Asia so that we can make sure we can take advantage of our current position and growth expectations. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on pause. I think because of where we are and how we\u2019ve been able to execute and the ADTI integration is going \u2013 we can\u2019t really talk about that here. It\u2019s going as expected or better, and so I think our confidence is pretty high. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Appreciate it. Glen Ponczak : Thanks, everybody. Alex, any closing comments? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah, so I\u2019ll just build on that. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. We had an opportunity, actually in the last few days to meet with our new partner, CBRE, who will be providing services to us and we\u2019ll also be providing services to the commercial market through CBRE and Trammel Crow and their companies. I look \u2013 I feel fantastic about not only the transaction but strategically what CBRE\u2019s going to bring to the market with our GWS employees who are long-term employees that are quite frankly a lot of them are my friends. I\u2019ve been here 32 years and a lot of them have been too. And I feel great about that transaction. It\u2019s great for our customers. It\u2019s great for our shareholders. And it\u2019s great for our employees. I feel the same way about our Interiors business. We\u2019ve now moved from a business, and it looks like we\u2019re early movers. The business is starting to consolidate as we predicted. We couldn\u2019t have a better partner. The strong position that we have in China along with the footprint that we bring from a global perspective to the joint venture is fantastic, once again for our customers, no doubt for our shareholders and our employees are now in a part of a business that is going to invest and grow. So both of those things strategically have been important, and I just can\u2019t thank our employees enough. The ability to go through the amount of change that we\u2019ve gone through over the last year and a half and be able to meet the commitments that we\u2019ve made year-on-year, and you look at it business-by-business; confidence is continuing to build. And then lastly, our employees embracing the Johnson Controls operating system, and actually taking it on faster and more effectively than what I anticipated. I wouldn\u2019t trade the position we\u2019re in if I could go back a year and a half. And so I feel great about where we\u2019re at. I think the opportunities in front of us. I think the challenge for us is to make sure that we invest in the right platforms for growth. But our margins continue to improve, not only because of our portfolio actions but also because we\u2019re executing. So it was a great quarter. I want to thank employees and I appreciate the attention that you guys are paying with us. Glen Ponczak : Great. Thanks, Alex. Thanks everybody for calling. Kathy [ph] and I will be available for any follow-up for the balance of the day and whatever you need. Good luck with the rest of earnings season. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Johnson Controls disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation. And with that, I will turn it over to Alex. Alex Molinaroli : Alright. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by recognizing the fact that our employees, once again I feel like a broken record and it\u2019s fantastic to be able to say that our employees continue to deliver in an environment that externally has some mix markets and we will talk about that a bit, but probably more importantly for us through the significant amount of change that we are going through, our employees continue to deliver in each one of our businesses and I am particularly proud that our margins continue to improve lot of that from an perspective as we follow and implement our Johnson Controls operating system. So, if we are on the first slide there that I have, we will start to talk about the markets. In a minute, I am going to talk about China. But for the most part, the markets are participating in a way and improving in a way except for China that we have been able to take advantage of and it\u2019s good for us both in buildings market and in our automotive market and in our battery market. And I have a slide here in a second we will talk about China specifically, but if you take a look at where we are and what I am particularly proud of, our revenue and backlog, we will talk a minute about building efficiency. We are starting to see particularly the strength in our institutional markets. Over the last year, I think it was either a year ago or 9 months ago, we talked about the fact that we saw our pipelines improving and consistently we are seeing growth in our markets and now we are starting to capture those opportunities. And I am happy to say the second quarter in a row we have got 6% once you adjust for ADTI and just for FX a 6% improvement in our secured line and a 5% improvement in our backlog. I asked Glen to look and see when was the last time we could talk about our backlog improving and the last time we had an improvement like this was the third quarter of 2012. So, we finally have turned the corner here. The outlook for the next quarter also seemed strong as it relates to the secured business in the secured part of our income statement. And the reason I feel confident is that as we look at the institutional markets, where we mostly participate they seem to be healthy. And in fact what you will see is we have hired almost four dozen sales people in the last couple of months and we have got another four dozen, more to go in the next quarter. So, we are staffing up to capture the opportunities and it\u2019s a great opportunity and it\u2019s a great problem to have the fact that we need to staff up. We haven\u2019t been able to exercise that muscle for quite sometime. The other thing that we will talk a little bit about this is that the battery business continues to perform quite well are the OE and aftermarket demand continues to be strong globally. We have increased sales in China and our AGM business for the last quarter actually increased 47%. And so if you start looking at the strategies that we put in place many years ago, we are starting to see the market come to us even outside of Europe. We will have a slide here in a second about China and you can see what the opportunity is, but the Power Solutions business is really clicking on all cylinders right now and are very proud of what they are accomplishing. Also, the progress around our initiatives, the Yanfeng Interiors JV closed on July 2 and we will reconcile our numbers going forward. Brian will talk about that. The GWS sale is on track and we expect to close that here in the fourth quarter. And the Hitachi JV is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2016. So, all of the initiatives around portfolio are on track. And in fact I would say that looking back retrospectively we are doing as well or better than what I expected when we embarked on these initiatives. Let\u2019s talk about China a bit because there has been a lot of noise around China, specifically as the market is slowing down, there is no doubt about that. But I want to talk about how that\u2019s impacting our business and how we are performing. So, if you go to Slide 5, we will start with Power Solutions. What we see when you look at the Power Solutions business, because the market is not only an OE business, but we are going to be able to participate in the growing aftermarket business. We see a CAGR of 8% to 9% through 2020 even with the slowdown in the OE business, because the aftermarket was growing so rapidly. For us, because of the future growth in AGM, we even see the market expanding much quicker than that. And in fact if you once more look at this year-to-date, we have 9 times the sales that we did a year ago for AGM in the year and we continue to see that part of our business growing significantly. And in fact, you will see here we have got a huge order with another OE customer that we are putting capacity in place for. If you look at our aftermarket shift, it\u2019s 58% prior Q3 a year ago. And so you can see the capacity that we are putting in, in place. In fact, we recently announced I think in the last couple of weeks that we have located our plant for our third facility in Northern China in Shenyang and we continue to gain share in Power Solutions in China. Talking about gaining share if you move to Automotive Experience, one of the things that we feel good about is that not only our position in the market with around 40% market share in seating, but we have the right customers and we certainly participate with the right programs. And there is no doubt as it relates to our partners, we have extremely strong partners. So, even though that we do acknowledge the market slowing down, we have the right mix of customers and the right mix of programs. And in fact, one of the things that you need to make sure that you understand you look at our business is we are in the passenger car business. And if you look at the numbers that people talk about as far as the market slowing down, the path of the business has not hit as hard as the overall market, particularly in the truck and third-party van business. And in building efficiency, I am quite proud of what they have accomplished. Certainly, the market has been under some stress for quite some time. But if you look at our orders for Q3, our equipment business is up double-digit. Our controls business is up almost 50%. And we are growing an emerging service business, 16%. So, we are gaining share. This is in our York brand. And then when you see here on the slide I talked about VRF, Johnson Controls has a small position with our York branded VRF system, but this 10% also speaks to our future partner gaining a share of 10% in a very fast growing VRF market. So, our position in China is unique. I think that we are not immune to the market changing, but we are in a really good position. And all of our businesses are gaining share and really doing well based off of some of the activities that we put in place over the past few years. So, let\u2019s talk about the real news of the today. So, I want to congratulate Bruce McDonald. Bruce have been named to be the new Chairman and CEO of the Automotive Spin [ph] Company that we expect will be completely separated and spend 12 months from now plus or minus. We believe that based on the work plan that we have that we will be able to get that accomplished in fiscal year 2016. And my belief about this business is that it \u2013 we are already being one of the largest automotive companies in the world, but I would certainly believe it will be, if not the best, one of the best automotive suppliers because I think we already are in the world. And I think that and in fact Bruce and his team will be able to take this business to new heights. As we get more information we will continue to keep you updated. But I thought it was good for you, for our employees and for our ability to be able to move forward for us to bring some certainty around that. So we will \u2013 what we have to announce today is the path that were on. It doesn\u2019t preclude us being able to sell this business if it came up, but we are focused on making sure that we can control our own destiny and spend this business in fiscal year 2016. And I want to congratulate Bruce again, he is here and he is pretty interested in making sure that this works for us and for the remaining \u2013 the remaining Johnson Controls. So I will conclude my remarks. I will come back later and talk about the quarter. Pretty impressive numbers with FX adjusted we saw growth of 5%. You can see our earnings per share of 15%, our segment income up 14%, 19% if you FX adjust. And then as I have talked about earlier, 120 basis points of margin improvement and that\u2019s been a consistent theme that we have been able to talk about over the last couple of years. And I see no reason that we won\u2019t be able to continue to expand margins. So with that, I will turn it over to Bruce and we will talk about the business. Bruce McDonald : Alright. Thank you, Alex and thanks for the kind words. So let me start with Slide #8 on building efficiency. You can see, if you look at the numbers here we had a nice quarter. Sales were up 5%, $2.7 billion. I think it\u2019s important to really look at the FX adjusted number. Here we can see that without foreign exchange, our revenues were up 10%, so double-digit increase in underlying revenues. To look at that kind of by region, North America \u2013 our North American business up about 4% and we are finally starting to see higher demand in the institutional markets. So for the last probably six quarters to eight quarters, we have been talking about how the HVAC market we have seen the smaller end of the market, the residential side picking up. And I think what\u2019s exciting here and Alex alluded to the fact that we are adding resources, program management and sales force is that we are finally starting to see the long awaited recovery of the institutional market, I think that\u2019s pretty noteworthy. Elsewhere around the world, Middle East is up 18%, still pretty soft in Europe, about down 1% and Latin America not surprisingly continues to be a problem for us, it was down 10%. Orders for the quarter were up 9% if you take out foreign exchange and ADT, underlying orders were up 6% with really strong growth in local and state and federal government. Those were the vertical markets that really drove the growth in our orders in the quarter. Outside of North America, if we look at Asia, up 13%, the Middle East was up 11%, Europe down 1% and Latin America down 11%. Backlog is up about 5% at $4.7 billion if you adjust for foreign exchange. Regionally if you look at our backlog, North America was up 5%, Middle East was up 16%, Asia was up 9% with Latin America being down 19% and Europe being down 3%. So the Latin America and European we are not seeing any signs of recovery in those markets. But when you look at the overall total, North America key emerging markets for us, the strength is really stronger than the overall number. Turning to segment income, you can see for the quarter, we are at $272 million, up 3%. This includes \u2013 ADT was in part of last year\u2019s quarter. So this is the last quarter you will see ADT results in one quarter, not in the previous year. So that will clean itself up. Margins, real strong at 10%, that\u2019s for those of you that follow Johnson Controls from a time know that our target margins for building efficiency is to get them for the 10% level. They were down about 20 basis points versus last year, but that really reflects the fact that we have to bring on the resource in anticipation of an improving growth outlook. So a good strong quarter for BE and margins of 10% are something that we are really happy about. Turning to power solutions, sales were down 2%, again if you adjust for foreign exchange, here we are up about 6%. Led in the quarter really was an issue. It was pretty comparable from the top line perspective versus last year. Geographically our volumes were flattish in North America. Asia was up 8% and Europe really driven by the strength in the aftermarket. You know last year we said aftermarket demands have been somewhat constrained with channel destocking. If you just look at the year-over-year aftermarket growth in Europe, it was about 43%. And that\u2019s a poor comp last year, but also indicative of the fact we just continue to gain share in that market. Looking at it by OE versus aftermarket, OE was up 2% globally, aftermarket was up 7%. Alex touched on AGM in China early on, but if you look at overall, our AGM growth was accelerating. That\u2019s pretty exciting, because that\u2019s the product that\u2019s really driving a lot of our margin expansion, so that 47% in the quarter to nearly $2.9 million. We have really seen growth in all regions. And one other things that we are starting to see now is because we have got a little bit of capacity we are able to start building up our aftermarket AGM business both as replacement, lot of units in the market that need replacement right now, but we are seeing our customers interested in AGM as a premium replacement battery. So that\u2019s pretty exciting for us. In terms of segment income, a great quarter here, looking it without foreign exchange, up nearly 30% to $234 million, really seeing the benefit of strong operating performance, higher volume and improved product mix, so great quarter for the power solutions here. And lastly on Slide 10, we will flip you over to automotive. In terms of the auto business, it continues to deliver very strong results. In the quarter, again taking out exchange sales were up about 3%. And if you look at it geographically, we are down about 1% in North America against the industry being up 2% that kind of is the reflection of some of the new business that we were \u2013 or some business that we lost associated with some commercial issues, that just started to roll off against us. In Europe, on FX adjusted numbers our revenues were up 3% against the sort of flat production environment. In total Europe, but up 4% increase in Western Europe. And then in China, which we mostly do business by a non-consolidated joint ventures, you can see in the quarter our sales were up about 10% to $1.9 billion. In terms of the our interiors joint venture, Alex talked about it early on but that business closed on July 2 and as a result as \u2013 on a go forward basis, the business will be accounted for an equity affiliate, so you will see the earnings flowing through in our consolidated results, but about $1 million of sales per quarter will be de-consolidated. So when you start just to look at the auto numbers here, the revenue will be down for the next three quarters year-over-year as a result of the de-consolidation. Turning to segment income results, you can see our margins were up about 110 basis points to 6.5% versus 5% \u2013 or 110 basis points. If you look at interiors \u2013 that was seating, sorry seating was up 110 basis points to 6.5%. Looking at interiors you can see 5.8%, about 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. The turnaround in the interiors has been pretty breathtaking and kind of what you are seeing here is the benefit of us taking the restructuring actions in some of our loss making product lines and in some of our high cost country locations. So over the next 12 months we will be winding down the bits and pieces of interiors that did not get contributed to our joint venture. And you will start to see the strong results and the growth that we will see coming through from our global interiors business with Yanfeng. So, with that, I will turn it over to Brian. Brian Stief : Okay, thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, our results from continuing operation included $26 million worth of transaction integration cost associated with the number of portfolio activities that we have going on and then also included a non-recurring tax charge of roughly $75 million related to some tax plan done in connection with the Interiors JV which closed on July 2. These items resulted in net charges in aggregate of $0.15 in the quarter. As I talk through the financials, I will exclude the impact of these items in my comments. And in addition, you recall that our results from continuing operations will exclude GWS as we continue to report that as a discontinued operation. Overall, third quarter revenues were down 2% at $9.6 billion with higher revenues from Building Efficiency related primarily to the ADT acquisition offset by lower revenues in Power Solutions and auto. But as Bruce and Alex mentioned, each of our three businesses were impacted negatively by FX in the quarter, primarily the euro. If you exclude FX, our revenues in the quarter were up 5% and that\u2019s across all businesses showing year-over-year solid increases ranging from 3% to 10%. If you look at gross profit for the quarter, it was 17.8%, which was up 170 basis points from the prior year. And that\u2019s really due to improved product mix and the ongoing benefits we are seeing from the implementation of the Johnson Controls Operating System. SG&A is up 2% year-over-year that relates primarily to building efficiency where we have got the ADT, SG&A in this quarter and it wouldn\u2019t have been in the prior year quarter. And as well we have added the sales personnel in North America that both Alex and Bruce referred to, to capture market growth opportunities. So overall, when you look at our SG&A line, our JCOS benefit some cost control efforts are really in line, if not exceeding our expectations. Equity income of $91 million was 3% higher than last year just a general reflection of improved profitability across most of our JVs. And overall, third quarter segment income was up 14% if you back or adjust for FX, it\u2019s up 19%. And segment income margins of 8.8% or 120 basis points better than last year\u2019s 7.6%. So, turning to Slide 12, net financing charges of $75 million, or $8 million higher than the prior year. That simply reflects the financing cost associated with the ADT acquisition in June of 2014 as well as our ongoing share repurchase program. As far as our tax rate in 2015 and 2014, the underlying rate from continuing operations approximates 19% in both quarters. Income attributable to non-controlling interest is up $12 million and again that just reflects the improved profitability of our Power Solutions and Automotive consolidated joint ventures. So, overall a very strong third quarter across all of our businesses, diluted EPS at $0.91, a 15% improvement versus the $0.79 a year ago. So, turning to Slide 13, I would like to spend just a few minutes reviewing our balance sheet and cash flow position as well as providing some guidance for Q4. If you look at our Q3 free cash flow of approximately $400 million, that\u2019s slightly behind plan and the prior year. However, this is due to one item, which was $170 million dividend that we expected to receive in Q3 from one of our unconsolidated automotive joint ventures and that\u2019s not lined up to receive that in Q4. So, it was simply timing. As far as year-to-date capital spending, $820 million is in line with our expectations. And based upon current forecast, I think we will be slightly below our CapEx plan of $1.3 billion for the year. As everyone knows we embarked on a 3-year $1.2 billion per year share buyback program beginning in fiscal \u201814. Through Q3, we have now executed on $1 billion of our fiscal \u201815 plan of $1.2 billion. Trade working capital as a percentage of sales continues to improve and that\u2019s down 110 basis points year-over-year and this continues to be an area of focus and I think an opportunity for us as we move forward. Net debt to cap is 40.7% at the end of the third quarter. And given our free cash flow and divestiture proceeds in Q4, we expect that percentage to be in the low to mid 30s by the end of the fiscal year. So, as we look into Q4, we expect to receive about $1.3 billion in net proceeds from the sale of the GWS business to CBRE and we continue to target approximately $1.5 billion in free cash flow for the full fiscal year. As far as our Q4 guidance, the range is now $1 to $1.3, which will result in $3.38 to $3.41 for the full year, excluding transaction and integration costs and any other non-recurring items. And our Q4 guidance now assumes the euro is at 110 versus the 105 we assumed in previous guidance, that benefit is going to be substantially offset by some increased commodity prices and some other currency exposures that we see in Q4. So, in summary, we are very pleased with the Q3 results. We have seen strong performance across each of our businesses and we continue to meet our financial commitments even during a period of significant portfolio change and a number of internal initiatives. Building efficiencies year-over-year improvement in orders secured is a very positive sign and we continue to see the strength in the North America institutional market. As Alex mentioned backlog at $4.7 billion, an increase of 5% is the first time that we have seen that since Q3 of 2012. Year-over-year segment margin improvement of 120 basis points reflects our commitment to reduce cost and the implementation of the Johnson Controls Operating System. And I think we have talked about the portfolio changes that we are making, all of those we have now got really line of sight to complete within calendar year 2016. So with that, Glen, we can open up for questions. Glen Ponczak : Actually, we are ready to take some questions. I would ask everyone to limit their questions to your best and follow-up. And if you got other things to ask, please get back in the queue, so we give more people an opportunity to participate. Ashley? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Emmanuel Rosner. Sir, your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good morning everybody. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Emmanuel. Emmanuel Rosner : So many things to talk about. Let\u2019s maybe start with the spin-off decision. I was a little bit surprised to see such a rapid decision just over a month after you sort of announced that you were exploring strategic options. Can you maybe talk to us about the decision process maybe the rationale to spin-off the business as opposed to maybe selling it? And you see it back from your automaker customer so far. Alex Molinaroli : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So, actually it was not too tough a decision. If you think about the size of that business and the natural buyers of that business, we have the opportunity to spin the last bit speaking to those potential buyers and understanding what the real opportunity is. And it came very clear to us that we needed to make sure that we focused on the spin. And just like I said in my comments, it\u2019s possible you could still sell, but we need to provide the same amount of work in order to make the spin decision. And I think our customers also needed to have some certainty about what it is that we were going to do, particularly our Chinese customers, because as you know we have many partnerships in China and uncertainty is just not a good thing. So, I think for us and our employees and for our customers and our partners in China, it made sense for us to make this decision. And quite frankly because of the resources that we have on our GWS transaction, our JV with Yanfeng, we have the resources right now to transfer on to this project right now and so it just made sense. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that\u2019s clear. And just switching gear quickly, I wanted to ask you about building efficiency services, in particular, I was a little bit surprised to see your service revenues which are now ex-GWS down quite significantly year-over-year. I think you have been running at $900 plus million a quarter for the past. So far this year as well as last year the same quarter and now this fell sort of like to the $700 million type of range. And so I was curious what maybe happening in services ex-GWS and also why your margins overall down year-over-year, a little bit despite revenue growth? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. So, I will need to look at the numbers on service. Without having \u2013 without getting to some of the specifics, it could be some of our services. We went through a process with GWS as we went through the disposition to decide what part of our service business belong with GWS and what part of it with building efficiency as there is nothing underlying this exchange. So, we will follow up on that, but my guess is it has something to do with how we parsed out what meant the GWS and what stayed with the buildings business. But I will validate that. Nothing \u2013 just rest assured, nothing has really radically happened differently around our service business. And in fact what I would tell you is our service business particularly is driven by North America. The margins are up. Our renewal rates are up. And so I don\u2019t think we have any deterioration of that business. I think as it relates to the overall margins of the business and I think you are talking about a year-on-year basis, Brian went through some of the specifics, but one of the things and I did signal this last quarter is that we were going to be staffing up in advance of the growth of the market. And then quite frankly, I will be honest with you not that I would like to see the margins under pressure, but we are having a hard time hiring at the pace that we need to hire in order to capitalize on the opportunities for next year. So, I do expect that we will be hiring in anticipation of the market, because you remember, our business which might be different than some of our competitors, most of our sales go through brands or company-owned operations, so that SG&A cost hits us immediately. Emmanuel Rosner : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan. Your line is open. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Colin. Colin Langan : Great, thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to get some color on the joint ventures in Auto Experience in China. Can you give us any color on the size of the EBIT margin for those joint ventures, if there is any cash stuck in those joint ventures, do you know what their balance sheet look like? And all we really have is the net income. Alex Molinaroli : So, this goes really good. I am going to turn this over to Bruce. Bruce McDonald : Yes. As we have gone through this process, I think one of the things that sort of become apparent from a valuation perspective is we are not doing a good job giving the analyst community a lot of color around our Chinese joint ventures. And from a valuation perspective, we are probably not getting the full valuation there, but I can tell you that I would think for \u2013 I am not so sure we can pull together from the next quarter, but definitely by the time we put together our analyst presentation here in the December timeframe, we will provide a lot more clarity there. They are accretive to overall automotive and otherwise the business, the joint ventures of higher margins, not in our base business. But generally speaking, if joint ventures have any debt, it\u2019s nominal, but net-net there is a significant cash balance in the JV. It\u2019s probably in the $700 million to $1 billion range. Colin Langan : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And any color on the cost savings program that was announced with any opportunity there to get margins to your targets a little bit faster? Alex Molinaroli : Color on the cost reduction activity initiative? Bruce McDonald : So, I think as it relates to the Johnson Controls Operating System, I think in the last call we mentioned that we were going to get about $50 million of run-rate benefit in fiscal \u201815 and there would also be another $125 million in run-rate benefit in 2016. And in addition to that, we announced in the press release and maybe this is also what you are referring to that we were going to be looking at really a cost savings review here in the fourth quarter. And those activities are really being done in conjunction with looking at the separation of auto and standing up both those companies as separate public companies and to see whether there is some operating model changes or cost savings that can come out of that process. So, that\u2019s something that we will look at beginning immediately and will probably take place and take action on throughout the next 12 months or so. Alex Molinaroli : Yes, we are bringing more information to you about that. This is Alex. I am sure you are referring to what was in the press release. As we go through separation process, it\u2019s going to be clear that we need to take the opportunity in advantage of not only setting up a new automotive company with the proper operating systems and cost structure, but we need to do the same thing for remaining Johnson Controls. And so that\u2019s what you are referring to. We don\u2019t have anymore information on that, but you can expect to hear more. Colin Langan : Okay, alright. Thank you very much. Alex Molinaroli : Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Robert Barry. Sir, your line is open. Robert Barry : Hey, guys. Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Bruce McDonald : Good morning. Robert Barry : Hey, Bruce congrats on the new role. Quick actually housekeeping item, could you give us or maybe I missed the North America orders in BE? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, I think that \u2013 North American orders in BE up 8%. Bruce McDonald : 8%. Robert Barry : Got it. Thank you. And then also I had a quick follow-up on the spin, I know it\u2019s still early, but just your thoughts on the anticipated balance sheet at auto and whether the plan is contemplating any kind of dividend back to JCI? Alex Molinaroli : There will be a dividend back to JCI. We are still working through what the proper leverage is, but you can expect that we will make sure that the automotive business is in a position to compete. So, it would be similar to its peers. Robert Barry : Got it. And then just given how much advancement you have made in some of the portfolio initiatives, I guess I would expect M&A to start to become a larger part of the story you have alluded to that in some of the comments. Maybe just provide an update on what the M&A pipeline looks like and in particular the size of some of the deals in there and what the timing is on when we might see something of size in BE or Power? Bruce McDonald : Yes, so that\u2019s a great question. And I don\u2019t think that we can answer it to fulfill you. But I can tell you that as busy as we are on the things that we are talking about as we are just as busy and the things that we are not able to talk about, but we are looking at deals that will complement us from a product standpoint will help us geographically and shore up some of the technical product challenges that we have. So, we have plenty in the pipeline. And I would say, they span the gamut from being bolt on to being things that are transformational. Robert Barry : Got it. And then maybe just one last housekeeping item, what\u2019s the net impact that you expect from the interiors kind of income going out of the P&L versus picking up the 30% ownership in the JV? Is that relatively neutral or is\u2026 Alex Molinaroli : It\u2019s neutral. Bruce McDonald : The equity, 30% of the JV is pretty close to 100% of the remaining parts. Alex Molinaroli : Yes, I think the difference is going to be as we move forward and we pick up the joint ventures income on an equity basis, you end up where you pick that up on an after-tax basis. So, there is going to be essentially a flip between segment income and our tax rate as it relates to how we look at the Interiors joint venture income. Robert Barry : Okay, thank you. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Josh Pokrzywinski. Sir, your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, guys. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, just on some of the comments you made on moving the staff up in BE and I guess that\u2019s pressuring the margins in the short-term. But how long should we think of the staffing drag weighing on the margin expansion? And then given that you are seeing budding strength, particularly in North American institutional where you have always had a big presence. How should we think about the leverage on the North American institutional web recovery, maybe X some of these staffing up periods, but more ongoing as we get into late \u201815 or I guess late calendar \u201915, \u201816 and beyond? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. So, I think that as I said we have some variable cost, because of the sales staffing and it\u2019s going to be in advance. I think without being able to put numbers on that, I don\u2019t have a calculator in front of me, but what I would say is over the next [Technical Difficulty] is going to be a little bit of a catch-up, so make sure they catch up to the marketplace. And then we should see, because remember we are selling and then our backlog is about a 6 month \u2013 it\u2019s about a 6-month backlog before we usually start to see the income from that. So that\u2019s when you will start to see the leverage and we won\u2019t be seeing the sales \u2013 the sales headcount as just a cost, we will be seeing that as. We will start seeing the earnings from that. I don\u2019t know that I have that exact leverage in front of you but you can expect some margin expansion. Today we are seeing the margin expansion based on the back of our cost profile. We should start seeing some margin expansion based off of our top line. Bruce McDonald : Yes maybe add a bit to that. I mean we have already sort of talked about those who have been around for a while that our margin improvement trajectory in building efficiency being sort of 50 or 60 basis points a year and over the last couple of years, we have seen growth a lot stronger than that which we attributed to the fact that in a normal business environment, we have to add project managers, people that can do the work on an installation business. And so in weak times, we saw margins growing a lot quicker than that that, that 50 basis points to 60 basis points was a result of some of the improvement activities that we are doing. And here for the next couple of quarters, you are going to see a little bit of lower than that because of the sort of headwind that we have which is absolutely necessary to grow the installation business. So we can\u2019t grow the installation business without putting the resource and training them in advance. Josh Pokrzywinski : Those two more quarters of that or how should we think about how long this? Alex Molinaroli : So the way that I would think about it is, look at hopefully continuing adding sales resources, but it\u2019s going to take us a couple of quarters to take advantage of the backlog we just put in place. And two quarters the backlog that you just see, the 5% up backlog, is when we will start to see that flow through. And that\u2019s when we will see that at least the effect of the initial hiring behind us and we should see it more of an ongoing hiring as revenues continue to grow. So I think we have got a couple of quarters before we see the real benefit of the sales people that were put in place today. We should see in the backlog but we won\u2019t see in the income statement. Bruce McDonald : I don\u2019t think what we will see it in the next few quarters. We are going to see margin contraction. That\u2019s not the takeaway here. The takeaway is we are doing a lot of things to grow our margins in all the three of our businesses that we expect to continue. This is a little bit of the headwind against that. Alex Molinaroli : Yes, two quarters out from now then we should be able to attribute our margin improvement not just from our operating efficiencies but also because of the fact we will have some volumes, right. Josh Pokrzywinski : Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Johnny Wright. Sir your line is open. Johnny Wright : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Alex just looking at the slide you gave on China is very helpful and sort of putting out the color longer term actually maybe just talk a little bit about what you are seeing right now in China, next couple of quarters and how you are going to see the auto demand playing out over the second half of the calendar year? Alex Molinaroli : I think what we see talking to our customers, remember we are talking about passenger vehicles, is that we see the market is going to be growing out about a 6% clip. And we continue to see that and remember for us because we have got some of the right customer some of the right program and we are gaining share in metals, we should be able to continue to outpace that. Bruce McDonald : So I was in China last week and so maybe I will just add a bit more stories from Ground Zero there. If you look at the passenger curve looks for 2016, so for our next fiscal year, I just anticipate that being in about the 6% range. If you look at our business mix and by that, I mean we tend to be very strong in the premium brands. We don\u2019t have stronger share in the Chinese loan brands or with the Japanese that are doing well in the market. Our production volume based on that 6% for 2016 we anticipate being up 8% to 9%. And then like Alex said, on top of that, we still have some incremental programs, market share wins and the penetration of our metals business. So we still \u2013 we feel like with the industry work is now we are well positioned to continue to drive double-digit growth for 2016. Johnny Wright : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on free cash flow, I know we are taking $1.5 billion for \u201815, but given the CapEx now $100 million to $150 million low than you originally expected, what are kind of the puts and takes in the operating cash flow lines versus your original expectations for the\u2026? Alex Molinaroli : So, I think the $1.5 billion is still our target for the year in order to get to that target we are going to have to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter of roughly about $1.4 billion. We have got plans to do that I would say there are some opportunities that we still have in the trade working capital area and also be benefited by the dividend that I mentioned earlier that did not come in Q3 but will come in Q4. So we are going to be pretty close to that $1.5 billion number I wouldn\u2019t expect any significant movement either up or down from that number. Johnny Wright : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Johnson. Sir your line is open. Brian Johnson : Yes, good morning. Want to talk a bit about BE in China. You posted some fairly healthy order numbers A couple of things, when would those come through? Is there anything difference around the conversion and backlog in revenue? Just second, given the slowdown in the China economy, where is that coming from? Are there segments of the Chinese institutional market that you are better exposed, are you gaining share in the segments that you are in and just how you are able to get that order pace? Alex Molinaroli : I don\u2019t know that I would call it episodic, but the fact that we are able to see it across our equipment business and our controls business and our service business I think it has a lot to do with some of the operating models and the changes that we are making as it relates to how we are going to market in some of the cities that are Tier 2 while we have been focused in Tier 1 cities. I don\u2019t know that our backlog is much different in the rest of the world than it does in North America. And the reason is because we are selling the same products. I am hopeful and I believe that, that will change over time. It will be a lot more rapid as you bring on Hitachi product line since you remember that\u2019s a different product and a light commercial product line, and that market is actually going quicker. So I don\u2019t know that I will be able to be a whole lot of color except that about the market as much as this is more about us and I think how aggressive we have been in the marketplace to gain share. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s about the marketplace I think it\u2019s more about us. And I would expect as soon as we are able to bring Hitachi on board to be able to see the benefits of being able to participate in the VRF market, which we see is growing almost 10%. Brian Johnson : Okay. And just where are you in that expansion to second and the third tier cities as well in terms of building out the brand for whatever structure using branch distribution are there more cities to come? Alex Molinaroli : Absolutely. I think we are in the early stages, as it relates to the opportunity particularly as we get more products because as you move further and further away from Tier 1 cities, you need a broader set of products particularly at the light commercial and we really just haven\u2019t had that full complement of products. So I think we are going to have even more impetus around that. We have got a long way to go. Brian Johnson : And on North American HVAC, you are definitely seeing orders picking up. But how long do you think this recovery could last? Is this just a kind of bounce off the bottom or do you see any structural tailwind in your institutional markets? Alex Molinaroli : I just think \u2013 this is Alex. I think by its nature the fact that it\u2019s happening in the institutional market is usually a much more of a structural than some of the commercial markets. So I think when we are seeing the institutional and government money being spent, I mean, I think the thing to keep our eye on is health care because it has grown some and I would say if there is anything that would be less certain and less predictable is what\u2019s going to happen in the health care market. But if you look at the local government, schools, state government, those seem to be pretty strong in the pipeline strong. So I think that we are in a good cycle for those markets. For health care, I would never consider a victory yet because I think that market is still under a bunch of change, but we are seeing improvement but I don\u2019t know that if I would consider it a victory. Brian Johnson : Okay, final quick housekeeping question, Power Solutions, China, can you kind of update us on the OEM versus aftermarket split there and how you see that developing? Bruce McDonald : Yes. Brian its Bruce here I think Glen will follow-up with specific numbers. But I think what we are sort of giving you that commentary here on the market. I think the most noteworthy thing that we are seeing is we have talked about this last couple of quarters, but really rapid acceleration in AGM demand from the customers. We were awarded just in this quarter a $1.4 million unit order. We talked on our last couple \u2013 on our last call around that we are adding AGM production in the north plant, where we are looking to do sort of half AGM and half SOI. It\u2019s looking like we are going to have to pivot away from that and put in all AGMs. So, lot of customer interest in the AGM product line and that\u2019s great for us. Glen Ponczak : We do have, it\u2019s Glen here, on aftermarket in China, it\u2019s somewhere between 45 million and 50 million units today going to somewhere around 80 million by the end of the decade, Brian. And we think our share goes by 40% of our business being aftermarket to like 60% of our business being aftermarket only at the same timeframe. Brian Johnson : Okay. Okay, thanks. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Rod Lache. Sir, your line is open. Pat Nolan : Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s actually Pat Nolan on for Rod. Alex Molinaroli : Okay. Pat Nolan : A couple of quick questions just to follow-up on that last year\u2019s questions on the healthcare side of the business. Can you just refresh us, because it seems like that part is actually not growing, how big of your business today is just healthcare, not institutional, just healthcare? Alex Molinaroli : About $1 billion, $1.5 billion, something like that. Bruce McDonald : Yes, I was going to say it\u2019s around 20% overall, but we could get back to you to specific numbers. Pat Nolan : Okay, that would be perfect. And to switch gears a little bit, on the Power Solutions business, it seems like you are getting incrementally more positive on the gross and AGM. How does that play into the 5% to 6% annual growth that you have been expecting over the mid-term? Do you think that could potentially push you beyond that target or push towards the high-end? How do you think about that expanding growth in that context? Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s a good question. I think we have \u2013 just to be completely honest, I think that we have been caught off guard with how fast the AGM market has grown in the last couple of quarters. As you can tell as we talk about the orders that we have received in China, the growth that we are now seeing in North America we had been expecting at some point, but it\u2019s really come very quickly. So, I don\u2019t know that we have those exact numbers. It\u2019s something that we need to pull together, but you could probably tell by the way that in reacting we are adding capacity at a rate that we didn\u2019t actually expect even a year ago. So, good question. I think we probably owe everyone some follow-up, but the bottom line is really good news for our business, because our position in the AGM market is significant. Bruce McDonald : It\u2019s still probably somewhat smallish as far as moving the needle even without acceleration here early on at least, because I mean we are talking about 10, 11 million units in \u201815 here, as we exit \u201815 out of 140 million units total. So, while the percentage is moving and it probably doesn\u2019t have an impact, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to move at multiple points. Pat Nolan : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joe Spak. Sir, your line is open. Joe Spak : Thanks, everyone. Maybe just one more on AGM, while we are talking about it, you sort of talk about the profitability on those units being about 3x of that asset. It\u2019s been a while since we heard an update on that. Is that still \u2013 is that what you have been realizing and is that still sort of the right way to think about that profit mix? Alex Molinaroli : It hasn\u2019t changed. Yes, same, so still 3x the profit dollars I believe is what we have talked about it. Bruce McDonald : And I think \u2013 I have made some comments about we are starting to see some aftermarket growth here. So, I think there is an opportunity to improve on that as we go forward. Joe Spak : Right. And then I know it\u2019s too early to think about \u2013 maybe it\u2019s too early to think about the pressure on the auto spend, but what about the other side of that? Any thoughts on what the leverage opportunity is on remaining JCI? Alex Molinaroli : On the \u2013 so, I don\u2019t think we are ready to talk about the capital structure. But what I would tell you is that we will \u2013 regardless of what the dividend side is we will be in a very good position to make \u2013 to need to make those choices around capital structure, but what we do is with a very, very strong balance sheet. Joe Spak : Okay. And then quickly on \u2013 I appreciate all the color on China, specifically with the controls growth you are showing there on the order side, is that related to sort of the build out you are talking about in the other tier cities or because that\u2019s mostly goes with new construction as opposed to retrofit, is that correct? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. So, I will just be 100% honest. When I saw those numbers, that can\u2019t be just \u2013 that has to be some unique success that we have had with the quarter, certainly not the marketplace. So, I don\u2019t want to make something up to know why those numbers are as high as they are, but I think it\u2019s just representation as why we wanted to bring it is that we are seeing it across all of our product lines. I don\u2019t know they have a lot more information on that exactly why it\u2019s so much different than our equipment business. Joe Spak : Okay, alright. Thanks a lot. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas. Your line is open. Rich Kwas : Hi, good morning, everyone. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Rich. Rich Kwas : Just, Alex, on the \u2013 so, on the proceeds, the net proceeds from GWS $1.3 billion, you got Hitachi you are going to make the payment for that here in the next quarter or so. The remaining funds how should we think about that? I know M&A is the focal point, but what\u2019s the appetite to do incremental buyback above and beyond what you outlined? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. So, I will turn this over to Brian in a second, but from a strategic standpoint, I think that when we start embarked on this, hopefully we demonstrated that we are going to make what\u2019s the right choice not only for where we are at the moment, but also strategically. And it\u2019s probably going to have a lot to do with where we are with some of our opportunities for investment, but we do recognize that we will have an opportunity to maybe change the pace at which we do some of the buybacks if we choose to. Brian Stief : Yes. I think, if you look at the $1.3 billion, Rich and then it\u2019s roughly $500 million investment we will make in Hitachi joint venture that leaves you with $800 million. Couple areas that we are going to be looking at, we have got potentially a pension contribution that we could make on a discretionary basis to essentially get the plans funded at the level we have historically targeted. We are going to have in the fourth quarter here through the adoption of some new mortality tables about a $200 million increase in our liability. So, we may use some of the proceeds to pre-fund the pension. There is also certainly in the share repurchase area we have got $200 million left on this year\u2019s program and we could pull some forward potentially from next year\u2019s $1.2 billion. And then there is also some moving parts just relative to tax payments. So, I would say, we are kind of \u2013 we are going to look at various options there and we will see certainly keep our flexibility. Rich Kwas : Would the discretionary investment be matched at $200 million increase in the liability be more than that? Brian Stief : The $200 million is right now what we think the ballpark increase in the liability from the new mortality tables. Rich Kwas : Okay. So you would match that and then go from there. Brian Stief : Yes. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then just the couple of housekeeping items, Brian, the $1.5 billion of free cash, does that include the $150 million from GWS? Brian Stief : We include what? Alex Molinaroli : The $150 million from the joint ventures. Rich Kwas : I thought GWS generated about $150 million in annual cash flows. So, does the $1.5 million include that? Does it include the disc ops? Brian Stief : Yes, it does. Yes. Rich Kwas : Okay, alright. And then for the fourth quarter, you cited in terms of the guidance commodities, I just wanted to get some additional color on that given that metals prices have come down and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s material? Brian Stief : Yes, I think its diesel cost is what we are looking at. And then from a currency standpoint, the real or kind of the two items that seem to be offsetting the benefit of going from 105 to 110 in the euro. Rich Kwas : Okay, okay. Thank you. Glen Ponczak : I think actually we are done here, because we are at the top of the hour. Alex, any concluding remarks? Alex Molinaroli : Yes. I just want to once again thank our employees for not only the incredible performance that they have provided, but all the support that they are giving us is as we move forward with this transformation to accomplish an awful lot, we have got more to do. And I think our employees are not only are they actually making this happen, but I think they are very proud of what they have been able to accomplish and they should be. Thank you. Glen Ponczak : Great. Thanks, everybody. Kathy and I are available for the balance of the day with any follow-ups that you have got. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alex. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning, everyone. I want to jump right in to slide number four. It is a busy slide, but we have been busy and I think it's indicative of all of the things that we have going on and the pride that I have in of our people. So our fourth quarter we continued most importantly with our ongoing improvement in each one of the businesses and our EPS guidance. We've made significant progress across our portfolio transformation. As we remake this company and ultimately as we create two great companies, once we spin our automotive business. In the face of some real headwinds in each one of our businesses and the company as a whole we've achieved margins in the quarter and margins for the year we've never achieved and I'm incredibly proud of our entire team. If you look at our slide four you'll see our improvements in our margin for the year is 120 basis points and our EPS improved 14% to $3.22. The slide also does a really good job of putting into context the ongoing transformational actions that we've taken up to this point. It goes back a couple of years since we began this journey and then specifically in the fourth quarter you can see we completed the sale of GWS and consummated the Hitachi joint venture. And of course the largest and most significant action that we currently have and that we've had under way is the spin of our automotive business which is planning to be spun off on October 1, 2016. If you move on to slide five, a couple of more data points already discussed : our segment margin improvements and our EPS gain but probably more importantly is the underlying health of the individual business operations. If you adjust for FX our segment sales were up 5% and our income was up 16%. Slide six. I've already talked about our record fourth quarter and key portfolio actions. I'd like to point out that these business improvements aren't happening just because everyone at Johnson Controls is working harder. We continue to work smarter. We're utilizing the principles found within our Johnson Controls operating systems and we continue to focus on managing the anticipated cost structure and the new operating models that will be necessary to run the remaining Johnson Controls and also our new automotive company independently. We are doing this simultaneously while we are able to achieve our results. I'd like to talk a little bit about our end markets in China. Bruce will talk more about this it will be happy to answer any Q&A but we do have good news. By the time we got to the end of the fourth quarter in China automotive market we were able to see that the dealer inventories began to get depleted and that sales began to move and we are actually feeling much better as we move into the fiscal year as it relates to China sales and so what we saw as a tough quarter began to get a lot better as the months went on in July, August and September. One of the important things that I've had an opportunity to see in some of the pre-reports is I'd like to talk about our VE backlog. We actually have a slide on that but first, I want to give you a takeaway. In the core of our business of selling equipment and controls through our branches is growing and because of the changing nature of our business one of the things that's become more and more important for us is that as we become product and distribution dependent our backlog - and I will give you more color on this in a slide or two - is becoming less and less of the most important metric. Certainly our sales are important, but if you look at revenues they've continued to increase even though we have a backlog that's been under pressure. It has to do with the mix of our business. I'm also incredibly excited to talk about the fact that we have our Hitachi deal done and simultaneously we have already released our VRF product, one of the leading VRF products in the world. We've already put ourselves into a leadership position in China and in Asia and now, we've released that product for sale and have already begun selling the product in North America. If you look at our battery business specifically, if you want to look across the region, but if you look at our AGM sales we will talk about that in more detail but essentially we are selling every battery that we can make and those sales are incredibly robust. Moving on to slide seven. On slide seven you can say we've put it into the quarter's perspective. We've had another strong quarter and if you look at our 150 basis points of margin improvement within our segments, it's something that we continue to be proud of and I guess the context I would like to keep that in is that we've done this quarter after quarter over the last couple of years and we continue to see improvements in all of our businesses and our ability to execute. On slide eight, it's a complicated slide but I think it's really important because it seems to be one of the things that is giving people pause about where we are in our performance and our continuing here. I'm actually very pleased about what's happening with building efficiency. If you look at our building efficiency orders, Europe and Asia were down and we expected that but what we are really surprised at is at the end of the quarter and in September - which is usually a very large month for us for the Federal Government; there were some political realities that were the case and still the case specifically in September around the continued resolution - all orders for the Federal Government business in North America were down 37%. That all actually really happened in the month of September. Hopefully some of this work will come back over the next few months and that assumes a constructive resolution in Congress around the federal budget, but this one is out of our control. As you think about us and you think about our orders moving forward, our pipeline is robust. We expected to have a much different set of numbers. The Federal Government continued resolution discussion and challenged us with something that caught us by surprise that was outside of our control. If we look at it and take it in context, orders and branches were up 4%. If you look at our pipeline, that's 4% over the year if you look at our pipeline, going forward, we still continue to see single digit growth in our pipeline moving forward. The other thing that's important to note is that in the past, backlog was always an important measure of our business and building efficiency. And it was because our dependency on our branch and projects business. As you all know, people that have followed us in the past, three quarters of our future sales usually came through our backlog and it was a good predictive measure. Since we've made our acquisition of ADTI, we've increased our distribution sales and now with the inclusion of Hitachi joint venture moving forward, that backlog information as we become less and less connected certainly correlates and it's important to have a backlog. But it will be less important as we talk about our sales moving forward. Our truck way sales were up over 4% for the year our distribution sales were up, the ADTI sales were also up. All of those things are not reflected in our backlog. You can see that if you look at the disconnect between our sales number or our actually revenue number and what our backlog numbers were in the past. One thing that's not on the slide that I would really like to point out is that the pull-through activity that's happening with CB Richard Ellis, something we probably should bring more focus on in the future and I think it's something that should become a topic, is something we are pleased with. It's actually started quicker than we thought. It actually began before we even closed the deal. A lot of that probably won't flow through our backlog either because it's dealing with individual customers and individual facilities. But we're seeing a real uptake in orders in a very large pipeline and backlog of opportunities. I'd like to talk a little bit about our growth opportunities and just give you some examples. If you go to slide nine, we are in the midst of launching many, many products expanding our channels. I'd like to talk about a couple of our products that we've introduced over the last quarter. Specifically, around our residential and light commercial business. You see the Champion LX series. We also upgraded and enhanced our flagship security product offering which is the P2000 Access Control System. And we've also launched some online tools for our residential contractors to help them be more effective and efficient and able support the consumers more effectively. End power solutions, we announced a new plant to be built in China in Shenyang, six million units and we debuted in Frankfurt a new generation of advanced start stop products that include both active in lead acid and lithium ion chemistries. In China we also signed an MOU with DAIC to support them and their partners for their growing needs for start stop batteries. Finally we recently formally announced our lithium ion distribution energy storage solution. We've already have presold and actually installed some of these systems and it's a launch we're actually leveraging the technology that we have from building efficiency with the distribution resources we have. I'm sorry, with the technology at power solutions and leveraging the distribution that we have at building efficiency. Moving on to slide 10 and automotive, lots of new products and launches. If you look at some of the product launches we have within our automotive business we continue to provide new products for our customers, personalization products that are becoming more and more important for new a generation of customers. We've launched our BMW 7 series in the Czech Republic, our core product portfolio and our mechanism family, very important part of our strategy moving forward. Our T-3000 recliner and our Hydro adjuster being released globally for multiple customers. And then Frankfurt we unveiled a new seat in interior technology talking about the future when we talk about autonomous driving. Obviously autonomous driving and the new technology going into vehicles will play a big part of our seating business in the future. Lastly before I turn it over to Bruce, I'd just like to point out that we have an incredible momentum in each one of our businesses. And we're going to continue to focus on our operational excellence through our Johnson Control's operating system, improving margins, lowering our cost and increasing our quality. And we will do that in the same time we go through our automotive spend activities. Our pipeline of investments is strong, and if I think about what's happening with our ACE separation, and you'll get more color on this when we see you in December. We're on track, on schedule, on task and this time next year we'll be talking about two powerful new companies. So I think that overall if I look at our progress over the last two years, we're well on our way to be the - to = be a leading multi-industrial company. With that, Bruce? You take this from here. Bruce McDonald : All right. Well thank you, Alex. And I think as I go through the business operations you're going to - what you're going to see is despite the fact that we've had a lot going on from a portfolio perspective, that our business leaders and all the people at the company have really been focused on delivering solid year-over-year results here. So if we start on slide 12, we were really pleased with building efficiencies results here in the fourth quarter. You can see sales of $2.9 billion were approximately the same as they were last year. Though stripping out foreign exchange, we had organic revenue growth of 5%. In North America Systems and Service, our business was up 6% year-over-year and we saw good strength in our Branch business, though that was offset by some of the softness in the Federal Government business that Alex talked about earlier in his comments. We finally saw - we've been talking a lot this year about the Middle East. We finally ran up against some more favorable comps, so Middle East business were up nearly 54%, Asia was level with the prior year, Europe was down 3% and Latin America, which continues to be very, very soft, was down 16%. If you look at our segments earnings in the quarter, $351 million. We're up 5%. And as we've noted here on our slide, backing out foreign exchange, it was up 8%. The year-over-year improvement would really be due to higher volumes and favorable price and product mix. The margins, which was a real strong story in the quarter, up - were up to 12.1%, a 60 basis point improvement versus last year. I would point out that this was the first quarter where ADT - the ADT acquisition has been in both sets of numbers, so that business, you'll recall, closed in June of last year. So this quarter we had a clean comparable quarter from a year-over-year basis, so the incremental benefit of ADT isn't what drove the numbers here. It was really just business performance. And then lastly I would just note for the full year, BE margins were up about 70 basis points, so I think we're pretty pleased that despite the fact that we saw some currency headwinds and some of the markets didn't recover like we thought they were going to going into this year, the business delivered segment margin improvement of about 70 basis points, which was about 20 basis points better than the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year for building efficiency. Turning to slide 13, in power solutions for the fourth quarter, our sales were down 6%. Though again adjusting for foreign exchange, we saw organic growth of 3%. In terms of unit shipments in the quarter, we're up about 1%. Europe and North America were each up 1%. Asia was up about 4%. AGM continues to be a huge benefit and you can see our growth is accelerating here in the quarter. We were up 44% to just under 2.9 million units. And then if you look at our mix between aftermarket and OE, aftermarket was up about 1% globally and OE was up 2%. Segment income in the quarter, you can see nice improvement, up 5% to $340 million. And again if you took out the impact of foreign exchange, we would've been up about 11% on a year-over-year basis. And an exceptionally strong margin performance in the quarter, up about 200 basis points to 20.2% I would just caution folks that, that's not - that level of margin improvement, while we're pleased with it, it is not something that's sustainable. So we don't see our business continuing to sort of grow at that level. So the 160 basis point improvement for this year, we sort of went into the year guiding to 50 basis points to 60 basis points of improvement on a year-over-year basis. The power solutions team, in the face of some of the headwinds that they had around foreign currency, I mean just did a great job for us. And then lastly on page 14, I'll just talk a little bit about automotive. As Alex mentioned in his comments, our interiors joint venture closed at the beginning of the quarter on July 2, so this is the first quarter that we are reporting our automotive results showing interiors as an equity investment, in other words our interiors business is de-consolidated. So when you look at our sales and we'll will see this for the next three quarters, our sales were down 21% in automotive, though if you were to back out the impact of foreign exchange and the de-consolidation of interiors, our organic growth in automotive was 3%. That is slightly lower than the industry production environment where we're up about 5% in North America and Europe. The reason for that really being some business discipline and recording process primarily in North America. In China, you will see, and here you'll see a bigger number now we're talking about our sales being up about $2.3 billion, up about 27%. That's because we are now picking up the Chinese portion of the Yanfeng joint venture here. If you were to sort of adjust for that what you would see in China was our underlying sales were down about 3% and that compares a little bit favorably to the industry production environment which was down about 5%. Spending a bit time on our interiors joint venture which closed in the quarter I would say we were pleased with how that business has started out. The numbers are looking pretty good there, from a topline perspective. I looked at the sales in the quarter, about $2 billion, so they were down about 2%, 2% or 3% versus the prior year. Though if you looked at that by region you'd see quite a different story. In our interiors business North America was up 14%. Europe was at about 16% really as a result of some of the new business launches we had. And then China was down 16%. So pretty mixed picture from a topline perspective in interiors. In China, it has been a hot topic lately. I know there's a lot of comments about what's going on in the market and I thought maybe I could share some perspective. I personally was in China three times in the last four months so maybe I could just comment on some of the things we're seeing and some of the discussions that we are having with our partners and customers. First of all, I would tell you the passenger car market, which is where we tend to compete, is holding up better than the other overall market. Though in the quarter it wasn't a big difference, about down 4% versus 6%. We have very little content on the light commercial vehicles so we are primarily exposed to the passenger car side. Many of our customers cut production in the quarter significantly more than sales, which led to inventory de-stocking. We continue to see the SUV and luxury car segment doing very well on a year-over-year basis and right now the market is in a little bit of a transition where the Chinese own brands are picking up shares at the expense of some of the transplant customers. I would also commend our joint ventures on doing a great job in flexing their cost base down in light of lower production and to give you a feel for that, if you were to look at our China seating business in the quarter, the equity income was a $5 million year-over-year decline. So even though our sales were down 3% the impact to our bottom line here at JCI level was about five million. So a nice job flexing the cost base. And then lastly as Alex talked about we did see production improve sequentially throughout the quarter and as you sort of look at this dealer inventory level stabilizing here and with some of the benefits that we expect to see as some of the government incentives kick in on small vehicles. We do see double-digit scheduling, production schedule increases ramping up here into the first quarter of last calendar quarter here. So I'm pretty optimistic that the worst is behind us here in China and we're going to start to see modest to mid-single digit type growth. Lastly I'll just comment on segment income, which was up about 4% after adjusting for the adverse impact of foreign currency in the quarter. If you look at the margins, our margins were about 6%, 120% basis points higher than last year and here we are really starting to see the benefit of some of the restructuring actions that we've taken over the last year or so. And then the benefits we're getting in our plans from the introduction of Johnson Control's outputting system. Maybe I would just point out, I've seen in some of the early notes a little bit of confusion around the margins, and what the segment margin expectation was in automotive and maybe just give a little color there. As it relates to interiors, we showed segment income of about $10 million, which was down I think from $40 million the prior-year. Just a few things I would point out there. What you are saying in that line item is the after-tax income from our Yanfeng joint venture. Previously, that number would have been a pre-tax number, so that's worth about 15% or 20% is sort of the effective tax rate in that joint venture. We've also got about $10 or $12 million of separation related cost in the JV. So that's the cost of setting up new IT systems and things like that. And then lastly what you see in that line item is the wind down cost that we have with some of the retained plants. That's a loss and we expect that's going to continue for the next three to four quarters. So overall, a solid performance from automotive. A solid performance from all three of the businesses and with that, Brian, I'll will turn it over to you and the financials. Brian Stief : Okay. Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. As you saw the press release and as outlined in the appendix to today's slide deck, the Q4 results from continuing operation include five significant non-operational items which resulted in a net charge of $1.04 in the quarter. And I'd like to touch quickly on those five items. First of all we had a non-cash mark-to-market pension and post-retirement charge of $422 million. The way to think about that and I think we've mentioned this before about half of that roughly relates to the fact that we had to adopt some new mortality tables in the pension calculations and that caused right at about $200 million impact tax. And then there was also with the August and September investment returns, we got hit hard in those two months and we ended up for the entire year having about a $200 million difference between expected investment returns and our actual returns. So all a 420 charge. Secondly, we had a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter just short of $4 million that related primarily to the automotive business and then some non-cash impairment charges we took as well. The third item would be a gain from the formation of interior's joint venture that Bruce referred to. That net gain was $145 million. Interiors is reported in our continuing operations but we've excluded that 145 from what I'll talk about this morning. We also have as we have in prior quarters the transaction integration and separation cost associated with all of our portfolio actions that we're taking. And the last item would be net tax expense charge that was taken as a result of the tax effects of the previous four charges or credits that I mentioned as well as planning around foreign cash repatriation that was done in connection with a couple of the transactions. So as I talk through the financials this morning, I'll exclude those items from my comments and also remember that in the current year, GWS has been reported as a discontinued operation and we've done that on a comparable basis in fiscal 2014 and you may recall as well, electronics as a discontinued operation in 2014 also. Last item that Bruce mentioned was the formation of the auto interiors joint venture which was formed on July 2. So we de-consolidated that in the quarter and we now maintain a 30% equity interest in that venture. So as I go through the income statement movements I will refer back to the impact of the interior de-consolidation. So overall, fourth quarter sales were down 12% at $8.7 billion, but that was due to the de-consolidation of the interiors business which was $900 million and unfavorable foreign exchange of $600 million really across all three of our businesses and that was primarily the euro. Excluding the impact of those two items, consolidated sales were up 3% and up across all three of our businesses. Gross profit for the quarter was 19.6% which is up 160 basis points from last year. We really see the continued benefits of the shift in product mix as well as the ongoing benefits we are seeing in the Johnson Control's operating system initiatives. SG&A was down 12% year-over-year. Again this was due primarily to foreign exchange and the de-consolidation of the interiors joint venture, and we also had some benefits from certain of the cost reduction actions that we've taken beginning in the fourth quarter here and as we move into fiscal 2016. Equity income of $105 million was 14% lower than last year, and that was due to the fact that in the prior year, we did have an equity interest gain related to one of our joint ventures. In the current year, the Interiors joint venture income of $10 million that Bruce referred to, which is an after-tax number. That was offset by some shortfalls and certain of our Chinese Auto Seating joint ventures. Overall, fourth quarter segment margins were 10.7% or 150 basis points better than 2014. So really strong operational performance across all three of our businesses. During turning to slide 16, financing charges of $73 million were $7 million higher than the prior-year quarter. That was really the function of average debt levels were a bit higher this year throughout the year. As far as the tax rate, both 2014 and 2015 have an underlying tax rate of roughly 19%. And if you look at income from - attributable to non-controlling interests, that's down $12 million, and that really relates to some of the reductions that we've seen in earnings at our Automotive consolidated joint ventures as well as the deconsolidation of the Interiors business. So overall, EPS of $1.04 is a record, up 7% versus the $0.97 of a year ago. Turning to page 17, I'd like to just spend a few minutes on some balance sheet and cash flow highlights, and then spend a couple minutes also on our Q1 guidance for fiscal 2016. So during the year, we executed share repurchases of $1.4 billion. In that $1.4 billion, of that, $400 million was in the fourth quarter. And we also paid throughout fiscal 2015 about $700 million in dividends to our shareholders. So at this point in time if you look at our share repurchase program, we've executed on about $2.6 billion of our $3.6 billion authorized level. GWS divestiture proceeds in the quarter were at $1.4 billion. And if you think about where we really use that cash, we had about $400 million in tax audit settlements. And just as a point of reference, that $400 million that was paid really closed out about 33 or 34 open tax years in the United States, Germany and Mexico. And it's going to be - it's a positive thing as we move toward the Auto spin as well. We also made some voluntary pension contributions of about $400 million, and of course, the Hitachi joint venture that Alex referred to that closed on October 1, that was about $550 million in cash. So that's kind of the way to think about the GWS divestiture proceeds. As we move into 2016, our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt to cap of 36.7%, which is about 400 basis points better than last quarter and comparable to 35.7% that existed at the end of fiscal 2014. Net debt is $6 billion at 9/30/15 and reflects a net debt reduction in the quarter of about $1.3 billion. And our adjusted cash flow for the year was about $1.4 billion as we've outlined in the appendix to the deck. Capital spending of $1.1 billion was $200 million below plan, and that was primarily due to timing and some deferred projects at Power Solutions and BE. As far as fiscal 2016 guidance, our strong fourth quarter provides us good momentum as we enter the year, and we expect earnings per share in Q1 of $0.80 to $0.83, which is up 8% to 12% from $0.74 last year. I would point out that this guidance, consistent with our practice this year, does exclude transaction, integration and separation costs. And I would just note that given the size and complexity of the AE separation and spinoff, the separation costs in fiscal 2016 will likely be significant and we'll provide some more color around a range of those costs in the December meeting. Also in the December analyst meeting, we will provide more details on the full year guidance. And with that, Glen, I will turn it over to you. Glen Ponczak : Great. Thanks, Brian. Abby, I think we're ready to take calls here. I don't know how many are in the queue here, but just so that we give more people a chance, if you can keep it to a main question and a follow-up. And then if you've got more, get back into the queue, that would be helpful. And, Abby, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Barry. Your line is now open, sir. Robert Barry : Hey, guys. Thank you. Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Morning, Robert. Bruce McDonald : Good morning. Robert Barry : Yeah. I guess I wanted to start on the Building business in North America. I mean it looks like the orders slowed. I guess a lot of that was the government. The comps also got a lot tougher. So maybe can you just update us on how you feel about the momentum and kind of the key nonres verticals for the Nonres Applied business? And specifically on that government piece, I mean things are looking a little brighter on a budget deal. I mean how much line of sight do you feel you have to a kind of book of government business that could flow through if in fact things move forward with the contemplated deal? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. That's a great question. Well first, I hope it came through in my comments. It was a very frustrating - literally because of the - because of when the end of the fiscal year happened. I believe it was like over the weekend, a lot of this came to light at the very, very end, as it relates to the continued resolution and what that meant to the different agencies we do business with. They actually didn't realize that they were going to be curtailed because of the uncertainty. So you're right, the budget looks like it's going to get resolved. We're not sure what the resolution exactly is going to be. We would expect some of these projects to come back soon. But we also know that some of them may not come back right away because a lot of these projects are the type of projects that come at the end of the year when agencies find that they have additional funds in their budget. So I think it's going to be a mixed bag of us being able to get some of these projects in earlier than waiting for the end of the year. But it certainly wasn't something that we expect. The good news on any of this, if there's any, is that these projects typically are very large and very, very slow moving, so that's not going to have a real huge impact on us this year. But it was disappointing because we have such a strong pipeline and such a lot of momentum in that business. The team was just really deflated when they were kind of dealt this curveball here over that weekend. But the pipeline is as strong as it was when we talked about it two quarters ago. And last quarter, what we see is secured pipeline. It looks very strong, particularly in all - in the institutional vertical markets. We continue to add salespeople, and so I think what we're going to - we'll continue to see growth. I would consider - I think what I hope everyone takes away from this is this is not a change. What this is was something that was just something we couldn't predict and for us we do an awful lot of business with the federal government, so it was a significant blow to us. But I'm just as strong, if not more bullish because if you look at where, we talked about one quarter, and then two quarters and three quarters and I think we're - our line of sight is over the next couple quarters, we should continue to see strong orders. Robert Barry : Gotcha. And maybe just a question on the Power business. Really two questions. If you could address the slowdown in the growth in the aftermarket? And then on the margin in Power, can you kind of bridge that gap between the guide of 50 bps and the 150 bps that you did? And to what extent specifically was there any change in planned investment spending that caused that much stronger performance in Power? Thanks. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Yeah. I don't know that it was planned investment spending. I do think that what we can't predict at the end of each and every quarter is when - how our customers are going to order - get it where they get ready for - as they get ready for the winter months. What I would expect, in fact I was with one of our customer yesterday, is what I would expect is that some of the profits that we saw in this quarter may have been in a different year next quarter, so I think it's a little fungible quarter-to-quarter. But as it relates to the slowdown in the aftermarket, I think what our team is seeing overall - let's use North America I guess as the best proxy. Is they're seeing a 3% to 4% growth. And in fact our team would tell you right now they're struggling to get batteries to be prepared for the winter. We're really concerned about our service levels so absent whatever is going to happen with the weather I can't really control that. Our biggest challenge right now is to make sure that we do have batteries to be prepared. So I think that's good. And then AGM as far as where we are on that is we are capacity constrained. We're building as fast as we possibly can and hopefully we have to get through the allocation. All in all a positive Brian Stief : Yeah. Bruce McDonald : I think one point around the investment, we are opening up our plant in China, our partnership AGM batteries out of China. So there is going to start to be some heavier investment in China next year versus this year around some of those new capacity adds. Alex Molinaroli : That's true. Yeah. I did see actually - that's a good point, Bruce. I did see in some of the forecast that we have some launch costs in China specifically and as we start to use our global network for batteries, we probably are going to have some additional expense cost as we move batteries around versus capital cost. Robert Barry : How much of a headwind is that? Bruce McDonald : We'll talk more in December. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Bruce McDonald : We'll give you more detail around... Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. I really don't - I really - I guess with the numbers I saw, I really don't know if I got to the root cause of it. It's not something that to be concerned about. Robert Barry : Okay. Thank you Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Julian Mitchell. Your line is now open, sir. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Hi. Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Just a question on the segment margins within building efficiency. You had a good increase in Q4 and through the year. Just wondered if you could parse out at all how much of that was driven by price net of raw material costs? And how the hedging works and what kind of benefit you think you'll see in Q1 from that effect? Bruce McDonald : Yeah. This is Bruce here. You kind of broke up a little bit. I don't have - and we usually don't like to talk about pricing versus commodity but commodities would have been a benefit with them trending down throughout the quarter but I would say equally that's not unique to Johnson Controls and so our competition would've been faced with the same tailwinds there and that tends to be reflected in how people look at quoting. So I don't think it's a big deal. I mean I think probably the best way to think about it is we've pretty consistently said that we see our glide path in BE margins around 50 basis points a year. When sales tend to be soft, we tend to do a little bit better job because we don't have to sort of ramp up resources in advance of new business. We are adding salespeople. I mean I think we talked about that a little bit on our last quarterly call but it would really be and if we have flat topline performance, we can do a little bit better than the 50 basis points. When we start to see it turn, you probably see a little bit worse than 50 basis points. So that's kind of the best way to think about it. Alex Molinaroli : I'd just add to that. I think in the fourth quarter the building efficiency team did a pretty good job of addressing early on some actions it was going to take from an SG&A standpoint and there was a benefit in the fourth quarter from some of those actions that they were able to accelerate versus some of the other actions that relate to the restructuring charge we took in the fourth quarter likely won't happen until sometime during fiscal 2016. So there was a bit of a benefit there as well. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then just my follow-up question is on the Asian business within building efficiency. Yeah. The revenues were flat at currency orders down slightly. I think China is a pretty high-margin business for you in that segment so maybe just give some color on not the auto side but what you're seeing on the building side in China right now. Bruce McDonald : Yeah. So let me give this a little bit of that. I don't want to call victory. Bruce's conversations around the automotive business I think is something because of our unique relationships that we have. We probably had more visibility into exactly what's going to happen. I can tell you we got more positive comments but I would call it anecdotal versus something that in automotive where we would see something more structural happening. So the phone calls have been better. The anecdotes have been better but I certainly don't think we're out of the woods yet in China as it relates to the building business. Now all that being said, remember we just went through the Hitachi joint venture. So our presence in China has changed dramatically. We have a new party at Hycincs in China. We participate much more broadly in the market and I think we have the opportunity to see some increases because of that new participation and new products that we can cross sell. But we haven't really identified that. So I think that we may be able to do better than the market as we move forward because we have new products that we can sell through with multiple channels Julian Mitchell : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Emmanuel Rosner. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning Emmanuel Rosner : Wanted to ask you first about the automotive spin off. So if I heard you right I think it's scheduled for a about year from now, which obviously is a decent amount of time. I was curious if you could just give us some color on I guess what does the process look like? What do you have to accomplish in order to be able to get that done? Why does it take so long? But also, how do you reassure clients and customers, the auto makers in particular that about the future? I mean, some of your sitting competitors seem to imply that they are taking advantage of the uncertainty and they're getting more business as a result. So what can you do over that time period to sort of like make everybody more comfortable? Alex Molinaroli : I'm going to turn this over to Bruce because he's so deeply into this, but I just want to address that last piece as it relates to what our competitors may or may not be saying. I'm not privy to that but I think that that's probably - I actually think that our position with our competitor is probably more about the fact that the way we manage the business today, not about who we're going to be tomorrow. Because if you think about how we manage the business today, we've very selective in the way that we allocate capital and how we compete within the Automotive business, particularly the Seating business in North America and Europe. That doesn't necessarily mean the way that Bruce and his team will run it in the future. So I think that when you hear our competition talk about it it's probably less to do about the spend and more to do about the fact that as a whole Johnson Controls has had a capital allocation strategy that may have benefited. That's the only way that I can relate to that comment. But as far as how they spend is going and why it takes so long I think Bruce probably has a couple of facts that he can give you. Bruce McDonald : Well, it's taking longer than I would like to happen but I think just to sort of walk you through sort of the main work streams. First of all and probably the most complicated is the separation and establishment of new corporate entities. So unlike say a divestiture where we're pretty used to say carving something out and selling it and have had a fair amount of experience over the last couple years doing that. Here we have to do all the separation work but also set up the corporate functions starting from scratch. And so that's a big work stream. The IT systems are always a challenge and again, we're used to sort of separating them out and automotive tends to be fairly separate here at Johnson Controls. There's not a lot of co-mingled systems or assets. But again, on the corporate side, we have to set up brand new systems from scratch. So that's kind of - what really drives the timing. I think if you look like we have, Emmanuel, in terms of how long some of these spinoffs tend to take, as we looked out in the market, we've seen sort of nine month would be a quick one, 9 or 10 months to 18 to 24 months would be a slow one. And we tend to be I think given the size of it nearly $20 billion, 35 countries, we have 225 plants, 75,000 employees. So in the scheme of it I would say we're a large complex separation and I think the timetable that we've established is pretty aggressive given the complexity. I mean, I would say it's on the shorter end of normal and it's on the much more difficult than normal. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. That's helpful. And then just my follow up on automotive again. I guess the margin came maybe a little bit lower than we would have expected. And I realize there's a lot of moving pieces now because obviously the denominator is just a consolidated sales but on the numerator you have the consolidated earnings, you have now the interior earnings, you have the China earnings that are not consolidated. Can you maybe give us directional comment on how the performance for margins was for these different pieces? North America and Europe filling up down and then China filling in the interiors? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. I don't have it on the top of my head. I think and maybe we can follow this one up, Emmanuel, but I'd say just look at that seating margins were up 90 basis points in the quarter, 5.9% versus 5% last year. Interiors, in my comments I talked about some of the noise that's in their around the wind down cost, the fact that it's flipping from pre-tax number to post-tax number now. The fact that we've got cost to set up the new joint venture flowing through those numbers. So you're quite right, there's a lot of noise. We do intend next year to continue to show seating and interior separate. And I think as we sort of hit our stride on getting the JV set up here, I think it's up to us to maybe do a bit better job educating folks on what the interior piece of it is going to look like, because I think that's where the confusion is coming about. I think the street had auto margins being about 70 or 80 basis points higher than we came in at. And I think that was because they sort of looked at last year's segment income in interiors and figured that would repeat. And that's where you see the 30 million year-over-year delta. So I think there is a lot of moving points and it's something that we can do a better job, and we will in Q1. Bruce McDonald : Yeah. I think one of the things that we'll do as part of the December analyst day is we'll kind of unpack both the consolidated and unconsolidated automotive sales and related margins. So we'll get into that in a bit more detail in December. Emmanuel Rosner : All right. Thank you all. Bruce McDonald : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Kwas. Your line is now open, sir. Rich Kwas : Hi. Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Richard. Bruce McDonald : Good morning. Rich Kwas : Alex, I wanted to touch base on your comment about backlog. So GWS wasn't included in backlog, and resi and the light commercial stuff. And you're implying that backlog is going to be less relevant. But if I look at the business as a whole, GWS wasn't part of it. So why is backlog less relevant going forward here? I understand the ADT piece. That's now in the business. That's not part of backlog. But it just seems like from an institutional standpoint, your mix hasn't changed all that much. So it still should be pretty relevant. So I just wanted to get some additional color from you on that. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. I guess what I would say is first off, as I thought about GWS, I never really thought about it in the context of being part of the BE and the construction projects. What I mean by that is that the way that we're going to market, the way that we're selling our products, whether it be ADTI, whether it be our Hitachi products, whether it be our strengthening of the other products that go through distribution not only in North America but around the world, we've gone through a place where 75% of our business used to be backlog ex, not including GWS. Just separate GWS out. Now it's something that's around 50% or less and probably continuing to be less and less. And so what I just wanted to say is that over time, we're going to have to make sure that we don't - that we continue to give you the information that you want to see around our projects and our projects business moving forward. But our projects business moving forward will continue to be important, but it won't be the dominant part of our business in the future. And so that's really what the comment means. In fact, you can see our ongoing sales have continued to increase adjusted for FX, and our backlog has been under pressure. And so I'm just pointing out that that's becoming more and more disconnected. That's it. Rich Kwas : Okay. So is that more kind of differences in how you've gone to market here in the past year or so with new opportunities and what not? Alex Molinaroli : Absolutely. I think it speaks to when we talk about having multiple channels, multiple ways to getting to the market and serving the market more broadly than just the complex market and becoming much more of a product company. I think all of these things, this whole conversation is really an outcome or an attribute of how we're going to go to market and what kind of products we're going to sell. We'll become more and more talking about our product sales and less and less pivoting on the contracting part of our business. That's all. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then [indiscernible] Alex Molinaroli : Not that we're restricting the [indiscernible]. Bruce McDonald : We're not getting rid of it. I don't want to go over it. I'm just saying the mix is changing. That's all. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then just broadly speaking on M&A, there's been some speculation around the business that would fit the power solutions here recently and you talked about trying to expand your scale in the midmarket light commercial residential, et cetera. How are you thinking about this right now with the transactions? There's still work to do with some transactions but how are you thinking about the landscape right now and where you see capital deployment going here within the next year or so? Alex Molinaroli : Great question. So we're going to talk about - this is a good pivot to talk about our December analyst day. We're going to have, you know, all of these conversations are going to be in real detail because one of the things you should expect from us is that I don't think we've done a great job. I do think our capital allocation strategy has become much more robust in the last couple of years but I think philosophically we need to talk more about that. We'll do that in December. How are we going to make these decisions? What process and insight analytics and what metrics are we going to use? Not only what parts of our business need to be levered because they have strength as it relates to adding geography and technologies but also where we have gaps and how we would do that and what kind of metrics we'd be? Because I've gotten a lot of feedback from individuals I'm sure, you also, to make sure that we continue with a disciplined capital allocation strategy and we'll talk about that in December. So I think that you should keep that in mind understanding that we know that we need to add capabilities and take advantage of some of our portfolio to make it stronger. We also have realized that we need to make responsible capital allocation choices. More in December. Rich Kwas : Okay. Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks, Richard. We have time for one more, operator. Operator : Okay, speakers. Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman. Your line is now open, sir. Sumit Agarwal : Hi. This is Sumit for Ryan. Thanks for squeezing us in. I just want to go back to the sleeping margins. You've seen a good increase in the margins. I'm just curious where are you on the restructuring savings and should we be expecting that margin improvement to be sustainable or are the margins going to flatten out going in FY 2016? Bruce McDonald : Yeah. It's Bruce here. I think it would be normal for us here in December. We'll give our margin expectations by business for all three of our businesses in December. So that's - and sort of hold off on that. Sumit Agarwal : Okay. Can you just share your thoughts on where you are on the restructuring process in terms of the getting savings there? Bruce McDonald : Restructuring for the company? Alex Molinaroli : For seating. Sumit Agarwal : For the seating. Yeah. Bruce McDonald : Yeah. Well it plays right into the margins so I think we'll just leave that until the December meeting. Sumit Agarwal : That's fine and just a follow-up. Thanks for your comments on the China market regarding automotive. Just curious, again, if you're seeing any delay in new programs or new launches coming to the market because of the slow down or is that really something that's not playing out at all? Alex Molinaroli : I think I would say not so much on any launches at this point in time but I do think there are a couple of OEs that are rethinking or possibly going to defer some capacity increases. Sumit Agarwal : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks very much. Bruce McDonald : Thank you. Glen Ponczak : So thanks everybody. Couple closing comments, Alex? Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Just a couple. I mean, first, it's become an enjoyable broken record to thank our employees for everything that they've accomplish over the last quarter and now you got the opportunity to thank them for what we've accomplished over the last year. It's quite outstanding. I certainly don't want to leave anyone out when I think about whatever our employees accomplished in each one of our businesses. They performed extremely well in each one of our geographies depending on what they've faced. They face with different challenges and opportunities and I think we've got opportunities. We've exploited them and I think where we had challenges we went over to mitigate those challenges. And then if you look at our corporate teams and our teams that are supporting our portfolio transformation, not much can be said except I think each one of these transactions and each one of the things that we've accomplished I feel absolutely proud of what we've been able to make happen, not only from the standpoint of the time that it took to do it but the outcomes. We hopefully get to see everyone in New York in December. I think it's going to be an important meeting, one of the most important meetings we've ever had in New York because we're going to talk about the remaining Johnson Controls and our strategy moving forward. So we'll bring more and more clarity around that. We're going to give you details around the automotive spin, which I think there is a need for everyone to understand that so it can help you put the right values down in your models as you move forward. And once again I just want to thank you for your interest and hope you have a great day. Take care. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. Today's call is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this point. Now I will hand the meeting over to your host, Mr. Glen Ponczak, sir you may begin. Glen L. Ponczak - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, operator and welcome, everybody, to the review of Johnson Controls First Quarter 2015 Earnings. If you didn't already receive it, the slide presentation can be accessed at the Investors section at johnsoncontrols.com. This morning, Chairman and CEO, Alex Molinaroli, will provide some perspective on the quarter as well as some updates; and he'll be followed by Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief, who will review the results of the individual businesses as well as the company's overall financial performance. Following those prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for questions, and we're scheduled to end at the top of the hour. Before we begin, just want to remind you that today's conference will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors that could cause results to differ are discussed in the cautionary statement included in today's news release and the presentation document. We also remind you to review the extended disclosures related to the proposed transaction with Tyco, which can also be found in the earnings document today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alex. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thank you, Glen. I first want to acknowledge that this is probably the first time in years that Bruce McDonald hasn't been on the agenda, but just for everyone's sake, he's here, so when we get to the Q&A, we'll make sure that Bruce gets an opportunity to keep his string alive. What I'd like to do before we get started is just remind everyone, it's been a while since we had an opportunity to talk, and I wanted to remind everyone that in December when we had our Analyst Day there's some themes that I want to hit on. We talked about execution, and over the last couple years, I continue to be completely satisfied with our teams' ability to stay focused, particularly as we transform our portfolio. Our teams within the business units have been focused on reinvesting in growth, but most importantly, being able to improve margins and continue to meet our commitments. As we talked in December, we've made a lot of progress around our operational excellence, our Johnson Controls Operating System, and it continues to bring and yield results for us as a company within our business units. And I think after the Auto spin, we talked a lot about that, and Bruce had an opportunity to meet with a bunch of you in January in Detroit about the Automotive business, about Adient, and we'll be well-positioned along with the Automotive business to be two great companies after the end of this fiscal year, and I'm pretty excited about that. And then as it relates to the path of the remaining Johnson Controls, I think that particularly as we talk about our announcement earlier this week and the portfolio changes that we made up to this point and how we've invested within our businesses, I think we're really on a path to achieve our multi-industrial status and make sure that we are in a position to reinvest in the business and continue to increase shareholder value. So with that, I'll start on slide seven. I won't spend a lot of time on this, but I just want to break a few things down for you to make sure that you understand that from an organic standpoint, although we're not exactly where we want to be, I am seeing some momentum in the business. If you sort out some of the numbers, you see that our FX has impacted us negatively along with a drop in lead prices within our Power Solutions business, and Brian will talk about that when he gets into each one of the businesses. Also, you have to take Hitachi and you have to make sure that you know that we now have that consolidated within our quarter and it's over $0.5 billion of increased revenue, but then you have to take the deconsolidation of the Interiors joint venture out, and it's over $1 billion. So if you look inside our businesses, what you see is Automotive business really exceeded our expectation around production levels across the board, and that would include China, by the way. And then BE is up organically 1%, and that excludes Hitachi and FX, and we have higher revenues, particularly in North America and the Middle East. And we'll talk later about North America, but we're seeing some real momentum in that business that we saw earlier, and I think last quarter, we had a little bit of a hiccup because some of the federal government work, but the secured sales continues to come, and our top line I think is in a position to continue to grow. And then Power Solution, if you take out the unit volume and you just take out lead and FX, we had a 3% growth, and I'm particularly happy with some of the sales increase we have in China. Once again, we continue to see margin expansion in the business at 130 basis points across the board. In Auto, we had record performance. We've never seen this kind of performance before in our first quarter, and we continue to see improvements within that business, and so we're setting that up for success. And then Power Solutions, again, with margins that are almost 20%. A little bit benefit from the low \u2013 the pressed lead position, but still we're seeing margin improvements within the business. And now we're seeing BE with the reinvestments into that business with a real position to \u2013 in a real position to grow. If you go to slide eight, let's talk about a couple of things here that I think are pretty important. You know that I'm pretty proud of how our team is accomplishing, and as I said earlier, and with the segmented income margins up 130 basis points and EPS 11% versus last year, even with a little softness in the top line versus where we wanted it to be, we've got a lot of headwinds in the business that are outside of our control, we continue to deliver on the bottom line despite that. And of course, as I said earlier, operational excellence across all of our functions continues to improve. And I would say that it includes everything from our procurement, our manufacturing operations, our supply chain and the productivity we're getting out of our sales force. We have a challenging macroeconomic environment, but we are gaining some momentum. If you look at our SSNA, our North American branch business, we saw orders grow in Q1 and we see the pipeline are up. If you look within North America and you just go to North America, you can see that orders are up 13%. Our chiller market share is up 170 basis points. Our hit rate is up; this is historical highs. And then within Q2, we see the pipeline continuing to grow. And so the institutional market focus that we have I think is starting to pay off. It's been a long time coming, but hopefully we'll continue to see that happen. And so we expect to see revenue growth and the pipeline continue to increase. Actually, in Asia, orders were up significantly in the quarter. Now in the context of things that we saw three quarters of orders being down prior to that, so we were happy to see Asia orders being up. And if you look at Hitachi, we're pretty happy with where we were. Now it exceeded our plan, we've got a long way to go with Hitachi and the integration, but the integration is going well. And as it relates to what our plans were for Hitachi, we had more profitability and better operational performance than what we planned, so off to a good start there. Power Solutions, great quarter; some real milestones, I was reflecting on Power Solutions and some of the growth. We're going to be adding some more capacity as we speak. Within 2017, we'll have another 6.5 million of units in a new plant in Power Solutions in China. And we hit a record of 1 million units of batteries shipped in China during December, and a little bit less than 3 million units for the quarter, and I was reflecting on that, because you know over the past few years, when I was at Power Solutions when we had our problem with the Shanghai plant, that plant was a 3 million unit plant. And so as we've moved through the past few years, we're now selling in one quarter of total capacity what we had when we first entered China with our Shanghai plant. And then AGM growth continues to be something that's accelerating. Our biggest challenge here is keeping up with capacity. We had a 41% growth in AGM, so the mix is working in our favor. You go to slide nine, we'll talk about the Auto separation, the Adient spin-off here in a few minutes, and then as you all know, we introduced the fact that we will merge with Tyco earlier this week. And I'm incredibly excited about what I've seen so far, the reaction by our customers, by our employees and by the folks that follow us, our investors. I do think it's going to be a win-win for both companies, certainly for our customers and our shareholders. And so I look forward to working with our partners at Tyco over the next few months as we work toward close. And I think that it's just going to be more exciting times to come for both companies. Back in December, I think there was a little bit of a disappointment. We talked about the fact that we were just a little unsure of ourselves as it relates to our share repurchase program and we wanted to pause that while we really understood what the costs and the cash flows were going to be associated with the Automotive spin. And I got a lot of feedback there at the meeting that there was a little bit of a surprise. I think it was the right thing to do, but we now understand how this is all going to come together, and so we're going to reinstate our repurchase program in the second half of this year. I think the stock price is at a place where it's a really good buy, and so we're going to \u2013 we plan to repurchase 0.5 million shares by the end of the fiscal year in the second half of the year. So I'm happy to report that. Go to slide 10, you know that Bruce announced earlier this month, and I found out just right before you did the name of the new company, Adient, and it's a real exciting step forward. A lot of things that are on this slide are consistent with what you saw if you were \u2013 if you either had the presentation or you were at the presentation that Bruce gave in Detroit, but there's only one real significant difference is that since that time, we've actually received another piece of business, a Hyundai Kia replacement business and a VW metals program, and so that moves from the $650 million of replacement business to $750 million. And of course we already had talked about $850 million of new business that we've seen in the business essentially since we made the announcement. So the team is working hard around separation. We're not seeing any hiccups in the business itself. And in fact, we're seeing momentum. The team is really excited about their future. You'll get some more information. The Form 10 should be out late March, early April, and then when that comes out, I think you'll get some of the details that you're probably looking for as we work toward getting that complete. I don't want to jump ahead of ourselves. And so I think when that comes, I think a lot of the questions that you might have and some of the things we're still working through will be answered. And then I think that as we talk about our capital structure, Bruce talked about that, and nothing has really changed as it relates to how we're thinking about the capital structure for Adient. On slide 11, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. This should look familiar; the Tyco and Johnson Controls merger, if you look at the key points on this particular slide, I just want to talk about a couple of things and make sure that it's absolutely clear, and we've gotten a lot of feedback over the last week. We see $650 million of synergies including operational and the tax synergies that we're going to get from the deal. That's something that we've taken to the bank and we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve. What we don't have in that is any revenue synergies. One of the things that you can expect from us over the next few months as we fully understand how that is going to come together and how we're going to integrate specifically, you can expect for us to update these numbers to include revenue synergies and the timing for that. So that's \u2013 we've positioned that as all upside to make sure that we didn't set some expectations that we couldn't meet. But I can tell you internally, our teams are incredibly excited about this opportunity, and I spoke with George Oliver, and his team is too. Post-merger, prior to any of the synergies, we're talking about a company with $4.5 billion of EBITDA, so I think the financial flexibility we'll have as a combined company certainly will be much enhanced from what we have today and what RemainCo would have had without the merger. If you go to slide 12, we've gotten a lot of feedback over the last week, and so we tried to put a slide together that I think is going to be very helpful. There's been a lot of feedback that we've gotten to make sure that people can understand because we are merging and then spinning, what is the value to the JCI shareholder and what are the mechanics and what's included what's not included. And so I think this slide certainly goes through some of the questions that we've gotten in particular. I'm not going to go through the entire slide because I think most of this stuff is something that we've talked about and that you've been able to understand. I think that the share repurchase helps you understand how we get from the current 650 million shares outstanding to the future combined company of 940 million shares outstanding after the repurchase program. So if you go back into the appendix, there is a slide that I think can help you get from the 650 million to the 940 million of shares, and that might close some gaps for some of the folks that are on the phone that were trying to understand some of the metrics around this deal. The $10.5 billion net debt is an important number, and if you look at what our \u2013 you look at our net debt-to-EBITDA is we'll be in a strong position, as I said earlier, to be able to have some flexibility moving forward. So with that, I think that as we move forward, we look forward to your feedback to make sure that we're as transparent as we can and make sure that you can \u2013 it helps you put together your models. I do know that it's a little bit of a challenge with a couple of the moving parts that we have here. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Brian and let him go through the businesses. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into page 13, just a couple housekeeping things. As you saw in the press release, our Q1 results from continuing operations are adjusted for the $87 million in separation cost, primarily related to the Adient spinoff that we incurred in the quarter. And as I talk through the business unit results and the financials, I'm going to exclude the $87 million in costs from my comments consistent with what we guided to previously to exclude those type of costs. And I'll also comment on just continuing operations as we go through the slides here. As you know, the formation of the Automotive Interiors joint venture in July 2015 and the closing of our Hitachi joint venture in October 2015, does impact the comparability of the quarter-to-quarter results, and so I will also refer to that as I go through the commentary here. And then lastly, we did file Form 8-K today, and that Form 8-K will break out for you the fiscal 2015 results with our new reportable segments for BE. It will give you annual fiscal 2014 results as well. And then as we move through 2016, you'll have the comparable quarter amounts for the four new business segments of BE. And those four new business segments are Systems and Services North America, Products North America, Asia, and Rest of World, and we have outlined kind of the mapping as to our old segments to the new segments in an appendix to the slide deck. So with that, let's go through slide 13 on Building Efficiency. Their sales in the quarter were $3 billion, which were up 18% from the prior year. If you adjust for Hitachi and FX, sales grew by 1%. Revenues in our Systems and Services North American business were up 4% year-over-year, and as Alex mentioned, we continue to see good momentum in the North American branch business. And the Middle East was up 31% quarter-over-quarter, and that was due primarily to several large jobs that closed here in the first quarter. However, Asia, excluding Hitachi, was down 3%, Europe was down 4%, and Latin America was down 31%, although the 31% is off a pretty small number. Orders secured in the quarter, excluding Hitachi and FX, were up 5%. We're very pleased with the share gains we saw in the North American region where orders increased 8%. As Alex mentioned, Asian orders were also strong in the quarter, up 10%, and we did see a bit of softness in the Rest of the World. Backlog is consistent at $4.5 billion, and we continue to see strength in the Systems and Services North American business, as far as the new business opportunities pipeline for the next six months, which is up 7%. If you look at segment income, year-over-year, up 10%. Ex-Hitachi and FX, it's up 2%, primarily due to the higher North American volumes. And as expected, with the Hitachi consolidation, our margins were down to 6.1% versus 6.6% in the prior year. But if you adjust out for the negative impact of Hitachi, we're flat year-over-year. And we'll comment that for the remainder of the year, we still are confident that the margins will be in line with the guidance that we provided in December, which is a 30 basis point improvement. So overall, a very solid Q1 for Building Efficiency. If we turn to slide 14, Power Solutions, their sales were down 6% compared to last year. But again, if you adjust for FX and the impact of lower lead prices, their sales were actually up 3%. And just to kind of put a little bit of color around the lead prices, the average price in Q1 of this year was $1,681 as compared to $1,999 in the first quarter last year, and that reduced price of lead finds its way through our top line. In terms of units, overall first quarter shipments were up 3%, with growth in all regions. Americas up 1%, Europe up 8%, and Asia was up 7%. And as Alex mentioned, we had a record 1 million units shipped in China in the month of December. We continue to see very strong AGM growth, with quite honestly demand outpacing our current capacity, and year-over-year volumes are up 41% to 3.2 million units. And we saw strong global volumes with the OEs up 4% and aftermarket up 3%. Segment income in the quarter was $342 million versus $315 million last year, an increase of 7%, primarily the result of the higher volumes, improved product mix and productivity improvements. The segment margin improvement was 260 basis points, but you really have to look at that exclusive of the impact of lead, and ex-lead, it was still up a solid 70 basis points in the quarter. So again, Power Solutions just continued to deliver strong quarters for us. So turning to the Automotive business, their sales were down 20% compared to last year, but as Alex mentioned, you've got to factor in the deconsolidation of the Interiors business with the joint venture that was formed in July of last year and FX. And if you consider those two items, sales were actually up 4% on across-the-board strong global production. China sales, which are primarily unconsolidated, as you know, improved 58% in the quarter to $3.3 billion, but that's inclusive of the Interiors joint venture. If you strip that out, China sales were up 11%. So again, very strong performance. For the quarter, segment income of $266 million was up 15% year-over-year, and Auto margins of 6.3% were up 180 basis points. Again, we get the benefit of the Interiors equity income being picked up with the sales not in the denominator, so if you adjust for that, the Automotive business still showed a 70 basis point improvement in the quarter versus last year. So Automotive simply continues to deliver excellent results for us. So if I take you to page \u2013 slide 16, overall first quarter revenues were down 7% to $8.9 billion. As Alex mentioned, you really kind of need to unpack that in three pieces. There's just short of $1 billion in Interiors revenue that we lost, and then we had headwinds with about $0.5 billion of foreign exchange, and then additive to that would be the Hitachi revenues of north of $500 million. So if you look at it that way and exclude those items, you end up that sales were actually up 2% on a consolidated basis and up across all three of our businesses. Gross margin for the quarter was 18.3%, up 160 basis points, and I think that's really reflective of the benefits we're continuing to see from the Johnson Controls Operating System. SG&A was level with last year. Really the way to look at that is the increases that came from the Hitachi JV were substantially offset by the deconsolidation of Interiors and ongoing cost savings and restructuring initiatives that we have across our business. Equity income was up strong, 37%, to $140 million, and that's really attributable to two pieces; the Interiors JV, which contributed about $20 million in the quarter, and then there were several JVs that came with the Hitachi business and they contributed between $15 million and $18 million as well. So that really is the entire gap there. So, overall, first quarter segment margins of 8.8% were up 130 bps versus 2015, and 80 basis points excluding the impacts of Hitachi and Interiors, so very strong performance as it relates to our segment margins. On slide 17, net financing charges were pretty level with last year. We did have a slight increase in our effective tax rate from 18.4% to 19%. And there were a few joint ventures that came with the Hitachi transaction that added about $10 million to the minority interest line in the current quarter. So, overall, we're very pleased with strong first quarter results and diluted EPS of $0.82, which is up 11% from last year. And I would just echo what Alex said, we're pretty proud of the management teams that are able to deliver these type of results quarter-to-quarter with all of the portfolio transformation that's really going across the company and could be potential distractions for us. But it simply hasn't been and we continue to deliver strong results. So, quickly, I'd like to hit the highlights in the balance sheet. At quarter end, we've got a net debt to cap of 39.1% versus the prior quarter of 40.5% and year-end at 36.7%. And our net debt of $6.7 billion is up from $6 billion at 9/30/15. And if you look at those ratios and the net debt position, it's really a function of the Hitachi investment we made in Q1. Capital spending at $300 million is in line with expectations and relates primarily as we've talked in the past about Power Solutions' growth investments. And then cash flow we made some good progress in the quarter. It's normally a cash outflow quarter for us, as you know. It was $300 million in the quarter, which was $100 million better than last year and we had $100 million of separation costs \u2013 roughly $100 million in the quarter as well, so stronger free cash flow performance this quarter than planned. So let's turn to guidance on slide 19. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.83, which would be up 10% to 14% from the prior year level of $0.73. And then consistent with our prior guidance, this will exclude the transaction and separation costs in the second quarter, and I note that again simply because we expect those costs to ramp up in the second quarter as we move toward a July 1 operational separation date with full legal separation in early October. The other thing we've done on page 19 is kind of lay out for you a chart that shows what our December analyst guidance was for sales growth by business and then our sink margin targets by business for fiscal 2016, and I would highlight a couple of things. As it relates to BE, we are seeing revenue softness in that business primarily in three areas; China, where it seems to be taking a bit longer to number one, secure orders, and then number two, to get the orders executed from a revenue recognition standpoint. So, that's causing a bit of softness for us as we look through the rest of the year. The Middle East, although strong in the first quarter, it looks like with oil prices where they are that there could be some softness in the back half of the year. And then the third area that I'd just point to is there were three or four federal jobs, one in particular, that we thought at the end of the year fiscal 2015 that we were going to secure in early 2016, and for a variety of reasons, those jobs have not been secured yet. And if they aren't secured, that'll provide a bit of downward pressure on our previously provided guidance as well. So, some softness we see in BE as it relates to the 9% to 11%. In Power Solutions, although unit volumes remain strong, the decrease in lead prices that Alex and I have talked about, as well as the FX impact in the year, could put a little pressure on the 9% to 11% at Power Solutions. Auto, on the other hand, continues to be very strong, and we would expect them to exceed the revenue guidance that we provided. As far as margins, despite the top line pressures that we see at BE and Power Solutions, we continue to be committed to that margin improvement as well as delivering on the $3.70 to $3.90 per share annual target that we provided in December, and that would be 8% to 14% improvement from the $3.42 that we delivered in fiscal 2015. So with that, Glen, we can open it up for questions. Glen L. Ponczak - Vice President-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Alex. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Sir, your line is now open. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Rob. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Wanted to follow up on the comments on commercial HVAC in Asia, both China and elsewhere. It looks like orders were actually pretty good in the quarter, but you also cautioned that China weakness is kind of weighing on the outlook. So, could you maybe unpack a little more of kind of what you're seeing in commercial HVAC in Asia, China and elsewhere? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so I think that \u2013 and you're right, I caution because you look across our businesses and just because you asked the question, I'll go ahead and answer it, but I'll also point out that we're really surprised with the strength in Auto and Power Solutions continue to gain share and grow dramatically there in China. But when we look at the Buildings business, there does seem to be some delays and some stickiness, and it's been pretty lumpy. If you remember, we had a couple of quarters where we were down. We had a real strong quarter, I think it was fourth quarter sales secured, and so it's pretty lumpy. And I think from our standpoint, it's probably just best for us to be cautious, and that's why when we talked about our guidance, we report on the top line. It's just become pretty hard to predict as it relates to the commercial business. I would tell you, though, that one of the real surprises we had, I was looking at the Hitachi sales and our VRF sales through Hisense, our \u2013 it's an unconsolidated joint venture in China, were up dramatically versus our plan. So I think it's more of a mix issue, and I think at the high-end infrastructure level some of the commercial projects we're doing moving a little slower than we thought. But our VRF sales are higher than what we expected. So, I think we're just going to have to continue to watch it. Thank goodness that North American market just seems to be kind of chugging along and gaining a little momentum. You didn't ask the question, but I looked inside our secured for North America, and it's truly institutional. If you look at within the institutional and also commercial, which we're seeing some benefit from the CB Richard Ellis relationship, within commercial and institutional, we're seeing that outpace some of the losses that we're seeing within the, essentially the manufacturing and retail segment. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. Got you. Just sticking with BE on the margin side, you talked about seeing improvements in the remaining quarters after some pressure in 1Q. Is that just about investment spending moderating, or what's driving that? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So as you look \u2013 and I'll let \u2013 get Brian get into some of the details, but if you look at the margins and you get into the new segments, you'll see that our product margins are under pressure, and that's where the investments are showing up. I think what our expectation is that we had some costs that won't repeat, but we certainly have reinvested in that business purposely, and you're going to see that pressure. It'll get offset, but you'll see that pressure is going to continue to be a little bit on the product side because that's where the investments show up. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Rob, I would just add to that. I mean, if you recall, in Q4 we took a pretty good size restructuring charge in BE. And if we look at the timing of those actions, some of those are occurring during the first quarter and we'll just get full run rate benefit for the year in the back half. So there's some improvement in margins just as a result of the timing of some of the restructuring actions we had. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And then just one last one for me. The resumption of the share repurchase, does that add to the EPS target for this year versus what was factored in at the Analyst Day? Thank you. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, at Analyst Day we had an average share outstanding of 652 million, and at that time, we indicated we were going to pause it for six months and then reevaluate. We had built into the guidance that we had given that repurchase program coming in for the entire $1 billion in the back six months of the year, and now we're doing $500 million, but instead of doing $1 billion at $50 a share, which was what we had built into our plan, we're doing $500 million at $35 a share let's say, just to pick a stock price. And the net effect of that is about a penny or so in the guidance that we gave, Rob. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. It benefits it by a penny. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Actually, it's the other way, right, because we had $1 billion in shares at $50 in what we guided, and it's going to be $535 million. So I think the net effect of that's a penny going the other way. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. Great. Thank you. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jonny Wright with Nomura. Sir, your line is now open. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi, guys. Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So just going to the Auto side maybe, I mean you guys are actually putting up some strong results despite certainly from some of the investors we've talked who seem more and more concerned about the Auto cycle. I know China's benefiting a little bit from the incentives that have been put in place there. But maybe you can talk about in developed markets what you're seeing, what you're hearing from companies and kind of your outlook for the remainder of 2016? Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it's Bruce McDonald here. Yeah, I think if I just sort of run through it regionally, you're right. The incentives that we've put \u2013 that got put in place in China that last till the end of the fiscal year have been pretty effective. If just look at the production throughout our quarter, and it accelerated and it continues to be pretty strong. I think there are some questions whether or not after the Chinese New Year's here in early February whether that strength is going to continue. But for now, the production schedules that we have for China look pretty good, and I think people are feeling fairly optimistic and probably much more optimistic than people looking outside into China are feeling. The Auto sector is doing well and the stock market impact in terms of the how widespread that is, is much lower than people think. So I feel pretty good about the outlook for China for the balance of the year, probably more so than most people. In Europe, I would say, after a long period of soft volumes, we're seeing sort of double-digit increases in some of the more mature markets like, Spain, France, Italy, the UK, and Germany. Those are holding up pretty well. Our customers are doing better there. A lot of us have taken big restructurings in Europe and so I think we are positioned well, and you'll have seen that in our margins, we're positioned well to benefit from the better volumes. I'd also point out that in Europe, it's primarily where all the luxury vehicles are made for Audi, BMW, Mercedes and the demand globally for the luxury is strong and that's helping us particularly in our Interiors business and seats because there's a lot more content there. And then in North America, things are looking pretty good. We're, I would say, doing better than the industry because of the enhanced content in larger SUVs and pickup trucks, which as you know are sort of hard to keep in stock here right now. So, I don't think there's a lot of extra growth in the tank for North America this year, but we are seeing a richer mix on larger vehicles and that will be a good thing for Johnson Controls. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that, Bruce. And on Power Solutions, 3% growth excluding FX and the lead impact, I think you guys are looking at close to double digits. But some of the key drivers in that business, you have the China record order \u2013 record shipments in the month, the AGM up 41% \u2013 look pretty robust. Maybe what's different there versus your prior expectation and kind of how do you see that playing for the rest of the year? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, well, the numbers are so big when you get to Europe and North America. When you start talking about AGM growth at 41% and China being record sales, it doesn't \u2013 we can't get to the 9% to 10% without both mix and growth within primarily North America, I mean that's really where we need to see it. And so I think that, I mean, I think we feel good about where things are, but it's a little bit out of our control. Particularly when you start talking about the aftermarket and what the weather's going to be and what the timing of that is going to be, but that's what moves the needle when you look at North America. So I think we feel like we're in good position. A lot of it has to do with what our customers are seeing. We're not in a position we're going to gain any more share in North America and so what we really need to see is some \u2013 we need to see the weather help us out here little bit so... Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, guys. Just, Brian, reported free cash flow this year is $1 billion still the target? Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Yeah, the guidance hasn't changed. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jonny. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just first a question on pricing within building efficiency. I guess firstly around \u2013 you talked about some of the private sector commercial activity maybe being a bit uneven. Have you seen any change in the ability of HVAC manufacturers to price? And then also on your margins what sort of affect do you see for price net of cost this year in BE? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're talking about based on commodities? Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah and your pricing net of commodity costs, yes. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So I actually don't have that in front of me, so I will have to get back with you and make sure I understand our net hedge position, primarily around copper. We certainly are seeing some help as it relates to our transportation costs, but I don't have an update on that. So we'll follow up on that specifically just so I don't misrepresent it. As it relates to pricing, I was talking to Bill Jackson, our President at Building Efficiency and he seems to feel pretty good that pricing has been rational and probably because we're starting to see orders increase a little bit that we're not under as much pressure, particularly in North America. I think the opposite is the truth when you get to places like China though. I think there's some pricing pressure in China. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thanks. And then just on Hitachi, you highlighted that it's off to a good start on growth as well as perhaps margins. I just wondered when you look at that business right now, how you think about the priorities there in terms of maximizing say VRF growth in the U.S. versus making sure that you can pull up the margins through cost synergies. And maybe how much higher do think you can push those margins at Hitachi over the next couple of years? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So I think if you were going after the most important things, I mean strategically we need to be able to get our position strengthened in North America in VRF, because we're going to market now, and Hitachi wasn't in the market. So I think that strategically is going to be important. As it relates to margins, our biggest lever on margins is going to be the business that's in Brazil, and the business that's in Japan and Iraq business, which is a residential business, and that's going to be more around cost than it is going to be around growth. So there's really two answers. One the long-term, it's going to be very important for us to continue in investing. So if you looked inside we should see we're investing in our distribution, and investing in places like North America to set up our channels and our training and our support system. And then if you look at our cost plan, it really is around the residential business and focused in Japan and Brazil. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On the commodity question, just to address that quickly, I do have some data here. So as it relates to BE in the quarter, we did get a commodity benefit of about $3 million, $3.5 million in the quarter, and we're forecasting for the year that that number could be around $14 million but based upon current FX levels across the two or three main countries that they do business in that are impacted negatively, it's pretty much offset as it relates to our plan. So there's really no commodity benefit net-net coming through if you consider FX as well. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike Wood with Macquarie. Sir, your line is now open. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, are Hitachi sales still expected to be about $3 billion for the full year? And is the lower run rate in fiscal first quarter just seasonality or is there something else there? Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so a couple of things there. The first quarter was $525 million, and it is seasonal to some extent. I would tell you that we had guided at about $3 billion of sales and $120 million a sync and in that $3 billion of sales there was an entity that's got about $250 million of sales that we were planning on consolidating. And as we got in and looked at the underlying agreements related to the joint venture itself, we determined from accounting standpoint that we weren't going to be able to consolidate that entity. So, instead of $3 billion for the year, our revenues related to Hitachi are going to be $2.75 billion or so, and that correspond where there's about $70 million in the quarter that was impacted as well. So that $525 million was originally targeted to be about $600 million. So, we are now looking at Hitachi for the year about $2.75 billion. And, yes, the $525 million in the first quarter reflects some seasonality in that business. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'd like to point out that the strong [exposed] you saw in China is in unconsolidated. So if you look at the topline growth, where we had the strongest sales, it happens to be \u2013 and where we saw the strength in China that was \u2013 representing earlier happens to be with Hisense which is unconsolidated. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Then approximately when should we expect to begin to see benefits of the restructuring in that resi business that you were planning? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a great question. I think the next time we get together I'll be able to update. In fact I'll be at a steering committee meeting tonight. So I'll be able to report on that. So I'm anxious to be able to tell you what the plan is, but I want to make sure that I get it hot off the press. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Sir, your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Josh. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just to follow up on some of the BE order momentum and maybe unpacking that growth algorithm to 10%. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm sorry. We can't hear you. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Can guys hear me? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, go ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Just to come back to that 10% outlook for BE, obviously some puts and takes internationally, and it sounds like the bottom line is North America is still pretty solid. I guess, Alex, how do you think about North America underneath that 10%, and where does the bridge from here really need to get better to start to move closer to that? Maybe the 10% number is more aspirational just given where we started, but what needs to get better or chilled from here to start looking more achievable? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : If we continue to see the kind of momentum we have in the quarter, particularly the end of the quarter, I mean I think that at some point, in North America, I think that we can get there. I just get a little bit nervous about things that are outside our control. I mean it seems like the actual market is doing better than the financial markets, but at some point the financial markets will make their way to the investors and that \u2013 investments and that's what worries me. I'm pretty bullish on what I see in North America, with one caveat is that there is this cloud hanging around as it relates to the financial markets that just what you hope is it doesn't get our customers spooked as it relates to investments. But the institutional markets are gaining steam, which is our strength. So knock on wood, I'm hopeful to be able to report that we will continue to see that growth. Unfortunately the one thing that we were counting on that did not come back, at least didn't come back at the pace we wanted was, if you remember we got sidetracked at the end of Q4 with the federal government work, it was huge projects, and a lot of them. And we had significant impact to our backlog and to our topline because of that, and we haven't seen that come back, hopefully we'll see it at the end of this year, when it comes to that time again, but it's always been something we can count on, and I'm just not sure if we can count on it now or not. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Would that branch business look even stronger ex government this quarter? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. The federal government \u2013 in fact earlier when I said that, I apologize, I said something about industrial \u2013 industrial and federal government together are the two ones that are off, not only where our backlog is, but we've seen that continue through the second quarter. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, I mean just to put it in perspective, the government jobs that I referred to that are really out there that we aren't sure if they're going to now be able to execute or even if they will be awarded to JCI given some of the deferrals that are going on are in the $125 million to $150 million range in aggregate. So that certainly is a piece that we need to work through for the rest of the year here. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. As I think about how that 10% broke down initially in December, it seemed like there were, if I'm recalling it right, about maybe three or four points of product \u2013 new product growth and channel penetration. How would you mark yourself against that bogie today? On track or there may be a bit of a gap there too? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There's a gap there and when you talk to the teams, I mean there's two things that when you look at the new segments you'll be able to see that. The product growth wasn't what we expected, and the margins because the investments were a little lower. One of the things that was a challenge for us in the first quarter was that when we were going through the integration of ADTI, one of our brands, our significant brands, we relocated one of the production facilities, and I think we had a hard time catching up with deliveries. So hopefully that will fix itself a little bit, but that was one of the problems we had in the quarter. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think with some of the product investments that we made in the first quarter, hopefully we will start to see some of that benefit in the back half of this year. But I mean just to kind of frame that you, between product investments and investments in sales resources, that number was almost $20 million in the quarter for BE, and you'll see that when you see the products North America segment data that's in the 8-K. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The other thing that this kind of a \u2013 to kind of pile on a little bit, the Hitachi channel work will show up in that number, too, which was \u2013 which is an investment that we have to put in place in order to get ready for sales for that particular product. So there was a significant amount of investments in the product North America business. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And just flipping over to Adient real quickly, it might be a little premature for this. I'll take a flyer. I guess with the new structure with Tyco one would imagine that Adient now comes out maybe a bit more tax advantaged than it would have otherwise pre-merger. Any way to maybe handicap what kind of tax synergies maybe versus the former imaginary case. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's a great question. It's a really good question, and I think as we work through that, we've talked about where we are and we just don't have it finally worked out. We will have it worked out by the time we get the Form 10 and the question you have is a great question, and I think that we are sorting through that now and we certainly will have that prepared between now and the Form 10 and so at the latest we will be able to have that then which is late March, early April. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good question. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Colin Langan with UBS Securities. Sir, your line is now open. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can I just clarify \u2013 I just want to understand the power solution outlook. I mean if we take out the impact of lead prices, does the outlook on your \u2013 for that segment actually really change? I mean is the sales-that's creating a sales headwind, but dollar margins seem like they're going to look better on a percentage basis, or is there some other underlying headwind there that we should also be considering. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's the way you should think about this business. So one of the things we wanted to make sure that we pointed out was that don't give us all the credit for the 260 basis points of margin improvement, because that's not all operational because as things move around, we may not be able to continue at that level. So that's why we point that out, that we are \u2013 because that's such a big part of that pass through that it does impact our margin. But you got it right. As lead prices go down, the margins go up. It doesn't impact us. There is a timing issue that flows through our books, but other than timing, it's kind of a net zero effect dollars wise. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And in terms of the outlook for Building Efficiency sales being at risk, you named three items, you quantified some like the federal jobs are maybe 1% of your growth. I mean if all of those items are issues what is sort of the bare case that you are looking at for that from that 9% to 11%? How bad do you think it will get if all of them come together at the same time. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Probably half that number. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I mean I think that's probably what we see now. I mean I guess it could get worse, but if we see \u2013 kind of if you look at where we are, when we talked about it, our backlog was actually down going into the year because of the federal government work. And so what you have to \u2013 what gets a little bit difficult to predict is if the product business doesn't grow, then we are really suspect to the revenue recognition of meeting a backlog and the flow-through to the work. So even if we are secured starts moving at the rate it's been growing at, we'll still have a revenue issue, and so we need to get those orders in now. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Very helpful. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But I would tell you, we've got a contingency plan as it relates to, if that were to happen, we've got actions that we can take to ensure that we still deliver the segment income and the margins and what we've kind of put out there for our full-year guidance. So, we're working the issue relative to top line and adjusting our cost structure accordingly. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, absolutely. So our investments will certainly mirror our top-line prospects. We have not changed our commitment regardless of where we fit in that revenue as it relates to our bottom line, because the other part of this is, it's not like you can't see it coming as it relates to revenue. If our backlog doesn't improve, we're certainly not going to be able to make the investment as quickly as we planned. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Rod. Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. It's actually Pat Nolan on for Rod. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Pat. Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just a similar question on Power Solutions the organic growth, the 9% to 11%. I know it's not the biggest quarter this quarter but how are you \u2013 if things are tracking pretty much in line with what you're seeing at the end of the quarter, where do you think that 9% to 11% ends up for the year? And just a housekeeping. What was the actual revenue impact from lead in the quarter? Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm sorry, the... Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Revenue impact on lead? Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Revenue impact on lead was about $50 million in the quarter. And as far as where the 9% to 11% could go, I guess based upon what we've seen, it could go down to 7% to 8%, yeah, but again, I would tell you that if it goes down to that level, we've got plans in place to cover. So at this point in time, whatever shortfall we might see at BE and Power, we think Auto is over-performing, and so we're very comfortable with where we are for full-year guidance. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and remember, as it relates to any of the lead impact to top line, it's not something that we should feel from a bottom line perspective. Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Operator, we've got time for one more. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is now open. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, thanks for taking the question. So with the Tyco merger now another major integration to manage, just wondering how, if at all, does that change your thinking about the capital allocation strategy once all these ducks are put in a row? Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Do you mean as it relates to after the... Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes after the spinoff and the dividend receipt, the influx of cash, how could all of this change any of your thinking about capital allocation say between M&A, share repurchase? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I don't know that it changes anything except that we're going to have an awful lot going on. And so depending on where we are, and if you look at the cash flows that we look at, I mean, it's going to ramp up because we'll still have some trailing costs as it relates to integration moving into next year even the separation. So I think as our cash flows improve, depending on where we are with the integration, I would expect that we're going to make the right decision as it relates to whether we return that to the shareholders or make investments. I don't know that we've gotten that far, but one thing I can tell you for sure is around our dividend policy, we're both, at this point, we're both committed to making sure that at a minimum we continue the current dividend policies of both companies. And we have \u2013 just to make sure that you understand where we in the process, there's an awful lot of the stuff that we really have to continue work through. We haven't really had a lot of those conversations yet as a team. But we're going to have significant cash flow, that's for sure. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, if I have time for one quick follow-up just to come back to Power Solutions and specifically to AGM, 41% growth in shipments. Maybe at a high-level could you talk about your level of, let's call it, medium-term visibility over the next few years, you're significantly expanding capacity. How much of that visibility related to design-ins and customer commitments and what's sort of the right mix of aftermarket versus OE to think about? Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that \u2013 so a great question. It's still going to be a lot more OE than aftermarket because the OE business is growing so fast. And our visibility to that is pretty high because usually it's program driven. A lot of the AGM capacity that we're talking about adding has been in China, but what we're seeing is across the board. I mean we'll be adding capacity in Europe. A lot of that is because the aftermarket is starting to happen there because we've been at it much longer. And in North America, there's actually more than aftermarket that's already there surprisingly. It's not necessarily for start-stop. It's just for enhanced performance, and in China it's really \u2013 it's an OE story. So I think it's still going to be a heavy mix for OE and I think that what we see is that most of the capacity if not almost all of it is already subscribed that we're putting in. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Excellent. Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So let me close out. I mean I just want to comment again. I'm not sure if you were sitting in my shoes how you couldn't feel good about the ongoing performance of the business. We continue to meet the expectations that we set not only as an overall business but within the segments, continue to improve our margins and I think our investments, particularly in BE, we're starting to see the shoots of growth and I'm pretty proud of all that that everybody's accomplishing. And hopefully you feel the same way that I do that our strategic position is improving. I think Adient is going to be an incredible competitor within the Automotive space and we're setting up to be successful. That's our plan and then if you look at the remaining Johnson Controls, not only the investments we're making now, but you look at the transformational merger that we talked about, we have an opportunity to be something really special and I think that we'll actualize that. So I hopefully have the same confidence I have and we look forward to continue reporting, achieving our near-term and our long-term plan, so thanks a lot. Have a great day. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I was reflecting about our discussion at the Analyst Day in December, and I thought I might just spend a couple of minutes reviewing a few things with everyone. In December, we talked about opportunity, opportunity that was in front of Johnson Controls and what a bright future that we had. And at that meeting, we committed to a few things. One is execution, and that's both our strategic and financial execution and meeting our commitments. Transformation, of course, at the time, we were really talking about the Adient spinoff and the Hitachi integration. Of course, things have changed since then, but we continue to be committed to transforming our business. Making strategic acquisitions, those that made sense and where it makes sense in order to support our growth platforms. Continuing on our drive for operational excellence; we're seeing that in the maturation of our Johnson Controls operating system and we continue to see and realize tangible results. Building a growth platform, a platform that includes both building technologies and energy storage, and a focused separate automotive company with a shifted orientation toward growth. And increasing shareholders value; focused on our multi-industrial company vision to create value through improved cash flow, improved margins, and a sustained top line. I hope you're seeing this through our actions and that we're laser-focused in order to make this vision a reality. So, let's start on slide seven. For the second quarter, I'm really pleased to talk about what our team was able to accomplish. We're able to execute and make significant progress as we transform ourselves into two leading global companies. We saw organic growth across all of our businesses this quarter. In Systems and Services North America, we continued to see positive momentum with revenues up 9% in the quarter and strong orders secured of 7%. Our backlog is up 2%. If you recall, it was flat last quarter, and so we continue to add to our backlog. And our North American pipeline is up 8% driven by activity in healthcare, higher ed and public transportation. In North America, we're seeing strong year-over-year growth in most of our HVAC businesses and we continue to gain share with a focused account management and solutions based approach. We continue to make investments in our future. We're launching new products in direct expansion, we've made increased investments at our chillers through our screw products, and we have new investments in our Metasys control systems, in fact, we're launching a new launch here in June for our Metasys controls. For Power Solutions, our investments in our additional capacity in China is paying off in a really big way; record shipments for the quarter, up 60% versus prior year. We've more than doubled our aftermarket shipments and we've grown our original equipment shipments over 20%, and sales of AGM units in China are nearly twice what they were last year this quarter. Our operational execution demonstrates our ability to continue to deliver as we effect our transformation. Our segment margins are up 160 basis points, including the contributions from Johnson Controls-Hitachi and, along with some offsets, as we continue to invest in new products and salespeople to fuel our future growth. Our adjusted EPS is over 18% up over prior year. Feedback from our customers, as we move towards our Adient spin and our Tyco merger, is extremely positive. In May, we'll be at the EPG Conference. We'll have an opportunity to talk about some of the feedback that we're getting. So I'll leave those comments to then. But just suffice to say that our customers, both from an Automotive perspective and our customers in our Buildings business are pretty excited about the opportunity in front of us. Speaking of our Building Efficiency business, we've had some great wins in the quarter. We secured a 20-year contract, $68 million with Norfolk Navy Base in our energy solutions business. And we've also got a partnership with Target to replace 3,600 rooftop units at 225 Target stores. And this is a three-year project in order to improve the efficiency of the units that they currently have with more efficient HVAC equipment. Our automotive seating order wins continued to accelerate during the first half of 2016, where we have nearly the same amount of orders in the first half of this year that we had all of last year. And our Interiors joint venture, which is deconsolidated, has secured business of over $7 billion since we made the announcement last summer. Our Johnson Controls-Hitachi joint venture integration is going extremely well. The strong quarter in Q2 exceeded our plan expectations; great performance in Taiwan, Japan, and in China, where we continue to take share in VRF. We're making great progress in our market plans across Europe and Asia and we're beginning to see increased backlog in base's design work in North America. We're making product investments within our base business in order to support the joint venture and you'll see this impact of the increased spending when you see our Products North America segment this quarter. We're reducing our tax rate for the year from 19% to 17%. And we benefit from the continuous long-term tax planning initiatives that we have underway. I'd like to address our top line growth. If you noted on our first quarter earnings call, we continue to gain momentum in our future top line. We're not converting the pipeline as quickly as we originally expected. So we now estimate our sales growth for BE to be 2% to 4% for the year, and we're very encouraged with what we see in North America. Unfortunately, we have some headwinds in the Middle East in our industrial refrigeration business, mostly driven by the lower oil prices in the region. A little bit of softness in China, more than what we expected in new construction starts, but, overall, when we look at our pipeline and our backlog, we're pretty pleased. For Power Solutions, we're updating our estimates to 4% to 6% growth for the year. Its positive share growth in North America and in China, but it's being impacted by lower lead prices. We're also seeing some warmer weather in Europe and North America than we expected, but we really feel very good about what's happening within Power Solutions. In Auto, we're increasing our estimates. Where in the past we talked about a decline of 2% to 3%, we think we'll be able to have that as we see benefits in the U.S. from higher SUV mix, more content, luxury segment is doing well, and that helps drive our volume. We have Bruce here, so later on, he'll be able to answer some specific questions that you may have. Our pipeline and backlog continues to build. We continue to effectively manage our cost and improve our productivity and so, as a result, we're able to increase our full year guidance. This is a result of a strong operating performance as well as a reduction of our go-forward tax rate, and Brian will cover more about that in a future slide. Move to slide eight. Let's talk about the financial highlights. I'll hit this quickly, so Brian will get into more detail. We really have a lot of moving pieces on our top line with the deconsolidation of the Interiors joint venture is about $1 billion, and the addition of our Johnson Controls-Hitachi revenues is about $740 million, but, as I noted earlier, we're seeing overall organic growth in all of our businesses that results in a 3% organic growth for the quarter, 3% in BE, 5% in Power Solutions and 2% in Automotive. Segment income is up 22%, excluding FX, with margins up 160 basis points; EPS up 18%. I'd like to talk a little bit about Auto. Record profitability in the quarter with production levels ahead of our plan levels, and we're benefiting both from the restructuring actions and our operational efficiencies. Great margins expansion, 250 basis points. Power Solutions has higher volumes that are being offset by our China launch cost. So we're seeing 10 basis points improvements in margins. And BE segment income is benefiting from the Johnson Controls-Hitachi joint venture, higher volumes, and that is being offset by our continued product and sales force investments that will drive our future growth. Let's go to slide nine and talk about the Johnson Controls-Tyco merger. There's a lot of discussion about the recent announcement and what the impact is on our plans. We're moving full steam ahead. We're executing against our day one and we're making tremendous progress. And our teams are working well together. And I'm really personally energized by the strategic nature of the deal and the opportunities it presents. Every day, as we get involved in this, I see more and more opportunity. We have an Executive Steering Committee that George Oliver and myself lead, along with integration teams from both companies. We're on a clear path to capture the value of this unique combination. As you all know, Tyco filed the S-4 on April 4. We received HSR regulatory approval during the quarter, and we do expect all the remainder approvals to be received within our timeline. We anticipate that the Johnson Controls and Tyco shareholder meetings will happen in the July/August timeframe and we're targeting October 1 as the merger date. I know many of you are aware and many of you have been asking about the new Treasury regulations that were recently released. Early this morning, we filed an 8-K jointly with Tyco, confirming that following the review of the U.S. Treasury's Temporary and Proposed Tax Regulations issued on April 4, that we will proceed with the merger and continue to expect $650 million of previously announced synergies over the next three years after closing. Those synergies will include operational and tax synergies. We'll provide additional updates on the progress at the EPG Conference in May when George and I will be presenting together. Let's move on to slide nine and talk about Adient. The Adient separation is on track to be a successful independent public company. Great momentum, just talked about great new business wins, record profitability and tremendous progress both on the organization and on the business. Bruce has the executive team already in place and its Board of Director appointments is substantially complete. The project management office, which is being led by our Vice President of Enterprise Operations, Jeff Williams, is on track toward our targeted internal day one of July 1. So we've got plenty of time in order to make sure that we are successful on the public date. The Form 10 we expect to file by the end of April and you should expect the separation cost to be within the disclosed range that we talked about earlier of $400 million to $600 million. Half of these costs come from IT. We're targeting a spin date of October 31, 2016. And Adient will be a foreign domiciled entity when we spin. Adient's employees, plants and income is primarily outside the United States and, as a result, we expect the effective tax rate for Adient to be in the range of 10% to 12%. This adds significant value and improved cash flow for our shareholders. Turn it over to Brian. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. So we had a very strong underlying Q2 quarter here. As you saw in our press release, our reported results do include transaction, integration and separation costs associated with our portfolio activities of $131 million, a restructuring charge of $229 million and a couple of non-recurring tax items that net to $765 million, which resulted in a net charge of $1.68 in the current quarter. We've included a summary of these items in the appendix, but given their size, let me just provide a brief overview on those three items. As far as the transaction, integration and separation costs, as you can imagine, those relate primarily to the Adient separation, and as Alex mentioned, those were in line with the previously provided amounts of $400 million to $600 million. As far as the restructuring charge of $229 million, that relates to the Automotive business as well as the ongoing stranded cost reductions that we're going after as we move toward the Adient separation date of 10/31. I would just note that substantially all of the Automotive restructuring will be funded in fiscal 2017 and beyond. There were two items in the tax charge. One item is really consistent with some of our previous divestiture transactions, GWS, Interiors and electronics, where we had a $780 million non-cash charge, and this relates to the required accounting for earnings, which are offshore, which were previously deemed to be permanently invested, which no longer will be, and we need to provide a book charge on that. But, again, it's a non-cash charge. The second piece of that is a benefit of $15 million that came through in the second quarter. That really reflects the first quarter impact of our tax rate reduction from 19% to 17%. As I talk through the business unit results and the financials, I'll exclude the impact of these three items from my comments as these items were excluded from previously issued guidance. And then also, consistent with Q1, the formation of the Automotive Interiors joint venture, which occurred in July 2015, and the closing of the Johnson Controls-Hitachi joint venture in October of 2015, those do impact the comparability of quarter-to-quarter results, and I'll comment on that as we move through the slides. So moving to slide 11, Building Efficiency second quarter sales of $3.2 billion were up 33% from the prior year. If you adjust that for the impact of the Hitachi joint venture as well as FX, our sales grew 3%. We did see strong Systems and Services North American growth, which was up 9% year-over-year, as we continued to see strength in our North American branch business. Ex foreign-exchange, Asia was up 3%, Europe was down 4% and Latin America, although small, was down 15% from the prior year. Orders in the quarter, excluding the Hitachi venture and FX, were up 5% for the second consecutive quarter. We experienced share gains in Systems and Services North America where our orders increased 7% year-on-year. In addition, our Asian orders were also strong, up 9%, and we did experience some softness in Latin American orders, which were down 19%. And as Alex mentioned, backlog is up to $4.7 billion, a 2% improvement. Year-on-year segment income of $245 million was up 43%, excluding the impact of FX, due to the contribution from the Hitachi joint venture as well as higher volumes in North America and Asia. I would point out that the integration of our Hitachi business is now well underway, and VRF product and sales force investments are being made on a global basis. Given these aggressive global integration efforts, the Johnson Controls-Hitachi actual results are really becoming difficult to measure on a stand-alone basis. However, we estimate that BE had mid-single digit segment income growth exclusive of the joint venture. Just as an example, as you'll see in our Form 10-Q, you'll see VRF product investments impacting the Products North America segment margins throughout fiscal 2016. Overall, BE segment margins of 7.8% were up 50 basis points from the prior year. So a strong quarter from BE. Turning to slide 12 and Power Solutions, sales were level compared to the last year. However, if you adjust for FX and the lower lead prices, sales were actually up 5%. In terms of units, overall second quarter shipments were up 3%, with the Americas up 2%, Asia up 28% and Europe down 4%. We continue to see strong AGM growth with year-over-year volumes up 18% to 3.1 million units and Q2 global OE and aftermarket volumes each increased 3% year-over-year. Segment income in the quarter of $264 million was up 3%, excluding FX, primarily the result of higher unit volumes, partially offset by the planned launch costs associated with capacity investments we're making in China. Segment margins were up 10 basis points in the quarter and remain above our expectations on a year-to-date basis. Moving to Automotive, who had another very strong quarter, sales were down 18% compared to last year. But as Alex mentioned, adjusting for the Interiors consolidation and FX, sales were actually up 2% on strong global production. And we saw production up North America 5%, China 4% and Europe 3%. Seating volumes in North America and Asia continued to be very strong, although, we did see some weakness in Europe and South America within the second quarter. In China, where we go to market primarily through unconsolidated joint ventures as you know, our 100% sales improved by 51% in the quarter to $2.9 billion. Adjusting for the Interiors joint venture and FX, China sales were up 9%, which compares very favorably to industry production of 4% in China. For the quarter, segment income of $324 million was up 26% year-over-year, total Automotive margins was 7.5% or at a record level, up 250 basis points, and that's 140 basis points if you adjust for the Interiors deconsolidation. And these significant positive results reflect the benefits of the higher volumes as well as ongoing restructuring benefits at Automotive as well as continued operational efficiencies around JCOS. Turning to slide 14, on a consolidated basis, overall second quarter revenues were down 2% to $9 billion, but that was driven by the deconsolidation of Auto Interiors business and the unfavorable impact of FX, offset by the consolidation of the Hitachi joint venture. Excluding the impact of these items, sales were up 3% with all three businesses showing year-over-year increases. Gross margin for the quarter of 19.1% was up 200 basis points versus the prior year, as we continue to see the favorable impact of the Johnson Controls Operating System efforts as well as improved product mix. You'll note that SG&A was up 6% from last year. This really reflects the consolidation of the Hitachi joint venture as well as the products and sales force investments that are being made in BE, and that's partially offset by the deconsolidation of Interiors and ongoing cost reduction activities within the company. Equity income of $117 million was 43% higher than year ago levels, and that relates primarily to the Interiors joint venture, as well as some of the joint ventures within the Hitachi consolidated venture that we have. Overall, second quarter margins were 9.2%, 160 basis points better than 2015. Turning to slide 15, net financing charges of $74 million were slightly higher than last year. I guess the highlight on the page is that we have reduced our effective tax rate from 19% to 17%, related primarily to tax planning associated with the Adient spinoff and, of course, that gave us a $0.02 benefit in the quarter. This is a sustainable rate at the 17% level in the near term. And we continue to see the tax rate benefits of our global tax planning initiatives that are being put in place in connection with our portfolio transformation over the last couple of years. Income attributable to non-controlling interests is up $41 million compared to last year. That primarily relates to the contribution of the Johnson Controls-Hitachi joint venture and, as we've talked before, that venture has several majority-owned ventures within it as well, and so that year-over-year increase is significant. Overall, very strong second quarter results with diluted earnings per share at $0.86, up 18% versus $0.73 year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow at quarter-end, our net debt-to-cap ratio of 40% compares to the prior year second quarter of 41.2% and 39.1% and 12/31/15. Our net debt of $6.7 billion is down $700 million versus a year ago and level with 12/31/15. And our capital spending remains in line with our target for fiscal 2016 of $1.3 billion. Turning to cash flow, I'm pleased to report that our Q2 cash flow of $400 million is an improvement of $300 million versus the prior year and that includes $100 million of transaction, integration and separation costs. However, I should also point out that in the second quarter of last year we did have $200 million of one-time tax payments, but still, on a net basis, we're plus $200 million for the quarter. So we're making progress in this area. We still have some work to do, but we had a good second quarter. And then, finally, we plan to resume our share repurchase program shortly and expect to buy back $500 million of shares by the end of fiscal 2016. Moving to slide 17 and our guidance, we expect third quarter earnings per share of $1.01 to $1.04, which will be up 11% to 14% from the prior year. And consistent with prior guidance, this would exclude any transaction, integration and separation costs or any other one-time items that we would have in Q3. And then, lastly, we are raising our full year guidance from $3.70 to $3.90, up to $3.85 to $4.00, which is up 13% to 17% from fiscal 2015, and this really reflects the momentum we have from our strong year-to-date operational performance as well as the reduction in our effective tax rate from 19% to 17%. So with that, Kathie, we can open it up for questions. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Operator, we'll now start the Q&A. We have a long queue today, so if you could please limit it to one question and one follow-up and then get back in the queue, it would be much appreciated. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Your line is now open. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, my question is pretty straightforward, but any update on the stranded costs post the Adient spin? I think at the Investor Day, you said it was $150 million to $200 million. Is that still the range or is that actually maybe a little worse or better? Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The $150 million to $200 million is still a good number and we're on track to take those costs out prior to entering fiscal 2017. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And I guess one \u2013 and then one maybe a quick follow-up here. Any color on free cash flow conversion? That would be a popular topic among investors. Do you think the 77% is still on track? And you're on track to get it to your midterm of, I think, it was 80%, 85%? Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think, Colin, when we put the free cash flow conversion slide together at Analyst Day, we did have a couple of pro forma adjustments in there for tax payments that would be one-time related to transactions, but we were $200 million ahead in the second quarter and we're $100 million ahead in the first quarter. Some of that might be a bit of timing, but I think the 77% that we gave you, I like to think there's a bit of upside to that, but we're certainly comfortable with the 77% still. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Colin. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Good morning, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just a follow-up on the BE guidance, Alex, I think the 2% to 4% probably more in line with where you guys are tracking on sales and orders. But could you maybe hash out how that looks on an EBIT basis because, clearly, margins are performing better here in the interim? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So I think that what you probably heard and maybe this is a good opportunity to even talk about a little bit is, what you're seeing is, we're seeing an improvement in Hitachi better than what we expected. But one of the things that's causing us a little bit of tentativeness here is we're spending an awful lot of money in the core business outside of the Hitachi joint venture in order to build a pipeline. So our sales efforts in North America, Europe and parts of Asia and South America are outside of the joint venture. And so that will impact our core margins a bit. So when we talk about our margins, it will be very difficult for us to talk about core margins versus consolidated margins, because we're doing stuff in and outside of the joint venture, but I think what we're seeing some \u2013 we're seeing leverage on the BE business more than what we expected, even though we're making the investments we're making. I don't know that we have a guidance at this point, but we probably just need to follow up on that. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. And then just as a follow-up, I noticed when you guys reiterated the $650 million of synergies, it didn't quite get bucketed out. Should we still think of it as a $500 million of operational, $150 million of tax? And maybe as a corollary to that, you mentioned some of these integration teams coming together and the excitement building. Do think that means that those numbers look conservative? We're realizing them earlier? How should we think about some of that early excitement? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that the early excitement should translate into more synergies. Obviously when you get teams together, they're probably more excited about the revenue opportunities than anything else and that's one of the things that we still haven't talked about and, hopefully, we'll be able to, at a minimum, start giving examples. But what I would say is we want to break out the $650 million. Obviously, the new regulations do have \u2013 would have an impact on our tax planning. And so it wasn't without us having to go back and revisit what the tax planning would be to see what we could recover from the new regulations. But I don't know that we're comfortable talking about what the split is, but the new regulations did have an impact on us, but we are going to be able to achieve tax synergies, but they're global tax synergies. It's not always in the U.S. when you look at where our opportunity is. I don't know if you have any more comment on that. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I would just add to that. When we came up with the synergy numbers of $500 million and $150 million, that was early on in the process and we obviously had ranges around each of those areas; synergies from costs and synergies from taxes. And I would just say that as we've gone back and looked at the opportunities for global tax planning as well as understanding Tyco's tax footprint and their understanding of ours, that the range that we had for tax, we're still very comfortable that we're going to be able to be within the range of tax synergies that we quoted previously. So I think from our standpoint, it's full speed ahead. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks for the color, guys. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Rob. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Hey, Rob. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I had a question on tax as well. I just wanted to clarify. So, as we think about JCI ex Adient, so the piece that's merging with Tyco, is it going to be joining with Tyco having this 17% tax rate? Is that the idea? Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think, what we're saying, Rob, is our tax rate in the near term we think is sustainable at 17%. So when I say near term that takes us through fiscal 2017. The Tyco tax rate, I think, has historically been in that 17% to 18% range. So if you put the two companies together and then layer on, over a three-year period, that we think there's $150 million of tax synergies, I think that's kind of the way to think about it. So as we put the two companies together, we're just going to have to kind of work through what the ultimate rate is. But I think we've been talking in terms of 17% to 18%, and I would say that the guide down to JCI of 17% means that we think we may do a little better than that. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And then maybe just... Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Rob? Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Just wanted to make sure that you also \u2013 kind of the news on this was the Adient tax rate was something that we hadn't talked about previously also. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes, indeed. And it was pretty striking to see it at that level. So I was curious if somehow the split between the two impacted the way the business would look as it entered the merger. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, in fact, a big part of the integration process is to make sure that as we do our planning that we do tax planning during the \u2013 I'm sorry, the separation over the last year. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And then maybe just on BE, it looks like there's definitely some good momentum building there, especially, in North America. I think, Alex, you called out healthcare and education was where you were seeing the strength and so, perhaps, is government a lagging? Any color on the verticals? And then, if you could also just comment on pricing. As this order momentum builds, is the pricing of the backlog, would you say, accretive or dilutive to the segment margins? Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that \u2013 I don't know that (33:04) these are mostly contracts, so I think it's really a variable margin play. I don't know that we're really looking at a fixed cost play. So I do think that it's accretive. Now, it's going to come down to the mix of the size of projects. Typically, the larger the project, the lower the margin, but also, it has lower SG&A to go along with that. So I think that we're going to see accretive \u2013 the business is going to be accretive as volume runs through it, particularly, as we have pull-through. Again, a lot of this business is not performance contracting business, so a lot of this business is core construction business, which means it's going to drag along equipment and controls, which will have an accretive component to our business. Those are real positives. The other thing that I'd say is around the verticals. We talk about transportation, I would call that really more of a state and local government vertical, which is infrastructure related. That seems to be holding up; education, healthcare. We're also \u2013 and we didn't talk about it in our comments, we're also seeing in our commercial business is doing pretty well, and that's really on the back of our CBRE business. We're seeing significant orders through our relationship with CB Richard Ellis. So, we're hitting on a lot of key initiatives and the market seems to be holding up with an 8% pipeline in front of us. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open. Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities : Hi. Thanks for that color on the commercial verticals. Could you also provide some trends on commercial in terms of split between renovation activity and new construction and what you're seeing in the pipeline? And also maybe the various size tonnage equipment and where you're seeing most of that pipeline come from? Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, so this is kind of a global picture. If you look at from a global perspective, actually, our large tonnage business is not doing well as more of our mid-market or mid-tonnage spends. And that's primarily driven by markets like the Middle East, markets that are driven by infrastructure spending. When you look at North America, I think what we're seeing is, basically, the same thing. It's kind of a mid-market on revenue, but on the secured, there's some very, very large infrastructure projects. So I think, today, our mix would probably be more toward mid-size equipment. I think that the secured pipeline is looking toward larger projects and larger tonnage. Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities : And you'd mentioned Hitachi exceeding expectations initially. Is that sales or margins? And do you have a clear plan at this point now with how to fix the resi business or has that began? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, I would tell you, on the Hitachi, we're seeing both the top line has been something that's been a pleasant surprise. Tremendous growth, particularly, in the Asian markets in market share, and we're also seeing margins better than what we expected. So I think, on both counts, we're seeing with Hitachi. As it relates to residential, right now, the plan that we have in residential, we have a lot of new products that are out in the marketplace. We're making some initiatives, but nothing transformative at this point. Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities : Thank you. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just a first question maybe on Power Solutions. You had obviously enjoyed exceptional margin expansion and then, obviously, that seems to be sort of leveling out a little bit. I just wondered if you could call out how severe and how long do you expect the headwind from those China launch costs to be? Was that sort of a blip that you saw in Q2 and the second half margin expansion should be more considerable? Any color there? Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So when we talked at the December meeting, we actually guided margins down 50 basis points from 17.5% to 17%, and I think we called out at that meeting there was going to be some China launch costs, certainly, throughout fiscal 2016. So, we're starting to see those now. Even with those, we had a 10-basis point improvement in Power Solutions margins, and year-to-date, they're still up pretty strong. So there will be more of that in the second half of the year. And then, as you know, we're also in the middle of constructing a plant in the north in China, and so I think the investment and some of the launch costs in China we're going to continue to see for a period of time. But I would tell you, sitting here today, when we look at the margins for Power Solutions, the 17% that we guided to in December, we're well ahead of that pace right now for fiscal 2016. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you. And then, back to Building Efficiency. I think there's been sort of very mixed and mostly negative sort of comments on China construction for quite some time. Your own sort of Asia orders though have been very good actually, up 9% to 10% the last six months. So maybe give us some background as to how you're able to drive that? Any particular verticals or countries that you think are key behind that sort of very high-single digit above-market average growth? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This is Alex. So, what I would tell you is that China has been a headwind for us, with the exception of what we're seeing through Hitachi in our VRF business. So that business is growing pretty quickly. When you look outside of China, I don't know that you can point to one particular country, but, across the board, the ASEAN countries were seeing growth. And what I would tell you, as it relates to China, it's kind of a mixed bag. We're \u2013 it's choppy. We're seeing some orders. We saw some \u2013 I wouldn't call it momentum, we saw some sprouts here in the last few months. We're also seeing some new infrastructure projects that are on the board when you look out west, and so we're hopeful that it will come back with some stimulus money here. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you very much. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good Morning, Jeff. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Good Morning, Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. A couple of follow-ups. First, just on the Target deal, I'm intrigued by that. Your name doesn't usually come to top of mind when I'm thinking kind of big retail retrofit job, so congrats on that. But could you elaborate on what drove that? Was there \u2013 it sounds like there were some performance contracting tied to it. And do you have a pipeline of some additional opportunities there? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, actually, it wasn't a performance contract, it was more of a \u2013 it was based off of energy savings, but it really wasn't a performance contract, and I think that what you should see is that, over time, I think we'll continue having more activity there, but it's probably something that we are under-utilizing. I agree. It's something that you don't see a lot. I do think that we have a set of new products that makes us more competitive in that market, so we probably haven't been approaching it aggressively, so, hopefully, you'll see more in the future. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And on the government side, Alex, things have been hung up there for a while. This Navy project broke free. Do you have a decent size front log (40:44) on the U.S. government side in particular? And how do you think that plays out over the balance of the year? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think we talked about, about $150 million if I remember the recall that got hung up. I think we're going to see about half of that and the Navy project would be in that half as it relates to projects that were hung up. Moving forward, we still have a headwind around the U.S. federal government related to our historical plans. So, we're not really counting on that this year to save our day until we get kind of through this fiscal situation that we have with the U.S. government. But we are glad to see that we were able to get that project freed up. There are probably a few more, but we'll get about half of what we expected. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Thank you. And then just a quick one on Adient, should we still be kind of thinking dividend roughly two terms on EBITDA? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm going to let Bruce talk to you about that. Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : Well, actually, I think, on the slide in the deck here, when we talk about the Adient separation, we're just finally icing that with our advisors. The first turn here of the Form 10, it won't have the dividend in there, but that's something that is top of mind for us and we're working with Brian and his team on that. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : All right. Thank you. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Kwas from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow up on Power, so Start-Stop coming in at 18% for the quarter, that's good growth, but down pretty considerably from the 30% and 40%s run rate that you've been realizing over the last several quarters. Just curious in terms of was there a timing of launches around in North America or China that affected the growth rate. How should we think about the progression of the growth rate? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, two things. One is, the numbers are getting bigger and the second thing is that we're capacity constrained. So, if you remember as we talked about last year, things were happening much quicker than what we expected, and so as we're putting in capacity, we're chasing a little bit here. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And, Alex, are the economics still the same with regards to the price and the margin dollars two times, three times on sales and operating profit, respectively? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Pretty much. Even though you see the basis volume \u2013 you kind of have to look through the numbers, but if you look at our unit growth rate and you look at our margin growth rate, you can sort of see it. There's so many moving parts with lead costs and FX, but we are seeing that, and as we're able to continue that capacity, more and more of that will get realized on the bottom line, but, yeah, we're still seeing it. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just a quick one on Auto for Bruce, so in the deck it says European softness on production here in Q1 or fiscal Q2, I should say. You've had production get raised here recently. Just curious is that a customer-specific issue or what's going on? Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : It really just relates to some business that we have that's rolling off. So, as you know, the last couple years, we had some business losses that we didn't renew in Europe and so we're just sort of seeing the tail-end of that. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And that would be pure seating, not including Interiors? Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : Correct. Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, again. Yeah, just two for me. Number one is, what's the pricing like on those seating contracts? It just strikes me as obviously fairly remarkable acceleration, right? To do sort of all of what you did in bookings in a half a year in terms of compared to what you did a year ago in a whole year. Are you finding that the environment is just willing to take in some new orders at reasonable pricing or is this kind of an aggressive push to kind of reassert yourself at your proper share? How should we think about that? Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : Well, first of all, it's great progress, and I think when you think about the rationale for spinning off the Automotive business, it's really been because we wanted to free up Automotive to reinvest the cash flows to grow the business. And so, if you were to look at our reinvestment ratio in the Auto business compared to our closest North American competitor, what you would see is our reinvestment ratio is about 30% to 40% lower than theirs. And so, our growth has been stunted because of our lack of commitment on future CapEx and engineering expense. So it's not that we are chasing things at lower prices here, it is \u2013 our business \u2013 and probably the best way to think about (46:01) around for a while is, we have a long 20-year, 30-year track record of aggressive growth in Automotive and we're giving them back the access to resources and let them flourish again. And that's what we're seeing in the first half. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. All right. Thanks, Bruce. And just one other side one maybe more generally, it just feels like in the last four months or five months like the noise on \u2013 not noise, but the discussions on 48 volt have gone up a lot. Can you just remind us like sort of your positioning there and how much of an opportunity that could be for you? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so I think that, for us, the 48 volt discussion is one that's a positive discussion, because as we've talked about our technology portfolio and the fact that vehicles will move from one powertrain to another powertrain, we'd rather see an incremental move and one that's not 100% disruptive, but more of an evolving portfolio. And for us, this is something that we actually predicted. The timing of it is something that's unique around the discussion, but I do think it makes an awful lot of sense and we're encouraged by it. If you look at our investments in R&D, it's directly related to low-voltage lithium-ion products. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And just to follow up really quickly, is this \u2013 are these products that you could see in the market within kind of a two-year timeframe? Is it that soon? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think you're \u2013 if you think about the cycles of the Automotive business, you'll probably have some pilot projects, but you're really talking about five years plus out just because of the product cycle times. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys. That's all I have. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, and thank you. Let's start with Building Efficiency. You had mentioned the new Metasys launch in June. So as you work towards the Tyco merger and the integration, I was wondering to what extent are you already starting to design building automation products for integrating some of their fire and security products and controls? It seems like a good opportunity and just wondering how much of that might be baked into how you think about synergies versus potential upside, and maybe what you think the integration of those product suites will do for your competitive positioning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as you probably know, the Metasys platform has been around for a long time. It's an evolving product platform. And it already has an integrating capability with lots of fire alarm products, including products like the Simplex products through open protocols. I think what you're going to see is a much tighter integration. We haven't really gotten into the details of the product planning. You have to remember, we're still two public companies, and there's certain planning that we can't do until we're further along in this process. But, clearly, when we talk about \u2013 and I think Tyco talks about their Tyco On product and we talk about Metasys, that's really a convergence of technology that will need an integrating platform. What that really looks like, the opportunity to look under the cover, we really can't do that yet. So I'm excited about that as part of the synergy opportunity. It wouldn't be the near-term synergy opportunity; it would be like the second wave of opportunity. The first wave of opportunity is going to really be cross-selling and commercial opportunity. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): We'll look for that. And then just a question on Power Solutions; you mentioned in your guidance for the year, the change in the guidance earlier, just wondering how you think about regional volumes in kind of the remainder of the year, North America, China versus Europe and kind of the puts and takes of that and where you think that might end up impacting pricing. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think that the mix will be very similar to what it's been up to this point. We have actually gained share. There's been a little bit of market growth in North America. Europe has had a pretty mild weather. It hasn't lost share, but it's pretty competitive in Europe. And so what I would expect is that our share will continue to grow pivoting toward Asia, specifically China, and we'll see moderate growth in the other regions. Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Noah. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC. Your line is now open. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Oh, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one quick one on, I guess, the Yanfeng JV, where we just get a little transparency. It seems like things have really accelerated there by some of the clues you dropped here; China up 51%, but only 9% ex that JV. And then if you could just sort of back out the margin improvement as well, is that \u2013 I guess, is that just the fruits of some increased business, because it seems to be up way more than China production would have otherwise suggested? Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : I just want to clarify. You're talking about the Interiors joint venture, correct? Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Yeah. Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : Well, yeah. Keep in mind, Joe, it's a global joint venture. So, roughly speaking, it's a little bit more than 50% is China and the balance of it is North America and Europe, just to remind those on the call that maybe aren't familiar with it. But we \u2013 this joint venture, we basically took Johnson Controls' business, which was a global Interiors joint venture, or operation, and combined it with Yanfeng's business, which was almost all in China. I think they had one North American plant. And really, the rationale here was combining the Chinese cost base that they brought and access to low-cost tooling and capital, and marrying it up with our global footprint and our global customer relationships. And what you've sort of seen there is putting that all together, is we've got a business that's got a return on sales of more than 6%. That's somewhat stunted because of the costs that we're incurring to set it up as a separate entity. We see good strong growth and we've got a global business that's growing nicely. And we see the $7 billion of \u2013 that's lifetime awards of revenue, so it's not the same as our backlog. But that \u2013 if I looked at that backlog, that's the customer validation of the investment thesis and I think if you look underneath that, about two-thirds of the new business is Daimler, BMW and Porsche on business, and that's a global mix, so it's not just winning it in one region. So, great customer acceptance, the marrying of the customer relationships and the cost base, it just has played out perfectly for us and we're real excited about how that venture's starting off year. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just to confirm that it's the after-tax portion of that JV that you're reporting in that segment income number, right? So, I guess, the difference suggests sort of something about like almost $50 million contribution which just seems to be a little bit higher than, I guess, some of the initial color you had. Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I don't think the \u2013 maybe after the call, Kathie can straighten you out there, but I think it's not quite \u2013 I don't think its $50 million from the Interiors joint venture. But your point is actually bigger than you said. All of our Chinese equity income, which is more than $50 million in the quarter is all after-tax income, and I think one of the things that, from a value perspective, is generally speaking I think people give us an EBITDA type multiple on our equity income rather than a PE type multiple, and I think there's lost value there. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, we can walk through the math afterwards, but remember that's a 30% \u2013 we've got a 30% interest in that joint venture and you're correct, it is after-tax. So we can walk you through those numbers. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. We can take it offline. Thanks. Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Thanks, Joe. Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Alex, closing comments? Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Appreciate it. I thank everyone for joining the call today and I just want to just to mention, just as I always do, but it can't go unmentioned is that how could you not be more proud of our employees and what they're accomplishing. We've got a significant amount of things going on. If you look at the summer we have ahead of us, it's not slowing down, but I think we can see the path to be clear of all this. Things are becoming much more clear for our employees, for our customers, and I think that the execution that they're delivering on is something to really be proud of. So, I just want to thank our employees and I want to appreciate everyone's great, great questions, and sticking with us through this transformation. We're going to be \u2013 we're a great company today and we're going to be an even be a greater company, a great two companies when we come out of this. So thanks a lot. Have a great day. Kathryn Campbell - Director-Global Investor Relations : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session starts. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may now disconnect. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Kathie Campbell. Ma'am, you may begin Kathryn Campbell : Thank you, Dale, and welcome to the review of John Controls Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. If you didn't already receive it, the slide presentation can be accessed at our Investor page at johnsoncontrols.com. This morning, President, Chairman and CEO, Alex Molinaroli will provide some perspective on the quarter, as well as some progress updates on our merger with Tyco. He will be followed by Bruce McDonald, incoming Adient Chairman and CEO, to provide some updates on the Adient spin-off. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief, will then review the results of the individual businesses, as well as the Company's overall financial performance.  Following those prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions, and we are scheduled to end at the top of the hour. Before we begin, just want to remind you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause results to differ are discussed in the cautionary statement included in today's news release and the presentation document. We also remind you to review the extended disclosures related to the proposed transaction with Tyco, which can also be found in the earnings documents today. With that, I will turn it over to Alex. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks, Kathie. Good morning, everyone. So, I'd like to get started before we jump into the slides, just as a reminder and I\u2019ve done this the last couple quarters to remind everyone what we talked about back in December as we made commitments to ourselves and to our shareholders and to the folks that were at our December Analyst Meeting and talk about the few things that are guiding light here as it relates to being able to achieve our objectives.  First that is around execution delivering both on our strategic and our financial commitments; second one is our transformation activities to make sure that we are able to complete successfully our portfolio actions. Recall the time when we had made those statements then we were talking mostly about the spin we weren\u2019t really including the Tyco transaction.  Maintaining a strong balance sheet for the future in order to be have flexibility for our growth investments and then continue our drive toward being coming out real benchmark for operational excellence and I just like to make a comment, I believe that our Johnson Controls operating system continues to deliver tangible results and I think we just had more to come. So I am very pleased about that and then position ourselves with business platforms and you can think about the sectors that we participate in and operating models to be able to drive sustainable organic growth.  All these with an eye, what\u2019s important to us is to increase shareholder value. I am really proud to say that we\u2019ve stayed focused. We\u2019ve been able to execute inline with the strategy and objectives that we talked about in December.  With that, I\u2019d like to jump into the slides, just move to the Slide 7 please. On Slide 7, we have some highlights here I just like to report on. First our Q3 was a great quarter and excellent with the continued execution. Just for the Hitachi joint venture and currently in our lead cost pass-through our organic sales were 4% in Building Efficiency and 5% in Power Solutions. Building Efficiency growth was driven by both North America where we saw 3% growth and Asia at 9% and we are seeing some strength in China which is really encouraging. Power Solutions our unit growth across all of our regions, we\u2019ve had growth in all regions, what\u2019s particularly we are seeing strong growth in Asia, across at Asia 12% and our start-stop growth which is the future of our business over the next five years grew 22% driven by the Americas and China at 78% and 79% respectively.  We have continued trend of our segment year-over-year profitability improvement with segment margins in all business units up 170 basis points across the board. Our adjusted EPS up 18% at $1.07 which is above our guidance for the quarter and with the strong operating performance we\u2019ve tightened our guidance to the higher end of our previous range. Brian will get into that later as it relates to our full year guidance. We continue to invest in our future. During the quarter, we announced our joint venture with Bohai Piston Group which is an affiliate of BAIC in China to build our fourth plant. This strategic partnership is pretty important to us because it gives us access from an OE perspective to 5 million vehicles by 2020 and it also gives us access to distribution channel in 2400 outlets of OES shops in order to sell batteries to the aftermarket.  With this local partner it\u2019s going to help us continue with our objectives to gain share in the region. We\u2019ve also announced that we are doubling our AGM expansion in North America by 2020 and while increasing our capacity up to 11 million units and we are taking advantage of the growing demand for start-stop. And I mentioned this earlier what we see is this technology is becoming more and more ubiquitous and vehicles as they come out and for our customers to meet the increasing regulatory targets.  Our Hitachi joint venture continues to exceed our expectations and I\u2019d just give you a little bit of color on, if you look across the regions we are seeing strong performance in China, Japan and Taiwan and we are starting to see some opportunities in North America as we\u2019ve made significant investments in both product and sales.  In order to drive profitability within the Hitachi joint venture and across the board our pricing, we\u2019ve brought pricing discipline along with cost reductions and across our operating system functions, manufacturing, procurement, and design.  We also completed in the quarter, our $500 million stock repurchase that we announced last quarter. So we\u2019ve completed that and we are at share count that we talked about in the previous call. We continue to make great progress on our portfolio transportation \u2013 transformation activities. In fact, we are in a position now that we can talk about our merger date with Tyco moving to September 2nd and we continue to be on track for Adient spin date on October 31 as we previously communicated. Both Bruce and myself will talk about both of these transformation activities in further slides.  If you go to Slide 8, financial highlights and we had a lot of moving pieces as we all know, if you look at the top-line and kind of break that down, you take the Interiors joint venture, where we deconsolidated the revenues for that and then you add back the Johnson Controls Hitachi revenues, you adjust for these two events and currency, our overall organic growth was 1% for the quarter.  I noted previously that we saw strong growth in Building Efficiency and Power Solutions at 4%, 5% respectively. Overall, Automotive Experience is down 1%, Seating grew 1% and there is some remaining plants, if you recall in our discussions around our Interior joint venture, we maintained some of the plants in Interiors and as we wind those plants down as where we are seeing the decline in sales, not in our Seating businesses. Segment income was up 19% excluding FX with margins at 170 basis points. Our adjusted diluted EPS up 18% and it\u2019s a second quarter in a row. Building Efficiency segment income continues to benefit from the contribution of Johnson Controls Hitachi, both higher volumes and cost improvements, that is being offset by some of the product and sales force investments we are making outside the joint venture.  Auto had another exceptional profitability quarter driven by the performance of the Seating business. It was partially offset by lower than expected results from Interiors.  Power Solutions continues to drive segment margin expansion with higher volumes both through manufacturing and pricing disciplines.  Let\u2019s move to Slide 9, I\u2019ll give you an update on where we are with our merger with Tyco. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the quarter as we combined Tyco and JCI teams continue to work extremely well together. In the quarter, we\u2019ve announced our combined leadership team. Tyco has received an effective S-4 in our perspective it\u2019s clear and we\u2019ve set both shareholder meetings for August 17. The shareholders of record of June 27 should have received all the proxy materials in order to vote for the merger. We\u2019ve received all of our antitrust clearances. So the shareholder vote is one of the last hurdles necessary to close. And based on that, we are expecting to accelerate the closing date to September 2. So we feel good about the progress we are making around synergies.  And I\u2019d just like to reiterate the commitment that George Oliver and myself made during the quarter at the EPG Conference where we talked about $1 billion in runrate savings coming from the combination of the ongoing productivity and improvements at both Tyco and Johnson Controls along with the synergy cost reductions we remain committed and are optimistic that we\u2019ll achieve those.  And finally I am lucky to say the date, we are going to have our first as a new company Analyst Day will be at the Mandarin Oriental in New York City on December 5 and if you could save that date it\u2019d be great because it\u2019s going to be an opportunity for us to talk about both strategically and financially on what the merged company would look like and what the expectations you should have and it\u2019s a main important event for us as we start our new journey as a combined company.  With that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Bruce and he will update both around the Adient progress and the separation activities. Robert Bruce McDonald : Okay, thank you, Alex and good morning to everyone on the call today. I am real pleased to talk about where we stand in terms of the Adient separation, like the activity is ongoing with the merger with Tyco. We on the automotive side have had an extremely busy quarter as well.  For us, July 1 was a huge milestone. It\u2019s the internal date that we said we were going to have effectively our separation largely completed. So we call that operational day one. So with that, we changed over the bulk of our IT systems, clone what we had to clone.  We\u2019ve got new treasury systems in place. Good progress on the corporate organization structure. So for all intents and purposes, we are operating independently within Johnson Controls, we\u2019ve got a four months kind of running in parallel health until we get to our true separation which will be at the end of the October.  In terms of the tracking of the cost of the separation, Brian had given an estimate of cost being in the $400 million to $600 million range. We are tracking well within those estimates. Those costs will quickly drop-off here in the fourth quarter and I think there is a little bit that hangs into the month of October.  But that separation costs are on a pretty down \u2013 a pretty steep downward trajectory here as we\u2019ve done most of the activities. In terms of our Form 10, which we filed \u2013 which we filed during the quarter, the second version, it had our pro forma financial results in there and our 2-B balance sheet, in there we disclosed that we\u2019ll have $3.5 billion of gross debt.  We\u2019ll retain $500 million and pay $3 billion dividend back to Johnson Controls just before the spin-off. In terms of our financing, great progress here. We are nearly, probably early next week we\u2019ll wrap up the first part of our financing plan which involves us putting in place $1.5 billion revolver which will be for working capital purposes and give us some cushion.  And $1.5 billion of term loan A. Those \u2013 that we are just wrapping up the commitments from our lenders and we expect to close that out early next week and make an announcement. Then we\u2019ll shift into our bond programs. During the first two weeks of August, we will be marketing our bonds we expect to issue $2 billion of 8 to 10 year bonds here and close that transaction into escrow here in mid-August.  In terms of our credit rating, I think we\u2019ve published that we\u2019ve received the double B Plus rating from S&P was consistent with our expectation at sort of one notch below investment grade and I really think it speaks to the underlying strength of our business and this bright future that we have. Moody\u2019s will publish a rating on us probably here within the next two weeks.  In terms of the next version of the Form 10, that will be filed late next week. In there, I guess the most noteworthy thing is we\u2019ve decided in there to change our domicile from the UK to Ireland. That reflects really as we sort of working through the complexities of the separation with the new Johnson Controls entity being domiciled in Ireland, it was just more tax-efficient and less complex transaction structured for Adient to be Irish domiciles and so we made that change and you will see that reflect in the next version of the Form 10.  I think the main issue from a financial perspective with that is it really doesn\u2019t have any impact on our numbers and with the Irish domicile we are still confident that our tax rate will be in the 10% to 12% range as we\u2019ve previously communicated.  Lastly here, I would just comment as save the date, we expect to have our first Adient Analyst Meeting here in September 15, so prior to the spin-off we will be doing a number of shareholder outreach and one-on-one things from mid-September through our spin-off date, but sort of kicking that off will be an Analyst Meeting that we scheduled here for the morning of September 15 in New York. Teams are excited, working hard and really looking forward to legal day one.  Maybe just transitioning into Slide 11 here, maybe just comment on our investment thesis and why the team is so excited before I turn things over to Brian. So first of all, I just point out our market position, I mean, clearly, we are the market leader in many, many sense of the word, if you look at our market share we are globally number one.  It was 50% bigger than our next close competitor. Our product line up, we\u2019ve got a very diverse product line up from a vertical integration point of view we\u2019re the most vertically integrated. So extremely well positioned in the industry.  Then I think really uniquely to us for Adient is our customer diversity that we have and I think it\u2019s clear that we are the envy of the industry. If you look at our share, our market share and we are leaders in all three of the major regions and we\u2019ve got great customer diversity with Japanese, with Chinese customers, our business really reflects the diversity of our \u2013 of the auto OE-based globally. So, we are not overly exposed to any one customer, any one region. We are the envy of the industry.  In terms of looking forward, obviously automotive here is on an upward trajectory in terms of our margins and profitability this year and we expect to see that to continue as we get into \u2013 as we become our own separate company.  We\u2019ve got a lot of self help initiatives, some operational efficiencies that we are going to implement and you can see here on the slide and we\u2019ve talked about this before that we expect to deliver 200 basis points of margin expansion over the mid-term here. Then lastly, coming out with $3 billion of net debt. We are not too worried about. We expect to have extremely strong free cash flow, I mean the automotive business is a strong free cash flow business.  We will be ticking up our capital expenditure here to invest in some growth initiatives as we go forward and pay a competitive dividend, but all in all, very strong stable source of cash flow that will enable us to both quickly delever, paying attractive returns to our shareholders and also invest in growth initiatives to get the top-line moving again for automotive.  And so with that, I thank you and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Brian to go through the business results. Brian Stief : Okay, thanks Bruce and good morning everyone. As you saw in our press release, our Q3 reported results include transaction, integration and separation costs of about $167 million, a restructuring charge of $102 million and a non-recurring non-cash tax charge of $85 million, which resulted in a net charge of $0.48 per share in the current quarter. We've summarized those items in an appendix, but just given their size, I\u2019d like to just briefly comment on each of those. As far as the integration, separation and transaction costs, the majority of those costs in the quarter relate to the Adient separation, and as Bruce indicated we should be on the downside of those costs as we move through Q4 now and there will be some trailing cost into Q1 toward the separation date of October 31.  As far as the restructuring charge, there is some non-cash impairments included in that. Stranded cost reductions in connection with us moving toward the Adient spin date as well as some footprint changes at the Automotive business. And then lastly the tax charge again is non-cash and it relates really to some Adient spin-off tax funding that\u2019s been done in the quarter.  So as I talk through the business unit results and financials, I\u2019ll exclude these items from my comments and also consistent with Q1 and Q2, as you know we formed the Automotive Interiors JV in July 2015 and we closed on the Johnson Controls to Hitachi or JCH joint venture in October 2015 and those impact the comparability of the quarter-to-quarter results and I\u2019ll comment on those as I go through the slides.  So with that, turning to Slide 12, on Building Efficiency, third quarter sales of $3.6 billion were up 36% from the prior year. If you adjust for FX and JCH sales grew by a solid 4%. Revenues in Systems and Services North America were up 3% as we saw good growth in the North American branches and in Products North America residential business drove year-over-year growth of 20% and Asia was up 9% ex Hitachi.  In our rest of world segment, it was level with Q3 of 2015 with a few unpacks at Europe was up 5%, Latin America was up 3% and there was softness in the Middle East, it was down 10% and that\u2019s tied into oil prices.  As far as orders secured in the quarter, excluding M&A and FX we were up 5% for the third consecutive quarter and we saw share gains in Systems and Services North America and Products North America related to our residential business. Asia orders were also strong in the quarter up 6% and we ended the quarter with a backlog of $4.8 billion, which is up 2% year-on-year. As far as segment income of $397 million, it was up 48% ex FX, due primarily to the volumes in North America and Asia and the contribution of the Hitachi joint venture. As I mentioned last quarter, it\u2019s now difficult to isolate the Hitachi joint venture standalone results given all of the integration work that\u2019s going on and the investments that we are making in products and sales force that Alex referred to, but based upon some pro forma calculations we\u2019ve done, we would estimate that we\u2019d be in mid single-digit segment income growth without Hitachi. And overall BE segment margins in the quarter were very strong at 10.9%, up 90 basis points.  So turning to Power Solutions in Slide 13, sales were up 3% compared to last year and 5% if you adjust for FX and the lead price. So lead price is today around 1700 versus last year at about 1950 and of course that impacts our top-line sales numbers.  In terms of units, we saw higher volumes across all regions with global third quarter shipments up 2%, again if you unpack that, Asia was up 12%, Europe was up 2% and the Americas were up 1%. We continue to see strong start-stop growth with year-on-year volumes up 22% from 3.3 million units last year to 4 million units this year.  All regions delivered higher year-on-year start-stop volumes with China at 79% and the Americas up 78% in growing markets and then in the mature markets, EMEA we are up 4%. We also saw Q3 global OE and aftermarket volumes increased 5% and 1% respectively.  So from a segment income standpoint, Power Solutions delivered $262 million, which is up 13% ex FX and that continues to reflect the higher volumes, some strong price discipline and the ongoing favorable products mix that we are seeing at power. Their margins were up 130 basis points year-over-year and remain well above our expectations year-to-date. Moving to Automotive Experience, sales were down 19% compared to last year, but if you adjust for the deconsolidation of Interiors and FX, they were down 1% and we really saw strong global production in Asia and Europe that were offset by some expiring programs in North America.  If you look at our China non-consolidated joint ventures on a 100% sales basis, they were up 49% in the quarter to $2.9 billion, but again, if you adjust for the Interiors joint venture and FX, they are only up 11%, but still very favorable relative to industry production of 5% in the quarter.  Our Automotive team has been quoting significant new business and have secured wins of $4.3 billion year-to-date which already exceeds the fiscal 2015 full year total of $3.6 billion and they are well on their way to a record year of new business secured at Automotive.  For the quarter, segment income of $344 was up 1% year-over-year as we continue to see the benefits of cost reduction and restructuring initiatives and overall Seating results were very strong however as Alex mentioned, we did see some softness in the Interiors business related to the retained plants that we have at Johnson Controls that were not contributed to the joint venture. China translation and some launch cost that were beginning to incur on new business. So total auto margins of 7.9% was very strong in the quarter, up 160 basis points year-on-year and up 20 basis points if you adjust for the Interiors deconsolidation.  Moving to Slide 15 in the consolidated results for the quarter, overall third quarter revenues were down 1% to $9.5 billion, but if you adjust for Interiors FX and the Hitachi joint venture, sales were up 1% as Alex mentioned. Gross margin for the quarter of 19.8% was up 200 basis points and this just continues to reflect the benefits we are seeing from the favorable impacts of Johnson Controls operating system initiatives and our improved product mix.  SG&A was up 7%, this increase is really a function of the consolidation of Hitachi joint venture as well as product and sales force investments in BE and this is offset by the deconsolidation of Interiors and our ongoing cost initiatives and I will just comment here as I think the overall focus that we have on G&A cost remains strong as we really right size our cost structure as we move toward the Adient spin-off in October. As expected, equity income of $134 million was 40% higher than year ago levels, again that was due to about $19 million in the joint venture related to Interiors and certain joint ventures of JCH contributed another $30 million. So overall, third quarter segment margins of 10.5% were a 170 basis points better than 2015 and this is well ahead of the 70 basis point expectations that we had for the year.  Turning to Slide 16, net financing charges of $69 million was slightly lower than last year and that\u2019s due primarily to the favorable interest rate environment we have today and consistent with the last quarter our tax rate remains at 17% which is favorable compared to our Q3 of fiscal 2015 which was at 18.5%.  Income attributable to non-controlling interest is up $49 million compared to last year and that\u2019s primarily due to JCH and overall, we had a strong third quarter up 18% from $0.91 a year ago to $1.07 this year.  And I just comment, I give tremendous credit to our business unit management teams as they continue deliver these outstanding results during a period when a lot of these portfolio transformation activities could be a potential transaction for our global teams. So, they are doing a great job. Turning to the balance sheet on Page 17 at quarter end, we have a net debt-to-cap ratio of 44% compared to the third quarter of last year which was at 40.7% and 40% at the end of last quarter. That increase really is a function of the share repurchase and some of the separation cost that were funded in the third quarter.  If I turn to cash flow, our third quarter adjusted cash flow of $400 million was inline with our expectations. We have included an appendix in the deck which provides a reconciliation of our reported to adjusted free cash flow and to similar to the format we presented at our Analyst Day in December.  And as you can see in the third quarter, we had transaction cost, separation cost in tax payments that totaled about $600 million. We do expect to be inline with the $1.5 billion free cash flow guidance that we provided at the December Analyst Meeting.  If I turn to Slide 18, there are lot of moving pieces as we enter Q4 and I just like to comment on a couple of things before we get into Q&A here. As Alex noted, the expected merger date is now September 2, which will mean that we will pick up one month of Tyco results in our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial statements including the purchase accounting adjustments.  Additionally, the consolidated balance sheet at the end of our fiscal year will include Tyco\u2019s historical debt of about $2 billion plus the new debt raise of around $4 billion that will be completed in connection with the transaction. And on our year-end earnings call, we will provide you with some pro forma financial information to demonstrate Johnson Controls performance exclusive of Hitachi as we provide our upcoming guidance here. Yesterday you may have seen we announced the fall order of our fourth quarter dividend of $0.29 to shareholders of record on August 5th and the payment date will be August 19th and we will continue to see the one-time or non-recurring items I guess, or special items related to transaction and separation cost in Q4, we will have likely another restructuring charge as we move closer towards the spin-off of Adient and the integration efforts associated with Tyco and we will have our normal Q4 mark-to-market adjustment related to our pension and OPEB plans.  One technical thing from an accounting standpoint, we are not able to show Adient as a discontinued operation until the date of the spin. So, our year end financial statements will continue to show Adient as a consolidated entity and it won\u2019t be until Q1 that we show that as a disc-op.  Turning to Slide 19 and our guidance and I\u2019d emphasize that the guidance that we are providing you excludes any impacts of the Tyco merger. Our Q4 earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 1.17 to 1.20 which is up 13% to 15% from Q4 last year and it does reflect the tightening of our full year guidance to 3.95 to 3.98 which will be up 15% to 16% from fiscal 2015. And I would just say with our fourth quarter guidance reflects the positive momentum we have going into Q4, but it is somewhat tampered by uncertainty around potential currency and volume headwinds that could exist in our Automotive business as we move through the fourth quarter.  So with that, Kathy we can turn it over for questions. Kathryn Campbell : Dale, we will now begin our Q&A. If you could please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then get back in the queue will be much appreciated. Dale? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have one from Joshua of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning folks. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just a quick question on BE margins, I guess, could you break down maybe some of the headwinds, tailwinds or are you moving pieces around price cost and then I know you had some investment spending last year, how did that look on a year-over-year basis? And then, maybe Brian just go through where we are at versus that $100 million of cost savings you expect it to get this year whether running ahead of that at this point or if that\u2019s all part of the performance in the quarter? Alex Molinaroli : I won\u2019t put the numbers to it, Brian can do that, and then kind of give you a overview. As we\u2019ve quickly integrated the Hitachi business it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult for us to be able to tease out the margins inside Hitachi and outside Hitachi not because we don\u2019t have the results, but because we are making investments outside of Hitachi around on Products North America. So what you see was when you get into the Products North America, in particular you are going to see some margin pressure and you\u2019ll also see a little bit of margin pressure although because of the volumes been overcoming in SS&A where we are hiring sales people. And then we also have some products that we are building for our EPG business which had an excellent quarter, this quarter. We are making investments in new product development there. So those are the three, I guess, those are the three major headwinds we have as it relates to cost. All of them are investments and future products and a lot of that is real self help from the standpoint that we\u2019ve been able to lower G&A and reinvest it in the business in both products and sales people. I think, Brian could give you maybe some of the details around that. Brian Stief : Yes, Joshua, I think on the $100 million number, of course that was the number that we showed at the Analyst Day and that was the gross save from our JCOS initiatives and then the net save was the 100 you referred. That of course is across all three of our businesses, but BE certainly is benefiting by that and I think some of that is reflected in certainly the margin improvement we are seeing at BE. But that $100 million would be across all three of our businesses and I would say we are pretty much on target with what we expected there. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Perfect, and then, I guess just a follow-up, on the Tyco close moving forward, certainly good news there. Any expectation that we would update the synergy target or maybe some more crystallization or timing around that. At close, are you guys going to wait until you report the fourth quarter? Alex Molinaroli : So we will wait till December, yes, because I think that we want to make sure that as we get into post-close activities that we validate a lot of the things that we are working on now. We\u2019ve done an awful lot of planning, but I think as we put together our plans, as you remember we not only have synergy cost that we talk about as it relates to the deal itself, but also cost reduction initiatives with both companies, because we are still two separate companies, we don\u2019t have the level of details that we need to talk about it now, but when we come out December, I think we\u2019ll be able to have the level of details that becomes ourselves accountable and that you folks will be able to have some transparency too. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Perfect, appreciate it guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Robert Barry : Yes, hey everyone. Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Robert Barry : So, I think there were some concerns in the quarter perhaps about non-res flowing a little bit perhaps due to the Dodge Momentum Index slowing though it rebounded a lot in June. It looks like your orders in BE showed good growth, but steady versus last quarter even though the comp got a little easier. So just curious how you\u2019d characterize the momentum there and anything since last update, any verticals in particular got better worse? Alex Molinaroli : So, across the board, we are seeing strong, but if you try to tease out underneath the overall North America what you trying is both in our HVAC business and our Controls business, we are not only seeing growth in the market but we are also gaining share. Where we having a tough comp is in our performance contracting business and our federal government business, those businesses are under some pressure and so, what, if you get underneath you will find the institutional markets in our core business, HVAC controls and ironically fire and security are growing extremely fast and then if you look at our performance contracting business, particularly the federal government business, we are seeing some slowdown there. And I think that is probably something that we are going to live with for a while. We're seeing a diversion of funds away from the type of activities we have. So there is just less opportunity there and in the Performance Contracting business particularly federal government. But I see strong momentum in the core of our business. Robert Barry : Gotcha and then maybe I did actually want a follow-up on the comments about the residential business, just because I think it\u2019s struggled a little for a while, it sounds like the momentum there is actually really good. So can you give us a little more color on how it performed and it sounds like it inflected and why that might be the case? Alex Molinaroli : Well, it\u2019s a question, because we\u2019ve been on suppression, I mean, I think the comps are better, but we\u2019ve also had a lot of new products out in the marketplace. So we are seeing mid-teens growth in the quarter. So we had some strong growth. We\u2019ve had some specific wins. We\u2019ve also added some distribution throughout the region. So, we are pretty pleased with some of the growth that we are seeing because we haven\u2019t as we noted over a period of time, but mid-teens. Robert Barry : Is that revenue or orders? Alex Molinaroli : Revenue. Brian Stief : Revenue. Robert Barry : And the distribution you added, was that, I know you had some shortfalls or coverage weakness in Florida, in Texas because that were at\u2026 Alex Molinaroli : Yes, we lost \u2013 as you recall, we lost some distribution and in Florida we put some back and we\u2019ve also got some distribution across multiple regions, but in Florida specifically we have added back some distribution. Kathryn Campbell : And Rob, revenue and orders are both up mid-teens. Robert Barry : Well, great. Even though maybe the weather wasn\u2019t super helpful. So, that\u2019s good. Alex Molinaroli : Yes, that\u2019s great. Robert Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up since day with BE, so we do obviously have a little bit ongoing non-res tailwinds, you had mentioned a lot of new products in the marketplace, I was just sort of wondering particularly on VRF, what kind of traction you\u2019ve been seeing there in North America? You\u2019ve spent some resources that kind of integrate this the strength we are seeing seems to be kind of in the mid-market which is really kind of the sweet spot there. So, how is that tracking and kind of how much room do you think it has to run? Alex Molinaroli : Well, a long way to go. I think we have, we are starting to get products out. We\u2019ve had some product gaps as part of the investment we are having to make because the products that were built by Hitachi were really not to serve the North American markets. So we are getting to where we have a full set of products. Our quoting activity is up quite a bit, but I\u2019ll tell you we still got a long ways to go and I think we will have the right product positioning and we are starting to see distribution sign up, but I would say that we are seeing most of that growth is, right now outside of North America. Noah Kaye : Okay, thank you. And then just a quick clarifying question on Adient. The tax rate, it looks unchanged from previous expectations, but you did mention that you thought there might be some tax benefit moving from \u2013 moving to Ireland, certainly it\u2019s got a lower statutory corporate tax rate than the UK. So, can you just kind of clarify that for us a little bit. Is there a benefit, how should we think about that? Thanks. Robert Bruce McDonald : This is Bruce here, maybe I\u2019ll just make a few comments and Brian, you may want to add in, but we disclosed that we would have a rate of around 10% to 12% previously when we thought we are going to be domiciled in the UK and with the change to Ireland, there is no difference and the reason why we don\u2019t have a reduction is because we really don\u2019t have any Irish income. We don\u2019t have any plants or anything like that in Ireland. So it wasn\u2019t a positive from a rate perspective for us. Noah Kaye : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Kathryn Campbell : Thanks, Noah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Richard Kwas : Hi, good morning everyone. Alex Molinaroli : Hi, Rich. Kathryn Campbell : Good morning, Rich. Richard Kwas : Just wanted to ask Alex on Brexit here. I know it\u2019s kind of early days still, but are you seeing any impact on quoting activity, particularly as it relates to BE? Alex Molinaroli : You know what, well first off when we put in context, our revenues in the UK are pretty small, I think it\u2019s 3%. So we started from a small place. We do have reports that not necessarily quoting activities, but things are just a little slow right now, because people are \u2013 some products that are into queue have slowed down, probably people are just trying to figure out where things are. So I think that people are at kind of the wait and see mode, so we do see some indications of slowdown, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019d be the bellwether for the UK. Richard Kwas : And then how about broader Europe? Anything where there is any early signs of any contagion or\u2026? Alex Molinaroli : No we don\u2019t see it across Europe. We do see a little bit in the UK. In fact you look at our European business, it\u2019s not doing badly, it\u2019s actually seeing some growth, because we have developed in the rest of the world where we see some deterioration it\u2019s actually in the Middle East where we are more petroleum energy dependent. Richard Kwas : Okay, and then on North America, on the product number, which I think is new, I hadn\u2019t seen that disclosed previously in terms of your orders. So that was up eight, so that suggests there is pretty good activity on the institutional side. Is that a fair assessment of what you are seeing right now based on that number? Alex Molinaroli : Well, the way I would think about it when our products business is probably more skewed towards the light commercial, and our branches are more skewed to institutional, because of the channel, I am sorry. Richard Kwas : Okay, all right and then, so just, and then lastly on to the clarification on the mid-teens number for residential, is that residential and light commercial combined or just residential in terms of the orders of the revenues? Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s both, that\u2019s combined. Richard Kwas : Okay, combined. Alex Molinaroli : That\u2019s the old EPG. Richard Kwas : Right, okay, thanks. Kathryn Campbell : Thanks, Rich. Alex Molinaroli : Operator? Kathryn Campbell : Dale, you are still there? Operator : Yes, can you hear me now? Kathryn Campbell : Yes, is there another question? Operator : I do apologize. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Your line is now open. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi good morning everybody. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Kathryn Campbell : Good morning Emmanuel. Emmanuel Rosner : Just a couple of questions on the auto side. First on the margin performance in the quarter. You mentioned a few factors that sort of like may have sort of been keeping a lid on margin expansion there. Can you please just go back over, some of these factors were what\u2019s happening in Seating and Interiors? And then how should we think about that the margin expansion enough for the near future and in particular in the context of your ability to expend that by couple hundred basis points? Alex Molinaroli : Maybe share buyback. Robert Bruce McDonald : Maybe, I\u2019ll talk to what I think is going to drive the improvement in the future and then maybe Brian can just read, he went through a number of things, so maybe he can touch on those. But, from a go forward perspective, what we are seeing, we are looking for a couple hundred basis points of margin expansion. It really falls into a few big buckets. First of all, is us have any \u2013 I\u2019d say a leaner corporate SG&A structure then we have as part of Johnson Controls it would be a single industry company and we \u2013 that will and smaller and I think that will offer us some attrition. So these I think as we look at the cost associated with standing up the company to be a public entity that\u2019s a big driver. Secondly is, we are on an upward trajectory in terms of our business performance right now, really and things there you would sort of see is some improvement on metals business on a go forward basis, that\u2019s probably the single biggest bucket there and then, I guess the other thing I would point to from a margin expansion would be the growth of our equity income which flows through as our Chinese businesses grow. So those are the three main areas Emmanuel where the 200 basis points come from. Brian Stief : And I think if you look at the segment income in the quarter, seating results were very strong and I think it continues to reflect some of the cost initiatives as well as some of the JCOS benefits that they are seeing is, it was really offset in the quarter by softness in Interiors and those would really come in three areas. As you may know in connection with the formation of the Interiors joint venture a year ago, certain plants, the unprofitable plants were retained by Johnson Controls and we\u2019re essentially winding those down as we move through about mid fiscal 2017 and so those losses have been a bit heavier than we expected, that would be one. The second item which is kind of a good news, thanks the new business that\u2019s being won by the Chinese joint venture is significant and they are incurring some front-end launch cost associated with that business. So, again that was a bit of a way down in the quarter on their results. And then lastly just the currency in China has given us some headwinds as well. So, those will be the three big buckets I guess that would explain the Interiors. Emmanuel Rosner : Great, that\u2019s and just a real quick follow-up on the business wins in the autos business, obviously a very strong acceleration there. Can you provide any color either by product like Seating versus Interiors or geographically where you sort of like seeing the most traction with the new Adient proposition? Robert Bruce McDonald : Yes, well, first of all, that the number that we quoted, just Seating. So, when we are talking about new business wins on a year-to-date basis, just the Seating side, okay. And then, if I was \u2013 we\u2019ve historically, if you sort of go over last couple years most of our new business has been in China and that continues to be the case, so, well I would say our backlog is building on the consolidated side of our business in North America and Europe. So, I think in the last couple of years and we talked through our backlog it\u2019s almost all the growth has been in non-consolidated operations, what you sort of see when we probably touched on this a bit more in our Analyst Day here in September, you\u2019ll see, we do have some consolidated new business opportunities that are coming through. So that\u2019s good because it will help us turn our top-line performance around here. Emmanuel Rosner : Great, thank you so much. Robert Bruce McDonald : Thanks, Emmanuel. Kathryn Campbell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Kathryn Campbell : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Just on Power Solutions, the aftermarket shipment growth was lower in the quarter that we\u2019ve seen for a while. Just wondered if there was any background you could give on that and if you see that picking off now in the fourth fiscal quarter? Brian Stief : Yes, so, I sort of take that, I think that, it\u2019s really a function of the market itself, I mean, as you know, it\u2019s a very mature market and with our size, our size in North America and the Western Europe is one where it\u2019s very hard for the growth we have in China at this point to move the needle. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why that the growth would not be at some of the same rate, particularly you see is around the technology changes. We had a lot finished here. We\u2019ve maintained our customers and the mature markets and we are gaining share in China. I think if you look at the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve got, we are going to see some growth in the fourth quarter. What we don\u2019t know is, how it will compare to last year, because what we need to make sure is our customers are starting to stock up for the winter to make sure that we are able to \u2013 they are able to serve their customers. So the market itself is one that we were kind of reporting because we are such a big part of the market, we are really reporting the market growth. Julian Mitchell : Thanks and then, just my second question is if the free cash flow guidance is still around sort of $1.5 billion for the year, and a quick follow-up would be any color at all you can give on expected sort of Tyco financial impact in the fourth quarter? Brian Stief : I am sorry, the Tyco financial impact in the month of September? Julian Mitchell : Correct. Maybe you can\u2019t talk until the actual earnings, but if there was any context you could give and then on the free cash flow guide, is that still $1.5 billion? Brian Stief : Yes, I mean, the $1.5 billion is still our plan. I guess, if you take where we are free cash flow-wise through three quarters that we provided in the appendix we may be short a bit of free cash flow Q4 this year versus Q4 last year and that would really be related to three items. There is a couple $100 million of additional CapEx in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year. In addition, there was a dividend that we received in the third quarter of this year from a Chinese joint venture partner in the Auto business that last year was received in the fourth quarter and then there is probably about $50 million to $100 million more in cash restructuring cost that we are going to have in our fourth fiscal quarter this year. So that\u2019s \u2013 that probably is $300 million to $400 million less than last year\u2019s Q4 number, but with that, we still end up being on or above that $1.5 billion number that we guided to in December. So we still feel pretty comfortable with that. As far as Tyco\u2019s impact, I really don\u2019t have visibility to that right now and we\u2019ll certainly lay it out for you on the year end call. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Kathryn Campbell : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open sir. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Kathryn Campbell : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hi, so just circling back on the aftermarket, the plus 1%, I am wondering did the cooler weather in both North America and Europe, do you think that has an influence or maybe dampened down the market a little bit? Alex Molinaroli : Well, it always does, Nigel. I mean, there is two things that influenced the market, one is, we are at - what position our customers are in as it relates to their own inventory and then whatever is weather-related. So I could say that\u2019s probably the case, but if you look at the overall growth of the aftermarket in both the US and Western Europe, you are really talking about a 1% to 2% growth over a long period of time, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s kind of what you can expect. And so it can be a little choppy, but you are really going to be sticking around that 1% to 2%. Nigel Coe : Okay, that\u2019s very fair. And then you called out China as an area of strength in Building Efficiency, probably not a huge surprise, but it\u2019s obviously a big debate about durability of that strength. So I am just wondering if you can maybe add some context about what you are seeing in some of the quoting activity and the general health of that market. Alex Molinaroli : So the quoting activity is strong. We are seeing \u2013 a year ago, I didn\u2019t want to say that we felt that we were pessimist about the market. We felt like that was the place to stay there over a period of time that would \u2013 it would sort of felt up and I wouldn\u2019t declare a victory today, but I would tell you that we are seeing quoting activity be strong, we are certainly getting an awful lot both on our VRF sales not only in the joint venture, but outside of the joint venture and then we are seeing some fairly significant size orders in the core of our large tonnage business. We are also making investments in tier-3 and tier-4 cities where we are getting \u2013 we are gaining share and moving into markets that we have previously served us well. So I think the market seem, how durable it is, but it seems less choppy than it was and I think our folks feel more optimistic each and every quarter, we\u2019ve had a couple of quarters here where we could feel like things are getting stronger. Nigel Coe : Great and then a quick one for Brian. On Slide 18, you call out pension OPEB mark-to-market. Brian Stief : Yes. Nigel Coe : I don\u2019t know if I missed the comments in the prepared remarks, but what does that relate to? Brian Stief : What is it referring or what do you think? Are you asking\u2026 Nigel Coe : No, no, it\u2019s a bullet point, so I am just wondering if anything to say about that. Brian Stief : Well, we have adopted mark-to-mark accounting. So, in the fourth quarter of each year we will have either a charge or a benefit to record based upon investment experience, actual investment experience versus expected in our assumptions and then also there is a movement in interest rates that gets taken into consideration in the valuation of the obligation at each year end. So, as it relates to that adjustment, we are working through the magnitude of that right now, but with the rates being down, I think we are assuming there is going to be a mark-to-market charge. We don\u2019t have that framed yet as to size. Nigel Coe : Okay, on the low discount rate, it doesn\u2019t cause any cash confusions next year? Brian Stief : It does not. Nigel Coe : Great, thank you very much. Kathryn Campbell : Thanks, Nigel. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Alex for some closing comments. Alex Molinaroli : So, I just want to once again thank our employees for everything that have been accomplished. Brian touched on it. It\u2019s absolutely amazing to see what\u2019s been accomplished. Probably the biggest accomplishment of this particular quarter, for me is to be able to see the Adient spin and we really are running as two separate companies inside Johnson Controls today and we are going to be well positioned and feel really comfortable that we are going to be in a place where in October of 31st that we are going to be confident that we will be able to turn this thing over officially.  And then as it relates to the quarter coming up the one that we are in, obviously we\u2019ve got the anticipated merger with Tyco and the activities going on with Tyco and George Oliver and his team, I can\u2019t say anything, but good things about what I\u2019ve seen, the people at Tyco and the opportunity in front of us.  So I think that, I feel great about what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish and I feel even better about the future. So I appreciate the questions and I am sure there might be some follow-ups. Thank you, operator. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.",

Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Operator : Welcome to Johnson Controls' Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only, until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded, if you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli; President and Chief Operating Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you view today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our segment operations during the call references to adjusted EBIT margins, exclude transaction, integration, and separation costs, as well as other special items. This metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. In addition to our earnings release issued this morning, we filed an 8-K, which contains quarterly pro forma fiscal 2016 financials for Johnson Controls Plc. The pro forma financials represent the combination of Johnson Controls, excluding Adient and Tyco, including conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting, to provide you a comparable basis for our reporting in fiscal 2017. The purpose of this call is to discuss the quarterly results for the fourth quarter. If you have any questions regarding the pro formas, please contact me after the call. Now, let me quickly recap this quarter's reported results. On a GAAP basis, which includes one month of Tyco, sales of $10.2 billion in the quarter, increased 17% year-over-year on a reported basis, driven primarily by the contribution from the Hitachi joint venture as well as Tyco. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls' ordinary shareholders was a loss of $1.61 and included net charges of $2.82 related to special items. These special items were primarily composed of non-cash mark-to-market pension/post-retirement and settlement losses, transaction, integration and separation costs, restructuring charges and tax expense related to the Adient spin-off. Adjusting for special items and excluding the Tyco results, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.21 per share, compared to $1.04 in the prior-year quarter. In order to remove the complexity associated with the closure of the merger with Tyco, the results discussed on today's call reflect the underlying non-GAAP operating results of legacy Johnson Controls. Now, let me turn the call over to Alex. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Antonella. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today on this call. Before I get into the details for the fourth quarter, I'd like to just spend a moment as I've done over the last few quarters to reflect on the commitments we made last December. Of course, we'll be making some new commitments in the upcoming December, but to reflect on how we did against those commitments throughout 2016. As you all know, there was an awful lot that happened at Johnson Controls. Let's start on slide five of the presentation. As we started the year, we had a couple of strategic objectives we needed to achieve during the year, first, was our integration of Hitachi as you recall, first of last fiscal year we formed a joint venture with Hitachi. And I'd just like to say that the performance of the Hitachi joint-venture, the integration activities has far exceeded our expectations. And I think it's a great platform for us moving forward. The second thing that was important to us to get accomplished, and we just accomplished this on October 31, was a spin-off of Adient. I just want to make a couple of comments about that. I was fortunate to be invited by the Adient team to be a participant at the New York Stock Exchange last Monday when they rang the bell and their first trade happened. And I couldn't be more proud to be associated with the team. And I feel great about what they have in front of them as it relates to the opportunity. Great team and I'm happy for Bruce and for all the Adient employees. And I wish them well in the future. And then obviously, one of the most important events, clearly that's a watershed event for us, is the historic merger with Tyco, which happened a month ahead of our schedule. We'd scheduled it for October 1, and we were able to get that done a month early. And we have our legacy Tyco team members here today. In line with our vision three years ago that we started to transform ourselves to a multi-industrial leader, I can say now we truly are a multi-industrial. We have a great position, leading positions in building technologies, integrated solutions for buildings and energy storage. And George will give you some updates on the progress that we've made so far related to the integration and sort of frame-out the organization. Second, our financial commitments; throughout this entire process, we've had every opportunity for our folks to be distracted. And I couldn't be more proud of what they've been able to accomplish, 150 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion over the last year, and most of that achieved, at least in large part due to our Johnson Controls operating system initiatives and our cost reductions. Earnings-per-share growth 16%, and without sacrificing the continued investments we have in our business, and just to highlight a couple here on the page, we have strategic capital investments as you know expanding our AGM capacity 245 million in North America. And then, forming the joint-venture in order to add our fourth plant with Bohai Piston, which is an affiliate of BAIC in China, in order to increase our capacity there in China. We've accomplished a tremendous amount this year in this quarter, and I just want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, it's truly remarkable. Across the globe, across all of our segments in all of our businesses, everyone really pulled together as a team. Our transformation, coupled with our strong financial performance, allows us to enter this 2017 with great momentum. We're really positioned well to deliver \u2013 continue delivering strong results. So if you turn to slide six, I just want to reiterate, we exceeded our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, and then we were at the high end of our guidance for the fiscal year. Let's go to slide seven. So we finished the year strong, both from a top-line and a bottom-line perspective. Organic growth, our sales increased 4%, if you exclude Automotive or Adient, with 2% growth in Building Efficiency, and 8% growth in Power Solutions. Building Efficiency; to give you a little bit of color on that : underlying strength in Asia, real progress in China, when we started the year we weren't sure, but as the year has gone on, China has gotten stronger and stronger. We've introduced some exciting new products in our HVAC product range around small tonnage chillers for the Asian market, and really seeing good traction there. Another thing to really happy about is our products in North America. In our UPG business, we are actually gaining share, both in residential and light commercial, and seeing strong growth both in residential and light commercial mostly because of new product introductions there and the investments we've made over the past couple of years. Power Solutions has benefited from strong growth across all of our regions. Start-Stop technology has grown 30% globally, that's held up over the year, and as you know, we're adding more capacity. This year we shipped over 152 million batteries, which is an increase of 4% from a unit perspective. Lastly, an added confidence as we move into 2017, orders grew 6% in the fourth quarter, and it's a fourth consecutive growth \u2013 fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth in orders secured. And we continue to see strength in our orders in the institutional vertical markets, and that is on a tough comparison. We've seen growth on a year-over-year perspective here for the last couple years. Turn to slide eight. I just want to remind you this excludes any results from Tyco. Revenues in the quarter increased by 7% to $9.4 billion. If you take-out FX and M&A, the overall revenue was level, and Brian will give you more detail business-by-business. Profitability, we continue to show improvement year-over-year with all of our \u2013 across each and every one of our businesses with the segment income adjusted up 16%. Our adjusted margins expanded 90 basis points overall for the quarter, EPS up 16% to $1.21. And I couldn't \u2013 I think as Brian goes through the numbers, I think you'll see that we had strength in almost all of our regions and in each of our businesses, so great performance. With this, I'm going to turn it over to George, and he will give you an update on how we're doing with integration. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking and congratulating, both the legacy JCI and legacy Tyco teams for all of their hard work and dedication over the last nine plus months. Our integration teams, working with our employees across the globe, have put in countless hours and an enormous effort to put us in a position to complete the merger a month ahead of schedule, so that we could hit the ground running in September. We have moved firmly into the execution phase of our Day One plan. And although, we're only two months into the process, I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing, including some very early traction on our $1 billion cost synergy commitment, as laid out on slide nine. We'll update you in more detail and provide some timing around synergy achievement at our upcoming Analyst Day on December 5. As we have come together as one team, it has become more and more apparent to me that the two organizational cultures have more similarities than differences, as I've seen that in nearly every region of business I visited within my first 60 days. In the marketplace, we continue to receive positive feedback from our customers and channel partners, and I can tell you they are just as excited about this combination as we and all of our employees are. Turning to slide 10, we will be organized around two strategic platforms : Buildings and Power. The Buildings platform represents a combination of the legacy Building Efficiency businesses within Johnson Controls and the legacy Tyco businesses. Together, these businesses will generate roughly $23 billion in annual sales and consists of several well-known and trusted brands across complex HVAC, building controls and fire and security systems. We are well-positioned in the building, with one of the broadest portfolios of products, integrated solutions, and service offerings in the market. We are also uniquely positioned with our customers and channel partners with a large installed base and significant scale in the direct channel. Going forward as one company, we will be able to leverage that global scale to expand our installed base as well as our market reach. And as the technology convergence in the building evolves, we'll be prepared to lead the way. The Power platform includes a portfolio of leading battery technologies across the product technology continuum, with number-one positions in conventional lead acid and AGM Start-Stop batteries globally. Our Power Solutions business has a large and resilient aftermarket business with consistent performance and growth throughout the cycle. I look forward to providing you more details on our strategic growth plans across the portfolio on December 5 at the Analyst Day. Let me now turn it over to Brian to walk through the financial details of the quarter. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our release this morning, our Q4 reported results, as expected, were a bit noisy and included a number of special items which resulted in a net charge of $2.82 in the quarter. We've summarized those adjustments for you in an appendix. But just given their overall size, let me briefly comment on each of them. First of all, transaction, integration and separation cost of $293 million. Those costs relate primarily to the Adient separation and the Tyco merger and were in-line with our expectations. We also had a restructuring charge in the quarter related to asset impairments as well as some workforce reductions. And the way you should view that, as outlined in the appendix, is about half of that charge is cash and the other half is non-cash. And it's really spread ratably across the businesses and corporate. We also have, as we always do in the fourth quarter, a mark-to-market pension adjustment given the accounting method that we use. That adjustment was $514 million in the fourth quarter, related primarily to a decline in interest rates year-over-year. There were also some non-recurring purchase accounting items of $74 million. A good example of that would be the requirement to step-up inventory to fair value in the opening balance sheet, and that turns out as that inventory turns. That we've called out separately at $74 million. And then there was $1.1 billion charge related to the Adient separation. As I talk through the business results, I'll exclude the impact of the special items as well as the Tyco results since they were not included in our previous guidance of $1.17 to $1.20. Similarly, we've got the Hitachi joint venture, which closed in October of 2015, and so the Hitachi JV does impact the quarter-over-quarter comparability, and I'll comment on that as I go through the results. And then for the first time, the Automotive Interiors joint venture, which closed in July of last year, we do have comparability in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year as it relates to the Interiors JV. So with that, let me turn to slide 11, Building Efficiency. Their fourth quarter sales were $3.6 billion, which were up 25% from the prior year. If you adjust for the impacts of M&A and FX, the sales grew 2% and had a strong comparable 2015 quarter, which saw a 5% growth rate. Revenues in our Systems and Services North America business were level year-over-year, and we saw a good growth in our Residential business and Products North America of 3%, and as Alex mentioned, Asia was up 8%, ex-Hitachi. We had good order growth in the quarter, up 6%, and as Alex mentioned, it's the fourth consecutive quarter where we saw order growth above the 5% level. Systems and Services North America was up 6%, Products North America was up 7% due primarily to growth in our Residential business, and Asia was up 7%. Our backlog ended the year at $4.8 billion, a 5% year-over-year improvement. Turning to segment income at Building Efficiency, it was up 17% year-over-year due primarily to the contribution of the Hitachi JV entities and the North America Residential business in Asia. And as expected, in the fourth quarter, we did see a 80 basis point reduction from the prior-year quarter to 11.3%. That was due primarily to mix related to the lower-margin Hitachi joint venture and some ongoing product and sales force investments we made. If you kind of step back and look at the full year as far as Building Efficiency margins, we ended the year up with 9.2% from 9.1% last year. And that was far in excess of the guidance that we provided in December of last year at our Analyst Day. Moving to slide 12, real quickly touching on the Tyco results, which as you know, that merger was completed on September 2. Sales for the month of September were $828 million and segment EBIT was $86 million. That $86 million does include $21 million of recurring purchase accounting amortization, so if you adjust for that, the EBIT of $107 million reflects about a 13% loss in the quarter. And I'd say overall, as we look at the Tyco businesses moving into fiscal 2017, they've got solid momentum. Turning to slide 13 on Power Solutions, they just had another great quarter. Their sales were up 7% compared to last year, 8% if you adjust for foreign-exchange and lead. And in terms of units, we saw higher volumes across all regions, with global fourth quarter shipments up 7%. Asia was up 22%, Europe was up 11%, and the Americas were up 3%. As far as Start-Stop shipments, they continued to be strong, up 30% year-over-year, growing from 3.1 million units to 4 million units. And all regions delivered higher year-on-year growth with China up 136%, albeit on a very low base. Americas up 87% in a growing market, and EMEA is up 3% in a very mature market. We also saw Q4 OE up 2% and aftermarket up 9%, again strong showing. If you look at Power Solutions segment EBIT for the quarter of $394 million, it was up 16%, primarily driven by the higher unit volumes, product mix and cost reduction efforts. There was segment margins in Q4 were up 160 basis points and were well above our expectations for the year. For the year, we had 19% margins and we had guided in December to 17%. So another great year for Power Solutions. Touching quickly on slide 14 on the Auto business : Their sales were down 5%, the higher volumes in Asia were offset by lower volumes in North America and Europe. As far as China, we did see the 100% sales numbers for our non-consolidated JVs, up 26% in the quarter to $2.9 billion and if you adjust for foreign-exchange that was actually 31% compared to industry production of 21%. So the JVs continue to perform exceptionally well. For the quarter, Automotive segment EBIT of $281 million, up 13% year-over-year, and overall Auto margins were 7.1%, up 110 basis points for the quarter. So, let's move to the financial highlights on slide 15. Overall fourth-quarter revenues were up 7% to $9.4 billion, that was primarily driven by the Hitachi JV, offset by some headwinds for FX. If you look at gross margin for the quarter, it was up 90 basis points to 20.5%, and as Alex mentioned, we continue to see the benefits of the Johnson Controls operating system efforts on a global basis. SG&A was up 13% from last year. If you remove the impact of Hitachi joint ventures, the SG&A is actually down 4% year-over-year, and I think this is really reflective of the continued focus that we have on right-sizing our cost structure in connection with the Adient spin-off. Equity income of $150 million was up 43%. That was due primarily to the Interiors joint venture, which added about $8 million year-over-year, and the Hitachi JV with $30 million. So overall, a great fourth-quarter with double-digit EBIT growth at 16%, and segment margins improving to 11.6%, which is a 90 basis point improvement. Turning to slide 16, fourth-quarter net financing charges of $77 million were slightly higher than last year, due primarily to the portion of the Adient debt proceeds that we drew on in the quarter. Tax rate remained at 17%, and the non-controlling interest was up $40 million, due primarily to the Hitachi joint venture entities. So as Alex mentioned, diluted earnings per share of $1.21 was up 16%, and I too give a lot of credit to our management teams globally to continue to focus on our external financial commitments that we've made in a period when it would be pretty easy to point to the transformational activities and other initiatives that we've got in our businesses being a distraction. So, well done to our global teams. On slide 17, balance sheet and cash flow at quarter-end. Our net debt-to-cap ratio was 39.4%, which is right in-line with expectations. We do have kind of a grossed up balance sheet at the end of this fiscal year, primarily related to the $2.2 billion of debt we assumed in connection with the Tyco merger. In addition, there was the $4 billion of newly issued debt in connection with the merger, the cash of which went to the JCI shareholders. And this balance sheet that you have at September 30, includes $3.5 billion of debt related to Adient, and there's $2 billion of cash in escrow, $1.5 billion which will be retained by JCI, and $0.5 billion has gone to Adient as of October 31. Our cash flow in the quarter was $900 million, which exceeded our expectations, and for the year adjusted free cash flow was $1.7 billion versus a plan of $1.5 billion. So I was pleased with the progress we made there in fiscal 2016. And CapEx was pretty much in-line with expectations. Just a waterfall chart on slide 18, to kind of show you the pro forma net debt; you can see we started at the $16.4 billion and the $3.5 billion of debt that went with the Adient spin on October 31. We have net cash of $700 million at the end of the year, and then we will have $1.5 billion of the $2 billion in escrow come to us. So our true pro forma net debt position as we move forward is $10.7 billion, which is right in-line with where we expected after the transformational activities. Before we open it up for questions, I'd just like to take a couple minutes here on slide 19 and talk about items of interest as we move into fiscal 2017. First of all, as we've talked about throughout the quarters this year, even though the Adient spin-off has already occurred, from an accounting standpoint we can't report that as a discontinued operation until the date of the spin. So the first time we'll report Adient as a discontinued operation will be in Q1 of fiscal 2017, and all prior periods will be restated. Consistent with George's comments regarding our two strategic platforms, we do plan on changing our reportable segments, probably in the later half of 2017. So within the Buildings platform, there will be more granularity that we provide as we move forward into 2017, and we'll talk about that a bit more at our Analyst Day on December 5. We're also going to report corporate as a stand-alone segment and we think that's going to provide better transparency to our underlying business unit margins, and the overall level of corporate costs. We will also finalize the Tyco purchase accounting. As of September 30, 2016, we've done a preliminary allocation based upon some preliminary work done by our outside valuation firm. There will be some true ups to that as we move through the first half of fiscal 2017. We'll continue to have some restructuring, and impairment and integration costs as well as our Q4 pension mark-to-market in 2017. But I think those will be communicated as far as range and expected costs, again on December 5. As Antonella mentioned, we did file a Form 8-K this morning, which shows the fiscal 2016 quarterly and full-year EPS numbers on a pro forma basis. The full-year is $2.31 and that includes about $0.31 of annual consolidated amortization expense. So on slide 20, to wrap up here, please join us on December 5 at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York for our Analyst day, and at that meeting we will present our Q1 and full fiscal 2017 guidance. And with that, Antonella, we can turn it over for questions. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Brian. Operator, could you please provide the instructions for asking questions? Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on getting to the finish line and then starting your next marathon as well. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thank you Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : The slides were real helpful as were the 8-K just to kind of sort us through the changes. And maybe just for the legacy Tyco analysts like myself, George, can give us a perspective on the quarter consistent with the metrics that we are used to seeing on organic revenue growth orders and so forth? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Sure, Deane, let me just give you a high-level summary. Certainly, as the year played out we saw a continued softness in the high-hazard heavy industrial end markets, and that had a fairly significant impact on our product businesses as they played out for the year. That does impact about 35% of our revenues in that segment, and certainly these are high-margin businesses. Overall though, the orders for Tyco were up low single-digits so we continue to expand orders. The backlog year-on-year is up 4%, which does position us well here to get out to a good start in 2017. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then, Alex, this might be a good question for the Analyst Day, but your comment that the transformation is complete, certainly, JCI is \u2013 has arrived as a multi-industry company, but the idea is portfolio optimization never ends. And where do you think \u2013 at the margin do you expect portfolio moves over the next year or so? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so that's a good question. So I'm not sure if I had an adjective in there or not. At the margin, we're going to be looking at our portfolio. That's not going to change. But I think that the comment that I made was the major transformation to get us to a platform that we can truly call ourselves a multi-industrial is complete. I mean, and I think that probably means more to the legacy Johnson Controls people that had followed us, because we've gone through this transformation over the last three years, and if you've been a spectator, it's been quite a transformation. I think where we are as we're in a position we can truly call ourselves a multi-industrial now. Now we have to \u2013 that just means \u2013 I think you just said it a minute ago that it's the new marathon begins. And portfolio optimization is not going to be something that's going to be lost on us. We're looking at our \u2013 actively looking at our portfolio both in the legacy Johnson Controls and legacy Tyco businesses, and that will continue. And we'll talk a lot about that, or at least we'll talk some about it in December, as it relates to not only capital allocation, but strategically how we want to position ourselves. So more to come on that. But if I left you to believe that we are done, that's not correct. I think I want to make sure that you understand, everyone understands, particularly our employees, that we've got ourselves now positioned where we need us to be as a true multi-industrial. The Automotive business is set-up to be successful, and I think now we have a platform for us to optimize... Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great to hear. Yeah, that's \u2013 I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Just some questions really kind of on the numbers so we're just kind of level-set here, because I think we're not getting a lot on forward guidance. But first, just on the amortization, maybe it's for Brian. It looks like the deal-related amortization came in on the low side of what was expected. Can you provide a little bit more color on what drove that, and if that number is likely to move around some more? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, I don't think that number is going to move around now significantly. I think we're pretty well grounded with the valuation firm we're working with relative to the amortizable intangible asset base. So I think the number that's out there in the pro formas is a pretty solid number as we look at it going forward. You're right, it did come down from the preliminary filings that were made. I think it came down roughly $100 million or so; I'm probably rounding there. But that had to do really with the original information that was provided to the outside firm. As you go through that process of finalizing a valuation, there's tweaks you make to it based upon variations in earnings levels by geography, and what ended up happening as a result of some of those changes we made, some of the amortizable asset base came down as far as intangibles, and it really got reallocated to either indefinite-lived intangibles or to goodwill. So I think that number where it stands right now, Jeff, is a pretty good number to use. And that number will be with us for a while because the life associated with those amortizable assets is anywhere from 10 years to 15 years, so that's a pretty good number. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then \u2013 thank you very much for that detail. And then also just on the baseline number of $2.31, I believe stranded costs would be conceptually in that number. Can you give us a sense of what that is, and how rapidly that could come down, or what we should think about that? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, I mean, the stranded costs number that we've kind of been talking about related to the Adient spin-off. It was about $150 million, and I think a little over half of that was taken out in fiscal 2016, so it's already reflected in the results. The other half will come out during fiscal 2017, and it's really part of the $300 million of productivity that we've talked about that will be recognized over the next three years as part of the JCOS benefits that we're going to realize. So I think that's the way to think about that, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks. And if I could just sneak one more bigger-picture in. George, you mentioned kind of just an early traction on cost synergies. I'm just also wondering early reaction from customers on the sale side, I doubt you have some big marquee order to share with us today, but how is the sales funnel looking? And do you guys see some early traction on that effort? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Sure, Jeff. As you know, and Alex and I've talked a lot about this. We had an outstanding integration team put together over the last 10 months and they've done some great planning work and now we're into the implementation phase. Revenue growth is a key component of the merger, and we've had commercial teams across the globe laying out the existing customer bases, how we serve them today, the opportunity that we have to be able to cross-sell and serve them with more of our portfolio. Build services and how we create additional value for those customers that we serve. And we feel really good about the planning process, and now we're putting in the right incentives so that no matter where our commercial people sit across the globe, they are going to be properly incentivized to be able to bring the new capabilities to their customer base, and to be able to drive growth. We're going to lay this out in a lot more detail at the Analyst Day in December, but we are certainly feeling very good about this because this, certainly, was a key component of the merger to be able to accelerate the ability to be able to serve customers, being able to capitalize on the full portfolio, being able to converge some of the technology to be able to longer-term change the game, and how we serve buildings. And I feel really good about the progress we've made. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hey, Jeff, I'd just add as Alex said, you know we had an opportunity to work on this almost in a lab environment for nine months, so it wasn't real except for the fact that we had a chance to visit with customers. And what I've seen happen with the integration teams over the last couple of months, it's gone from an idea to a reality, and I've seen a lot of confidence building in our team. As we get an opportunity to meet with the integration team and now moving into the business. George put together an organization that's going to activate it, he talked about incentives, I know he'll talk about that. But I'm actually really pleased with what I see. One of the things I didn't mention earlier, I'm just going to sneak in, it doesn't have anything to do with this question, but it relates to being able to get synergies. We've actually seen almost $100 million in revenue \u2013 in secured the CBRE relationship, and we've learned a lot. It's not the same, but we've learned a lot in being able to pull-through activities from activities like that. So I think our team is seeing those things too, and that gives them confidence. I think we're going to be pleasantly surprised. Obviously, we've got to secure it before we revenue it, but I think in December, we'll maybe have a couple of those stories we can share with you. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. And your questions about customers, I've met with a number of customers in my first 60 days here with the integration, and they're very excited about the combined capabilities and our ability to be able to better serve them on combining the work that we do across our channels. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Congratulations. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Gautam Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: I have three quick questions. First, I was wondering, at the Investor Day do you plan to lay out multi-year targets, revenue and EPS like you used to at Tyco? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Well, I can't speak about Tyco. But we will give you some \u2013 we'll give you some ongoing metrics that you can look at that you can hold us accountable to, hold ourselves accountable to, which I think, look, based on what I've seen in the past, very similar to what we've done at Johnson Controls Investor Day. So you will get something that gives you guidance on each aspect, whether it'd be cost reductions, productivity, top-lines, bottom-line. It will give you some guidance on how we're thinking about capital allocation also. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : I think we will probably give pretty solid focus on fiscal 2017, and then we will give medium-term guidance relative to key financial metrics, sales growth, segment EBIT growth et cetera. And that's reasonably consistent with what JCI has done historically as well. So you'll be able to kind of take it through 2020 based upon the way we're doing things. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That would be helpful. And the second question was on Power Solutions and the strong growth you experienced in the quarter. Was there any one-time affect in the quarter? Or is this what we should be anticipating going forward in terms of organic growth based on the mix shifting to AGM and what have you? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Well, I think the unit growth, I don't really think about it quarter-to-quarter because there are \u2013 depending on \u2013 a lot of times it depends on pricing and stocking. A quarter can move around a little bit. But I think what you've seen if you look at our average growth across the year, I think that's really consistent. I think when you look at it quarter-to-quarter, it's a little bit dangerous as each one of our customers is either filling their channel getting ready for the season, or finishing the season and sometimes that doesn't happen the same quarter after quarter. But if you look on an annual basis I think it's fairly consistent, which is around 5%, and I think that's probably a pretty good number. And the mix is obviously going to help us because it's more and more AGM and of course, a lot of our capacity is moving into China, so it's going to be heavily focused on Asia growth. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. And lastly, I was wondering, maybe you gave us this before, but what is the dividend for the go-forward company? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : We didn't get into that. (40:02) Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : That will be approved by our board at the November meeting, and it's still under review. So we don't have the go-forward dividend for 2017 established yet. We'll be announcing that at the Analyst Day, as well. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks a lot. I'll turn it over. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on the milestone, everybody. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Steve. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Steve Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thank you. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So I just wanted to maybe start with getting a little more granularity, if I could, on the HVAC side, and specifically YORK equipment as opposed to services, resi versus non-resi. Can you just give us some color for the quarter of what was the organic growth in that business that you saw, resi, non-resi in the Americas maybe? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Why do you ask? We had a great quarter. I'll put it in units. Our residential unit growth was 23%, which is outstanding. Now we have a lot of new products to come out. We also announced some pricing that's going to be effective the first of November. So I'd have to say that, I'm sure some of that impacted it, but what we're seeing is an awful lot of growth in both residential and our light commercial growth was in the upper teens also, from unit perspective. And that's really a benefit from a lot of the product investments we've been making over the last couple years, and then we've also been making some investments in some of our channel structures. So great quarter, gained share. Glad you asked the question Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And the second part of that question was non-resi? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Non-resi in the unitary was close to 17% Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And applied? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Around 4% Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Specifically, on the applied side for, maybe large absorption chillers, are you seeing large project activity picking up on the bid front? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : We're seeing project activity because that would be in line with our SSNA channel in North America where we're seeing weakness is in the Middle East and Europe, particularly as it relates to when it's starts moving toward the energy-related markets is where we're seeing some weakness. So we're seeing strength in China. We're seeing steady as she goes in North America, and having, just like, the rest of the market, almost a near collapse when you think about the Middle East because of the energy-related part of the market. And then of course that bleeds into our industrial refrigeration. So a lot of the gains that we are getting are being offset by industrial refrigeration and some of the toughness in the Middle East market. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's really helpful and sounds good. Secondly, on CapEx and cash. Maybe just a little bit of picture or you may defer this to December, but how should we think about in Georgia, also, as you're starting to look across the organization, how that CapEx may pace down over years or how working capital may improve on maybe the combined business? A little color there would be helpful. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. We ended the year with CapEx right at $1.250 billion which is what we planned for. The current year included in that number. Round numbers was about $300 million or $350 million related to the Automotive business. And if you look at Tyco's historic CapEx, it's in that $300 million to $350 million range, as well. So I think in the near-term here we don't see a significant reduction in CapEx. I think a number between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion will probably be steady-state for us for the next two or three years as we ramp up some of the investments that Alex talked about in the Power Solutions business. That does give us a reinvestment ratio that's probably around 1.5 times or thereabouts. And so we recognize it's probably a bit higher, but I also would tell you that the growth investments we're making have good business case financial metrics associated with them. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Great. We'll leave the rest for December. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to start with the Building Efficiency organic sales growth. You'd called out that the EMEA region was very soft in line with other companies. But if we look at the North America Systems and Service specifically, sort of flattish sales there and I think that did drag down the global organic sales average a little bit. Did you see any delays in customer conversion of orders into revenues? Or it's just sort of classic kind of lumpiness and we should expect that revenue number in North America Systems and Service to accelerate soon? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, I think we had a pretty strong comparable last year in North America, but I do think it's just project flow. There's nothing that you would look inside there and see an aberration. The orders are strong; backlog's up. So I don't expect that that's something to be concerned about. I think it's probably, as you just said, just the timing of projects themselves. Nothing sticks out as being unusual. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then related to that, you called out the strength in some of the institutional buildings verticals. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yes. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Remind us, I guess how much of your Building Efficiency segment is institutional? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Well over half. Probably two-thirds of our Buildings business is institutional related. And just to remind you, when we say that, that would be the government verticals, healthcare, and education. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then secondly would just be on the Power business. Very good incremental margins, 40%, 45% or so. Could you remind us where we are on the cost build-out within China? On and off in the past 18 months, that has been a headwind on your EBIT margin within Power. Was there any kind of one-time factor driving that down in Q4? Or you think that the margin headwind from China is kind of behind you largely in Power? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Well, we're going to continue to launch plants. So I think that what you \u2013 instead of what I \u2013 if you look at China and you separated it, what you'd see because we're adding capacity obviously is \u2013 because of launch costs, it's going to be a lower margin than other regions. But I think the right way to think about it is the plant economics are no different in China than anywhere else. And so we're getting good economics, but we also have the launch costs that are in. And they're going to be there for a while. But as we continue to add, as our capacity increases, it becomes a much smaller percentage of the overall cost structure. But launch costs in that business are fairly significant. It takes a while to launch those products. Some of the quirkiness of the China market as it relates to the testing required to go-to-market. And then of course, having a plant that's got open capacity also has some cost. But I would say that the plant economics, which is probably the most important thing, are really no different in China than anywhere else. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : I think our EBIT margins of 19% for fiscal 2016 were pretty strong relative to what we expected. But I think if you look at the investments that we're making in Power Solutions in China over the next two years to three years, there will be a bit of drag on margins simply because of the launch costs that Alex referred to. But we'll actually be providing both 2017 and guidance through 2020 on Power Solutions margins on December 5. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research Group. Your line is now open. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just a follow-up on couple of the questions on your non-resi businesses, particularly in legacy JCI. Alex, I think there's been a lot of debate around where we're at in the non-resi cycle. Clearly, institutional verticals are a little later positioned than some of the other ones. But can you just talk about the lead time and the visibility and the \u2013 maybe the percentage of revenue that you have booked for 2017, just to give people some comfort about the level of visibility, kind of the long-cycle nature of that business as we stand here today? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so the good news about our business is that it's late cycle and the bad news, it's late cycle. In this particular case it's good news, because as we build our backlog, typically our projects are more complex, larger in late cycle. So our position is probably \u2013 we're probably in a better \u2013 it was tougher for us to get to this point, but probably in a better position than we have been because if you look six months, nine months out, our business is fairly predictable just because of the nature of the type of projects that we have. And so if you look at the flow rates of our projects, on average you're talking 9 months to 12 months. And it's pretty easy for us to see six months to nine months out. And then we look at our forelog, which is our pipeline, we can pretty much look at the next quarter and see what we can expect. So I think that we feel, if you look at it from a FY 2017 perspective, I think we have pretty good visibility in North America. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. And then, just following-up on some of the stranded costs questions. I understand that JCOS productivity has been aimed to bring those down. I think it was $100 million a year that we should expect. Brian talked about $75 million of leftover stranded in the next year that, that comes out. Does that come out on a run rate basis or does it actually come out in $75 million lower. I'm not trying to put too fine a point on it, but it seems like this has been a source of confusion. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, I think the $300 million I referred to is $100 million over each of the next three years and we took out a little bit more than half of the $150 million in 2016 and the remaining piece is really part of the productivity $100 million that's embedded in the 2017 plan that we'll present December 5. So it's part of the productivity piece that's been out there given the fact we knew that we were going to be spinning Adient. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Probably the way to think about it is, because you take out $75 million last year, take out $75 million on stranded costs, whether it's an exit rate or ongoing rate, you probably at a zero-sum game here because you've got last year's costs benefiting this year, and this year's costs benefiting next year. So I think you can \u2013 I know that you \u2013 probably a little more detail and we'll give it to you, but I would think it's going to be fairly consistent with what we've seen over the last year. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, guys. This is actually Evelyn Chow on behalf of Joe. Maybe just starting with Power for a minute. Your EBIT was very strong and represents a much higher-level of EBIT dollars than you've historically achieved in 4Q. Can you just help give us a sense of what were the headwinds and tailwinds you saw on the margin line? Maybe the lower lead prices, potentially as some mix shift from the better aftermarket and start-stop growth. A little color there would be helpful. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, a lot of time when we give you the numbers \u2013 I think when we gave you numbers, we were trying to make sure we take out the effect of lead. Lead is, right now, it's about where it was last year but it's been a round trip that's gone down and it's back up to about where it was a year ago at this time. So I think that that's probably not much of a change year-on-year if I think of it intuitively. One of the things that is obviously a tailwind, is the more AGM Start-Stop batteries we sell, the better. The second thing that's happened is that, we're seeing some really strong growth in the market in North America, particularly. I think what the people inside the business call is an echo of five years ago when the OE build started, we're starting to see the aftermarket from that grow and registrations pick up. So we're seeing some strength in North America which is good for us. We do well when we're able to run at capacity and then Start-Stop in China, and China aftermarket growth has been incredibly strong this year, which is something that we had always planned for, but we're just really pleased to see it happen. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. And then maybe... George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Lots of tail \u2013 a lot of headwinds, not tailwinds. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Makes sense. And then maybe a similar question on the Building Efficiency side. I think you've called out some investments both this quarter and in prior quarters, too. I guess I just want to get a sense of what the puts and takes are on the margins and maybe a little bit more context around the year-over-year decline that you saw in the business on the margin line. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : So as Brian talked about the specific margins for the quarter, but to give you overall what's happening. First off, we knew that Hitachi was going to be a drag on our overall margins in general because of the lower margin business. However, Hitachi is doing better than we expected, but it's still dilutive. So that's one of the things that's kind of fighting us on a year-on-year basis. Brian can give you some more specific color, but the investments that we've been making, two specific investments, some in our product ranges, you know, there's been refrigerant changes, plus, as many of you may know, over the last few years, we've had to catch up on some investments in our UPG business, light commercial and residential. We're seeing the benefit from those investments now. And then we've made significant investments in just sales head count over the last year. So those are the three buckets of investments. Brian, you might want to give a little bit of color on the margins. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, I mean, the margins for the year at Building Efficiency were 9.2%, and that's a 10 basis point improvement. But I think what you're referring to is it was pretty choppy quarter-to-quarter. I think in the first quarter for Building Efficiency, we had a 50 basis point improvement. Second quarter, we were down 50 basis points. Third quarter, we were up 90 basis points, and fourth quarter here that you're referring to is the 80 basis point decline. So it's been choppy. And a lot of that has to do with the timing of when we're making some of these product and sales force investments and also the timing of some new product launches. And in particular, in the fourth quarter, there was some new product launches that impacted the basis points reduction in the quarter. So I think to step back and look at it, I think you really should look at it on a full-year basis and say we improved 10 basis points versus what we thought going into the year. We thought our margins were going to be in the 8.1% to 8.3% range, so I think the folks at BE are actually pretty happy with where they ended up margin-wise. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. And what I would say is we did that and we didn't jeopardize any of our investments. We made the investments we needed to so to not only help us with the growth that we're seeing now, but allow us to position ourselves well for the future. And so I think being able to get those margins and maintain our investments and our product investments, I feel good about. Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : In terms of cash flow, I mean, you're going to have the elevated CapEx continuing in Power. It seems like a lot of the opportunity cash conversion-wise has to come out of Building Efficiency. Can you talk about where that stands, and as you've looked at the initial integration plans, et cetera, just frame a little bit the opportunity you see for that piece of the business cash-wise? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : So, I think if you look at free cash flow adjusted for next year, and the reason I say adjusted is we've got some really choppy tax impacts that will hit us from a free cash flow standpoint in fiscal 2017. But as I step back and look at Building Efficiency, I think the opportunities for improvement are probably in the \u2013 geographically in certain pockets in the accounts receivable area. I do think there might be some opportunities in Power Solutions in the inventory area, and I think on a combined basis, as we look at Tyco and JCI together and kind of put together the JCOS operating system embedded across the organization, I think there's going to be some working capital opportunities there as well for legacy JCO (57:48) and Tyco combined. So I mean, I guess when we look at fiscal 2017, it's going to be choppy, but on an adjusted basis, I think we're going to probably be in 75% to 85%. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the treatment of restructuring and special charges, I mean, there's obviously some things to be called out, but is there also sort of a pay-as-you-go restructuring or repositioning element that you are going to include? Could you just maybe clarify what's going to be in and what's going to be out of the numbers? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : I think the adjustments that we've historically made have been the tax payments, and we've had separation costs included in the adjustments, and then any other significant one-time charges. I mean, we're going to put only items that are kind of viewed by us to be material on a quarterly basis in that adjusted free cash flow number. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. And just to clarify on the historical Tyco side, because Shannon, I think you're referring to how we typically grouped restructuring and the repositioning all into one line item. So what's reflected in the pro formas is the restructuring dollars or charges are out, but those repositioning charges that Tyco took in 2016 are part of the $2.31 pro forma. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Operator, I think we have time for maybe one more quick question. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Rob. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Just wanted to actually follow-up on a couple of things. One is on the government vertical within North American non-resi, I know that last year in the quarter that was a pretty significant pressure. Did that snap back? Or what are you seeing in government? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Still under pressure. So if you looked across the institutional, that would be the one place, healthcare is reasonably flattish, and the government business is down, continue still down under pressure. Everything else is really strong, but we're still seeing pressure there. I don't think that is anything that's unusual to us. I think what we're seeing right now is \u2013 maybe it has to do with the environment we are in, hopefully things will free up here after today. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. And then you talked about strength in Hitachi. I think half of that is residential air-conditioning in Japan. Is that what's doing well? Or what's growing there so well? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, I wouldn't say it's across the board, but it's in a lot of places. The Residential is doing much better than we expected. But what we are seeing is it's really quite impressive. Maybe George can even comment. He had a chance to see some of the integration activities, but on the cost side across the board we're seeing an awful lot of benefit that we've been able to bring through our integration and synergy activities. There's been some pricing actions and some channel restructuring as it relates to Residential business. There's been some new product introductions. The China business with our partner at Hisense is doing really well, and Taiwan is doing fantastic. So I would say it's not everywhere, but it's more places than not we are seeing improvement, both on the cost and on the sales side. There is still opportunity, but it's been pretty impressive. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, just a quick comment on that. I had the chance to join the team at the one-year anniversary and was very impressed with the work that's been done from an integration standpoint, deploying the JCOS across all of their business processes. As you talked about, how do we now leverage that platform in many other markets that are very attractive markets that we don't ultimately served today. And the team has got plans, detailed plans and how we take that product and truly capitalize on the growth opportunity that we see in any other markets beyond Japan. So I would tell you my first view there and I was very impressed with the team, very impressed with the performance in the first year. And truly, it's going to be a strategic platform for the future for the company. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. Been a great partner too. (1:02:06) Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got you. I think originally that was targeted as like a 4% to 5% Op margin, and it sounds like it's tracking well ahead of that? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Well ahead of that. It was a great investment for us, it was even better investment for Hitachi. Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining and you may now all disconnect.",

Bernstein & Co. LLC Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Operator : Welcome to Johnson Controls' first quarter 2017 earnings call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' first quarter fiscal 2017 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli; President and Chief Operating Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you view today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statement that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins, exclude transaction, integration, and separation costs, as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedule attached to our press release. All comparisons to the prior year are on a combined basis, which excludes the results of Adient, which is presented in discontinued operations and includes the results of Tyco net of conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting. Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Sales of $7.1 billion in the quarter increased slightly year over year on a reported basis. Organic growth of 1% was partially offset by the net impact of FX, M&A and lead pass-through pricing. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls' ordinary shareholders was $0.39 and included net charges of $0.14 related to special items. These special items were primarily composed of transaction, integration and separation costs as well as non-recurring purchase accounting charges, which were partially offset by discrete tax items. Adjusting for special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.53 per share compared to $0.48 in the prior-year quarter. Now let me turn the call over to Alex. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Antonella. Good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details of the first quarter, I'd like to just take one minute, if we turn to slide 5 in your deck, to talk about the key priorities, and we talked about this when we were together in December. I just want to remind everyone what it is that we're focused on before we get into some of the specifics. When you think about this merger, the intangibles of this is bringing together two cultures of these two great companies and we shared with you that we have put together our vision, mission, values and we talked about that at the Investor Day. We're well on our way on our journey to institutionalize this framework that we shared with you across our enterprise. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering our operating and financial plans. And we started off Q1 I'd say not exactly where we wanted to on the growth front, but certainly ahead of our plan on both margin and expansion of our earnings. And I remain confident in our ability to achieve our commitments for the full year. We're deeply engaged in a process of developing a new strategic plan for the combined company. It's informed by our insights from our customers on the convergence of technology. Evaluating our portfolio is an ongoing process that we do here and we're ensuring that we're investing in the right businesses not just because they're good businesses, but they're the right businesses for Johnson Controls. We've installed a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we talked about that in December, which balances our investments for future growth and returning capital to shareholders. Our current set of businesses are well positioned for the right markets for the long term. And I'm confident we'll continue to execute and drive shareholder value. Let's turn to slide 6 and let's talk about our start. Now, we started off this year with a great start with solid activity particularly around our integration activities. And we're currently proud of what's been accomplished by the team. If you think about our first quarter with the spin of Adient and the merger activities around Tyco, I feel, and George will get into the details, I feel very good about our start. The first quarter profitability in both our Buildings and Power are better than we expected. And our teams are focused on what's in their control and they remain focused on execution. We began to realize our cost synergies and we're actually a bit ahead of where we expect it for the quarter and that bodes well for the future. In terms of our end markets, the non-residential market continues to improve. Specifically, the institutional markets continue to be strong. And we saw good order activity there, particularly in healthcare. More importantly our sales teams are excited about the opportunity to work together and our quoting pipeline remains very active and cross-selling activity continues to build. As you know and I just referenced, we completed the Adient spin-off at the end of October. And I'd just like to take the opportunity to wish Bruce McDonald and his team continued success at Adient. Let's go to slide 7. So we put this slide in just to remind everyone about our investments in Asia-Pacific. And it really occurred to me that we wanted to make sure that we continue to talk about that and so I'd just like to spend a few minutes updating you on our progress. You've heard us talk about Asia-Pacific, particularly China and how excited we remain about the growth opportunities in the near term and also in the long run. And we're seeing both top line and bottom line improvement. We see performance across all of our businesses. In Buildings, the organic growth is in the low to mid single-digit range, and in Power we're seeing excellent results growing north of 20% year-on-year on organic basis. We're really seeing the benefit of these strategic investments we've made over the past few years. More importantly we continue to improve our profitability in this region with several hundred basis points of margin expansion. We're leveraging the expanding infrastructure that we have and the infrastructure of our customers and a growing middle class. And our scale continues to accelerate both our growth and improve profitability. I'm also impressed with what's been accomplished. We've been at Hitachi in our integration, Hitachi over a year and all the work that's been put in place to implement our Johnson Controls operating system within the Hitachi joint venture is \u2013 continues to contribute an even stronger margin year, year-over-year improvement. I'm proud of our Asia-Pacific team, I want to give them a shout out and I'm confident that they'll continue to grow while continuing to improve our profitability. Let's move to slide 8 and talk about the quarter. Sales in the quarter were basically flat with prior year $7.1 billion on a reported basis. Organically sales grew a little over 1% with a modest decline in Buildings more than offset by increased volume and a favorable mix in Power. We continue to see strong growth in start-stop. George will give you more detail on that in a few minutes. Continued profitability and EBITA of 10% year over year on a reported basis and if you adjust for FX and lead, up 13%, extremely strong execution across all of our businesses. Adjusted EBIT margins expanded 90 basis points overall, far exceeding our expectation of 30 basis points. EPS for the quarter was up 10% versus prior year at $0.53, above the top end of an adjusted range of $0.50 to $0.52, a great start to the new year, and look forward to getting into the details. With that, I'll turn it over to George, and George can go through the businesses. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the detailed business review, I thought I'd start with a quick integration update. As I discussed with you at our Investor Day back in December, I've been spending quite a bit of my time with our business unit leaders across the organization, getting deeper into the businesses and developing our strategies as a go-forward company. I've also had the opportunity to meet with several of our sales teams and I can tell you that energy levels are high with some early wins in the quarter, which set us up for future revenue synergy opportunities. Let me share with you a few of these recent wins, which highlight collaboration among the teams. Building off a strong legacy Building Efficiency performance record, a government customer contacted our branch regarding a fire system issue with another competitor's equipment. Our local branch teams worked together to secure a life-safety repair project, including a complete SimplexGrinnell fire alarm system. In Canada, our fire team was able to leverage a strong Johnson Controls customer relationship to secure an order for a very large fire sprinkler project. And in Latin America, the joint team had a combined win including a building management system, HVAC, access control, video, and a communication system for a hospital. Again, these are just a few examples of early wins. On the cost synergies side, we have implemented a strong governance structure to track costs and all related synergies. As we laid out for you in December, we expect to capture $250 million to $300 million in cost synergies and productivity savings in 2017. And as Alex mentioned, we are off to a strong start. We achieved roughly $50 million in synergies and productivity or about $0.05 on an EPS basis in the quarter. We expect to capture a similar amount in the second quarter. And then based on the timing around things like head count reductions, we expect to achieve $0.07 in the third quarter and $0.08 in the fourth quarter. The integration of two large organizations requires a lot of heavy lifting, commitment and leadership. Not all decisions are easy, but we have a strong team leading the process, ensuring we execute on decisions made and we move forward to the next step. Both the integration team and the businesses are guided around four main objectives : grow, integrate, change, and operate. We are making good progress and I look forward to keeping you updated on our continued success. Let's turn now to a review of the businesses, starting with Building Technologies & Solutions on slide 10. On a reported basis, Buildings sales declined 2% or a little less than 1% organically to $5.2 billion in the quarter. When you look at the field side of the business, which represents about 70% of total sales, organic growth was relatively flat overall, with a few positives and a few areas of pressure. We had strong growth in applied HVAC systems, which was up mid single-digits. In fire and security, both North America and the rest of world grew in the low single-digit range. On the other hand, performance contracting continued to face pressure tied to federal government budget delays, as well as a tougher prior year comparison, while industrial refrigeration is pressured by the oil and gas and process end markets. These two businesses were down about 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. On the flip side, our products business, which represents the remaining 30% of sales, declined 3% organically year over year. We continued to see very strong growth in UPG, which was up low teens, driven by increased shipments in both residential and light commercial. The strength in UPG was more than offset by a mid-single-digit decline in fire and security products related to the high-hazard heavy industrial end markets. Turning to orders, overall growth of 2% year over year excluding FX and M&A was driven by a 3% increase in field orders, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in our quick-turn product orders, which pressured our sales growth in the quarter. We have seen some early signs of stabilization on the orders front in industrial refrigeration, which is encouraging. Additionally, we expect the decline in fire and security products to ease, with revenues starting to flatten out. This stabilization combined with the timing of backlog conversion gives us confidence in improved sales growth in the second quarter. Backlog of $8.1 billion was up 6% year over year and up 2% sequentially, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A. Buildings EBITA increased 3% year over year, was 6% excluding the headwind from foreign currency to $578 million. The margin increased 60 basis points year over year to 11.1%, benefiting from strong productivity savings and the early traction we're seeing on cost synergies, which more than offset planned incremental product and channel investments during the quarter. Also contributing to the increased margin was the Hitachi JV, which continues to execute well with another quarter of solid operational improvement, although aided by an easy comparison to the prior year. Recall the Hitachi JV closed early in the first quarter of 2016, but the benefits from restructuring actions and plant productivity initiatives do not begin to bear fruit until the second quarter. We would expect that as we move forward in 2017, the magnitude of year-over-year profit improvements generated by the Hitachi JV will become smaller. Turning now to Power Solutions on slide 11, sales increased 9% year over year on a reported basis and 7% organically to $1.9 billion. As a reminder, the organic change excludes the impact of lead pass-through, which benefited Power's top line by just over 250 basis points. Overall, global unit shipments increased 5% year over year, driven by aftermarket shipments, which were up 7%. Global start-stop shipments continued to expand with a 27% increase year over year, with another quarter of significant growth in China and the Americas. Power Solutions segment EBITA increased 8% on a reported basis or 12% excluding foreign currency and lead to $390 million. Power's margin was down 20 basis points year over year on a reported basis, including a 110 basis point headwind from the impact of higher lead cost. Underlying margins excluding the impact of lead increased 90 basis points year over year, driven by leverage on higher volumes and favorable product mix, both higher aftermarket and higher start-stop shipments. Now let me turn the call over to Brian to walk through Corporate and the consolidated financial details of the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, George. Good morning. So for the first time, we will be reporting Corporate as a standalone segment. I think this provides a bit more transparency to the true underlying EBITA performance of our businesses. This segment is really comprised of enterprise-wide costs like executive management costs, public company costs, and other functional administrative costs that really aren't directly attributable to our primary businesses. Our Corporate segment expense did decrease 12% year over year, and this was primarily due to some of the productivity initiatives and the merger synergies that we had identified as part of the planning process last year, and both were a bit better than expected in the quarter. If I turn to slide 13, there are a lot of moving pieces in this quarter relative to the special items and also the fact that Adient is for the first time reported as a discontinued operation. Given the size of some of the special items, let me just briefly comment on each of those, the first being transaction, integration, and separation costs associated with our portfolio activities. That was roughly $134 million, and the way to think about that is about half of it is transaction-related and half of it is integration-related. We had a restructuring and impairment charge for $78 million. The majority of that would be severance-related. We had a lump sum pension buyout in the first quarter. And as a result of that, which was done in connection with the Adient spinoff, there's a requirement to go through a remeasurement of the liability and assets in the first quarter. And that resulted actually in a $117 million gain in Q1. We had some non-recurring purchase accounting expenses that Antonella referred to. The two primary areas there are the inventory step-up amortization, which is now fully behind us at the end of Q1. And also, we continue to amortize the backlog asset that was set up as part of purchase accounting. And then lastly, there was a discrete tax benefit related to some planning in our foreign entities that resulted in a $101 million benefit. The net of all that is a $0.14 charge, which when added to the $0.39 reported gets to the $0.53 that we've been talking about this morning. So, as I go through my comments, I will exclude these special items and also the comparison will be the pro forma combined financials that we put out on fiscal 2016 in the November 8-K that we filed. So, overall first quarter revenues were up slightly at $7.1 billion. If you exclude FX, lead, and M&A activity, organic sales were up 1%. Gross margin was constant at 31.2% and SG&A was down 3%, which was reflective of the cost reduction initiatives that we have across our business and the merger synergies. If you move to equity income of $55 million, it was 20% higher than year-ago levels, again related primarily to the strong Hitachi year-over-year performance. And then as Alex mentioned, for the first quarter we delivered double-digit segment EBIT growth, and we had EBIT margins of 10.7% which were 90 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016 and again both of those exceeded our expectations for the quarter. If we turn to page 14, net financing charges were $119 million which were slightly higher than last year, and our effective tax rate as we communicated on Analyst Day was at 15%, which compares favorably to last year's rate of 17%. Hitachi continues to perform well and that is also the reason for the increase to $40 million in the minority interest add back line item on the income statement, it's up $11 million year over year. And then overall we had a really strong first quarter with diluted EPS of $0.53 versus $0.48 a year ago. And our business unit management team really continue to deliver strong results during this period of transformation and the level of integration activity that's going on across our company. So turning to cash flow on slide 15, our first quarter adjusted cash flow was an outflow of $300 million. As mentioned at Analyst Day, there are a number of one-time expected payments that we realized in the first quarter. The most notable is the $1.2 billion tax payment we made related to the Adient spin-off. We also had some other items related to Adient's cash outflow for the quarter of $300 million and then we had some restructuring and change control payments of $300 million and transaction, integration and separation costs of a couple of hundred million which would include Adient. So, Q1 has historically been a cash outflow quarter for us. So, the adjusted free cash flow number is consistent with our expectations and we remain focused on delivering the $2.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the year. If we move to the balance sheet at quarter end, we had net debt to cap of 33.6% versus 39.7% at year-end. That's really related to the fact that as part of the Adient spin-out there was a $4 billion reduction in our equity and as a result that drove the increase in the ratio. Also during the quarter, we completed our previously announced debt exchange offers related to both the legacy JCI and Tyco debt, and we also made $535 million of scheduled debt repayments in the quarter. I would also just point out that beginning in Q2 we commenced a share repurchase program and expect to buy back about $200 million to $250 million of our shares during the rest of fiscal 2017. And again as we've mentioned, this is really focused on countering the dilutive impact of stock option exercises. And then finally I'd just comment that we continue to evaluate our overall capital structure in order to take advantage of opportunities related to the current interest rate environment as well as the timing of our future debt maturities. So, if you move to slide 17, just a couple of things I'd like to point out here. We've already talked about Adient being reflected as a discontinued operation. Just as a reminder, beginning in the third quarter of this year, we will be changing our segment reporting for the Buildings business. At this time, for the first and second quarter, we'll continue to report segments for I would say the legacy BE business in the same four segments we've reported previously. And then Tyco will be reported as a single standalone business within the Buildings set of businesses. And, as you may recall from Analyst Meeting, when we get to the third quarter, we'll have a Global Products segment. And then, we will have our Installation Project Service business, really our field business in three geographies; North America, Europe, EMEA and Latin America, and Asia. Also, as we move through fiscal 2017, we'll continue to have some special items and our guidance that we give here today will exclude any the impacts of those special items. And, lastly, I just wanted to point out that we did end the first quarter, harmonized the backlog definitions between Johnson Controls and Tyco, the primary adjustment related to the way both legacy companies had treated renewable service contracts. And so, the backlog what we're reporting here that's up 6% reflects those new definitions. Moving to slide 18, which shows the waterfall for our first quarter results, you can see the $0.05 year-over-year EPS improvement. That really comes from cost synergies and productivity savings which drove $0.05, along with volume mix, which is $0.02, both in line with our expectations. In fact, the cost synergies and productivity savings is a couple pennies higher. That was partially offset by planned investments in our Buildings and Power Solutions businesses, which was a $0.02 impact. And then the favorable tax rate was really offset by the FX headwinds we had in the quarter. All-in-all $0.53, which represents a 10% growth over the prior year, and we really are off to a solid start as we move through fiscal 2017. If I turn to page 19, in fiscal second quarter, you can see here that our organic sales will be up 2% and EPS at $0.48 to $0.50, which is up 7% to 11% year over year. And this reduction in Q2 earnings compared to Q1 earnings sequentially is consistent with the historic patterns of both Johnson Controls and Tyco, and really is the result of the seasonality in our Power Solutions business where our customers go through a strong customer stocking period in the months of October through December. The waterfall also shows the benefits of synergies and productivity improvements, that does remain at $0.05 through the second quarter. I would tell you that the first quarter synergies and productivity savings were really a lot of the low-hanging fruit that we're able to quickly move on as part of integration activities. I think as we get the processes and procedures in place here over the next quarter to ringfence both the legacy Tyco business as well as our federal business, I think we'll begin to see the second half ramp up in synergy savings. And then I've got a last slide here that I just wanted to go through relative to the phasing in the first half and second half of our EPS bill. Just to provide some context around this, you can see that the normal seasonality, it's contributing a lion's share of the improvement in the second half along with the ramp-up and the synergy saves that we expect and as Alex mentioned, we're really running a bit ahead of our first quarter target. So I think that bodes well for us looking at the second half of the year. But all-in-all, we remain very confident in delivering a very strong fiscal 2017 and we reaffirm our full-year guidance of $2.60 to $2.75, which will represent a year-over-year increase of anywhere from 13% to 19%. So with that, Antonella, we can it open up for questions. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Brian. Operator, could you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and open up the lines? Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Nigel. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, George, you addressed in your prepared remarks the impact of the heavy industrial declines on the fire and security products. But I'm just curious that the field and product growth divergence is about 6 points this quarter. And it's something we've seen echoed by some of your competitors. I'm just wondering if in addition to that, that pressure from the heavy industrial, whether we're seeing some channel inventory clearance, and any perspective on that would be helpful. And then as it relates to the guidance of 2% to 4% for Buildings this year, just given the first half order trends, and the 1Q performance, are we already looking at the sort of the 2% zone for the full year? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Nigel, I think the first question was related to the fire and security products within the heavy industrial, high-hazard space? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's more \u2013 just interested in the divergence between field and product trends, and the extent to which we've seen inventory clearance in products. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yes, let me start with the field, within fire and security. We have been building and this holds true also for the legacy JCI Building Efficiency business, we've been building orders consistently about 3% or 4% over the last year or so, and that's been building the backlog. And what we're beginning to see is actually the conversion of that backlog within the fire and security space. And so both businesses, both North America and rest of the world up somewhere 2% to 3%, which actually is a reflection of the progress we've made with orders in building the backlog. Relative to products, products are a shorter, your shorter cycle turn business, and as we've seen our first quarter last year was pretty good within the fire and security space. So now we have a \u2013 the last of our tough compare within the first quarter within fire and security. I believe we've seen the inflection point based on the current trends that we see with the activity that's taking place. A lot of this is being driven by the Middle East. And so the Middle East, when you look at both combined businesses, is down pretty significantly. That's driving both the Middle East field business as well as our product businesses. We've seen some real bright spots here over the quarter with some nice wins and orders coming through. And I think that bodes well here as we project the remainder of the year, both within the industrial refrigeration business, within the legacy BE business, as well as now the flow of our product businesses supporting the heavy industrial, high-hazard end markets within the legacy Tyco product businesses. We continue to make the investment in our products. So we have not slowed the investments. And I think as the market begins to recover, we're going to be positioned extremely well to be able to capitalize on that recovery. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the part on the 2% to 4% for the full year in Buildings, is the high end of that range a stretch at this point? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : So when you look at the orders that we've had and the backlog that we've built, so the orders in the first quarter up about 2%, but the backlog was up 6% year on year, 2% sequentially organically. And so although we're a little bit off what we expected, just recognize that in the first quarter, we only expected modest growth within Buildings in the first quarter. And so we came in a little bit short of that. And we were going to accelerate during the course of the year to be able to deliver on the 2% to 4% organic growth for the year. Now that being said, now that we're off to a little bit slower start than we expected, that will put pressure to get to the higher end of that organic growth range. But we're still positioned with the orders that we've been able to generate, the backlog that's in place, our ability to be able to get into that range, most likely to the low or to mid end of that range that we provided guidance to back in December. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Nigel, this is Alex. From a Buildings perspective, I probably ham-and-egg this a little bit between myself and George. I would agree with what George said. I think that what we're seeing as the backlog continues to develop, just the sheer math of it would tell you that we're probably going to be at the mid range of that or lower. So, that being offset on the positive is I think the synergies are coming a lot faster than what we expected. So I think as we move forward, I'm just glad we continue to build the backlog. Eventually that's got to flow. But what we do have is we do see the cost coming through at a better pace than what we expected. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, good morning everyone. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just to follow up on Nigel's question, can we extend that same discussion to the overall core revenue growth guidance for 2017, the 2.5% to 4.5%? I don't think I heard that explicitly reaffirmed, but maybe some color on that. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : I think it's probably a bit of a carry-on to what Alex and George said regarding Buildings. I think 2.5% to 4.5% consolidated is very doable for us at this point in time. I think Power Solutions continues to perform extremely well. And if some of the backlog starts to flow in the back half of the year on the Buildings side, I think we're very comfortable at 2.5% to 4.5% as a target we can get. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's good to hear. And then on the reference in performance contracting, the government delays, maybe you can expand on that. Is that anything unusual, is it election-related, is it a pause before potential infrastructure spending, just some context around that, please? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : So I'll take this because it needs a little bit of a historical context with Johnson Controls to understand. I think we knew this was coming because a year and a half ago, at the end of fiscal 2015 I guess that would have been, what we saw and it had to do with all the budget issues with the federal government is a significant decline in our secured sales in the federal government business. As I think you know or at least you'll again understand is that business flows really over an 18-month period. So now we're seeing the result of that federal government business that really never came back. It's a new normal of that business, which is a significant part of our performance contracting portfolio, normally secured in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and that new normal is now what's flowing through our book. So I think if you had the historical context of Johnson Controls, this is the output of the secured sales challenge that was due to the federal government that I think is a new normal, quite frankly. Who knows what the future bodes, but at least over the last year and a half, it's a new normal. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful color, thank you. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hi, Jeff. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Hey, I was wondering if you've been able to dig a little bit deeper into the whole border adjusted debate and analysis. Obviously, there's not a lot of import/export with guys driving around in trucks and the like. So I kind of get that relative to your service business. But what can you share with us on the product side, your import/export flows and any other frame of reference? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Sure. So there's border adjustment and there's a whole Mexico conversation, and they're related but not completely. And I think we'll have to wait to see how the dust settles. But if you just look \u2013 if we just take as a reference point because I think what most people are using is essentially the House blueprint as a tax policy and a border adjustment. I assume that's your reference point too, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes, exactly. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : If you think of it that way, we've modeled it, what the impact would be of, say, the 20% tax rate and a border adjustment. It's neutral to us if you look at the overall effect, because we are a net importer, mostly because of our battery business. But it's complicated because our supply chain, we take core batteries into Mexico. We manufacture batteries for the Mexico market and for the U.S. market. We bring batteries back into the U.S., and then we finish them in the U.S. And so when you look at our total cost in our value chain, it's a very complicated equation, and we really don't know the details of the tax plan. But the best we can tell when we do our own modeling, we're net neutral on this. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. And I was wondering also, we're all just sorting out, new company, new guidance, there's a lot of things moving around. Looking forward now into the back half and what you gave us, I just went back and looked at Q3 last year for both JCI and Tyco, and it was clearly the strongest organic quarter of the year for both companies, in the scope of what could be a recovering market, maybe not something to be overly concerned about. But as we try to get our models straight here, is there anything we should be thinking about as we lay that second half together off the second quarter guide that you gave us? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : I don't know that we could give you much more in the quarter-to-quarter, but I don't see anything that's unusual this year versus last year. I think what for us at legacy Johnson Controls in particular, as we saw the models that were put together for the second quarter and we knew internally that we were going to have growth, but that we understood our seasonality, and we think a lot of folks didn't really understand our seasonality on the second quarter. So for us, the second quarter that we're giving is not a surprise and the back end is also not a surprise. I just think that this is a learning process that's going on between us and a lot of the folks that are following us that don't really understand the seasonality of the battery business. The battery business is fairly predictable. There are some quarter-to-quarter lead adjustments, but overall it's fairly predictable. And I think if you look at the back half of the year with our backlog and then if you also think about it from the historical perspective, I think we feel relatively comfortable and that's why we put that slide in that showed both the synergy costs and the back-end flow of the business. George, you may have a perspective on the Tyco side. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : I would say, Jeff, that within the Tyco portfolio, I think we start to see better compares as it relates to the heavy industrial, high-hazard end markets. Recognize that within our products business those markets represent about 30% of our volume and revenue. And so I think we start to see a better compare there, the field businesses are executing well with the continued order growth and the backlog growth that we're seeing. That's going to play out here I think well as we now project the second half of the year. We typically have a seasonal decline in the second quarter, is typically the slowest quarter because of the install segment of our business and then it becomes very strong \u2013 it strengthens in the third and fourth quarter. So I don't see anything unusual except for that I believe that we're seeing an inflection within some of the key end markets that we serve. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And now one just quick one for Brian, maybe, Corporate in the quarter is clearly run rating lower than the annual guide, I have seen some of that flexes up on higher sales and the like. But how are you thinking about Corporate for the year relative to that $480 million to $500 million guide that you gave us in December? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yes, pretty consistent. I don't think \u2013 we did have some synergies that came out at $15 million reduction in the quarter related some to cost synergies that were permanent takeouts. There was some expense deferral that will probably come back and end up in the second quarter for us. So, I would necessarily go with that $108 million x4, I do think there's probably a slight build in Corporate expenses into the second quarter, so the range we gave before is pretty reasonable still. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Shannon. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hi, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Alex, you emphasized Asia in the beginning of the call. I mean, the Building Efficiency orders in Asia were down about 3%. Just wondering what your view is in the context of I guess generally staying pretty bullish on Asia? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : When I look at Asia, I guess to give you some qualitative. What I see is that the activity is strengthening in Asia. And then if you think about orders being the field part of our business and you think about revenues on the other side, which show up in our \u2013 things like our Hitachi joint venture, we're seeing a mix change too. So it's not just a projects business, which kind of shows up in our orders. But when you think about our products business, we're going to continue to see strength in things like our VRF products that we've gotten through the Hitachi joint venture. But I think overall, I would expect that we're going to continue \u2013 we will start to see orders build in Asia not \u2013 I mean, that won't be near the pace that we're seeing in Power Solutions because I think we have a unique situation there, but I do think that we're bullish on growth in Asia. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. And then maybe one along the same line there with the products North America, orders for Building Efficiency up 12%. I mean, that was probably the strongest area that we see in the company. Maybe just a little bit more color by product, and any other flavor there? Thanks. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : We've had some real strong performance here within our residential like commercial business. When you look at our product businesses here, even in the first quarter, our sales were up in those two businesses up 12% organically. Units actually up even further than that, so that's continuing. And we see that coming through strong, as we project the business going forward. We've also seen within the HVAC space some real strong performance in our applied HVAC across the globe, and building off what Alex said about Asia, a lot of that strength is coming through the work that we've done to improve our product as well as expand our channel within Asia. And so we're seeing some nice pick-up there within the HVAC. As I said we have short term, seeing the pressure with the industrial refrigeration, as it relates to the heavy industrial, high-hazard oil and gas type end markets. But the good news there is that in the quarter, we've seen some nice pick-up in order activity, as well as orders secured. And I think that's going to start to benefit us here as we project the remainder of the year. And so I think in the legacy BE portfolio with the exception of the performance contracting, with the investments that are being made, we're starting to see the pick-up within the product channels. And then within the \u2013 when you look at within the Tyco product businesses, we continue to invest in spite of some of the pressure that's coming through and the end markets that we serve and truly believe that we're at an inflection point, we'll start to see the progress here over the remainder of the year. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : I think I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about this performance contracting. It's under pressure because of some of the end markets, but one of the things that is going to be important for us as we go forward we'll talk about the branch businesses that pull through products. So, whether it's our applied businesses or our controls business, then of course, what's happening in products. The performance contracting business is a separate business unto itself and so as we compare ourselves whether we're gaining share or losing share, if you look at both the applied and the unitary products, we feel very good about investments we've made and we're seeing share gains. And so that's one of the reasons why we want to separate out because it bodes well for our future. We should see it both from the field side and get leverage at the factory. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you, good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Just to follow up on a couple of those questions, so could you first remind us of the size of the performance contracting business as well as industrial refrigeration and maybe what that 20% sales decline meant in terms of absolute dollar decline in the quarter? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : The performance contracting business is roughly $500 million on an annual basis and industrial refrigeration is probably $400 million to $500 million. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And so going forward, given the orders that picked-up at least on the industrial refrigeration side, what are you expecting the full year to be down and what do you think it's going to be net in 2017? Between those two? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. Gautam, I mean, I think it's a little bit too early to see what's going to happen here. I think what we've been doing is to try to mitigate the risk that we've seen with the softness that we've experienced, and we've been sizing the business appropriately to be able to execute on the plan. Now, that being said, with the pick-up in orders that gives us some confidence now that with the actions that are being taken that we're going to be positioned to deliver like I said on the guidance that we provided from an organic standpoint going forward. And, hopefully we'll be able to accelerate some of these orders so we can convert within the calendar year. But I think at this stage it's hard to forecast what ultimately the overall impact will be for the year. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. I guess the qualitative, I'd say the performance contracting will remain under pressure for the year. Industrial refrigeration, we've got some good order growth. And so, if we can get the conversion on that, it'd probably had less pressure on it. That's a qualitative, but I think that's the way I think about it. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And just to follow up on Jeff's question about tax reform and some of the impacts, does it have any impact on how you go about restructuring and where you go about restructuring? Does this give you any pause on the pace or maybe the nature of some of the plans you laid out at the Investor Day? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : No, I don't think it impacts us from that perspective at all. I think the only kind of pause it would give is if you making an investment in plant and equipment, you probably have a new formula, which you don't really know what that is yet. But, it really doesn't affect the plans that we have in place when you think about our synergy efforts and our productivity efforts. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): My first question would be around the EBIT margin expansion. That was around, I think, 90 bps year-on-year in the first quarter. You're guiding to only 20 bps to 30 bps of increase in the second. What's behind that sort of 70 bps deceleration in margin improvement? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : I think that really relates primarily to the fact that the Hitachi transaction occurred at the beginning of the first quarter in last fiscal year. And coming out of the box with Hitachi, as you may recall, they had lower margins. And as we look at the first quarter of this year moving into the second quarter of this year, the Hitachi piece of that is really what's driving it. Because the Hitachi margins, dollar margins and actual margins in the second quarter of last year, obviously, are more comparable to the second quarter of this year than the first quarter was. So I guess a year ago we had Hitachi, just \u2013 we just closed the transaction and we didn't really see any of the cost synergies out of that transaction until we started the second quarter. So that's really the primary driver. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. So in Power, there's nothing strange going on with lead or the cost impact of new capacity or anything in the margins? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : When we gave that 90 bps it had lead out. So the number we're using is neutralized for lead. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. And then secondly, just on the adjusted free cash. As you say, the Q1 is often an outflow for sort of legacy JCI. When we're thinking about the path to get to that $2 billion plus number for the year, when do you think we start to see positive sort of adjusted free cash? Is that really a second half issue or you think Q2, you'll start to see an improvement? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : It could be some \u2013 certainly there will be improvement in Q2. I don't know if we'll turn fully positive in Q2. It would be plus or minus $100 million probably off breakeven, but as we've seen I think historically in both companies the second half ramp-up is quite significant, and there are a couple specific things that we're looking at to drive throughout the remainder of this year. I think a lot of the things that have been done at Hitachi to-date have been very focused on cost synergies, and there's an opportunity I think at Hitachi from a trade working capital improvement standpoint, which I think could benefit the second half of the year. And then when we talk about the JCI-Tyco merger as well, I think there's an opportunity as we work through some of the integration activities that we're going to see some improved trade working capital at the combined business. So I would say those are both probably more back half of the year. And when you take that accompanied with the back-ended synergies and the related cash flow that will come off of that and then look at the legacy two businesses and how they generally had a second half cash performance, I think there's a roadmap to the $2.1 billion target we've got. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks and thanks for all the color in the slides. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning, all. I just want to make sure on the growth versus synergy element here. You guys in that $250 million to $300 million synergy target this year, none of that is linked to growth, or is some of that on the cost side, in another words, no large purchases that are volume-related that are on the cost side? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : That's all cost. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But it's not volume-linked cost? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Correct. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then secondly, I'd like to dig a little bit more on to the cash side. You've talked about the 10 points of conversion opportunity over time. You just gave us some detail about how the year normally sequences. But, George, from maybe also an operating perspective, when you think about that trade working capital, some of your competitors I know at ASHRAE and others are now maybe perhaps maintaining higher inventory levels to accommodate significant growth, at least in North America. How do you deal with that in what appears to be a pretty heavy trade working capital, capital-intensive business right now? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Let me grab that. I think most of the inventory that you see in that business probably has to do with more seasonality because a lot of that inventory is owned in the channel. So I'm not familiar with what you heard at ASHRAE, but when you look at our \u2013 if you look at Johnson Controls' working capital and our inventory, it's really more of a Power Solutions conversation than it is HVAC, which relates to the differences. And quite frankly, even though our products business is growing significantly, it's not as big a part of our business as it is probably with our peer companies. Our trade working capital, a lot of that sits in our field organization more than it sits in the channels. But when you think about channels and you think about the product stocking, I don't think that we have seen an inordinate amount of build-up I think a year ago at this time, when we were having a conversation around UPG. We were talking to the channels because we had some product changes, but I don't know that we have anything inordinate now. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : I would say, Steve, just based on the performance that we've seen here, we're turning that pretty quickly. We're producing at a double-digit rate on units. And as you've seen in the UPG channel or our business there, we're up 12% organically year on year, and we're projecting that to continue to be able to outperform the growth of the market. And so I think based on what we've seen, we're efficiently utilizing that inventory, and it's turning pretty well. Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. All right, great. And I just want to make sure on the Buildings side, it sounds like it is. Thanks. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : So just a footnote, we've seen a change in inventory that's half of our sales rate in our UPG business. So to George's point, it's turning quick, or quicker than it was. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research Group. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: On the backlog conversion, which I think is really what you're trying to say, George and Alex, on the underpinnings of the second half acceleration in the Buildings business, how do you think that's trended over the last call it 18 months? It seems like orders have steadily grinded higher in both JCI and legacy Tyco conversion, or I guess the way we've seen organic growth, it had some fits and starts. And some of that is products, which don't really make it into it, some of that is compares. But how much of the second half outlook is really just execution on what you have in the backlog already versus hoping the products business picks up some steam as maybe the channel inventories move around or you get some easier comparisons? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Let me start by giving you the fundamentals of each of the businesses. If you go back historically, the BE backlog turns anywhere from 9 to 18 months. The Tyco backlog on the installed business is 9 to 12 months. And recognize that every project is unique in how we ultimately go to market and execute on these projects. Now if you look at the total Buildings business, about 70% of the business is driven by the field orders. And so when you go back historically and do an average based on that backlog and the type of projects that are in the backlog and then project what's going to happen here over the next 9 months, we feel very comfortable with where we are and how those projects are going to convert, that we get into what we ultimately guided towards, which is the 2% to 4% for the total Buildings business because this is a significant piece of that within 2017. And so at this stage, I think it's all about execution. We're going to see some continued orders come in that are quicker turn to supplement that backlog. But it's fairly predictable at this stage where we are through the year and ultimately what we expect here over the next three quarters. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So it sounds like \u2013 not to put words in your mouth, George, but yes, the products business either accelerates or doesn't. And you're talking about maybe 0.5 point of variance, not a point or even multiple points, just given the relative sizing. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Correct. On a flow basis on the products side, as you know, we're continuing to expand our channels across both sets of businesses. That's helping us being able to accelerate the product growth. And that combined with the product that we support our internal channel with sets us up here fairly nicely for the next three quarters and continuing to accelerate the overall growth that we're going to achieve and deliver on the guidance that we provided. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Think of it as one piece of color on that legacy BE business. I think when we look at it internally, the law of large numbers. When we go into a fiscal year because of the turn rate, and you can do this math yourself, we're about 40% confident. About 40% of what we're going to get in a year is already in our backlog. Obviously, as the year goes on, that percentage goes up. So with 40% at the beginning of the year, you can kind of do your math. And so you can see as we go later in the year, as George was saying, we gain more and more confidence or not because it's either in the backlog or it's not. And so hopefully that makes sense but that kind of the 40% number walking into the year is from legacy BE when you look at our flow rates is how the math works. Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got it. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Alex, any other final comments before we end the call? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yes, I'd just like to finish the call and once again just thank our employees. The amount of change is incredible and I think we've moved past talking about Adient and the spin. I'm just proud of what we accomplished there but as we run these two companies together, it's \u2013 what I feel good about is the momentum that we're gaining around that something, George putting in place around organizational structure while getting the Buildings business organized and as it gets organized, we're going to be able to not only see cost synergies but be able to fulfill the promise of the merger. And so I want to thank our employees for a great quarter and we're confident about the year, I hope that comes true in this call, it just a lot of work for us to do. But I'm confident we've got the right team doing it. So thanks a lot, have a great day. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Alex. And thanks, everyone, for joining. Operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc Analysts : Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Welcome to Johnson Controls' Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' second quarter 2017 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli; President and Chief Operating Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you view today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins, exclude transaction, integration, and separation costs, as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. All comparisons to the prior year are on a combined basis, which excludes the results of Adient, and includes the results of Tyco net of conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting. Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Sales of $7.2 billion in the quarter, increased 3% year-over-year on a reported basis, excluding the net impact of FX, M&A and lead pass-through pricing, sales grew 2% organically. GAAP loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls' ordinary shareholders was $0.16 and included net charges of $0.66 related to special items. These special items were primarily composed of a non-cash tax charge related to the announced divestiture of the Scott Safety business, transaction, integration and separation costs as well as restructuring and impairment charges. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.50 per share compared to $0.45 in the prior year quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to Alex. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Antonella. Good morning, everyone. So, if we start on slide 5, I'd like to talk about the overview of the results and some of the commitments we've made over the past few months, both at our Annual Meeting, our Investing Meeting and then also at our Analyst Call. So, we had strong quarter earnings at 11% year-over-year growth and is at the top end range that we provided you at $0.48 to $0.50. And a lot of that came from our continued focus on our productivity and the integration efforts. If you go back and look at the commitments that we made as an organization, I think that we couldn't be more proud of our employees and it both came from productivity driven through our Johnson Controls operating systems initiatives along with the merger synergies. And in fact, we've seen around a $70 million benefit for the quarter, which is accelerating, so we're very pleased with what we're seeing and I just want to thank our employees. It would be very easy for our employees with all that's going on to not stay focused on the task and we've been able to generate the synergies and the cost savings which will bode well for the future. It leads me to the organic growth, particularly within buildings. We're starting to see the acceleration of our organic growth, particularly in our field businesses and once again that's where we're doing most of our integration efforts, so that's a strong signal to us that we're going to continue to see growth throughout the rest of the year and gives us confidence. I'd really like to also point out and George will go through this in a little more detail, we had really strong strength in our HVAC businesses, particularly our light commercial and residential businesses. We outpaced the market and most of that has to do with launches of new products and the investments that we've seen over the past few years. And we're seeing some stabilization within the legacy Tyco fire protection products businesses and that bodes well for the future also. The other thing that happened within the quarter is some of our strategic portfolio actions. Specifically, we closed the sale of ADT South Africa and we announced the divestiture of Scott Safety to 3M. Both of these are very important as it relates to those businesses within the legacy Tyco organization being able to sell those assets is important as it relates to the TSarl debt which as you recall was a $4 billion debt that was put in place to facilitate the transaction between Johnson Controls and Tyco, and accelerating that repayment of debt is going to be good for us moving forward. Related to that, is the share repurchase program of $500 million which is an increase from the previously announced $200 million to $250 million share repurchase program, that's already in place. So, that takes us up to $750 million for the fiscal year. So, the Scott Safety transaction will not be dilutive. If you go to page 6, I'll go a high overview of the numbers before I turn it over to George. If you look at our net sales of 3% reported and organic of 2%, buildings was up 3%. I talked earlier about driven mostly by our field organization and power is off 1%. And that was mostly a seasonal view, particularly because of some of the weather and restocking along with strong orders that we received a year ago, in China, when we first opened our new plant. And from a results standpoint, if you look at the impact of lead, it's pretty important because if you pull out lead, which was up significantly for the quarter, we had a 7% increase excluding both foreign exchange and lead, and there was a significant impact to our bottom line, I mean, to our top line and also impacted our margin. So if you adjust for that, we had a 7% increase in earnings driven by real strong performance in our Power Solutions business. And that leads us to the 60 basis points improvements in overall margins. The integration of our Buildings business as it accelerates and we get more and more confidence, we're going to see the bottom line continue to improve. And now that we're starting to see the organic growth within our Buildings business, gives us an awful lot of confidence to tighten our guidance for the year, which Brian will talk about, which is the 13% to 16% range, later in the presentation. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to George, he'll talk about the merger activities and also some more specifics around the business performance. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into a detailed review of the businesses, let me start with a quick integration update on slide 7. Over the last few months, the Buildings organization has gone through an impressive amount of change, and we've made a considerable amount of progress towards aligning the new leadership structure in the most optimal way possible with a focus on accountability for growth. We now have the management teams of our operational structure substantially in place and we'll now focus on building out the team structure over the next several months. Another area we've discussed with you is the need to substantially pay down the merger-related TSarl debt. As Alex referred to earlier with the announced divestiture of Scott Safety and sale of ADT South Africa, we will be able to make a considerable reduction to the $4 billion of debt. This will enable us to move more quickly on some of the heavier lifting restructuring and synergy actions. I wanted to take a minute to thank the team and the thousands of employees of both Scott Safety and ADT South Africa. I have had the pleasure of being involved with both of these businesses for over a decade, including my tenure as President of the Tyco Global product segment. It's never easy to part with such great leaders and colleagues, but I am confident they are in good hands and that both businesses will continue to be successful in the future. Before I get into the progress we've made on the cost side, I thought I'd highlight a couple of key cross-selling wins in the second quarter. We had a major win in the New England region to supply an array of building solutions in a new distribution hub being built by one of our large airfreight delivery customers. In this situation, our legacy SimplexGrinnell sales team leveraged their strong relationships in the region to provide a lead to a legacy Johnson Controls team. Working together, the two teams were able to secure contracts for the fire alarm system as well as the HVAC and building control system. In the institutional space, a legacy Johnson Controls Account team in coordination with the sales teams across SimplexGrinnell and Tyco Integrated Security submitted a joint bid for a fully integrated solution multi-phase expansion project at a major university in Texas. As a result, we were awarded the contract for the first phase providing our Metasys building automation system, York air handling units, Simplex fire alarm system, as well as access control and video surveillance. Not only is this phase a great win, we're well positioned for the next phases of the project. Both wins are great examples of how our teams are coming together to collaborate and provide integrated solutions that solve more complex customer problems. Turning now, to the cost synergy side. We continue to run ahead of plan in Q2, delivering roughly $70 million or above $0.06 in year-over-year savings. This is roughly $20 million in incremental savings over last quarter and is slightly ahead of our internal targets. Given the progress we've made year-to-date we now expect to achieve synergy and productivity savings at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range I provided to you in December. With roughly $0.11 achieved through the first half, we now expect $0.07 in the third quarter and $0.09 in the fourth quarter totaling around $0.27 in savings for the full year. As I mentioned last quarter, the integration of two large organizations requires a lot of heavy lifting, commitment and leadership. Not all decisions are easy, but we have a strong team, leading the process, ensuring we execute on decisions made and we move forward to the next step. Both the integration team and the businesses continue to be guided around four main objectives; grow, integrate, change and operate. We're making great progress and I couldn't be more proud of how the teams have come together and what they have accomplished over these past eight months as a combined company. I look forward to keeping you updated on our continued success. Let's turn now to a review of the businesses starting with Building Technologies and Solutions on slide 8. On a reported basis, Building sales grew 1% over the prior year to $5.5 billion in the quarter, as 3% organic growth was partially offset by the impact of FX and net M&A activity. The 3% organic growth was led by solid growth in our field businesses. When you look at the Field side of the business, which represents about 65% to 70% of total Building sales, organic growth was up 4%, with underlying growth across most regions, led by strong growth of over 3% in North America. When we look at the pieces within our Field business, we saw another strong quarter of organic growth in our applied HVAC business, which continued to grow in the mid-single digit range. Fire and Security, the legacy Tyco Installation and Service businesses grew in the low single-digit range led by mid-single digit growth in North America. Some of the areas within our Field businesses have put pressure on our organic growth rate in the first quarter, stabilized in the second quarter including both performance contracting and industrial refrigeration. Looking now at our Products business, which represents remaining 30% to 35% of Buildings. Sales declined just under 1% organically year-over-year, a sequential improvement from the 3% decline we saw last quarter. We continue to see very strong growth in our residential and light commercial HVAC business, which grew at a high-teens rate organically, benefiting by a significant amount of new product launches, something we expect will continue into 2018. The strength in U.S. residential and light commercial HVAC was more than offset by a mid-single digit decline in our Hitachi business, simply related to the timing of shipments, which we will see come through in the third quarter. Additionally, our Fire and Security product businesses are stabilizing. The mid-single digit, year-over-year decline we saw in the first quarter has moderated to a 1% organic decline in the second quarter. On a sequential basis, Fire and Security product sales are growing. We've seen encouraging signs that the short cycle industrial markets have bottomed and we would anticipate some inflection across the businesses in the second half. Buildings' EBITA declined 1% year-over-year to $628 million. The segment margin decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 11.3% as strong synergy and productivity savings were more than offset by planned incremental product and channel investments as well as mix during the quarter. Turning to orders and backlog on slide 9. Total Buildings orders increased 2% year-over-year organically, driven by a 3% increase in Field orders, partially offset by a 1% decline in our quick-turn product orders, which as I mentioned earlier was already felt within our product sales growth in the quarter, given the book and ship nature of that business. In terms of order activity we saw continued momentum in the U.S. market with stable growth in non-residential construction verticals year-over-year. We had a strong quarter of order activity with solid growth in our commercial and institutional verticals. As we have discussed before order growth in our Field business is lumpy, and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. The legacy Tyco business included a very large order in the prior year, which impacted the year-over-year comparison in Tyco orders by 3 percentage points. Backlog of $8.3 billion increased 6% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A. In summary, we continue to make significant strides in improving the fundamentals of the business. We are streamlining the organization, investing in our product and service innovation and driving commercial excellence. As a result of these initiatives, coupled with our order pipeline and backlog, we are well-positioned for increased growth in the second half of this fiscal year as well as strong margin expansion. Turning to Power Solutions on slide 10. Sales increased 7% year-over-year on a reported basis to $1.7 billion driven by the impact of lead pass-through, which benefited powers top line by roughly 8 percentage points. Organic sales were down 1%, driven by warmer weather in both North America and China, which negatively impacted aftermarket demand. In addition, we had a tough prior year comparison in China associated with the timing of the initial volume build in our Chongqing plant. Overall, total global unit shipments decreased 3% year-over-year driven by aftermarket shipments, which declined 3%. Global start-stop shipments continued to expand with a 36% increase year-over-year, including another quarter of significant growth in China and the Americas. Power Solutions segment EBITA of $303 million, increased 7% on a reported basis or 12% excluding foreign currency. Power's margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis including a 220 basis point headwind from the impact of higher lead costs. Underlying margins excluding the impact of lead, increased 230 basis points year-over-year, driven by productivity benefits as well as favorable product mix, primarily related to higher Start-Stop battery shipments. Now let me turn the call over to Brian to walk through corporate and the consolidated financial details of the quarter as well as our outlook for third quarter and remainder of the year. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, George and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 11. As you know, beginning in the first quarter, we're now reporting corporate as a standalone segment and for the second quarter corporate expense was $2 million lower than last year and as expected I think, we talked during the first quarter call that there was going to be a sequentially higher Q2 corporate costs than Q1 and that really related primarily to some indirect tax items and some IT related costs. Having said that, for the full year we now expect corporate expenses will likely fall at the lower end of our $480 million to $500 million range that we provided at the Analyst Day. Moving on to slide 12. As you saw in our release and as Antonella mentioned our Q2 results do include a number of large items again this quarter that we're treating as special non-GAAP adjustments. And, I'd just like to touch on those for a second. The first item relates to our ongoing transaction and separation costs that was roughly $138 million. We had some restructuring and impairment charges in the quarter of $99 million about two-thirds of that related to severance, and we had some mark-to-market pension and some non-recurring purchase accounting adjustments that aggregated $35 million. And then, the large item in the quarter was about a $457 million, non-cash tax charge related to the announced divestiture of Scott Safety. And I would just give you a reminder here that, that is a non-cash book charge and the actual cash tax charge when that transaction closes, later in 2017, we still believe that will be in the range of $50 million. I'll exclude those items as I go through my comments, but those items aggregated $0.66 a share for the quarter. So, turning to the highlights on slide 12, overall, second quarter sales were up 3% to $7.2 billion. And if you exclude the impact of FX lead and M&A, organic sales were up 2% versus last year and as George mentioned backlog year-over-year is up 6%, which bodes well for some momentum going into the second half here. If you look at gross margin of 31%, it was down 40 basis points for the year that was primarily, or for the quarter, that was primarily driven by higher lead prices and some unfavorable Buildings mix that George referenced, and that was offset by leverage on higher volumes, as well as some JCOS productivity savings we saw come through in Q2. SG&A levels were comparable to the prior year, up about 1%. This product, channel, and sales force investments were substantially offset by cost synergies. Equity income of $53 million, was 33% higher than a year ago and that was primarily due to strong performance in our Hitachi and Power Solutions nonconsolidated JVs. For the quarter EBIT was up 5% with the overall EBIT margins up to 9.8% which is 20 basis points positive versus 2016, which is in line with our expectations and if you will exclude foreign exchange and lead, these margins were up 60 basis points year-over-year. Turing to slide 13, net financing charges of $116 million in the quarter were slightly higher than last year, due to higher debt levels and as I think most of you know we did in the latter part of the second quarter issue $500 million worth of U.S. notes and $1 billion of Euro notes in connection with some of the other funding needs we have for the rest of the year. Excluding special items, our effective tax rate of 15% continues to compare favorably to our prior year rate of 17% and we did see a drop in income from \u2013 attributable to non-controlling interest, down about $11 million compared to last year and that really just relates to the timing of the Hitachi entities as well as some underlying tax rates in those entities. So overall, we had a solid second quarter, which was at the high end of our guidance at $0.50 which was up 11% versus the $0.45 a year ago. Turning to slide 14, just a quick Q2 EPS waterfall relative to last year, you can see we had a $0.06 benefit related to cost synergies and productivity savings in the quarter, which was slightly better than the $0.05 expectation we had on our call at the end of the first quarter, also we saw the benefit of reduced intangible asset amortization associated with the sale of the Scott Safety business and treating that now as an asset held for sale. And there was a $0.01 benefit related to our tax rate. Offsetting these items, were incremental product and channel investments in our businesses of $0.02 and a $0.01 impact of foreign currency. Turning to slide 15, on free cash flow as we did at the end of the first quarter, because of the significance of the one-off items that we have and the choppiness in free cash flow during fiscal 2017, we wanted to provide a reconciliation for you of the reported cash flow to adjusted cash flow and you can see this quarter, we had about $100 million of tax payments and $100 million of our ongoing integration and transaction costs. Our second quarter adjusted free cash flow was a solid $300 million and we continue to target adjusted free cash flow conversion of around 80% for the year. Moving to our balance sheet on slide 16, we saw a net debt to capital ratio pretty consistent at around 40%. And as I mentioned earlier during the quarter we did issue about $1.6 billion of fixed rate long-term debt, $500 million in the U.S. at a rate of 4.5%, and \u20ac1 billion at 1%. These proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt, which is primarily commercial paper, and the proceeds will also be used for general corporate purposes. The financing costs in the second half of the year will be higher than our first half, given the increased debt levels as well as the generally higher interest rate environment as we move into the second half. In the second quarter, as Alex mentioned, we also increased the original share repurchase program that we had of $200 million to $250 million by $500 million bringing the total for fiscal 2017 up to around $750 million. Turning to slide 17, just touching on a couple of things here, noteworthy, as it relates to divestitures. We've talked already about the Scott Safety sale to 3M and I've got a specific slide that I'll go through some of the specifics on that and additionally we completed the sale of ADT South Africa for about $130 million. Second in line with our expectations, we'll continue to have certain special items in the second half of the year along the lines of those listed on the slide. And then the final thing, I wanted to point out is, we talked about on the first quarter call, the reorganization that was taking place at our buildings business, which will result in a new segment reporting structure for the company and given some of the complexities associated with the IT requirements to get really the underlying plumbing, if you will, in place to report in our new segments. We will now be doing that in the fourth quarter and at the same time we announce our year-end earnings, we will provide the quarterly results on the new reportable segment basis for fiscal 2017. So you've got that information for comparability as you move into fiscal 2018. So let's talk a little bit on slide 18 about the Scott Safety divestiture; $2 billion purchase price, I think as you know is based on a 13 times trailing EBITDA multiple and we still believe the net proceeds will be in the $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion range. If you take that plus the $130 million of proceeds from the ADT South Africa sale plus the cash flow that we expect from the Tyco business in fiscal 2017, we will have paid down the $4 billion of TSarl-related debt at probably the $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion level. So, we're going to end up after we get the proceeds from the Scott sale. So, by the end of calendar 2017 say, we are going to probably be down to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in TSarl debt outstanding. So, real positive development there. As it relates to the loss of the Scott EBIT, which is $0.07 dilutive that is going to be more than offset by the interest savings and the pay down of the TSarl debt, as well as the share repurchases that we've talked about. Moving to slide 19, we've got a waterfall again here of EPS guidance for Q3. And just as a reminder, and we've talked about this before, but we're really now entering the second half of this year, which is our seasonally higher earnings period and I guess think in terms of probably 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. Our guidance for Q3 is $0.70 to $0.73, which represents a 15% to 20% improvement year-over-year, and again that excludes some of the special items that we talked about previously. As far as comparative to fiscal 2016 Q3, you can see in the waterfall that our growth will be driven by $0.07 of cost and productivity savings, volume and mix will deliver $0.03, and the lower tax rate will deliver $0.02 year-on-year. And then, the headwinds that we have going into Q3 would be the continued investments that we make in our business for us $0.01 and we also have FX that's a bit of a headwind for us estimated at $0.01 as well. So moving to slide 20, full year guidance, a couple highlights before we talk about full year guidance. We are taking our organic growth for the full year down from 2.5% to 4.5%, which is our original guidance. We're now taking that to approximately 3%. Having said that, we still are going to reconfirm our margins at 80 basis points to 110 basis points. And then, the other thing I would just comment on is, as we talk through the amortization benefit we're getting for the held for sale accounting for the Scott business that is essentially being offset by an increase in net financing costs for the quarter. So those two kind of neutralize each other. So with all of that, we've tightened the range for our full year EPS guidance from $2.60 to $2.75 down to $2.60 to $2.68, and that still represents a 13% to 16% increase year-over-year. So with that, Antonella, we can it open up for questions. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator, if you could please open-up the line for questions? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session in today's conference. Our first question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: So, just on the second half walk at Buildings, clearly we need fairly substantial margin improvement, certainly north of a 100 basis points at Lux. Can you talk about some of the drivers, I mean, obviously there is volume leverage, you have lower investment sequentially in Q3. But, maybe comment on the profile of the backlog you've been booking, is that actually accretive to the mix or to the margins that you're currently showing? And maybe talk a little bit about some of these projects that you've been booking and whether those are coming in at above segment average margin or any color you can give on why we should have confidence in the second half margin ramp at Buildings? Thanks. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : So, I'm going to turn this over to George cause he's into the details, but I just give you a sense for the back half of the year, particularly with legacy Johnson Controls. What I would tell you is that, the leverage on the volume is going to be the biggest single thing, but you also have to remember particularly in legacy Johnson Controls, the HVAC business itself is the service business is high margin and the volumes there are much different than they are in the winter season. So, you're going to get two things that are going to be incremental. George could talk about the backlog, I don't think there is anything significantly different about the backlog but there is going to be a lot more volume running through there. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, Gautam. I think to understand the third and fourth quarter, I think we need to drill into the second quarter and then I'll walk you to what you can expect here in the third and fourth quarter. So in the second quarter, the guidance we provided was for a modest increase in the margin rate in the second quarter. And so what happened was, when you look at the margin that came through we're getting tremendous productivity in costs savings as it relates with the synergies, that's coming through, that's 50 basis points. The investments that we're making both 30 basis points and when you drill into that, I would tell you across the board we're getting great traction with those investments. Whether it be in the applied space with our chiller investments, whether it be in the DX space with the work that we're doing in resi and in small commercial, in the control space with our launch of Metasys 8.1 and there's the Verasys platform. And then across the Fire and Security businesses with the new investments we're making where in spite of the pressure that we've had with the heavy industrial, high-hazard we continue to make great progress there. The second piece is that we had a project, a very large project that we took a significant charge here in the second quarter that has impacted our margin rate by about 20 basis points. And then the last, I think, is most important as we project third and fourth quarter, is the unfavorable mix, which is about 30 basis points. And when you think of that mix, our growth, the 3% growth that we achieved in the second quarter was driven by install. And as you know the install revenues come through at a lower margin. And that, at the same time, when our product business was down about 1%. So as you project going forward and that was roughly 30 basis points which drove the 30 basis point decline in total. So as you project the third quarter and fourth quarter, we have inflection in our products, we see continued momentum in the legacy BE product businesses. We start to see, we \u2013 sequentially we are seeing growth in the Fire and Security product businesses and they'll continue to accelerate in the third quarter and fourth quarter and so that is good mix coming through. And then as the Alex talked about, seasonally we start to get our pickup in service revenues in the third quarter and fourth quarter which is good mix. And then with the, just the nature of the business being higher volume in the third quarter and fourth quarter, we get nice leverage on that volume. And so as we look at now third quarter and fourth quarter, we're positioned to deliver about a 90-basis point improvement in margin rate. And that ultimately supports the overall margin rate that we projected for the company for the year. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Understand one more thing that, that... Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: And that 90 basis points that...sorry, go ahead. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : So I was just going to add one more thing that the Hitachi sales were down for the quarter. We have line of sight to some orders that are seasonal that last year, we saw in one quarter and now we're going to see in the third quarter. So I also think that we have some pretty good confidence around the Hitachi business also. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So I just want to kind of pick up where Gautam left off. So, as we go into second half year, I think you've threaded the bridge quite nicely, the down 30 basis points. So it looks like synergies will be picking up to maybe 60 basis points, 70 basis points, maybe 80 basis points in 3Q and 4Q. Hopefully, no more charges. So that goes away. Is there enough growth in products to get us to a positive mix in the second half of the year? And then on Alex's comments about Hitachi picking up in 3Q, my understanding is that Hitachi is a lower margin business. So why does that help margin? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, Nigel, let me start with Hitachi. So starting there we do see from a second quarter to third quarter last year, we had a timing of shipments that ultimately now this year has pushed to the third quarter. That's going to give us a nice lift within the legacy BE product portfolio. When you look at products in total, just pure volumes, and that starts with the \u2013 the demand that we see in the \u2013 in the order rates that we're seeing across our \u2013 across all of our product businesses accelerate in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And as I've been \u2013 we've been talking about in the legacy Tyco product businesses, we've seen sequential improvement continuing every quarter. And although, we have been \u2013 we went from mid \u2013 down mid-single digits in the first quarter, down low single digits in the second quarter, we're going to inflect here in the third quarter and fourth quarter. We're seeing continued acceleration with the end markets recovering that we support. So, that gives us a lot of confidence with that mix coming through, as well as service. When you look at the \u2013 the service business across both sets of businesses coming together. Think about it this way. We've got a tremendous field organization, that now has come together, that have a combination of customers that they are serving and now we can take our combined capabilities to be able to do a lot more for the customers that we serve. And we're already seeing some of that traction come through. And so, we are very confident that we're going to see an uplift there with that mix in the third quarter and fourth quarter, typically, it's a seasonal high for us. But above and beyond that, we believe that with some of the revenue synergies that we see, we're going to be able to capitalize that in the second half. And that again would be very positive mix to the overall portfolio. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Thanks, George. And a quick follow on, on the product side, down one (39:00) you saw in 2Q. How did that look ex-Scott Safety? Was it \u2013 was Scott accretive to that number? And then, is there anything non-cyclical going on in terms of retail or in terms of residential where there might be some market share loss, so some (39:16) structural pressures in those markets? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : No, Nigel. As we look at all of our product businesses, we've been performing and continuing to maintain and grow share across all of the segments. So there is no concern there as far as losing share. When you look at the type of product businesses, there was similar type pressure within the Scott Safety as it relates to the heavy industrial, high-hazard business. Recall that we had bought the IST Business, which gave us a bigger portfolio, bigger footprint into that end market, that has been somewhat pressured here short-term. But again, we're beginning to see a very nice pipeline of orders or activity in orders coming through, and that will also inflect here in the second half of the year. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : And Nigel, the only other thing I would point out is, remember our \u2013 the legacy Tyco retail business actually sits in the field, and that is continuing to perform well. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : And Nigel, this is Alex. I thought I would use it \u2013 since you ask about share, we talked about growth in products because one of the things that's, may not be clear, as we looked at how we put out our numbers, and as we pull together the organization \u2013 and I mentioned it, but I just wanted to put a little finer point on it. Our Light Commercial and Residential businesses are performing extremely well and outperforming the market, and as I look at what's happening with our peers, and we're just \u2013 I'm really proud of what the team is doing, and we're seeing the same thing in our Applied business. So, our HVAC businesses are really doing well, and then I think then as the volumes increase seasonally, that's going to drop to the bottom-line. So I just wanted to make sure that didn't get lost because of how we're reporting the numbers here. Operator : Speakers, our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon. Hey, just a couple of things, lot of talk about comparisons as we work through all the moving pieces. I get the seasonal lift H1 to H2, it does seem that the comparisons of legacy Tyco especially but even JCI BE organically are a bit harder as we move into the back as particularly the June quarter. This is as you look at kind of the backlog conversion, just kind of wondering your confidence level really in that 3% organic growth number, for the June quarter and maybe you can give us some color on how that splits between BE and Power? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : As far as the growth or the... Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : The organic growth. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Organic growth. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : So, Jeff, just to go through each of the segments, so when you look at Buildings and what we're seeing not only in the \u2013 we're building a very strong pipeline. We're beginning to convert at a higher rate that pipeline and that's positioned us to continue to accelerate the revenue that we achieve. Now remember there was a large shipment last year in Hitachi that moved from second quarter to this year's third quarter, that's going to be a significant contributor to the pickup in organic growth this year. And then with what we see coming through based on what's been booked, we see continuing at or above the rate that we're currently at in the third quarter and being able to continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter on that conversion that gets us to roughly, it's roughly 2.5% for the \u2013 roughly, kind of mid \u2013 2.5% to 3% for the year within the segment. So, we're feeling very good about our ability to be able to execute on that. In the Power business it really depends on how the lead fluctuates and how it's reported. But at the end of the day, we're right now seeing a roughly mid-single-digits in the third quarter. We typically have our seasonal high in the fourth quarter and based on what we see today, that's going to be very strong in the fourth quarter. So as we look at the total year, we're still in the 4% to 6% range for the organic growth in Power. So overall we feel very good about the activity that we see, how we're converting the market activity and ultimately the position that we're in to be able to deliver on the second half. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. Just on Power, for a lot of you, it might be your first cycle through Power. So, you may not have lived through this, but a lot of the seasonality is something that happens, it's not something to worry about, what you worry about is if we lost any share, and we haven't lost any share, in fact we've gained share and then when you think about the growth in the emerging products around AGM that's really going to bode well for the future. So I think our confidence level is high. We can't control sometimes the quarter to quarter seasonality, but I think the team there, when we talk to them, they feel pretty good about the rest of the year. As it relates to Buildings, I mean I think George hit it right. I feel good about the progress we're making and I think that the fact that we're starting to see the orders come through certainly within the field and then just going to come through in the products, I think we'll start seeing the leverage. And I think that shows up and it's tightening the range. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : I would just add this, Jeff, to summarize what George said, I mean, when we look at Q3, we've really got Buildings around 3% as it relates to organic sales growth and I think Power Solutions is probably in the 4.5% to 5% range and when you put those together, we're in that approximate 3% organic growth for Q3 and based upon what our teams have told us and us looking at opportunities, we think that's very doable at that 3% level for Q3, so. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great, thanks for all that color. Then separately, on just TSarl obviously you have stepped up now and done some share repurchase, but given that you've knocked that down so hard, is your urgency on further reduction somewhat diminished, and can we see maybe a stronger pivot to share repurchase in say 2018 whereas at least I was thinking maybe it was a 2019 story on share repurchase? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. That's still something we're going to have to look at, Jeff. I mean, technically, the answer is until that entire $4 billion is paid off, you have to have pretty robust procedures and controls in place to ring-fence that debt. There may be a practical level at which time you look at it and say if it's down at a certain level, you don't necessarily need to be as strict with the rules. But I would tell you that if we get that down to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion at the end of next year, we've always kind of looked at 2018 as being further pay down. And once that gets down to less than $1 billion, I think we probably have a little bit more flexibility relative to share repurchase. But I would just tell you that's something we haven't fully analyzed yet. But the good news is, the pay down of the debt is coming at a much faster rate than we had anticipated quite honestly six months ago. Operator : Speakers, our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, I would like to get a little more color on this Texas University integrated win because this is really part of that whole holy grail of integrated building services that you're working towards. So the idea of like, were these separate bids or bundled bids? How many points of contact did you have during this process from the customer side and what do you do with regarding any product subsidies, one business subsidizing the other in this process and how do you referee those? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. So, we're going through a major integration of our field force in North America, and certainly, we're going to be positioned as a leader across all of our domains. And what's been nice is, while we're going through that process, the teams are working within their current structures in how they're continuing to serve customers. And while we're integrating all of our systems and processes, have found ways to be able to leverage the customer base that we serve today. And then, as new opportunities are coming up, we're getting kind of first look on those opportunities with the other domains that we are not serving those customers with. And that is simple as that. That's what this was. We have a strong relationship in one of the businesses, working with this customer, and then have gone forward to say, this would \u2013 this is what our total capabilities are and what we can ultimately do. It came through one bid opportunity that we put all of our capabilities together. And because of that, we can maintain our fundamentals, while we're getting the additional growth by putting all of our capabilities together. So, we're seeing this, a lot of this activity, across our entire field, and that's what's building a pretty robust pipeline of opportunities that we're beginning to covert. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hey, Deane. What I would say is that this is going better than we thought. And, just to put it in simple terms, you talked about one project because we highlighted it. But there are, we're tracking these things, all the way here because it's an important part of why we did this, and things are happening quicker than we thought. And then George is a little bit modest because we've adopted an organizational change particularly in North America where we're bringing people together. And so, a lot of the \u2013 kind of the underlying question about, how hard is this to work together, a lot of those barriers are already broken down. So, I am really bullish on this. And in fact, it was a big strategic question a year ago, would we get the pull through and the cross selling that we expected and I tell you it's going to be better than we thought. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the Scott Safety divestiture. Just give us a sense are there more non-core divestitures that you're looking at? I mean, when I look back at the South Africa decision that makes complete sense you did this several years ago with exiting South Korea, those are special situations you really can't leverage the brand, it's a different set of security laws. But within the portfolio are there more divestitures that you're looking at? Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Well, Deane, we certainly are going to tell you everything that we're doing. But I would just say that we're looking across our portfolio as our strategy gets tighter and tighter around being a leader in Buildings and Energy, it helps us understand, what are some of the opportunities there. Because what we want to make sure is we invest in the businesses that makes sense for us. When you think about the Scott Safety business, what a great business that is. It's a fantastic business. But you know, it's probably not at the right place when you think about where we want to invest going forward. So I guess, the short answer is we're continuing to look, I think that what we've done so far is right on point. And I know that legacy Tyco folks will open up their portfolio, certainly at Johnson Controls we're doing the same thing. Now, we have a different framework, because we're a combined company and we certainly are taking a relook at some things that maybe, we haven't thought about in a while. So just kind of leave it with that unless you have something to add, George. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Hi, good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Good morning. So, you gave some good detail on the improving mix from here in Buildings. So I guess if we look at Power Solutions, you had double-digit underlying profit growth again year-on-year, same rate as in Q1. So obviously mix is a good tailwind there in the first half. Maybe clarify, how confident you are that those mix tailwinds can persist in the second half? And I just wondered related to that, if there is any kind of guidance now for the year on the ex-lead margin in that business? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. So Julian, what I would say in Power Solutions, we've done a really nice job driving productivity, continued productivity, as well as we're benefiting from the mix, the higher mix of the AGM. And so that has enabled us to offset the 220 basis points of headwind that we had on lead and being able to offset that for the quarter and deliver a margin rates that were up 10 basis points. As you project the year, we're going to see continued mix there with continuing increase in AGM shipments and that'll continue with all of the capacity we put into place and over the next few years that will continue. And we're still getting very strong productivity. So overall, for the year, when we project the margins, I think it's \u2013 we're going to be modestly down for the year. But overall, that's really a factor of the lead pricing. Brian, I don't know, if you want to comment? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. Julian, I think, it really is a function, with the lead prices where they are now, there will be pressure on reported margins. But if you look at our margins ex-lead, we should see positive improvement year-over-year there. So with the volatility in lead, you really need to look at those margins, as you know, ex-lead and those should be up year-over-year. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : So Julian, the last thing I'd just add to this, if you look at it on a long-term basis, there's two things that are going to end up happening, underlying. First is, our AGM mix will continue to add as a positive to our margins and then we're going to continue to launch capacity particularly in China and as we go through the launch of some of these China plants, it will be a little bit lumpy as that happens. So those are the two things, I mean there's obviously lots of other things as it relates to timing, but if you think about our business moving forward, overall margins will improve, but as we add capacity there will be some lumps in this as we go. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities : Thanks. And then just my second question would be, maybe more for Brian. You gave a little bit of color on the sort of aggregate part of the gross debt, at the end of this year, the calendar year. Maybe, when we think about other factors like cash restructuring charges and the moving parts around cash taxes, is there any update you could provide on the net debt or net leverage level you expect 12 months from now at the company? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Well, I think the leverage that we've talked about historically has been 2% to 2.5% and I think with the choppy cash flow we've had in 2017, you really need to look to 2018 to see what type of balance sheet flexibility we're going to have. But, I think once we get out of this year, as I mentioned, we still target 80% free cash flow conversion, but that's on an adjusted basis, right. So we're going to need to get into fiscal 2018, kind of get our feet underneath us a little bit relative to a year that's a bit more normal. And, I think with the cash flow in fiscal 2018, we're going to be in a position where we can further pay down debt and improve our leverage position. Now, the one thing, I'd point out as we look at fiscal 2018 and 2019, the term debt payments that we have coming due are pretty nominal. It's really into 2020 before we start seeing any term debt repayments of any significance. So, we've got a lot of flexibility as we look at 2018 and 2019 and our cash flow gets to a more normalized position. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Next question comes for Steve Tusa from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for slipping me in here. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You guys called out $0.01 of amortization in the second quarter bridge, where is that in the third quarter bridge? Because, I still think you got a, it's probably a benefit year-over-year \u2013 bit of a benefit year-over-year still? Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yep. It fully offsets with the net financing charges in the third quarter that's why you don't see it on the bridge. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So, it's not a discrete item like it was called out in this quarter. And then just building efficiency. So, you guys talked about I think 50 basis points of productivity but for the year or for the total Co. you had, the productivity was higher than that. Was there \u2013 what kind of \u2013 can you just like maybe explain precisely a little bit more around what kind of offset that or is there just a little bit more around, I guess the mix headwinds you had in the quarter? More specifically what types of \u2013 what part of the business that was in? Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : So, Steve, you're referring more to in Buildings, the mix headwinds that we were talking about? Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. I guess, I'm just trying to figure out why productivity didn't read through more in building efficiency. Is it, is there greater productivity somewhere else maybe at corporate or in the battery business maybe? I would have thought the productivity would have been higher there. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yep. So, when you look at the productivity and you look and you see where that sixth sense of synergies and productivity is, you have a piece going through Buildings that George had referenced early of about $30 million and then the rest of it remember you have some through Power because they're having productivity as well because it's synergies and productivity and you also have a piece of that going through corporate. So it's going across all three of those. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. So, it's a little more than just kind of the pure acquisition synergies, so some of the base stuff that they were doing at Battery prior. And then just one \u2013 one last one. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Just for everyone's knowledge, if you remember, we are now talking about productivity and merger synergies as one bucket. It kind of goes all... Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : ...the way back to the EPG conference. That's \u2013 that's really our \u2013 if you want to go with the framework we're using, it goes back to EPG a year ago, and it's the framework we've put in place. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That makes a ton of sense. And then, just lastly, this $10 million hit on the contractor project this quarter. What precisely type of project was that? Was that in old JCI, old Tyco? I would assume it was an install job. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. So it's in the legacy BE portfolio in North America, very large project that working with the customer we had accelerated the execution of that project and took on some additional charges. And so, with that, we'll continue to work with the customer and it's hard to predict ultimately what we'll recover. But at the end of the day, it's being positioned to deliver on what we've committed to the customer that we're serving, and took some additional costs in the quarter. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. I'd like to turn the call over to Alex now for some closing comments. Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc : Sure. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. I just would like to recap a couple of things. One is, if you look at the businesses, if we're going to see growth this quarter, it's good to see that the Buildings business getting on track. And I feel like we're going to gain some momentum. And underlying that, we got some stabilization in our products business, the fire protection products business, and some real strong growth in our HVAC businesses, particularly in our light commercial, residential, and even our applied equipment. So, we think that'll continue and then the other part around our merger cost synergies we're more and more bullish. We've gotten through the corporate piece of this and now we're moving into the Buildings part of it and it's going well. In the meantime, the sales synergies, and I referred to that earlier, that's secured, that we're seeing through the cross-sell opportunities is a real opportunity. I mean, this is not something that is an abstract. We see the projects, we see excitement and our customers are really embracing this opportunity. So, it's going to be a tailwind for us in the long run. And so, we're pretty confident we have the right strategy. We look forward to talking about this over the next few months with everyone, but things are getting clear and clear and the teams are coming together. So, I just want to leave it at that and I'll talk to you soon. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. Operator that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' third quarter fiscal 2017 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli; President and Chief Operating Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you view today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins, exclude transaction, integration, and separation costs, as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. All comparisons to the prior year are on a combined basis, which excludes the results of Adient, and includes the results of Tyco, net of conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls' ordinary shareholders was $0.59 for the quarter and included net charges of $0.12 related to special items. These special items were primarily composed of transaction and integration costs, a mark-to-market pension as well as restructuring and impairment charges. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.71 per share compared to $0.61 in the prior year quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to Alex. Alex Molinaroli : Thanks, Antonella. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. So if you've read - written in the release and our slides this morning, we reported a quarter of solid EPS growth, strong margin expansion, driven by that continued progress with our synergies and our productivity actions. I'm on Slide 5. As you'll hear from George in more detail, we continue to be below our overall revenue plan. And I just want to point out that many of our businesses and our regions are seeing some good growth and others have fallen short. So it's not across the board. Also, I need to point out that within Buildings, it would be wrong for me to say that I'm sure the merger itself and some of the changes that have come along with that have created some near term distractions that have contributed us not achieving our top-line objectives. We believe we can get that back on track. Our teams will however continue to offset the revenue shortfall by our continued driving of strategy and productivity benefits. Given our year-to-date performance and the expectations for the fourth quarter, we are guiding to the low-end of our prior range and we expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.62. This will be a 13% EPS growth year-over-year, strong growth, but not quite where we expect it to be when we laid out our guidance in December. Although we haven't achieved all of our objectives, I do remain confident that our strategy and the strategic platform that we're creating, the decisions we're making around integration and organization are positioning us well to serve our customers today and in the long-term. It's going to help us lean out our cost structure. And ultimately, will drive both top line and bottom line results. And finally, let me talk about cash conversion. This is clearly a need - needs to and will improve. In addition to the large cash outflows this year related to the tax payments and the merger transaction, we've also made some operational decisions that have affected our underlying cash conversions. Brian will talk about these in some detail. And George will address it also. So, if you go to Slide 6, and it's to kind of give you an overview of or recap of our results. The total company sales for the quarter increased 1% year over year to $7.7 billion. Organically our sales grew similarly, 1% year over year. Organic growth in Buildings is a little over 2%, partially offset by a modest decline in our power business of 2%. And George will provide more color and the trends in both of those businesses. Adjusted EBIT dollars are up 15% year-over-year. We saw solid profitability growth in the segment EBITA level, primarily driven by the continued focus on cost synergies and productivity initiatives. And we benefited also from the lower corporate cost and amortization expense versus prior year, the corporate synergies and the Scott Safety transaction respectively. Adjusted EBIT margins expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 13%. If you just for impact of FX and lead, margins actually expanded 170 basis points year-over-year. And lastly, EPS for the quarter was up 16% year over year to $0.71. With that, I'll turn it over to George, to talk about the integration and also the business performance. George Oliver : Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 7, by providing an update on the integration. The new organization structure in Buildings is now in place. And we have selected the best athletes and have asked them to play new positions on the field. Region by region, business by business, we have completely realigned the leadership structure in order to eliminate cost and redundant layers of management as well to optimize sales and service productivity. Naturally, this degree of change in a merger of this size brings with it the potential for short-term challenges as the players familiarize themselves with the playbook. With this in mind, we made a deliberate strategic decision to move as quickly as possible to implement our new organizational structure, recognizing this may result in a few false starts in the near-term, but will result in a winning strategy in team in the medium and long term. We remain fully committed to achieving our synergy and productivity savings targets. And have made great progress during the quarter delivering roughly $80 million or about $0.07 in year over year savings. We continue to track towards the high end of the original $250 million to $300 million range in cost energies and productivity savings for the year. With roughly $0.18 achieved through the third quarter, we continue to expect to achieve $0.09 in the fourth quarter, which would total $0.27 in savings for the full year. I am proud of the work we've done across the organization and the significant progress we are making on achieving merger-related costs energies. As I review the regional performance in Buildings, I will touch on some cross selling wins. Let's turn to Slide 8. On a reported basis, Building sales in the quarter were flat versus the prior year at $6.1 billion, as 2% organic growth was entirely offset by the impact of FX and net divestitures. Our field business, which as a reminder represents about 65% to 70% of total Building sales, grew 1% organically year over year with mixed performance across the regions. We saw continued momentum in our global applied HVAC business, which grew in the mid-single-digit range. Fire and security, the legacy Tyco installation and service businesses, declined in the low-single-digit range partly due to a tougher comp with the prior year. Let me quickly walk through the regions, starting with North America. As many of you know, North America is the largest region for both legacy businesses and therefore creates the great opportunity for growth from both a top and bottom line perspective. This is also the region that has undergone the most significant amount of change. At the beginning of the third quarter, we put in place a new regional organizational structure, which combine fire and security with HVAC and controls with 27 [P&L] [ph] leaders. The structure eliminates an organization layer, while increasing our sales management and selling capacity. This now gives us an opportunity to make sure our processes are consistent, that we harmonize the way we go to market, where it makes sense and we take advantage of scale. These leaders are a mix of legacy Johnson Controls and legacy Tyco leadership, who know a lot about where they came from, but have a learning curve with the rest of the business. This added a bit of pressure to the quarter. Organic revenue growth was flat year-over-year, with orders down 4%. Keep in mind, order activity can be lumpy and when adjusting for the timing of large orders, year-over-year order growth was relatively flat. As we've now been operating in this structure for a few months, we are continuing to make progress improving the level of depth and expertise of the P&L leaders. Although there has been some short-term impact, I am very pleased with the progress that has been made over the quarter, including the success we have had with cross-selling wins. We designed and implemented a new sales operating model to enable our customers to buy, how they want to buy. For example, during the quarter, we won a large project in the healthcare vertical. The fire team secured the order to install a fire detection system in a new building as well as the retrofit work in two existing buildings. Embracing the one team approach, the fire team brought in their HVAC colleagues, who are able to successfully displace a large HVAC competitor. Moving to Asia Pacific, we had a strong quarter all around, despite the concerns of softening macroeconomic conditions both organic revenue growth in orders were up in the high-single-digit driven by China and Northeast Asia. Contributing to the growth was a strong increase in service revenue. We've added additional technicians in China and Japan. And we are seeing nice growth as a result. Additionally, the team had several cross-selling wins in the quarter, which contributed to the high-single-digit order growth. For example, the team secured a nice win in Hong Kong for cooling systems in 19 rail stations. By leveraging cross business relationships, the team was able to secure this win over a seeded competitor. Moving to EMEA, the macroeconomic indicators are mixed across the region. Within our businesses in Europe, low-single-digit growth in Continental Europe was partially offset by a decline in the UK, resulting an overall modest growth. The Middle East on the other hand continues to be challenged. However, the decline has moderated to the mid-single-digit. Lastly, Latin America continues to grow organically, primarily driven by our subscriber business. Overall, orders in the EMEA region were down modestly. Looking now at our product business, which represents remaining 30% to 35% of Buildings sales increased 4% organically year-over-year. A nice sequential improvement from the 1% decline we saw last quarter. We continue to see very strong growth in our North America residential and light commercial HVAC business, which grew high-single-digit organically, benefitting from a significant amount of new product launches, despite beginning to lot more difficult comparisons. Our Hitachi business also grew high-single-digits organically aided by a recovery in the timing of shipments, we discussed last quarter. Additionally, as expected our Fire & Security product businesses have stabilized and our holding flat with prior year. Trailing EBITA increased 7% year-over-year to $908 million. The segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 15%, a strong synergy and productivity savings modest volume leverage in favorable mix more than offset planned incremental product and channel investments during the quarter. Turning to orders and backlog on Slide 9, total Building orders increased 1% year-over-year organically, up 3% when adjusting for the timing of large orders, driven by 4% increase in product orders, which drove the revenue in the quarter given the book and shift nature of that business. Field orders were flat with the prior year and strong growth in Asia Pacific was partially offset by a decline in North America and EMEA, as I previously mentioned. In terms of the order pipeline, we are seeing continued momentum in the U.S. market, with stable growth in non-residential construction verticals year-over-year. And expect to see orders growth in our North American field business next quarter. Backlog of $8.4 billion was 3% higher year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A. In summary, the teams are coming together as well, having been very engaged with every member of the team through this process. I remain convinced that the strategy of this combined entity is going to continue to unlock significant value for customers, employees and shareholders. Tuning to Power Solutions on Slide 10. Sales increased 6% year-over-year on a reported basis to $1.6 billion, driven by the impact of lead pass-through, which benefitted powers top line by roughly 8 percentage points. Organic sales were down 2% driven by 3% decline in global unit shipments with declines in both the OE and aftermarket channels. OE unit shipments declined 6% versus last year with particular weakness in the U.S. and EMEA related to lower OEM production volumes, which declined at a similar rate. On the aftermarket side, which comp for roughly 75% of our volumes, unit shipments declined 2% year-over-year. Weakness in the aftermarket channel was more prevalent in EMEA and China, where customers delayed order decisions based on the drop in LME lead prices throughout the quarter. Given the typical restocking that takes place in the late summer months, we expect low to mid single digit organic growth in the fourth quarter. Global shipments of start-stop batteries continue to expand with 17% increase year-over-year, despite a difficult plus 22% prior year comparison, including another quarter of significant growth in China and the Americas. The decline in EMEA was tight to the lower level of production in Europe. Power Solutions segment EBITA of $304 million increased 8% on a reported basis, or 7% excluding foreign currency and lead. Power's margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 120 basis points headwind from the impact of higher lead costs. On an EBITA dollar basis, lead was a slight tailwind in the third quarter. Underlying margins excluding the impact of lead increased $160 basis points year-over-year driven by favorable price mix as well as productivity benefits partially offset by lower volume leverage. Now let me turn the call over to Brian to walk through corporate and the consolidated financial details of the quarter, as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. Brian Stief : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 11, you can see that our corporate expenses were $23 million or 16% lower than last year, as we continue to see the benefits from the ongoing synergy and productivity actions we have in place. And we continue to feel that the corporate expenses for the full year will fall at the low-end of the $480 million to $500 million range we originally provided. Before we go into the financial highlight section here, I just comment that our results for the quarter due reflect some special items again transaction and integration costs, restructuring costs and primarily mark-to-market charges those are outlined for you in the appendix both for Q3 and on a year-to-date basis. And as I go through the commentary, I'll exclude those items from my comments. I'll also just say then I'm going to move through the financial highlight section pretty quickly here, because I'd like to spend a little bit more time in the area of free cash flow. So on Slide 12, you can see that our sales in the quarter were up 1% to $7.7 billion. It's also reported in organic basis. And SG&A expenses were down 6% quarter-over-quarter again reflecting our teams ongoing focus on cost and synergy realization. If you look at equity income of $69 million, significantly higher than a year-ago, and that again demonstrates the strong performance of the Hitachi non-consolidated joint ventures as well as some Power Solutions joint ventures. So for the quarter, EBIT was up 15% to $1 billion and overall EBIT margins of 13%, were very strong up 150 basis points from 2016. Moving to Slide 13, you can see the net financing costs were up $124 million versus last year and as primarily due to the debt issuances that we discussed with you last quarter. Our effective tax rate of 15% continues to compare favorably to our prior year rate of 17%, and you can see that our income attributable to non-controlling interest is $74 million, which was up $18 million from the prior year, and that continues to reflect the strong performance of the Hitachi joint ventures. The overall diluted EPS for the quarter of $0.71 is up 16% versus the $0.61 a year-ago. Moving to Slide 14, just a quick EPS waterfall here for Q3, and you can see that we delivered our targeted $0.07 benefit from cost synergies and productivity savings in the quarter. Organic growth in Buildings and some favorable mix in Buildings and Power provide additional $0.03, and we again picked up the $0.02 from the tax rate. These were partially offset by incremental investments in our business of $0.01 and $0.01 of foreign exchange. I will just comment that each of these bridge items are right in line with the Q4 - Q3 waterfall guidance we gave on our second quarter call. So now let's move to free cash flow, given the significant cash impacts of special items during the year, we've provided a reconciliation for you both for Q3 and Q4 - Q3, year-to-date. The items that we have called out relate to transaction integration costs, and restructuring costs as well as the tax payments. When you look at our Q3 and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of $200 million, it's obviously well below, where we would typically be at that at this point in the year. And I just like to make a few comments on a few specific items here. As Alex mentioned, there were some specific operational decisions that were made in the quarter, which have resulted in cash outflows versus our original guidance. This included $400 million inventory build in Power Solutions as well as the establishment of our hedge of our stock-based deferred compensation liabilities. And I'll comment on each of those in a second. In addition to those two items the timing of dividends from several of our equity affiliates have been delayed, pending further discussion with our minority partners on whether those dividends - when those dividends will be paid, we're still be reinvested in the business. So talking about the Power Solutions inventory build that was really driven by customer requests to ensure that we meet their stocking demands during the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2018. I just comment that in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we incurred incremental service and support costs and likely lost business opportunities due to inventory shortages that we had during the peak season, and we want to minimize that as we move in to this year's second half of the calendar year. In addition, the lower sales volumes in Q3 and Q2 increased our overall inventory levels. Consistent with Johnson Controls past practice pre-Tyco merger and the Adient spin-off, we made a decision in Q3 to hedge our stock-based deferred compensation liabilities in order to reduce the future income statement volatility associated with the movements on our stock price. As many of you know, Q4 is always a strong cash quarter for Johnson Controls and historically for Tyco as well. And we expect to deliver adjusted free cash flow of approximately $900 million, which is slightly higher than last year on a pro forma combined basis of JCI and Tyco. I'd like to do a little walk here to take you back to the original guidance that we've provided of $2.1 billion. If you adjust that for the decline in our earnings per share for the year, you arrive at a number of - between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. And so the bridge that I'd like to kind of take you through here is for the first three quarters of this year, we've got adjusted cash flow of $200 million as you see on the chart. We've got Q4 projected cash flow of $900 million to get to the $1.1 billion. And then if you add to that the inventory build Power Solutions, the equity hedge of $100 million, the delayed dividends from the JV of $100 million, you get to a $1.7 billion. And then on top of that we have seen in the quarter, and a little bit and late in the second quarter of build in receivables within the Buildings business. And that relates I think in part to the fact that we're consolidating a lot of activities into our shared service centers globally right now merging the Tyco locations with the JCI shared service centers. And we've seen a little bit of a build in receivables that we've got to go after here in the fourth quarter and in the fiscal 2018. I would also kind of step back and look at the trade working capital as a percentage of sales. And if you look at, I guess, I would call it our entitlement just to - if we would target trade working capital as a percentage of sales in the Buildings business to be around 12%, and the Power Solutions business to be around 20%. I think we've got about $500 million plus opportunity to go after some trade working capital opportunities here beginning in the fourth quarter through fiscal 2018. Our free cash flow is below plan levels and we recognized it's been very choppy in 2017 both in terms of the number of adjustments that we're talking you through, as well as overall free cash flow conversion rates. We're committed to improving working capital in 2018, and we think the gap between our reported cash flow and our adjusted free cash flow should tighten. And we also think that our free cash flow conversion rate should now be above the 80%, as certain of the operational items that I just talked about should in fact turn in the fourth quarter - late in the fourth quarter or into fiscal 2018. Moving to Slide 16 on the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, our net debt to capital ratio is 41.2% up from 40.3% the prior quarter and. And as most of you know, we are moving forward with the share repurchase program in the second half of this year, it was up by about $500 million in the second quarter, and year-to-date we've repurchased 10.2 million shares for about $426 million. And we would expect the full year repurchases to be in the range of $650 million and $750 million. Just talking through a couple of other items that you'll see in Q4. We'll see the items related to restructuring transaction integration costs and income taxes, we also will have our normal mark-to-market on pension and OPAB [ph] in the fourth quarter. And in addition to that I would mention that we've got the reportable segment change for Buildings that will be made in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. And as part of our earnings in Q4, we will provide restated quarters our new segment basis for Buildings. And then finally, I just wanted to confirm that the sale of our Scott Safety business to 3M is expected to close in Q1 of 2018, and the net proceeds of between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion will be used to pay down the $4 billion TSarl that was incurred in connection with the Tyco transaction. Turning to Slide 18, as far as Q4 guidance is $0.86 to $0.88 which was up 13% to 16% versus $0.76 last year. We've got a year-over-year waterfall, as we've mentioned before, we continue to believe there will be $0.09 of benefit related to cost synergies and productivity savings. And we'll have volume and mix of $0.01, which reflects some price cost pressure that we expect to see as we move through the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate of 15% compares favorably to the prior year of 17, so that contributes a couple of $0.01. And I would just comment, we continue to evaluate additional tax synergy opportunities related to the Tyco merger. And finally continued investments on our Buildings and Power businesses represent $0.01 impact in the fourth quarter. So overall our organic growth is now estimated to be 2% to 3% over last year with overall EBIT margin expansion of 70 to 90 basis points. As far as full year guidance on Page 19, given our reduced Q4 organic revenue growth we are guiding full year EPS to the low end of the range previously provided that range is $2.60 to $2.62, which represents a year-over-year increase of approximately 13% versus $2.31 on a pro forma basis last year. And with that, Antonella, we can open it up for questions. Antonella Franzen : Thanks, Brian. Operator, can you please open up the lines and provide instructions for asking a question? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey, maybe we can start with, Alex, your opening comments you referred to some of the distractions on the integration. And may be George was referencing the same thing about some false starts. But maybe you could give some examples or some specifics around where that might have been seen in the quarter and how that has been addressed as we look at fiscal fourth quarter? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, so the two things that I'd point out is - one is kind of clear when Brian talked about our receivables issue. If you look at it, as we started moving to shared services I think there is a distraction there. So either some cash, it wasn't collected. Process has changed, people have moved and locations have moved as it relates to some of our collections. So that's one that's pretty easy to get your head wrapped around. We'd like to think that we were not going to have, that things are going to hit the ground. But obviously, if you just look at - if you see the underlying receivables, it was some of the stuff that Brian talked about, you can see that that is something we can get back. But we lost a few days if you look at our DSO. And if you think about where the - I think George referenced the largest part of our business being North America. That is where both businesses came together. And as we came together, it's just - you can't point to a specific thing and say, well, we lost a project or somebody got distracted. But you just know, because those changes happened right after the end of this second quarter. I mean, we timed it to make sure that we got through the second quarter and then we made the changes. And so it's just logical to understand when you go through that kind of change in your field organization, that you're going to have a little bit of time that people need to adjust to the new bosses and new organization. But in the end, when you get out in front of the customer that hasn't changed, so the reason we have confidence that this is a - you know what, a short term challenge and one that's hard to put your finger on is that, that when you get in front of the customer the people that recall on the customer service and the customer - and their boss at the local level has not changed. But when you look above that, much leaner structure and much more logical structure, one that's going to work for a long term, but it's just - it just change. And I think that it would be naive for us to think that that didn't have somewhat of an impact, probably on some of our order secured is my guess. And so, hopefully, orders aren't lost, it's just - we just got to go through a process. So that's the way - George, you probably have more color on it. But that's the way that I would characterize it. North America would probably be the place that we're going to see, it is where we see it. George Oliver : Yeah, just a little bit to add, Deane. I would say that, when you look at the Buildings organization, you've taken two very large organizations. And although we talk about legacy JCI, legacy Tyco, we're running these businesses across the globe together. And so you can imagine from a leadership standpoint, the changes that had to occur. And I am more confident than ever, the way that the teams have come together. And the sales management, sales capacity that we've created, while taking out layers of management that, that is going to translate to accelerate the acceleration of orders and growth. Our pipeline, although we didn't convert in the quarter, we see a very nice pipeline built across the globe with opportunities and the quoting activity as a result of that pipeline is increasing. So I'm developing more confidence every day that as we put these organizations together, building off of the strong customer relationships that we had within the legacy structures, working together now into operating system, we're now seeing that coming through. Deane Dray : Got it. And then, just as a follow up on the free cash flow situation for the quarter, for Brian, is that $500 million trade working capital opportunity? That sounds like a new target. Just the degree of confidence and going after that, the pace of which you think you can begin to ring that out and does this change in any way the JCI longer term goal of reaching 90% free cash flow conversion by 2020? Brian Stief : No, the 90% is still intact, Deane. And as far as the $500 million, that's a target that's based upon where we think our optimal position is on trade working capital as a percentage of sales in each of our businesses. And historically, Building Efficiency and Tyco, I think when their trade working capital is well under control, we feel in a combined basis that a target of 12% there makes sense. And we're 150 basis points higher than that right now. And when you look at Power Solutions, we are of the view that 20% is historic targeted level that we think is optimal. And we're at 22.5% to 23% right now. So if you do the math on that, you pretty quickly get to a number of about a $0.5 billion that that should be achievable and we've got teams that are going after. Alex Molinaroli : Deane, some of that is some of the same stuffs that we have talked about. We have an optimal level of inventory within Power Solutions that is not as high as it is today. But one of the things that we've done is we've gone through - because of the customer issues we had last year, the orders we missed and the service penalties we paid. We put capacity and as you know, our capital spending is pretty high in North America. We put capacity in that will help us in the future. But this year, we're needing to put inventory in order to get through the season. I think we've got some capacities going a long place that will help us offset some of the need for inventory in the future too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz. Your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Al, and then we can talk a little bit more about what's going on in your Power business. You guys have leading market share in the business. And I know, last quarter, you suggested that your Power team is feeling good about the rest of the year. And then you missed your own quarterly projections by a significant amount. We know that part of the issue is customers waiting for lead price reductions. But why wouldn't that have been somewhat of a concern last quarter and something that maybe your teams could have been better prepared, so just sort of commentary on visibility around that Power business going forward? Alex Molinaroli : Yes, it's a good question. What I would say is it's not a North American phenomenon, because of the closed loop system in North America. I think both in Asia, specifically China and Europe we see that phenomenon. And I think there's just been a lot of attention within the business, how much - in order to motivate your customers how much do we want to do to pull orders forward, which would mean essentially we would give them relief early versus being able to deal with the price changes as they happen. So I think that we were probably hopeful, that we could pull some stuff into the quarter. I think that naturally it's going to happen. I think we'll see that happen in the fourth quarter. And it's hard to - and the only thing I could tell you for sure is we haven't lost any share. And it's - the you know the team is just as frustrated as you are, because it also a double dinger. It also hit us in the inventory. If you think about our inventory in Power, it's not only the inventory you built on purpose, but the fact that we didn't get the sales coming out in the quarter that we expected. So I don't think it's we don't have our eye on the ball. I think we're probably little optimistic that we could pull in front of the price - the price changes for lead. Andrew Kaplowitz : And, Alex, when you talk about sort of the low- to mid-single-digit growth in the business going forward, is that still optimistic or is that sort of realistic now based on what you see? Alex Molinaroli : I think it's realistic. I think that quarter to quarter, we obviously are seeing some volatility. But if you just look at the orders that we have, we are going through a change where a lot of our customers are now moving to AGM products. So I think one of the limiting factors are we're going to have the - are we going to have the batteries to be able to serve that market as we move forward. Some of the challenges - the reason why it's only 17% growth in AGM, which is not as high as it's been is - part of it is capacity constraints. Our customers are going through changes and we're putting the capacity in as fast as we can. I think the markets there on an overall basis, because you just look at the build and the replacement cycles, the markets there, the timing of it something that we don't control. And it got away from us this quarter, because it caught us both on the inventory and on the sales. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your lines is now open. Nigel Coe : I just want to go back to cash flow. You built about $1.1 billion of trade working capital this year. And, Brian, you were saying there is about $0.5 billion of relief from that. So I'm just wondering, the message that you came in post-merger kind of low on working capital and you have to rebuild some of that. And as a result, you've lost some business. And therefore, now, you've kind of gone above that target range you have to - that delve back. That's the first part of the question. And then the second part is you're not really assuming much working capital benefit in 4Q. Is that right? And if so, why is that? Brian Stief : Yes, so the fourth quarter benefits, I mean, if you look at the bridge that we've provided to get the $1.9 billion. I think, there's going to be late fourth quarter into the first quarter. I do think, we're going to see at least $200 million of the inventory build flush out. And then, I think the dividends from the JVs, we also are still of the view the fact is going to be received, as I mentioned we were resetting the situation now, we were discussing with our joint venture partners whether there's going to be dividends to each of the partners, or whether or not we're going to reinvest in the business. But we believe at this point that that's a timing item as well. And then on the receivable of a couple of $100 million, I would expect that we would start to see some of that turn as well as we get after this trade working capital initiative that we've got, we're moving forward with here. So I do think that there is $400 million of that bridge that I gave you that we're going to see come back and relatively short order between now and mid-fiscal 2018, which should improve our cash flow north of the 80% level that we had originally targeted for fiscal 2018. As far as your first question on optimal levels of trade working capital, and there is no double that we have gone backwards in the first nine months of this year. The biggest pieces of that tended to be the inventory build of Power, and receivable we've talked about. There were also payables and also about $100 million headwind there. So I think when we look at our overall initiatives for fiscal 2018. We're going to work toward trade working capital as a percentage of sales of 12% of Buildings and 20% of Power. And we think that's a good place to be both from customer standpoint and from a company standpoint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : I just back on cash flow here. Can you give us a sense of what you're expecting for CapEx in 2018 relative to 2017? Brian Stief : Yes, so if you - Jeff, if you look at Power Solutions, we're finishing the AGM capacity in North America and we've got two plants that we're finishing up in fiscal 2018, early 2019. So it's a pretty heavy year from the standpoint of - I would call it growth CapEx in Power Solutions. As you know this year, we guided to $1.250 billion to $1.3 billion, I think we're going to be in line with that. I'm guessing next year could be in the $1.4 billion range plus or minus just kind of what we're thinking right now given the Power Solutions investments. Jeffrey Sprague : And just trying to get my head around the conversion, obviously, on the cash flow miss here, could understand not want to go over promise for next year, but it's called $100 million headwind on CapEx, if you've got this big of a working capital swing. Actually feels like a number could be - could have a nine handle on it, I mean is there something else, I'm missing there, I wonder about other kind of charges that are maybe not in the deal integration numbers et cetera. What are the consideration should we have in mind, when we think about 2018 free cash? Brian Stief : I understand the math you're doing to get a nine in front, but I think we're still in the process of finalizing everything for fiscal 2018, Jeff. And we will provide more color on this, when we go through our 2018 guidance. But I mean suffice it to say we all recognize that given the poor performance in 2017 and certainly the working capital areas that should certainly provide some tailwind for us as we go into 2018. And I would say - but I want committed to say right now it will be north of 80%. Alex Molinaroli : I think that's a responsible way for us to answer the question, Jeff, at this point. We understand your math. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Stephen Tusa : Hi, guys, good morning. Alex Molinaroli : Good morning. Stephen Tusa : What exactly is the hedge for deferred comp, and I have a follow up on that? Brian Stief : So we've got stock-based compensation awards that we give to our employees. And you essentially work with a financial institution, you give them the money to purchase the shares and they essentially a lot of you to provide a hedge against future movement in your stock price. So to the extent that we buy in. And I believe in the 10-Q that you'll be seeing, I think we brought in at $42.21. And that hedge is going to offset movement upward and downward in the stock price versus the $42.21. So essentially what it does is, it takes the volatility out of your income statement for any movement in your stock price, which is required under gap to be either a compensation expense or compensation benefit as you move through the year. Stephen Tusa : And if that have any influence on what ultimately your employees receive? Brian Stief : No. Stephen Tusa : Okay, okay. And then just for - I just looking a bit ahead, these are just basically items that are probably no one at this stage of the game. And any view on kind of what ForEx, looks like to be kind of snapped a line here for 2018, and any other parts of the bridge in 2018 that are kind of - would be more just financially oriented. We can all kind of do our own math around volume and mix, but and any planned change in the tax rate and also are you reaffirming kind of the synergy forecast that you guys gave at EPG, I assume there is no change and you're executing well this year? Brian Stief : Yes. So the synergy number $250 million, we reconfirm. The tax rate we haven't finalized all the effective tax rate work at this point in time for 2018. But I would say that it will be 15% or lower, as far as FX. I don't think, I've got any specific guidance at this point in time on that. Antonella? Antonella Franzen : Yes, I mean, if you take a look at kind of how rates have moved particularly now, you could see that we brought down our FX headwind expectations for the year. So I mean, if rate stay how they are, I mean, if we take Q4 as an example, there is really not much of an FX either headwind or tailwind, it's actually pretty neutral. But as you know, rate moved, so as we get closer to 2018 will obviously adjust to the more current rates to see what type of impact that gives us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Timothy Wojs : Yes, hey, everybody, good morning. I guess, I was just on cash flow cash flow again if there are any thought or is there any concern just as you kind of tradeoff working capital that that has any impact on kind of the growth algorithm for the businesses. Alex Molinaroli : I'm sorry. You mean not having or having? Timothy Wojs : I guess, if terms are tighter, I mean, does that have any impact on how you guys think - how growth could come into the P&L in the Buildings business? If maybe in terms of a little less favorable. Alex Molinaroli : No. I don't think so. I don't think that. I don't see, I think that what we're talking about now is we've got some process issues that we need to effect, and in terms that we need to harmonize that's our opportunity. I don't see that we're going to do anything that's going to affect the growth of the business. And that's why I think when Brian talked about it being an entitlement, I think that's - the way that he was framing it. I thought maybe you're talking about Power Solutions, we did lose some growth, because we didn't have the inventory last year, or didn't have batteries. And you can either think you need to have capacity or you need to have inventory. I think at this point, we got the worst of both worlds, because we've got the extra inventory and we're putting capacity. And so we will be in that shape - we will be in a similar shape of next year from an inventory and Power. But if you look at receivables and Buildings, I think Brian talked about right, as an entitlement that's not going to affect our growth, and you look at inventory and Power, it's the same thing that we can take our inventory and Power, it's the same thing that we can take our inventory down and not hurt our growth, because we're putting new capacity in. Timothy Wojs : Okay. Great. And then just what's the - as you look at kind of price cost, that's been a theme in this earnings season. I mean, how would you guys frame that the price cost discussion into fiscal 2018, particularly in the Building side. Brian Stief : Yes, so if you look at Buildings in the third quarter were up 110 basis points on margin that was driven by volume leverage. We got the synergies and productivity as well as now we're seeing the growth come through the products businesses, which is a higher mix. That was somewhat offsetting some price cost of about 20 basis points, and that's mainly driven by steel, copper, aluminum as well as some refrigerant. And so as we look at this going forward, we'll still have the strong synergies productivity will continue to see increasing volume leverage, we will get the mix of our products beginning to accelerate but we are going to see continued headwind here in the fourth quarter, which we're estimating now to be about 20 basis points. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye : Yes, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. George, you mentioned earlier that you're starting to see very nice pipeline, and favorable quotation activity. Can you just give us a little more color on maybe where that is geographically or kind of within the segments? George Oliver : Sure. So if you start - let me start with North America, because that's certainly the big focus area. At the new organization that we put together, we freed up a lot of resources that we took out the layers of management to put back into sales management as well as selling capacity. We're putting the businesses together, we got a little bit behind of our hiring plan with our sales force. But we're significantly increasing our sales capacity as we speak and then with the work that we've done, the team has done a nice job in putting together prophecies in the field. As we're now leveraging the existing customer base that we serve to be able to better serve the customers with a complete portfolio. And I talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks, making it simpler for the customer to be able to buy from us the total capability. So when you look at the pipelines that have been developed across the globe within our direct channels, we're beginning to see that. Now there's a timing of conversion as we go through this. But it gives me confidence are based on what we see, we're going to begin to see an improvement on a go forward basis. And our product businesses, the team is done a really nice job, not only making sure that we've got, we're leveraging the channel - our direct channel, but also expanding our indirect channels across each one of our product businesses. So not only are we investing in our direct sales capability. But we're also expanding our channels, you'll see that some of the bright spots during the quarter and our DX business with a very difficult compare - last year were up about 17%, were up another 10% this year. That is really an output of some terrific work has been done in expanding our channel to be able to capitalize on the growth in the market share. So what I can tell you across the board, it's certainly a key focus and being able to not only get world class sales management but increasing capacity in our direct channel as well as our indirect distribution that will enable us to be able to capitalize on a broader part of the market. Noah Kaye : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on Power Solutions, Alex, I think you mentioned kind of some capacity shortages around AGM. With all that we're seeing and reading around kind of changes to try to change across the auto industry. Is it AGM demand kind of trending globally the way that you thought it would, as you look out the next couple of years or as perhaps accelerating. How do we think about that and kind of your own capacity build plans? Alex Molinaroli : It's a good question. There's so much been written about every all this whole topic, but what we're saying is probably going to move faster than we can afford to even meet the capacity. So I think we're going to have to be - really have to make sure that we put the capacity in the right place and leverage it, because I think it's just going to escalate. What we do see people trying to do is put some batteries and that are quite AGM capable, and then what we find is they come back later and say we need to do something else. And our capacity plans are pretty significant, our shares are really high. I think, they're probably be more demand, which will be a good problem to have I just think we're going to have to pretty choosy I think on who we serve. I think that's where we're going to be in the next few years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the Power Solutions division, so I guess it's obviously unusual to be sort of growing inventories, while sales volumes came in a bit light. I understand that the guidance is for aftermarket sales to recover in the next few months. But just thinking about the risks that inventories stay high, how would you characterize inventories today versus a typical time of year or typical seasonality in the battery business right now? And then also, on the Power side, I understand the drawdown of working capital not really having a revenue impact. So maybe just talk about any profit or EBIT margin impact as you get that adjustment on working capital in Power. Thank you. Alex Molinaroli : Okay, I'll address the first one. This is Alex. Our inventory is much higher than it was a year ago. And that's twofold. One is it's a response to the fact that we and you may recall we called out, when we're having service problems over the - actually over the last year-and-a-half we had service problems in the peak season, because our peak capacity is probably 120% of our total capacity. And so if you have to have an inventory, you'd be able to serve our customers. We had meetings with our customers, so particularly in North America, our very large customers who essentially put us on notice that they're not going to be short of batteries anymore. And so I think we've compensated for that in a way that we have the inventory and we're also putting in capacity, so that we don't have to have this much inventory on an ongoing basis. So it's a year from now. And so I would say it's sort of kind of in between where we are and where we need to be. As we put capacity in our inventory levels won't be quite this high. But they won't be as low as they were a couple of years ago. But that still gets us in the range of where Brian was talking about as far as what we would believe our entitlement for working capital. And that certainly is - within Power Solutions, it really is an inventory story. Brian Stief : Yeah, I don't think there's going to be any impact negatively on margins as that inventory turns out. I mean, as we kind of talked about in the past, sometimes your margin rates can vary depending upon where lead is. But I don't think there is a downward pressure on margins of Power Solutions as a result of that inventory turning out. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then just, my follow up would be on the Building side. You've had a big push on trying to reinvest more to take share and you have pretty good order numbers in the legacy buildings business this quarter. So that seems to be working. When you think about the incremental investment from here, do you think there's a need for another big step up or do you think that the organic investment in HVAC in particular is running around the right level today? George Oliver : Yeah, Julian, this is George. As you said, we're getting really good traction with the new products that we're bringing to market. And when you look at the performance across our portfolio, I think that's beginning to show, whether it'd be in the residential, like commercial or across applied, as well as within our controls. And that's where a lot of the investments are being put in. What I see going forward as we continue to gain the momentum, we're going to continue to reinvest and look at incremental investments that we see as - given the success we've had in each one of these segments that we see a lot of opportunity with the investments we're making. So we're going to, obviously, take that into account as we're beginning to accelerate and gain market share, but it gives us a lot of confidence that with the investments we are deploying we are beginning to see the growth come through and it's coming through at very attractive margins. Alex Molinaroli : Just to add to that Julian, I mean, we have some really exciting things that are going to happen over the next couple of years as it relates to some products we're developing. So, I think that - I think it's just going to get better. And one of the opportunities for us, particularly look what's happened not only with Hitachi, but just our business in Asia, I think you'll see investments there too, where we will be able to take advantage. We have a great position and we can take advantage for our position in the marketplace. Some of that top line that we're getting in - through Hitachi, you don't see, particularly in China, because it's unconsolidated, but it's growing pretty well, particularly in China. Antonella Franzen : Operator, I think we may be at the top of the hour. But we're going to try and squeeze in one more. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna : Yeah, thanks for fitting me in. So following up on just Brian's [ph] question about the cash flow. In Q4, how much of the items that you mentioned that slipped out of Q3 and perhaps this year do you expect to recover? So Power's inventory build, $400 million, the hedge, the dividend, and the - of the receivable, the $200 million receivable, how much is embedded in your expectation for Q4? Brian Stief : So in what we've talked about, none of it is expected to come back in Q4. We think most of it will come back in first and second quarter fiscal 2018. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And so, given that, and I think previously you've talked about $300 million tax item coming back to you in Q1 as well. Should we expect that Q1 and perhaps Q2 of fiscal 2018 will be very, very strong free cash flow relative to history? Brian Stief : Should be stronger than we've seen historically, that's right. Antonella Franzen : And, Gautam, that one thing to remember is, remember when the cash went out for the tax payment, we had it as one of our reconciling items. And when the cash come back, we said we would do that as well. Alex Molinaroli : So we won't take credit for it, we'll just take the money. Okay. Antonella Franzen : Operator, it is - yeah. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah. Antonella Franzen : I'm going to pass it over to Alex just for any last comments. Alex Molinaroli : Yeah, let me just wrap up here. Thank you for everyone for the call and all your questions. We really appreciate it. So I just want to make sure that, I understand your feedback. And there are three things I would like to point out. First is the synergy and productivity numbers are doing as well or better than we expected. We don't really expect that to change. And so I want to make sure that as we talk about this that we show that we're making progress there. Top-line I think is mixed. We have some opportunity. But we also are seeing some benefits and we haven't lost those benefits, but there are some opportunities for us to make some improvements. And then, clearly, cash flow we get it - there's work that needs to be done. We're a little gun-shy talking about, as you can see from our responses around how this is all - how and when this is going to come back. But we know the opportunity there and we're committed to make sure that, you're going to see the cash flow numbers as good or as better than what we've talked about in the past. So I just want to wrap on that and I want to thank our employees. Lot of work, hard work is being done in order to make this one company. Thank you very much. Antonella Franzen : Thanks, Alex. And, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we\u2019ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude transaction and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedule attached to our press release. All comparisons to the prior year are on a combined basis, which excludes the results of Adient and includes the results of Tyco, net of conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.93 for the quarter and included a net benefit of $0.06 related to special items. These special items primarily related to mark-to-market pension and postretirement gains and discrete tax items partially offset by restructuring, impairment and integration costs. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.87 per share compared to $0.76 in the prior year quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Let me begin with a look back at our first year as a combined company. And the message that I hope you walk away with is although our financial results came in at the low end of where we would have expected in fiscal 2017, we made significant progress on the integration of a historic merger with Johnson Controls. I\u2019m extremely proud of the work our teams around the globe have done and what we have accomplished throughout the year. We completed a major reorganization of our operating structure across the globe, most recently in North America. We made significant strides in aligning our cost structures, generating $300 million in incremental cost synergies and productivity savings, driving 90 basis points of margin expansion for the year. Despite the substantial amount of integration taking place, we also maintained rigor around optimizing our portfolio and capital structure. We completed the spin-off of Adient and divested ADT South Africa and Scott Safety as well as several other small noncore assets. We redeployed the proceeds from those divestitures into paying down a substantial portion of the merger-related TSARL debt. Additionally, we pursued opportunistic share repurchase in an effort to offset the coming dilution related to the Scott Safety transaction, and we finished the year with approximately $650 million of share buybacks. That said, as we have identified on the right side of Slide 5, there are areas in our performance where we need to improve as we move forward : accelerating organic growth in orders and Buildings, expanding gross margins in Buildings, improving free cash flow conversion and consistently delivering on our commitments. If we turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll tie those areas of improvement to the changes we have already implemented to enable us to put shareholder value creation at the forefront of everything we do. First, as you may have seen in a press release this morning, we announced a change in our General Counsel with the departure of Judy Reinsdorf. I\u2019ve worked with Judy for well over a decade. She was instrumental in my time as CEO of Tyco and has been a crucial voice throughout her transitional role for the past year here at Johnson Controls. I\u2019d like to sincerely thank Judy for her many years of service and wish her all the best. I\u2019d also like to take this opportunity to welcome John Donofrio to the team who\u2019s joining us from Mars Incorporated. With this and a few other recent appointments, our senior leadership team is coming together and will be held accountable for driving execution. Beginning in fiscal 2018, we plan to change our compensation incentives to be more closely linked to our performance and aligned with shareholder expectations. Specifically, we plan to tie compensation incentives to the key performance areas that we are focused on : organic revenue growth, EBIT growth and free cash flow conversion. When it comes to accelerating organic sales and orders growth in the field businesses, tracking sales capacity and sales productivity metrics are essential. Growing the field businesses requires a strong and expanding sales force by business and by region with continued productivity. It sounds simple but demands intense focus and consistent monitoring by our business leaders, including myself. With the combination of reorganization of the Buildings businesses, we have remixed the sales force and reinvested in areas of growth. For the full year, we were short of the increased capacity required to accelerate growth. However, in the fourth quarter, we enhanced the process and achieved net adds of 50 salespeople. As we move forward in our new structure, we are targeting 400 net sales adds in fiscal 2018, which will be core to accelerating orders in organic revenue growth. This investment is in response to a strong positive feedback from our customers with respect to how our technologies and solutions are helping our customers enhance their businesses. This will put a bit of pressure into the first half of the year as the new salespeople ramp up, but the increase in capacity will ultimately drive improvements in execution and higher growth. As we move through the course of fiscal 2018, we will keep you posted on our progress. Additionally, not all revenue growth is created equal. And similar to how I operated at Tyco, we will be focused on profitable growth. This starts with going after the right projects, remaining disciplined on pricing to ensure that we are being paid for the value that we provide to our customers and rigorous project management down to driving change orders. With the installed base we create, it is critical that we continue to accelerate our service growth, which enhances our margin profile. As we look at the underlying fundamentals of our backlog, there is some gross margin pressure we expect to see as the backlog turns in our North America field business. To put this in context, the size of backlog in our North America field business is $5.2 billion, and I would say we are entering the year with roughly 75 basis points of gross margin pressure. We have put in place a more strict approval process for large installation projects and are realigning the incentive compensation structure for the entire sales organization. We plan to weight sales incentives more towards gross margins and sales growth so that we can ensure our teams are targeting more profitable growth. With more discipline on price, sales productivity, project management and service acceleration, we expect to drive both improved margins and increased profitability. When it comes to improving free cash flow conversion, we had an intense focus in the fourth quarter to ensure we met the expectations set. I, together with Brian, established a weekly meeting to drive the importance of this metric and closely monitored our free cash flow generation. Additionally, we are in the process of establishing a cash management office reallocating internal talent to solve some of our working capital challenges and focus solely on achieving the targets we have set out. While we saw improvement in our free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter, we know we have a lot more work to do to increase our cash flow conversion. As we move forward, we will also be more selective in our CapEx spending, focused on high return projects and reducing our reinvestment ratio. In terms of capital allocation, you can expect us to remain disciplined when it comes to returning cash to shareholders with a near-term focus remaining on opportunistic share repurchases and overtime, a more balanced approach between accretive M&A and buybacks. We have leading market positions and are strongly positioned to win across our core businesses. That said, we will continue to look at the portfolio both within Power and Buildings, ensuring we are allocating resources in areas where we can generate the highest returns and divesting businesses that are noncore.  With all of these key business fundamentals I have discussed, we have established discipline and accountability from which we set grounded expectations. We know where performance needs to improve. And as a management team, we are entirely focused on executing on the actions I have outlined. I am humbled and honored to be leading this organization, and I want to reiterate that this team is intensely focused on driving execution and creating shareholder value. My personal mission as CEO of Johnson Controls is to lead with clarity, simplicity and confidence, and my intent is that those same values permeate beyond the executive management team throughout the entire organization. I remain confident that, with the organizational changes over the past year, we are well positioned to lead the evolution of Building Solutions and battery technologies. Turning now to Slide 7. Let me recap the results for the quarter, and Brian will provide more detail in a few minutes. Overall, another quarter of solid earnings growth with strong EBIT margin expansion driven by continued progress on synergy and productivity actions. Sales of $8.1 billion increased 4% on a reported basis in the quarter. Excluding the impact from divestitures, FX and lead pass-through, sales increased 2% organically, led by strong performance in our Power Solutions business as well as our Global products business within Buildings. Adjusted EBIT of $1.1 billion grew 10%, driven by cost synergy and productivity realization. EBIT margins were up 80 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or up 110 basis points excluding the impact of FX and lead. Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 8. You can see synergy and productivity savings adding $0.09 to the prior year, in line with our expectations. Volume and mix added $0.01 and strong volume in Power Solutions was partially offset by increased logistics and distribution costs, hurricane disruptions and price cost pressure. The lower effective tax rate year-over-year also added $0.02, and strategic investments were an incremental $0.01. Overall, this resulted in a 14% increase in adjusted EPS year-over-year. Just a quick mention on synergies and productivity on Slide 9. As we have been detailing for you throughout the year, synergy and productivity savings came in at the high end of our original $250 million to $300 million range or $0.27 in 2017. As we look to fiscal 2018, we are planning for an incremental $250 million in savings. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments. Brian Stief : Thanks, George, and good morning. Let\u2019s start with our new segment structure within Building Technologies & Solutions on Slide 10. As you can see, Buildings has two main components : Building Solutions and Global products. Building Solutions, which has annual revenue of about $15 billion, is our field business and direct channel. We operate in a regional structure and report 3 segments : North America, EMEA/LA and Asia Pacific. Global products has $8 billion of annual revenue and will be reported as our fourth segment within Buildings. This is our indirect channel with its sales through distribution and storefronts. I will speak to the new segments as I go through the results for Buildings. Now let\u2019s get into the details of the quarter on Slide 11. Total building sales in the quarter of $6 billion declined 1% year-over-year on a reported basis. However, excluding the impacts from FX and divestitures, sales grew 1% organically. The impact of the hurricanes, the earthquake in Mexico and some final sales-related purchase accounting adjustments impacted sales growth by approximately 60 basis points in the quarter. So let\u2019s start by unpacking the 1% organic decline in Building Solutions, which again represents our project and service-based field business. In North America, our largest region, sales declined low single digits. Our fire and security field business, which comprises about half of the revenue in North America, is relatively flat year-over-year. HVAC and controls installation and service activity, which typically accounts for about 35% to 40% of sales in North America, grew low single digits. However, this growth was more than offset by a decline in large projects within our solutions business, which declined low double digits in the quarter. And I\u2019d just point out that about half of that decline was driven by weaker sales to the U.S. federal government. Turning to EMEA/LA, we saw low single-digit growth in the quarter. Growth in Europe was led by solid project activity in fire and security. In the Middle East, sales inflected to positive growth in the quarter driven by HVAC. Latin America also grew low single digits with balanced growth across fire and security, HVAC and controls. In Asia Pacific, organic growth was flat in the quarter as strong growth in service was offset by lower project installation spend year-over-year, particularly in China. Turning to global products. Sales increased 3% organically year-over-year with growth across building management, HVAC and refrigeration equipment and specialty products. Building management, which is about 15% of global products revenue, includes controls, security and fire detection, and we saw a nice growth across all 3 of these product lines. HVAC and refrigeration products, which comprises about 65% of global products revenue, includes unitary and applied HVAC equipment and products, our Hitachi joint venture products, as well as industrial refrigeration and marine equipment. Within these businesses, resi and light commercial HVAC grew low single digits where a low single-digit decline in resi HVAC was more than offset by low teens growth in light commercial where we saw a significant growth in our national accounts business. I would point out that the resi HVAC decline was impacted by a tough prior year comparison with fiscal \u201816 Q4 growth north of 20% as well as lower cooling degree days. For the full year, our resi HVAC business grew high single digits organically, benefiting from new product launches in the spring of 2016. Our applied business grew in the mid-single digits range in the quarter with strong performance from North America and larger projects in the Middle East. Finally, we continue to see solid growth in our Hitachi joint venture as well as a pickup in our industrial refrigeration businesses led by the improving natural gas and food and beverage markets. The remaining 20% of revenue in global products is specialty products, which includes fire suppression and Scott Safety. This platform saw low single-digit growth in the quarter and, as you know, Scott Safety was sold to 3M in early October. So let\u2019s turn to EBITA. Buildings grew 5% year-over-year in both the reported and adjusted basis to $904 million with margins expanding 80 basis points year-over-year to 15.1%. This growth was led by cost synergies and productivity savings, partially offset by price cost pressure as well as continued investments we\u2019re making in new products in our channels. Over the course of 2017, we launched 14 new chiller products globally and expanded our factory direct distribution business by adding 17 new storefronts across North America. And I just point out that for the full year, Buildings EBITA margin expanded 50 basis points. So let\u2019s turn to Slide 12. Orders grew 2% organically year-over-year, led by the 5% growth in our products business. Field orders were flat as high single-digit growth in Asia Pacific was offset by a low single-digit decline in North America and EMEA/LA. Backlog of 8.5 billion at year-end grew 4% year-over-year on an organic basis. So let\u2019s move to Power Solutions. Sales of 2.1 billion increased 18% year-over-year on a reported basis, but this includes a significant tailwind from lead pass-through. Excluding lead and FX, sales grew 9% organically, led by strong shipments to the aftermarket channels across all regions. Global battery shipments increased 5% year-over-year with aftermarket unit growth of 8%, partially offset by a 5% decline in our lease shipments, which is consistent with the lower auto production in our two biggest markets, the U.S. and Europe. China rebounded nicely versus last quarter with total shipment growth of nearly 40% with strength across both OE and aftermarket. Global shipments of Start-Stop units increased 30% led by strong growth in China and the Americas. EMEA Start-Stop units increased 7% due primarily to strong aftermarket growth, which is more than offset by a low single-digit decline in OE. Segment EBITA of 431 million increased 4% on a reported basis or 5% excluding the impact of FX and lead. Power\u2019s margins declined 260 basis points year-over-year to 20.2% on a reported basis, but this includes 170 basis point headwind from lead. Excluding the impact of FX and lead, Power\u2019s margins declined 80 basis points. In the quarter, leverage and higher volumes, favorable mix and productivity savings were more than offset by ongoing product investments, start-up and launch costs and increased logistics and distribution costs, including the disruptions related to the hurricane. For the full year, Power\u2019s margin declined by 60 basis points to 19.5% on a reported basis, but this includes 150 basis point headwind for lead. Excluding the impact of lead and FX, Power\u2019s margins expanded a strong 100 basis points for the year. Moving to Slide 14. Corporate expense was down 25% year-over-year to 107 million, benefiting from continued synergy and productivity savings as well as a lower compensation expense versus the prior year. For the full year, corporate expense was 465 million on an adjusted basis, better than the 480 million to 500 million guidance range we provided last December. I am pleased with the progress in reducing our overall corporate expense, and we expect to see continued improvement in fiscal \u201818. Now let\u2019s turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In the quarter, we generated $1 billion in reported cash flow. Excluding 100 million of transaction and integration costs in the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was 1.1 billion. This out-performance versus the 900 million Q4 target we provided in July resulted primarily from the strong Q4 volume growth in Power Solutions, which allowed us to work through a portion of the inventory build from the end of the third quarter, and we also saw a reduction in receivables across our businesses. As George mentioned, we are in the process of establishing internal cash management office. This team will be dedicated to improving our overall cash management and forecasting process and will report directly to me. This team will be comprised of individuals from corporate, treasury, our shared service center groups and the business units. This area is one of our top priorities for fiscal \u201818, and we remain committed to delivering adjusted free cash flow conversion of 80-plus percent, which excludes net onetime cash outflows of $800 million to $900 million related primarily to integration, restructuring and income tax payments. Let me stop there just for a second and give you the components of the onetime items. We\u2019ve got restructuring and integration costs of roughly $500 million, which is probably $100 million higher as a result of us accelerating or pulling forward some of these actions to Q4 of \u201818 versus fiscal \u201819. Secondly, we\u2019ve got about $100 million of executive severance and the [Indiscernible] unfavorable arbitration award that occurred in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got the $50 million worth of Scott Safety tax payments. And then we\u2019ve got about $350 million, which is broken into two buckets in the tax area. One would be $200 million outflow related to a Mexican tax law change regarding they\u2019ll no longer accept consolidated filings in Mexico. There\u2019s a deconsolidation that\u2019s required, that will cause $200 million of cash outflows in the first quarter of fiscal \u201818, and there were some specific tax planning in the U.S which was $150 million outflow. So in aggregate, that\u2019s about $1 billion. And as you may recall, 200 -- originally, we thought $300 million was going to be the tax refund in the first quarter of fiscal \u201818. That number is now $200 million, but the $600 million that we expected in 2019 has now increased to $700 million. So essentially, where we are now is we\u2019ve got about $1 billion worth of cash outflows and $200 million related to the tax refund in the first quarter, which gets you that $800 million number. And again, I just point out that as we move into \u201819, we now expect $700 million of tax refunds related to the Adient tax that was paid in the first quarter of \u201817. Similar to recent years, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to be much more weighted to the second half of the year with an outflow in Q1 and our largest inflow in Q4. Moving to Slide 16. We ended the year with a net debt-to-cap of 39.3% versus 41.2% at June 30. During the quarter, we again took advantage of the low interest rate foreign debt environment and issued $310 million of yen-denominated five year notes and $175 million euro-denominated one year note. During the quarter, we used the strong cash flow generation as well as the debt issuances to repay $1 billion in commercial paper and $150 million bond maturity. Additionally, we repaid $165 million in TSARL debt with Tyco-related cash flows. As everyone knows, the Scott Safety sale to 3M closed in early October, and we repaid $1.9 billion of TSARL debt with the net proceeds from this transaction. These payments, along with the proceeds of the ADT South Africa sale in the second quarter of this year, reduced our original $4 billion in TSARL debt to a current balance of $1.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $225 million in stock or about 5.5 million shares. For the year, we repurchased just under 16 million shares for $650 million. I\u2019d also mention that we completed another $150 million of buybacks during the month of October. And as we move through fiscal \u201818, we will, at a minimum, buy back stock to offset the impact of option dilution. On Slide 17, we provided details in the appendix related to the Q4 special items, all of which have been excluded from our adjusted results. And as I mentioned earlier, the building segment change was effective in the fourth quarter, and we -- and the revised fiscal \u201817 quarters are provided in the appendix as well. And just finally, the House U.S. tax reform proposal was released last week, and the Senate proposal is expected shortly. Interest deductibility and repatriation taxes on foreign earnings will be headwinds for us, but we are in the early stages of reviewing the overall pluses and minuses [to Johnson Controls] as well as other available tax planning opportunities. So with that, let me turn the call back over to George to review our fiscal \u201818 guidance. George Oliver : Thanks, Brian. As I mentioned earlier, we have made significant progress over the past year related to the merger integration, but we still have plenty of work to do. Fiscal 2018 will be a year of change. We will intensely focused on driving execution. Turning to Slide 18. We expect total sales to be in the range of $30.1 billion to $30.7 billion. Based on current exchange rates, this includes a $265 million tailwind related to changes in foreign currency as well as a $70 million tailwind related to lead prices. Additionally, the impact of recent divestitures are expected to be a $700 million headwind to sales. We expect overall organic sales growth to be in the low single digits. Going through our expectations for Buildings and Power, let me start with Buildings. Based on current backlog, we expect organic growth in the low single digits as we begin to ramp our sales capacity in fiscal 2018. From an adjusted EBITA margin perspective, we expect the benefit from synergies and volume growth to be partly offset by gross margin pressure within our North American field business backlog, which I spoke to earlier, as well as continued incremental investments in our products and channels. Overall, we expect adjusted EBITA margin expansion in Buildings of approximately 10 to 30 basis points, including a 40 basis point headwind related to the divestiture of Scott Safety. Underlying margins are expected to increase 50 to 70 basis points. In Power Solutions, we expect organic sales growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by volume growth in the aftermarket. We expect volume mix and productivity benefits to be offset by higher lead prices and incremental investments including launch costs. We expect adjusted EBITA margins to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. As Brian mentioned earlier, we expect to see continued reductions in corporate expense and are targeting an incremental 5% to 9% reduction, which would bring our adjusted corporate expense down to a range of $425 million to $440 million. Overall, we expect adjusted EBIT margins to increase 30 to 50 basis points to 12.2% to 12.4%, which includes a 30 basis point headwind related to the divestiture of Scott Safety. Underlying adjusted EBIT margins are expected to increase 60 to 80 basis points. As we move to the below-the-line items, we expect to see a tailwind to interest expense related to the pay down of the TSARL debt from the Scott Safety proceeds. This decrease is expected to be mostly offset by an increase in variable interest rates. In total, we expect net financing charges to be in the range of $460 million to $475 million. Additionally, we have seen very nice growth from our joint ventures, particularly Hitachi over the last few years and expect to see our noncontrolling interest increase to $200 million to $210 million. Based on these items, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which represents a 6% to 10% increase in earnings per share versus fiscal year 2017. As Brian mentioned, we expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of 80-plus percent, which includes CapEx of up to $1.3 billion. Consistent with prior years, we expect our earnings per share to be stronger in the second half of the year due to the normal seasonality of our businesses. We expect our quarterly EPS cadence to be similar to last year with a slightly lower percentage of earnings in the first quarter, given the ramp-up of our sales force and lower margin backlog in Buildings and the lead price movements in Power. With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : George, just first on the portfolio and maybe putting Power aside, which is a whole other discussion. You\u2019ve only been in the CEO seat for 2.5 months or so but obviously, you\u2019ve been evaluating the portfolio as COO all along. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to name names on what might be a candidate to be divested, but can you give us a general assessment of your view? Is there 5%, 10%, 15% of the portfolio that\u2019s kind of a question mark in your mind? Just some way to kind of frame how you\u2019re thinking about that. And if you do have some additional thoughts on Power, would love to hear them, too. George Oliver : So what I would say, Jeff, starting out is certainly over the last couple of months the opportunity to really take a fresh look at the portfolio, I\u2019ve been working very closely with the business leaders and really understanding the core businesses, adjacencies and complementary type businesses. We\u2019ve got incredible platforms in both Power Solutions and Buildings. But as we look at the portfolio that there are opportunities for potential divestitures where we could take those proceeds and double down on some of our core businesses. And as I\u2019ve always demonstrated in the past, as we do this, we certainly will continue to focus on how do we create the most long-term shareholder value in the remix of the portfolio. So what I would say is starting out here, just with the type of businesses that you\u2019ve seen us looking at here, in that kind of high single-digit, mid- to high-single digits potentially as some opportunities here that we see that are kind of outside of our core that would raise capital and be able to position us to be able to double down from an investment standpoint in our more core HVAC and building system businesses within our Buildings portfolio. Jeff Sprague : Mid- to high-single digits within Buildings not relative to total? George Oliver : That is correct. Jeff Sprague : Yes. And I was wondering also, just shifting gears on tax and cash flow and the like, really kind of a couple questions, or related, anyhow, for Brian. How do we get comfortable that it\u2019s Mexico next year and it\u2019s not something else the year after, so to speak? And I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the magnitude of pressures you see on U.S. tax reform relative to your initial analysis. Brian Stief : Yes. So let me start with U.S. tax reform. And I think the two areas that I commented on providing the most headwind are probably the limitations on interest deductibility as well as the repatriation taxes on foreign earnings. And we are in the early stages, Jeff, of taking a look at the implications of the proposal, and we\u2019ll see what comes out from the Senate as well. But those two items certainly do put pressure on our effective rate in the mid-teens where it is today. But I\u2019d also say that until we really sit back and study all the provisions of it, we really aren\u2019t in a position today to comment on what the ultimate effect will be because I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be tax planning opportunities that we\u2019ll have in front of us as well. So I think this is one we\u2019re going to probably just have to keep front and center with you and everyone on the call. And the more information we get and as ultimately the regulations come out, we\u2019ll address it at that time. As far as your comment on Mexico, the calculations that were completed on the specifics around deconsolidation of Mexican returns, I mean the tax law changed, just to give you a little bit of color here, was that in Mexico, no longer can you file a consolidated return and get group tax relief, but you\u2019ve got to file individual returns. And that payment is required to be made for us in our first quarter of fiscal \u201818, and we didn\u2019t finish the calculations on what that net payment was going to be after unpacking all of these individual returns until just recently. And so the one thing I would point out there is that the payment that we\u2019re going to make of $200 million, the way these regulations are working in Mexico, we will recoup that payment over a period of time of up to seven years. So it\u2019s something we\u2019ll get back over time, but it was a onetime payment that\u2019s large enough that we called out in our commentary here. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : So just wanted to kind of dig into these first half margin dynamics. You said you\u2019re adding some new salespeople. The backlog margins are down. So can you just give us some color on kind of how that -- at a higher level, just perhaps in an operating margin level, how that will play through here in the first half to make sure people are kind of level set on the expectation as these costs and this lower margin revenue rolls through? George Oliver : Sure. So let me start with North America. As I said, we have about $5.2 billion in backlog there. And as that flows through, there\u2019s probably about 75 basis points of headwind in that and combined with the investments we\u2019re making in the sales and we\u2019re making good progress there, that certainly is going to create some pressure in the first half as we\u2019re ramping up the orders and that begins to convert to revenues. So that\u2019s the -- that\u2019s one big part of it. And then the other is when we look at our reinvestment, we are -- last year, we had about $0.06 of reinvestment mainly into our products. And that\u2019s beginning to really start to show performance as we look at our products organic growth, and that will continue here through \u201818. And we\u2019re estimating somewhere around $0.06 or $0.08 of reinvestment into our products. Those are the two large pieces as we think about 2018 guidance. Brian, maybe you want to comment? Brian Stief : I would just comment on Buildings, that\u2019s correct, George. And then when you look at Power Solutions given the spike up that we have seen in lead over the last few months here, there\u2019s probably a bit of headwind as we look at just Q1 impact. But as we\u2019ve kind of commented on before, when it spikes like that, we can have an individual quarter impact based upon the arrangements we\u2019ve got with our customers to pass on those lead increases over the course of the year that tends to normalize, and we wouldn\u2019t expect that to be a big number for the year. But there could be a little bit of an impact in Q1 from the spike in lead prices as well, Steve. Steve Tusa : Got it. So when I look at this kind of EPS growth trajectory for the year, $0.06 to $0.10 off of the $0.48 in 1Q -- or sorry $0.53 in 1Q \u201817, I mean will you be growing earnings here in the first quarter? George Oliver : Yes, I think the way to think about this is we\u2019ve historically been around 20% in the first quarter. And then it\u2019s probably been maybe slightly less of that in the second quarter. And so I think, for the first quarter, you can probably dial it in maybe a little less than where we\u2019ve been before, but that\u2019s kind of the general guidance we\u2019d give. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last question for you. The whole comp discussion around what you\u2019re getting paid for, I guess it\u2019s EBIT, organic growth and conversion, is there any -- so if like tax rates go up and your net income is impacted by that and your free cash is impacted by that, that doesn\u2019t impact your -- the kind of incentive package you guys have. Is that correct? Brian Stief : On the AIPP side, that\u2019s correct. On the long-term side, it could have some impact. But the short-term bonus here, it would be 1/3 on EBIT growth, 1/3 on organic revenue growth and 1/3 on free cash flow conversion. And then there could be some modifiers that might also address things like EBIT margin improvement to ensure that we aren\u2019t just chasing revenue dollars, that we\u2019re chasing profitable growth. Steve Tusa : And that\u2019s adjusted conversion? Brian Stief : Correct. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. David Lu : This is David Lu on for Deane. So on the cash flow for 2018, could you parse out sort of what the increase or the ramp-up from 2017 and 2018 will be? Is it more on the working capital side? I know you gave some color around CapEx, but how should we think about the different buckets that leads to the sequential increase in cash flow? Brian Stief : Yes. So CapEx is going to be still in the range of about $1.3 billion -- up to $1.3 billion. The way to think about that is if you look at where we are this year and adjust for the items that we talked about in the third quarter, what happened in the fourth quarter here, we were able to flush through about $100 million or so of the inventory build that we saw at the end of the third quarter in Power Solutions, and we also saw about $100 million reduction in receivables. So if you recall at the end of the third quarter, we talked in terms of a couple of hundred million dollars in inventory we thought we could take out and $100 million worth of receivables. So $200 million to $300 million, we were able to take out in the fourth quarter here. So there\u2019s really $100 million more that we expect in the inventory side. And then I would tell you that would get you up to that 80% plus range. And beyond that, it would be the additional effort that our cash management office team is going to put in place to continue to drive trade working capital improvements and look at payment terms and billing terms to our customers. So right now, we\u2019re looking at around 80% plus. David Lu : Great. And then for my follow-up, can provide an update on the nonresidential sector either in the U.S. or globally, how has it trended? How do you expect it to trend in 2018, is it accelerating or decelerating? Just any color around that would be great. George Oliver : Yes. So when we look at our nonresidential, we get pretty good presence across all the regions. If you break it out into regions, North America is going to -- as we said, we see lots of opportunity there. We\u2019re expanding our sales force here to be able to capitalize on that. If you look at the metrics, there has been plus or minuses here recently, but we\u2019re starting to -- we still see a very strong pipeline for growth and that\u2019s what we\u2019re ultimately positioned to do to accelerate orders through the course of the year and then begin to turn that as we go through the year. Regionally, when you look at EMEA/LA, our businesses in EMEA/LA, we\u2019re actually performing pretty well. We\u2019ve seen some nice progress in Continental Europe offsetting some little bit of pressure we\u2019ve had in the U.K. And as we plan for 2018, it\u2019s still going to continue to grow low single digits. Latin America has been pretty strong for us in -- with the investments and the expansions we\u2019ve been making there. That\u2019s been a bit better than the EMEA region. If you look at -- in Asia Pac when we look at our business there and the investments we\u2019re making, we see nice progress here in 2017 with the new products that we\u2019re bringing into that market and the footprint expansion. And so I would say that we are continuing to look at kind of mid-single digits opportunity there with the market continuing to play out as we expected and then with the investments we\u2019re making. So overall, a fairly solid position as far as a market standpoint. And then with the investments we\u2019re making, we\u2019re going to be positioned to capitalize on that on a go-forward basis. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Go ahead, please. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Andy. So Building Solutions was down 1% in the quarter and orders were flat. So can you talk about your outlook for Building Solutions business within the low single-digit organic growth for Buildings overall? George Oliver : When you look at our business here, let\u2019s looks at fourth quarter in Buildings, we are seeing some nice progress in our products businesses pretty much across the board. And that\u2019s an output of some of the fire and security markets coming back and those businesses performing well in the fourth quarter. And then with the investments we\u2019ve been making in HVAC and controls and the regionalization of some of those products, we\u2019re beginning to see the pickup, and that also would include the work we\u2019ve been doing with Hitachi. So we see that with those investments continuing in 2018. When you look at the field businesses, that\u2019s where the pressure has been. We were down about 1%, and that was driven by our performance solutions business in North America as well as we did see some timing of some of our projects in Asia, we saw a little bit of slowdown there, but we got a very robust pipeline of opportunities and we\u2019re seeing the orders coming through there. So don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s a longer-term concern. So when you look at what we\u2019re doing from a sales capacity standpoint, where we fell short in 2017, we\u2019ve now, over the last few months, picked up our activity in being able to add salespeople not only driving projects but also service. And so as we now project what that\u2019s going to mean, we\u2019ll see accelerating orders through the course of the year and start to see better conversion of the backlog that we have in place. Backlog was up 4% year-on-year so that does give us confidence that we\u2019ll begin to see the acceleration of revenue through the course of 2018. And while we\u2019re driving increased secured orders, that also gives us confidence that, as we plan for 2018, we\u2019ll be in a much better position to continue that acceleration of growth. Unidentified Analyst : And then in terms of synergies, can you talk about any progress you\u2019re seeing on the revenue synergies with any cross-selling opportunities that continue to progress? George Oliver : Sure. I mean what\u2019s happening is we -- within our business, we have very strong relationships with the customers that we\u2019ve served historically, whether it be HVAC controls or whether it be fire and security. And we\u2019ve seen nice progress here in the first year with pipelines, pipelines developing and then the conversion of those pipelines across the board. And what I would tell you is most of these projects are in -- it\u2019s anywhere from less than $1 million to $5 million or $10 million. These are customers that have expansion that -- they\u2019re executing on expansions that we\u2019re bringing in, our combined capabilities to truly differentiate how we can serve their needs within the new space, and we\u2019re starting to see some really nice traction. And so on a go-forward basis, when we originally laid out the longer-term plan, we did say that the first year was going to be about securing orders and that the second and third, we\u2019d start to see the conversion of revenue. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019ll start to see a pickup of the -- now that we\u2019re beginning to see orders, we\u2019re going to start to see the acceleration of the turn of those orders into revenue here in 2018. Brian Stief : And I would just comment, I would just add to that, that we\u2019ve got -- there is a lot of momentum that we\u2019ve got in the back half of this year. So we aren\u2019t seeing benefit in \u201817 from the revenue pull-through. But given the third and fourth quarter activity, we\u2019ll get some benefit on the top line in \u201818. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Rich Kwas : On CapEx, so up to 1.3 billion, what does that imply for the Power CapEx? I thought there was some expansion of facilities in China. So what\u2019s the latest on that? Brian Stief : So for Power Solutions next year, we\u2019ve got 500 million in the plan, and that would include the construction of the facility that will be part of our Bohai Piston joint venture. The other facility that we\u2019ve talked about in China will be starting late in \u201818, maybe even into \u201819. So the second facility in China will probably not have a big impact on the cash flows in fiscal \u201818. Rich Kwas : So Brian, I know as we think about \u201819, is this still kind of the peakish year for CapEx as you look out the next couple of years or is there still bit of a ramp in \u201819? Brian Stief : No, I would say this is the peak. I mean, I could see depending upon levels of the Buildings investments, I would say that we\u2019re probably looking at the 1.3 billion being a peak. I mean, it would have to be something very opportunistic for us to not have a peak at the 1.3 billion. Even at that level, we end up with the reinvestment ratio that\u2019s 1.4, 1.5, something like that. So we\u2019re working to get that down into the more 1.1, 1.2 range. Rich Kwas : Okay, good. And then just on the synergies, so 300 million for \u201817. It was better than expected. The guide includes 250 million. Is that a conservative number? Or is it a reasonable number? I mean, how should we interpret that, considering you had upside last year? And I know there\u2019s moving parts with regards to projects and whatnot, but how do you feel that in terms of potentially delivering some upside to that later in the year? Brian Stief : I\u2019d say we guided 250 million to 300 million last year. We ended up at the high end. I would tell you the 250 million is a number that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019ve got road map for fiscal \u201818. I mean as we go through the year, could there be some upside? Maybe. But right now, we\u2019ve got the teams focused on the 250 million, which is exactly what we\u2019ve got in our trackers, and we\u2019re working toward delivering that. So I think that\u2019s where we are, Rich. Rich Kwas : Okay. And then quick last one. What\u2019s the lead price assumption for the year? Brian Stief : 2,100. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Congratulations, George, on the new job. So two questions. First one, if you could expand upon why pricing in the backlog\u2019s softer in North America. Is it a function of chasing worse projects or is it just the demands conditions warrant that? And if you could just expand that comment to pricing in the applied market abroad as well? And as a follow-up, Brian, will adjusted free -- will actual free cash flow, all in, in 2019 exceed adjusted free cash flow? And if so, by how much, given the $700 million Adient tax recovery? Any color there on both of those questions? George Oliver : Sure, Gautam, I\u2019ll take the margin pressure. As I said in my prepared remarks, the incentive systems that were in place were incentivizing purely sales in the past. And what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve changed that now on a go-forward basis that its sales and margins. So we weren\u2019t consistently applying that concept across the board. And so over the last -- it\u2019s really been over the last 18 months, there certainly was a deterioration of book margins. And as a result, that backlog then plays out over the course of 18 months, and you\u2019ve got pressure in gross margins.  That all being said, we\u2019ve got the discipline in place, the accountability that\u2019s going to ultimately drive improvement. And then with all of the other cost actions that we\u2019re taking, we\u2019ll get benefit also in addition to the pricing to be able to improve that gross margin through the course of the year. And so -- and then the other element is service growth. As I talked about, making sure that we\u2019re getting the right mix of service growth, which as you know is higher profit growth within those field businesses, we had -- it was very low single-digit growth in 2017. I believe, and we\u2019re working across the board to accelerate that service growth, which is going to be a very attractive part of the business on a go-forward basis. So it\u2019s really those two elements that contribute to the overall margin rate. And I have confidence with the actions that we\u2019ve taken that we will be positioned to execute well on that. Gautam Khanna : Pricing outside the U.S. as well? Just on pricing outside the U.S. as well? George Oliver : Yes. So we\u2019ve been -- we have had a little bit of price cost as it relates to some of the HVAC equipment, and you\u2019ve seen that with some of our competitors. We\u2019ve been very disciplined around price and continuing to put a lot of intensity and driving out cost. And so what I\u2019d say is the price cost in the fourth -- it was in the fourth quarter, it was about $20 million or 30 basis points within our building segment, we\u2019re going to see a little bit more of that in the first quarter. But based on all of the reviews and the details I\u2019ve seen, with the price actions that have been taken, with the other cost actions, that we\u2019ll start to see that improve in the second quarter and beyond within 2018. Brian Stief : Gautam, so on cash flow for \u201819, I mean it\u2019s a bit early to talk about \u201819, but I guess I\u2019ll give you my thoughts as we sit here today. That $600 million refund from the Adient tax payment is now $700 million that we\u2019re going to get in \u201819. And I think we\u2019ve talked in the past, we hope to get that in fiscal \u201819. Whether it\u2019s fiscal \u201819 or calendar \u201819 really depends upon how quickly we can get it through a joint committee because, given the size of the refund, it\u2019s got to go to joint committee. But obviously, we\u2019re targeting to get it in fiscal \u201819. So that $700 million, when we look at the other onetime items that could be out there, it\u2019d be restructuring and integration, and I would expect those to be well below that $700 million number as we move into fiscal \u201819, there\u2019s probably a bit of a wildcard, right? Relative to tax reform and what that might mean. I guess we just need to sort through that. But I guess the short response is I would expect adjusted free cash flow or reported cash flow to exceed adjusted free cash flow in fiscal \u201819. Operator : Your last question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Wolfe Research. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just to continue on some of the comments that you guys made on the margin pressure, gross margin pressure in the backlog. George, I think at Tyco, you went through a similar phenomenon when you took over there trying to bring up backlog margins and enhance some bidding discipline. I think there was a period of time where that selectivity showed up in growth. Is that something that you guys are anticipating in the current outlook? Is that something that over the next couple of quarters could be kind of a slow or uneven handoff as you just work that through the system? George Oliver : Not at all. We\u2019re doing both. I mean -- I think what\u2019s different is that during that period of time, maybe the markets weren\u2019t as strong. And when we did the selectivity, it resulted in a net decline obviously with margins significantly improving. What I would tell you in the current environment is the market is pretty strong. We\u2019re adding salespeople, talking to our customers. We\u2019re getting a lot of good feedback that there\u2019s a lot more we can do for our customers and making sure that now we got the capacity to go after that and staying focused on projects that ultimately create the most amount of value. And then certainly from a price standpoint, we get the proper return for the projects that we actually deliver. And so I think it is different than what we went through in Tyco. Some of the same principles apply. It\u2019s more focus and discipline and making sure that the incentive systems are aligned to ultimately what we\u2019re trying to achieve both in growth as well as margins. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up on the cash flow, it seems like the mix of growth that you guys are projecting for \u201818 between more growth in Asia, more growth in Power or Asia on the -- or on the building side, those would be, I guess, your lower cash generating businesses since Asia has Hitachi, if that\u2019s a big component of the growth and obviously Power is a working capital consumer. Is that something that factors into maybe a suboptimal mix of cash flow growth this year and that could normalize something better than 80%? I\u2019m just trying to calibrate. It seems like the mix of growth is not your best case scenario for free cash generation. Brian Stief : I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to impact it in a big way. I guess the way to think about this right now is we\u2019re looking at the Buildings business globally. Target\u2019s about 85% free cash flow, and Power Solutions is around 70% today with the growth investments we\u2019re making. I think as we work through some of the growth investments that we\u2019ve talked about on this call at Power, I think moving toward the 90% target we\u2019ve got in 2020, that\u2019s still where we\u2019re headed. But I don\u2019t think the mix that you\u2019re referring -- the geographic mix you\u2019re referring to is going to be a -- is going to impact that in any significant way. Antonella Franzen : Operator, I\u2019d just like to turn the call over to George Oliver for some closing comments. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella. And again, thanks, everyone, for joining our call this morning. As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019m even more excited about the future opportunity as we look at 2018 and beyond and certainly look forward to engaging with many of you here over the next coming weeks. So, operator, that concludes our call today. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls first quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we have included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.25 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.29 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to restructuring and impairment cost as well as the net impact from U.S. tax reform partially offset by the gain on sale from the Scott Safety divestiture which closed early in the quarter. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.54 compared to $0.53 in the prior year quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. I thought I would start today by providing you with an update on the progress we have made with respect to some of the strategic priorities I laid out for you last quarter. Beginning on Slide 3, first we made some additional changes to our Board in the quarter. At our most recent Board meeting in December, we formally welcomed our newest director, John Young who currently serves as Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health. Additionally, we announced the retirement of two longstanding board members effective as of the upcoming Annual Shareholders Meeting in early March. On behalf of my fellow board members and the executive management team, I would like to personally thank Natalie Black and David Abney for their many years of dedicated service to Johnson Controls and wish them all the best. We also nominated two new board members Gretchen Haggerty who served as CFO of U.S. Steel before retiring in 2013 and Simone Menne who served most recently as CFO at Boehringer Ingelheim and as CFO of Lufthansa prior to that. Both nominees bring decades of senior leadership experience and a deep financial acumen. I look forward to their joining the board and to leveraging their expertise in the coming years. As we mentioned last quarter, we expected the Compensation Committee to make a number of changes to executive incentive plans in an effort to more closely align with shareholder expectations. Those changes have been made in beginning in fiscal year 2018 executive\u2019s annual incentive compensation plans are tied to three key performance metrics : organic revenue growth, EBIT growth, and free cash flow conversion. We are off to a strong start on our initiative to increase sales capacity. Net of attrition, we added 180 new sales team members during the quarter and we are well on our way to reaching our target for the year of 400 net adds. Although we are still in the early stages as it relates to the changes we are making across the sales organization within buildings, I am very encouraged by the results we are seeing so far. We are also beginning to see the initial benefits of driving improved gross margins in backlog. Our field teams are more disciplined on pricing new projects and more focused on driving stronger service growth. As a result, we are improving our booked margin rate on new orders as well as accelerating service growth which will help alleviate some of the margin pressure in the field organization as the year progresses. We saw solid organic top line growth across the buildings platform which grew 4% organically in the quarter, admittedly on our easiest comparison of the year. But the underlying trends across each of our businesses are promising and should provide us some momentum as we go forward. I am very encouraged on the progress we have made in expanding our services. We have been adding both sales and technician capacity and it is beginning to pay off with service growth accelerating to 3%. Next, we have implemented our internal cash management office and the team is actively engaged with the business units as well as external advisors in an effort to improve cash generation and management. I have made this our top priority for the company in fiscal 2018 and we have the right team in place to deliver. As I mentioned last quarter we will continue to look at the portfolio ensuring we are allocating resources in areas where we can generate the highest returns and divesting businesses that are non-core. Lastly, I wanted to highlight a number of truly innovative new products recently launched. As I have been communicating with many of you over the last six plus months, Johnson Controls entered into a significant product development base roughly 3 years ago. And we are beginning to see some of the fruits of our labor here on Slide 4. I want to spend time on each one of these, but I do want to call your attention to the breath of product categories across building technologies launched within the quarter over the last few weeks. We have a steady pace of product launches planned for 2018 across the buildings portfolio with expanded AGM battery offerings within power solutions. Turning to Slide 5, I do want to spend a minute highlighting our new York YZ centrifugal chiller which was launched in early January. The YZ represents a significant milestone in our product development journey. It will become the new flagship in our chiller portfolio. Our engineers have spent the past 3 years analyzing, designing and optimizing each component. Turn it around the next gen low GWP refrigerant to create the highest efficiency centrifugal chiller on the market today. With it\u2019s mag bearing driveline, variable speed drive and our OptiView control panel we have created what will be the new industry standard when it comes to reliability, energy saving and service capabilities. I have the opportunity to spend some time with key customers and distributors at the AHR Expo in Chicago last week. And I can tell you the feedback was overwhelmingly positive, not just about the YZ, but for the entire HVAC and controls products suite. I am extremely proud of the work our engineering and R&D teams are doing around the globe. And I am confident we are investing in the technologies and channels necessary to accelerate top line growth over time. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6, the macroeconomic environment remains generally favorable across most of our key geographic regions supported by rising global GDPs. North American non-residential construction markets are growing steadily, led by the institutional vertical. Global demand for our commercial HVAC and controls products is strong, highlighted by recent strength in Asia, the Middle East and North America. The sustained rebound in oil prices is helping to ease budget constraints. It even released some large infrastructure projects, especially in the Middle East and is also driving demand for our fire protection and suppression products that served the harsh and hazardous end markets. China remains one of the fastest growth regions, although pricing remains competitive, particularly in HVAC. We remain focused upon developing innovative new products and expanding our channel presence and we are gaining share as a result. In Power, we continue to see increased adoption of our start-stop technologies globally and are well-positioned to address the increased electrification in vehicles. OE production is a soft spot, particularly in the U.S. and Europe and we would anticipate that to continue in the near-term. That said we are fully committed to serving our customers and channel partners worldwide and our technology capabilities enable us to consistently outperform the market. Overall, I would say the economic landscape is supportive of continued order and revenue growth momentum throughout fiscal 2018. Moving to Slide 7, field orders accelerated in the quarter to 5% year-over-year organically compared to the low single-digit average we experienced in fiscal 2017. Underlying order strength was broad-based across the three regions as well as all domains, including installation and service. Brian will provide more color by segment in just a few minutes. Turning now to Slide 8, let me recap the results for the quarter. Sales of $7.4 billion increased 5% on a reported basis in the quarter and 3% organically led by strong performance across our building platform. As expected, adjusted EBIT of $748 million declined 1% as the impact from the Scott Safety divestiture and anticipated headwinds from lower gross margins and incremental investments more than offset cost synergy and productivity realization. EBIT margins declined 60 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or 30 basis points excluding the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, FX and lead. Despite the anticipated margin pressure in the quarter, we were able to deliver modest earnings growth of 2% year-over-year to $0.54. Adjusted free cash was an outflow of roughly $300 million, which is typical of our first quarter and in line with our expectations. Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 9, you can see synergy and productivity savings adding $0.05 to the prior year. Volume and mix added an additional $0.05 driven by solid growth across buildings and a mixed benefit in Power Solutions. The cumulative benefit of synergies and volume mix was mostly offset by expected gross margin pressure and incremental investments we discussed on our last call. Overall, this resulted in $0.54 in adjusted EPS for the quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments. Brian Stief : Thanks, George and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 10, we provided the breakdown of our buildings business, which is the same pie chart that we provided you last quarter when we thought this would be a useful reference point for you as we talk through our segment results. So, let\u2019s move to Slide 11 and get into the details with a look at the performance of buildings on a consolidated basis. And I would just say as you will see as I go through the results here the Q1 headwinds, we talked about on our Q4 call came through pretty much as we expected and we see good momentum building as we move into Q2. Total building sales in the quarter of $5.3 billion increased 2% year-over-year and 4% organically with products growth in mid single-digits and field growth in the low single-digit range. Buildings consolidated EBITDA of $559 million declined 3%, but keep in mind the prior year included the results of Scott Safety. Buildings EBITDA margin decreased 60 basis points versus the prior year to 10.5%, but again, this includes a 40 basis point headwind from the Scott Safety divestiture. So, on a normalized basis, EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points as we expected. You can see in the margin waterfall that the combined benefit of 130 basis points from cost synergy and productivity save as well as volume leverage was more than offset by 150 basis points of headwind from conversion of lower margin backlog, price cost pressure and the incremental investments in product and sales capacity, all generally in line with the Q1 expectations we set for you last quarter. Looking to Q2 we do anticipate these headwinds will continue. However, these pressures should begin to abate sequentially as we move throughout the year. As George mentioned total field orders increased by very strong 5% including improved margins with backlog up 4% year-over-year to $8.1 billion. Now in order to provide more transparency on each of our reportable segments within buildings let\u2019s review each segment\u2019s individual results. So moving to Slide 12 Building Solutions North America, their sales grew 3% organically to $2 billion, led by high single-digit growth in our commercial HVAC and controls businesses and mid single-digit growth in our solutions businesses, fire and security field revenues declined modestly in the quarter. North America adjusted EBITA of $236 million was flat on a year-over-year basis and EBITA margin declined 50 basis points to 11.7% as an 80 basis point headwind from lower margin backlog conversion and a headwind from sales force additions more than offset the benefits of synergies and productivity and volume leverage. Orders in North America increased a solid 4%. During the quarter we saw strong order intake, led by our conventional HVAC business, integrated security and retail primarily driven by higher installation activity. Our solutions business which as you know was primarily performance contracting also had strong order growth, but this was against an easy prior year compare. Given the underlying trends in North America and our opportunity pipeline, we expect to see continued solid order growth in Q2. Backlog at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which was up 4%. So let\u2019s move to Slide 13 in EMEA/LA. Sales of $915 million increased 4% organically with solid performance in installing service across our three primary regions. Europe grew modestly in the quarter across fire and security and controls and in the Middle East we saw solid demand for commercial HVAC projects. Latin America experienced broad based strength across fire and security, HVAC and controls. Adjusted EBITA of $71 million grew 9% and EBITA margin expanded 40 basis points to 7.8%, primarily driven by cost synergies and productivity as well as modest volume leverage. Orders in EMEA/LA increased to strong 6%, led by growth in Continental Europe and the Middle East with backlog increasing 1% to $1.4 billion. Moving to APAC on Slide 14, sales of $597 million in the quarter increased 2% organically, primarily due to higher service activity versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITA of $74 million increased 3% and adjusted EBIT margin declined 10 basis points, but this includes a 30 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. The underlying margin increased to 20 basis points reflect savings from cost synergies and productivity as well some modest volume leverage. One item that I would like to point out is that pricing does remain very competitive in China and did negatively impact margins in the quarter. We do expect continued pricing pressure in our China field businesses as we look into Q2, but we are going to work to offset that headwind with cost actions. Asia-Pacific orders increased 9% driven by strong growth in China, Northeast Asia and India including a solid increase in service bookings with our backlog increasing 11% to $1.4 billion. Now let\u2019s turn to global products on Slide 15 and again sales increased a strong 6% organically to $1.8 billion with mid single-digit growth across HVAC and refrigeration equipment, building management and specialty products. In HVAC and refrigeration equipment, our applied HVAC business grew in the mid single-digit range, with strong shipment growth across all geographies for both large and small tonnage chillers. Another bright spot that I would like to point out is our VRF business in Asia, where we saw mid single-digit organic growth in the quarter. And the other thing I would also point out would be that our unconsolidated Hitachi joint ventures in China also saw strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Moving to resi and light commercial HVAC equipment, we saw low single-digit growth versus the tough compare in the prior year. Mid single-digit growth in building management and specialty products was driven primarily by growth in buildings controls and fire and security products led by increased demand for special hazards and fire detection equipment. Segment EBITA of $178 million declined 13%, but remember this reflects the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture. The reported segment EBITA margin declined 140 basis points, but again 110 basis points of that decline was attributable to Scott Safety. So, the underlying segment margin and products declined 30 basis points to 10% as the benefit of cost synergies and productivity and volume leverage was offset by about 100 basis points related to incremental product investments and 160 basis points related to price cost pressure. So, let\u2019s turn to Power Solutions on Slide 16. Our solution sales of $2.1 billion grew 1% organically as favorable price mix was offset by decline in unit volumes. Global battery shipments declined roughly 2% with declines in both OE and aftermarket. The 1% decline in OE was actually slightly less than declines in the overall auto production. Shipments to the aftermarket channel declined 2% on a tough prior year compare, the warmer weather we experienced during the quarter and a bit of pull forward of demand that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Once again, the China market was a highlight with units up 20%, with strong growth in both OE and aftermarket channels. Global shipments of start-stop batteries increased 20% with another quarter of strong growth in the Americas and China and we saw EMEA start-stop up 3%. Segment EBITA of $384 million declined 2% with margins declining 250 basis points to 18%, but this includes a 150 basis point impact of FX and the higher led prices. Power\u2019s underlying margin declined 100 basis points as favorable mix and productivity savings were more than offset by planned product investments and startup and launch costs and increased transportation costs and logistic costs were a bit higher than we expected in Q1. We are definitely seeing higher freight costs, particularly in the U.S. and Mexico as well as higher fuel costs and unfavorable lane mix due in part to the ongoing impact of the hurricanes. Turning to Slide 17 quickly corporate expense, we moved down 6% year-over-year to $101 million and we continue to target a range of $425 million to $440 million for the entire year. So, let\u2019s move to Slide 18 and free cash flow. Reported free cash was an outflow of just under $400 million in the quarter, which is in line with normal seasonal patterns and consistent with our plan on expectations. Excluding about $100 million of integration cost, adjusted free cash was an outflow of $300 million. As expected, we received $200 million tax refund in the quarter and this was offset by the $200 million in tax planning payments that we talked about in our fourth quarter call. As George mentioned, the focus on improving cash flow is our company\u2019s top priority and I am working closely with the newly established cash management office as well as our external advisors. In Q1, we have created a free cash flow roadmap and identified specific actions with clear accountability that will improve trade working capital and drive higher free cash flow conversion as we move through the year. For 2018, we are on track to deliver 80% plus adjusted free cash flow conversion excluding the net one-time items that we communicated to you last quarter. Turning the balance sheet on Slide 19, net debt of $11.9 billion is down $1.3 billion sequentially versus the end of fiscal \u201817. Of course the biggest driver of this decline was the $1.9 billion pay down of the TSarl debt using the net cash proceeds from the Scott transaction. In addition we repaid nearly $500 million of debt in Q1. In early December given the positive rate environment we issued 750 million in euro debt with an effective interest rate of essentially 0% for a term of 3 years. We use these proceeds to fund recent maturities as well as the term-outs in commercial paper. In the quarter we also purchased 3.6 million shares for a total of $150 million and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal \u201818 still assumes buybacks to offset dilution. Finally I wanted to spend a few minutes on U.S. tax reform on Slide 20 which I know is of interest to everyone. During the quarter we took a provisional net charge of $200 million which reflects our initial estimate of the impact of tax reform in fiscal \u201818. This includes a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $100 million related to the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities and we also took a one-time $300 million tax charge for a preliminary estimate of taxes on unremitted foreign earnings. As you all know the cash taxes on the foreign earnings component is very manageable for us and will be funded over an 8-year period. Given the significance and complexity of U.S. tax reform, we continue to analyze all aspects of the new legislation and may adjust this one-time charge as necessary over the course of the year. With respect to our effective tax rate there will be no change to our 14% rate this year. We do anticipate our fiscal \u201819 tax rate to increase to a range of 16% to 18% based upon the effective dates of certain provisions of the new legislation. As always we will continue to evaluate tax filing opportunities as we move forward. With that, let me turn it over to George. George Oliver : Thanks Brian. Before we open up the lines for questions, I wanted to reiterate that fiscal 2018 will be a year of change. We are intensely focused on driving execution to deliver our adjusted EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which represents a 6% to 10% increase in earnings per share versus fiscal year 2017. As I mentioned on our last call consistent with prior years, we expect our earnings per share to be stronger in the second half of the year due to the normal seasonality of our businesses, the pace and timing of investment as well as price cost and gross margin headwinds, all of which are heavier in the first half. Based on our current outlook, we would expect EPS to be weighted roughly 38% in the first half and 52% in the second half compared to our normal 40-60 split. As I think about the second half ramp, we are going to focus on controlling what we can control. Although I feel good about the underlying momentum we are seeing in the top line, organic growth begins to decelerate, you should expect that we will dial back the pace of investments. Cost synergies are on track and it will give us about $0.03 more earnings in the back half than in the first half. Price cost headwinds should begin to flatten out as some of our more recent price increases begin to take effect. We feel good about our price realization so far, but obviously Asia and China specifically are still tough. And we are taking additional productivity actions to help offset some of the areas we are seeing pressure. Our guide assumes price gets better, so that is one area we will have to watch. I am encouraged by the margin improvement we are seeing in backlog, the traction we are seeing on sales capacity and by the acceleration we are seeing in higher margin service and product sales. Ultimately, we are committed to delivering on profitability as we continue to manage our way through the integration and focus on reinvesting for growth. We have made the structural changes necessary to help ensure that the focus on execution is felt deep into the organization. With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Antonella Franzen : Good morning Deane. George Oliver : Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey, just speaking of the year of change, I would like the revamp slide deck, lots of good color and especially like the bridges that are included so I appreciate that. George Oliver : Thanks Deane. Deane Dray : So first question, George, I was hoping you could expand on the strategic focus to improve to serve margins \u2013 secure margins in buildings and I can\u2019t help, but think that this sounds a bit like project selectivity and maybe there are some parallels there, but what are the initiatives and then for the 5% increase in orders this quarter, what\u2019s that margin improvement over the implied margin? George Oliver : Sure. Let me start Deane by saying that when I took over I setup a sales leadership team that I ultimately cheer. And we have been meeting monthly making sure that we are executing on the commitments we have made to not only put the capacity in place from a sales force point standpoint, but to be able to execute on improved margins and ultimately deliver on the organic growth. We are making a tremendous amount of progress with this team and so not only have we been able to add 180 heads in the quarter that was in addition to the 50 that we added in the fourth quarter. But strategically now as we are now segmenting our markets, understanding how we are deploying that capacity to be able to go after where growth is occurring and making sure that from a pricing standpoint we are staying disciplined with the projects that we are taking on. And so that said, we have seen significant improvement not only in the pipeline generation, but how that\u2019s converting to orders and then how that\u2019s going now set us up to accelerate organic growth through the remainder of the year. When you look at the book margins in the quarter, we booked margins, so the margin in backlog now is up 30 basis points. And so you can imagine, we booked margins much better than that in the quarter that brought the average up about 30 basis points. So I am feeling really good working with the sales team and how we are going about deploying the resource that we are putting into place, the productivity we are getting from those resources, the book margins that we are securing, the service growth that we are accelerating and that all will then translate into not only improved growth in the second half, but also from a margin perspective much higher margins. Deane Dray : So is there bit of this project selectivity playbook that you are running? George Oliver : So Deane, the project selectivity is making sure that from a resource standpoint as we are understanding the markets and the opportunities that we have in the markets that we are deploying our resources where we can accelerate and we can ultimately get the returns for the resource that we are putting into these projects and that we are beginning to execute. So certainly from a discipline standpoint, we have implemented the discipline to make sure that as we are planning these projects, we are planning them in a way that positions us to be able to get the appropriate returns. And so whether it would be project selectivity or just pure discipline and how we deploy our resources and setting expectations for the type of margins that we expect by executing on these projects that\u2019s ultimately what we are doing. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just as a follow-up question and this may just be competitive sniping with the second coming of ADT, but there has been some claims about taking share in light commercial and correct me if I am wrong, but non-competes all came off in 2014 and that really shouldn\u2019t be anything new going on here, but would be interested in your perspective? George Oliver : I would reinforce what you said Deane. Our security business is executing extremely well in North America. We are continuing to grow. We are continuing to execute on the margins and ultimately delivering on performance. And so as you said, the non-compete went away back in 2014. Certainly, we respect our competitors, but as what we are seeing now, we are continuing to execute on our business, continuing to grow and continuing to maintain and grow the margins. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Sprague : George, just back to thinking about how all those kind of plays out in margins. When you say margin is up and backlog up 30 basis points, that\u2019s up relative to what it I guess was last quarter, is it tracking up relative to what you are reporting here today and can you give us some context on that? George Oliver : Yes, absolutely Jeff. In the first quarter, when we look at \u2013 let me just go back and reframe what the problem was when we gave guidance back in November. We had when we looked at our North America backlog we have 75 basis points of pressure in about a $5 billion business. And so we had projected that there was going to be roughly about $40 million of pressure that was going to play out through the course of the year and we are going to have to offset that with productivity and other initiatives so that we would be positioned to deliver on the commitments we made. So, we have seen about $16 million of that pressure in the first quarter. And so the remainder of that will play out a little bit less in the second quarter and then less in the third and fourth quarter. And I would tell you with what we have been booking, we had an improvement of about 70 basis points, maybe a little bit better in the quarter. And so the work \u2013 the projects that are going into backlog as we project how they will play out the remainder of the year and beyond we will start to see improved gross margins. And so I am projecting here in the second quarter, our margins will be relatively flat in buildings with the work that we have done realizing that in addition to the backlog that\u2019s converting with the pressure, we also have price cost that we have experienced here in the first quarter, little bit more in the second quarter \u2013 little bit less in the second quarter and then we start to see it turned positive in the second half. So, the combined \u2013 those combined topics as we are now executing we are now seeing the margins flat and then you will start to see them improve in the second half. Jeff Sprague : And then thinking about the sales force growth and initiative, how long does that remain a headwind, how long does it take for lack of a better term for a new salesman to carry his weight so to speak and be accretive to the equation? George Oliver : Yes, what I would say Jeff, it varies depending on what business you are in and whether it be large installed project type business or whether it be service \u2013 transactional service business, but you could say that when we estimated the year, we said we are going to have about $15 million to $20 million of potential pressure for what I would say while we are adding the sales capacity, we would have less productivity per head with that new capacity. What I would tell you is that the way we are bringing them on board, we have been very process driven in training, getting them educated and trained so that they can hit the ground running. So, there is still going to be that pressure, but I have confidence with the folks that we have brought on here not only in the fourth quarter, first quarter, we are making really good progress in how we are deploying that capacity and making them productive through the course of the year. So, you can average it probably takes around 6 months \u2013 3 to 6 months depending on the type of business, but I am encouraged \u2013 I am extremely encouraged by the progress we are making and what we can expect here going forward. Jeff Sprague : And then just one last one for me, so you did do some share repo in the quarter, should we assume you are chipping away at repo or kind of given your leverage you are kind of on hold until the cash flow comes in later the year end or there is some asset sales or something else going on? Brian Stief : Yes, Jeff, this quarter $100 million that we did in the month of October and the thought is roughly $50 million a quarter for the remainder of the year, which is essentially offsetting option dilution. So, I don\u2019t think at this point in time we are looking at any incremental share repurchase above and beyond that. Jeff Sprague : Right, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from UBS. Your line is now open. Steven Winoker : Hey, thanks and good morning all. George Oliver : Hi Steve. Steven Winoker : Hey, just wonder on the cash side, I know you did referenced it in your prepared remarks, but a couple of things, one, when did the conversion addition to comp start to really hit the ground for management sales force etcetera? And then secondly we are not the sales force, sorry about the broader teams and then secondly maybe just talk about that cash management offers and I know this is a seasonally normal cash outflow, but maybe get into sort of the biggest drivers of that and that we might expect to see the improvement in over the next year? George Oliver : Steve, I will take the first part of the question and then I will turn it over to Brian on the cash management office. Relative to the incentives as we went through the succession with myself becoming Chairman and CEO, certainly there was a lot of focus on incentive compensation here, our executive compensation within the company. And as we are putting the plan together for 2018 that was certainly something was front and center with our \u2013 with our Board. And so we work through that very quickly, so that when we launched our incentives with our executive team and then had similar components that are embedded in the executive leadership incentive that now are pushed out into sales incentives and operational incentives, that all was done at the beginning of the year. So we wanted to be positioned, so we could hit the ground running. The right metrics were in place, the right incentives were in place, so that we could make sure that we execute on the commitments we made for the year. Now Brian, you might want to talk a little bit more about the cash management office. Brian Stief : Yes. And we set up during the quarter that the cash management office, which is really a combination of roughly 8 to 10 people internally and then we have got an outside advisor that\u2019s working with us on this effort. I would just comment that we took one of our top finance people, the CFO of our buildings business and have put him in charge of the cash management office, which is I think reflective of the importance that we are placing on making sure that we deliver on the free cash flow conversion commitments we have got. As far as Q1 and why Q1 tends to be a bit of a cash outflow quarter for us I think I would focus on a couple of things. First of all, as it relates to the fourth quarter, there is a huge push in Q4 and that tends to be our best cash flow quarter. And so there is a little bit of I would say pull forward maybe in Q4 from Q1. Secondly, I would say our lowest income quarter tends to generally be the first or second quarter as well. And then there is some timing of working capital that I put in the equation as well and then we do pay our bonuses out and the first quarter of each year as well. So those are probably some of the items that really drive some of the timing Steve. But I think it tends to be an outflow in Q1 and inflow in Q2 and then Q3 and Q4 tend to be our strongest quarters. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then George, I see all the start-stop growth that you are mentioning in power, can you maybe comment on the progress of those factor investments in AGM, how are \u2013 where we are in the ramp on those. And then I guess just one last one maybe Brian also I understand that tax \u2013 you are going through portfolio review together, but any of the tax legislation changes with regard to asset sales 338 H10 elections changed the view of tax leakage across the portfolio, does it give you more options? George Oliver : Yes. So let me \u2013 starting with the AGM, like we said we are up about 20% year-on-year and that\u2019s really of a function of very strong penetration in Europe and that continues. And we have \u2013 we are kind of in line with the market. We are picking up a little bit of share. And then if you look at where the investments are being made it\u2019s mainly in China as well as North America. So we are executing well on putting that investment in place and that\u2019s what\u2019s contributing to the very strong growth that we are getting in China being up, I think it\u2019s up over about 50 \u2013 China was up almost 50% or there abouts and continue to see good progress in North America. And so that is going to be when you look at the mix that\u2019s going to be extremely important for us to continue to execute on those investments and in the volumes from those investments. Brian Stief : Yes. And as far as the tax rate impact I mean clearly to the extent that any business that we would decide to divest of from a non-core standpoint to the extent of the head U.S. operations of significance, those tax rate reductions certainly would play into that. Steven Winoker : Thank you. Antonella Franzen : Thanks. George Oliver : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMC. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : Hi guys, good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Brian Stief : Hi Steve. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : So I just wanted to clear, what is the target for your incentive for this year in cash, I think the guide is 80% plus and then $1.3 billion of or up to $1.3 billion of CapEx, I didn\u2019t see kind of an explicit rehalf of that just want to make sure that we were counting for any kind of tweaks there and is it based on conversion or absolute free cash flow? Brian Stief : It\u2019s the adjusted free cash flow conversion is at 80% plus as we have talked about previously then there is no adjustments above and beyond that we have communicated already that are necessary really for us to talk about here. So the 80% plus is our target. Steve Tusa : Okay. And the CapEx guide? Brian Stief : CapEx $1.3 for the year, there is a little timing in the quarter, but still $1.3 for the year Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just following up on I think it was Dean\u2019s question on the security side. I mean you said that your security business is holding up in North America, I think the field business fire and surety field was a modest decline. Does that mean kind of fire was down and security is growing maybe you could just give us some idea of how kind of that core business did, the security business did in the quarter from a revenue perspective? Brian Stief : Yes. So, in North America, where we have had a GAAP with our capacity has been fire. And so as we talked about last year having some shortfall of putting the sales capacity in place, a lot of that was in the fire space. That has become a roll forward and why we are seeing. It\u2019s really just a temporary decline within that business. We have been adding capacity both in sales as well as technicians, because the market is very attractive and we are making progress. And so it\u2019s more \u2013 I would say, it\u2019s more of a temporary situation because of the way that we are short on how we are staffing the fire business, but that\u2019s going to \u2013 that will continue to improve now with the work that we have done in the capacity that we are putting in place. The part of the security business I think overall was modest, I mean, year-on-year they a good year first quarter last year and corrupt the low single-digits. Steve Tusa : This year, this security business? Brian Stief : Correct. Steve Tusa : And then one last question on commercial HVAC pricing asking all these guys all the guys\u2019 question, what are your assumptions embedded in for price this year for the business where it\u2019s relevant, I think it\u2019s probably mostly in the products business, yet a tough price cost spread of this quarter. What\u2019s your pricing assumption embedded for commercial HVAC? Brian Stief : Yes. So, if you look at our price cost pressure, we are in the first quarter, it was about $34 million and a lot of that certainly in HVAC. I am as we put our price increases it\u2019s our beginning of our second quarter, so the beginning of the calendar year. And I know there is a range from 5% to 7% type price increases that are being put into place. I think that that compares similarly with our competitors. Certainly, we are going to be very disciplined with how we execute on these price increases given the pressure that we have had here in the first quarter. Some of the actions have already taken place and so the price pressure, price cost will be better in the second quarter and then as we get into the third and fourth, we believe that we have a positive price cost. And so right now, it\u2019s really all about executing and staying disciplined with all those price increases are going into place, because we are seeing on the opposite side, we are seeing the commodity headwind and is coming through. Steve Tusa : Yes, I guess I have seen a lot of letters around residential price and I am sorry to prolong this, but I am just trying to get an idea of the magnitude in commercial markets a lot more opaque for everybody and Ingersoll made some positive comments on ability to get price, so it\u2019s carrier, but there is no number that have been around those. I guess are the magnitude of commercial HVAC price increases, I mean, is it low single-digits, is it mid singles hoping to capture low singles, is that TBD like I did just trying to get an idea of the magnitude that you guys are all kind of trying to put out there. Nobody seems to be giving like up are a really good answer? George Oliver : So Steve, I have been spending a lot of time in the field here over the last couple months and this is been front and center with many of our discussions and I would tell you is probably the range varies depending on market Brian talked about China being a little bit more difficult right now with some of the pricing but on average what I would say is, low to mid probably low to mid-single-digit still getting traction which is certainly part of our ability to be able to now normally improve the projects that we are putting in place and then ultimately however expanding on margin improvement of those projects. Steve Tusa : Great, color. Thanks a lot for the detail. Appreciate it. George Oliver : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning, guys. Brian Stief : Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Just going back to global products, the 6% organic revenue growth looks like the strong that it\u2019s been in a while, while you mentioned fire security VRS being highlights of the quarter, the former Tyco [indiscernible] business has been a drag in the business for a while, is that really the biggest change in the growth profile of the products business as we sit here today? George Oliver : What I would say is we have had strength is very broad based. And so as Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks we are seeing it across all of the platforms. So we break it down into HVAC equipment, we break into building manager, which is all of our electronic equipment and we break it into specialty, which is the for a suppression business. And when you look at across the board, it\u2019s broad base, anywhere it\u2019s all kind of around 6% about 5% to 6%, 7% across the board. And so what\u2019s happening here is you have to two \u2013 there is two key elements, where we have been investing heavily over the last 3 years. We have actually increased our technology new product developments. If you look at our run rate of investments they are up about $165 million on a run rate over the last 3 years. We are now seeing the products from those investments coming to the market. And so we are positioned to be able to gain share and continue to accelerate our positioning. And that in addition to some of the market recovery and so as we see the Middle East with oil and gas beginning to recover, we see industrial refrigeration we are up very strong double digit 20 plus percent in our industrial refrigeration business with orders and backlog extremely strong. And so what we have seen here is not only a significant recovery of fire and security products, but very broad based execution across every one of our platforms. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful, George. And I want to ask about power margin in the quarter, you identified transportation costs as a drag, which I am guessing really wasn\u2019t as much in your initial guidance, so maybe you can give us little more color on what do you expect going forward there and if that cost is higher, what you can do to sort of get closer to the flat margin guidance that you had given for the year? George Oliver : Yes. Overall when you look at the total, when you look at the total company we were down about 60 basis points in the first quarter and about 30 basis points of that was the divestiture of Scott Safety. Now if you break it down into the two segments, buildings it was right in line with the lower margin on backlog conversion, again we are down about 60 basis \u2013 it was about 60 basis points, 40 basis points of which was driven by the Scott Safety divestiture. And then with the additional price cost that we talked about in the quarter and then the acceleration of our sales force, the investments in sales force and the continued product investments is what ultimately contributed to that. So we got strong productivity and integration savings, plus the volume was a little more than offset from the price cost and the additional sales investments and continued product investments. So that\u2019s the building side. On power \u2013 the power margins right off the top you got 150 basis points from the impact of FX and lead. And so then when you look at the remaining 100 basis points, we got the volume leverage and mix on productivity was more than offset with the product investments \u2013 continued product investments as well as the increased transportation costs that Brian talked about, that post hurricane as well as with the overall pickup in the economy you can imagine transporting lead acid batteries, there is a cost of that. And as we are going through into our ramp up in the first quarter getting ready for the selling season certainly had higher demand. And so with that capacity is what created some of the increased cost that we saw in quarter. Brian Stief : So I think when you look at the power margins, as George said there is 100 basis points in the first quarter that transportation and logistics will probably continue with us into the second quarter. And I would think in terms of half what we saw in the first quarter. And then I think as we move throughout the year through either cost actions we are going to take or pricing actions we are going to take in the back half of the year, we will make effort to cover that. But there still will be some going into Q2. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Wojs : Hey everybody, good morning. I just had two quick follow-ups if you could, I guess first hit on the order growth in products, I am not sure if I saw them, I might have miss this some more, but if you will let me know what the order growth in the products business was in the quarter. And then secondly just on the cost side of the price cost what are you expecting or what are you putting into the back half of the year in terms of input costs around things like metals and refrigerants? George Oliver : Yes. So on the first one\u2026 Antonella Franzen : So let me take that one. In terms of the orders one of the things that we decided to do just to make sure that everybody is clear is when we are looking at forecasting our revenue going forward the orders are now focused on the field side of the business, because keep in mind that on the products side it tends to be more of a book and ship type business. There might be a little bit of variability from quarter-to-quarter and you may recall last quarter actually orders were a little higher than the revenue growth. And this quarter I would say that the orders were a little lower than the revenue growth, but think of products as more of a book and ship type business. George Oliver : And the second part as far as this price cost, we are monitoring all of our commodities and projecting what that \u2013 what each one of them will do and as we look at the mix of our commodities with the overall cost of goods that we have we are making sure that our pricing actions are not only in line, but ahead of that to make sure that if there are any additional pressures going forward we are going to be able to abate the overall margin pressure from that. Antonella Franzen : And the only thing I would to that in terms of price cost I know there is a lot of focus on that. We had about $0.03 in the first quarter that\u2019s expected to moderate maybe $0.02 in the second quarter. And keep in mind as we get into the second half of the year it will actually be a benefit for us. So particularly as you think about first half, second half that is another thing that flows into the second half of the year as the benefit. Tim Wojs : Great. Thanks. Good luck. Antonella Franzen : Thanks. George Oliver : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye : Thanks and good morning. Antonella Franzen : We are getting a lot of feedback on the line. George Oliver : Operator, you are going to have to\u2026 Operator : From Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Could you guys hear me? George Oliver : Yes. Joe Ritchie : Alright, that was interesting. Maybe just circling back to this price cost question for a second, I just want to make sure that I may have not heard the answer, but we talked about $34 million headwind in the first quarter, it seems like your guide is assuming that it gets better as the year progresses, what the implicit or explicit assumption on price cost for the outlook? George Oliver : So as we laid out the year and certainly this has been one of the headwinds we have been extremely focused on. We have started off knowing that the first quarter was going to be the most difficult which it was $34 million, mainly in global products and as well as some of the pricing in China that we talked about. But for most of the price increase going to affect this quarter and as we have started the second half we believe it will mitigate a lot of the pressure we had in the first quarter and the second not fully, so it will improve first quarter to second quarter. With the idea with all of the actions in place, we then in the second half we turned positive in price cost with the actions that are being taken. And so that\u2019s we are watching this very closely. We are making sure that we are staying disciplined in the market and that we are ultimately yielding what we need to yield to be positioned to be able to deliver on the commitments we made here through the year. Joe Ritchie : Got it, that\u2019s helpful George. I guess my following question in yield and thinking about those like lower margin projects I mean you talked about it a little bit last quarter that had been basically have been building for about the last 18 months fully recognizes that your backlog typically isn\u2019t that long cycle, I am just trying to understand like when we start getting through these lower margin projects will be begun by the second quarter or could they possibly bleed into the second half of your fiscal year as well? George Oliver : Yes. So our projects you can look at projects we turn \u2013 some of the quick term projects can be a few months. And then some large projects can go multi years, the average being somewhere 6 to 9, but probably 6 months to 12 months depending on whether it\u2019s fire security or HVAC. And so we knew the turn that we saw coming through in the first quarter that that was going to be the toughest. And as we said in North America, at the start of the year, we have 75 basis points of pressure that on a $5 billion plus backlog goes roughly about $40 million. About 40% of that turned in the first quarter. So, it was about $16 million. As far as we now project what\u2019s in backlog and how it\u2019s going to turn, that will be reduced in the second quarter and then minimal impact in the third and fourth quarter based on what\u2019s being put into the backlog. Just another note on that would just be to say that in line with the compensation discussion, a big change has been making sure that not only from a sales standpoint, but from an overall comp standpoint margins is part of the compensation now for our sales team and for our operating teams in the field. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Thanks, George. Operator : I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to George now for some closing comments. George Oliver : Alright. Thanks, again for joining our call this morning. As I hope you took away from our call today, we are building momentum and expect a very strong second half. So, I look forward to seeing many of you soon. Operator, that concludes our call. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now all disconnect.",

Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Welcome to the Johnson Controls second quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice-President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls second quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George Oliver and our Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we have included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.47 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.06 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to integration costs. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.53 per share compared to $0.50 in the prior year quarter. Now let me turn the call over to George. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I would like to begin this morning with a quick review of the strategic highlights in the quarter which will set the tone for this morning's call as well as what you should expect from us over the next couple of quarters. A consistent theme you will hear today is that we are building momentum across the organization. Starting on slide 3, as we have discussed over the past couple of quarters, we have been intently focused on reinvesting for growth, transforming the sales organization, driving synergy and productivity benefits, improving free cash flow conversion, and optimizing our portfolio. Based on the results of the second quarter, I'm even more confident that the steps we have taken and the investments we have made are beginning to pay off. We saw another quarter of strong traction with respect to increasing our sales capacity. In fact, by the end of the quarter, we have already achieved our target to add 400 salespeople net of attrition. Additionally, we are seeing better than expected productivity from our new sales ads which has contributed to increased sales orders. The resegmentation of the sales force along with our initiatives to improve pricing discipline have resulted in an improvement in margins on orders secured and backlog. For example, in the second quarter, margins on new orders booked in North America increased approximately 100 basis points year-over-year, which compares to the 70 basis point improvement we discussed last quarter. Based on the progress made to date and to better position us heading into fiscal 2019, we plan to continue to add sales capacity in select regions and businesses. Consistent with the first quarter, organic growth in our Global Products segment increased 6% year-over-year. The significant investments in capital we have deployed over the past several years into areas such as engineering, R&D, and distribution footprint continue to convert to higher Global Products sales growth, and we expect the momentum to continue as we launch new products and technology into the market. Building service growth increased 3% in the quarter. We made significant progress expanding our commercial capabilities and strengthening operations while increasing our field technician capacity. In Power Solutions, although we have experienced a softer than planned start to the year, I am encouraged by the progress our team has made securing new OE and aftermarket business. We will see the benefits of those wins beginning in the second half as top line growth accelerates to 5-plus percent. The underlying fundamentals within the Power Solutions business are extremely strong, which will help deliver solid volume leverage as growth accelerates. Another area we continue to see very good progress is on the synergies and productivity front. Year-over-year, we had an incremental $0.05 of savings in the quarter and $0.10 year to date, and that will increase in the second half. We continue to expect $250 million or $0.23 of incremental savings in fiscal 2018. In addition to the cost side, we continue to benefit from cross-selling wins. In the quarter, we were awarded a sizable project for our fire and controls products as well as the installation for a new mega-resort in Asia which will include multi-function and convention halls as well as two luxury hotels. This is just one example of the everyday joint efforts of our one team approach. We are also seeing some momentum building on cash conversion, as Brian will discuss a bit later in the call. We generated approximately $300 million in adjusted free cash flow during the first half of fiscal 2018, a significant improvement versus the prior year. Clearly there is more work ahead, but as I have committed to you over the past couple of quarters, improving cash conversion is one of our top priorities. Lastly, I wanted to comment on our ongoing strategic review of Power Solutions. Power Solutions is a strong franchise with very strong positions in proven advanced Battery technologies with long-term relationships with both OE and aftermarket customers around the globe. We continue to work closely with our external advisors, and we are making good progress. We are committed to positioning Power Solutions for long-term success and optimizing shareholder value. Let's turn to slide 4 for a quick look at the macro environment. The macroeconomic environment generally remained favorable across most of our key geographic regions, supported by rising global GDPs. North American non-residential construction markets are growing steadily, led by the institutional verticals. Global demand for our commercial HVAC & Controls products is strong, highlighted by continued order strength in Asia, the Middle East, and North America. The sustained rebound in oil prices continues to ease regional budgetary constraints across the Middle East, and is also driving increased demand for our fire protection and suppression products that serve the harsh and hazardous end markets globally. China remains one of the fastest growth regions. Non-residential construction starts in China remained flat overall with declines in commercial offset by double digit growth in institutional, infrastructure, and industrial verticals. In Power, lower auto production particularly in the U.S. and Europe has put pressure on industry unit shipments year to date. The moderate weather has weakened aftermarket demand. However, China continues to outpace the market and has been a source of growth in both channels. As we look to the back half, we expect production levels to stabilize, and we are encouraged by the pace of new business wins over the last six months. Overall, the underlying fundamentals within most of our key geographies remain supportive of continued order and revenue growth momentum throughout fiscal 2018. Turning over to slide 5, Buildings field orders accelerated again in the quarter, up 7% year on year organically with continued strong quoting activity. This compares to low single digit average growth in fiscal 2017 and 5% growth last quarter. Underlying order strength was broad-based across the three regions as well as all domains including installation and service. Our growth in backlog provides confidence in continued improvement in revenue growth. Turning now to slide 6, let me recap the results for the quarter. Sales of $7.5 billion increased 3% on a reported basis in the quarter and 1% organically led by products and service which, as I mentioned earlier, grew 6% and 3% respectively. Adjusted EBIT of $740 million grew 4% as the impact from the Scott Safety divestiture and anticipated headwind from lower gross margins and incremental investments were more than offset by cost synergy and productivity savings. The headwinds we anticipated played out pretty much as we expected. The conversion of our lower margin backlog in North America resulted in a $10 million headwind. Price/cost was expected to be a $20 million headwind. We actually came in better than expected, less than $10 million, resulting from strong realization on the announced price increases. Between incremental product and sales capacity investments, we planned to spend approximately $30 million in the quarter, and we came in closer to $40 million. Despite those margin pressures in the quarter, EBIT margins expanded 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or 30 basis points excluding the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, FX, and lead. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.53, up 6% over the prior year and in line with the framework we provided you last quarter. In addition, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $600 million. Turning to our EPS bridge on slide 7, you can see synergy and productivity savings adding $0.05 to the prior year. Volume and mix added an additional $0.02 driven by solid growth in Buildings and a mix benefit with higher growth in products and service. The cumulative benefit of synergies and volume mix was partially offset by expected gross margin pressure and incremental growth in sales investments. Net FX and other added $0.01. Overall, this resulted in $0.53 in adjusted EPS for the quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, George, and good morning. So starting on slide 8, let's take a look at the performance of Buildings on a consolidated basis. You can see sales in the quarter of $5.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year and 2% organically, with Products up 6% and Field down 1% where we saw solid growth in service more than offset by slower backlog conversion on project installations. On the Buildings top line, a 4% headwind from M&A, primarily related to the Q1 divestiture of Scott Safety, was fully offset by the benefit of FX in the quarter. Buildings consolidated EBITA of $630 million was flat year-over-year but up 3% excluding the net impact of the Scott Safety divestiture and FX. Buildings EBITA margin decreased 10 basis points versus prior year to 11.2%, but this includes a 40 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Scott Safety. On a normalized basis, the EBITA margin expanded a solid 30 basis points. As you can see in the margin waterfall, the combined 130 basis point benefit from cost synergy and productivity savings, volume, and mix was partially offset by 100 basis points from the expected Q2 headwinds related to conversion of lower margin backlog, price/cost pressure, and incremental product and sales capacity investments, all generally in line with the Q2 expectations we set for you last quarter. As George mentioned, organic field orders increased by a strong 7% year-over-year with backlog up 6% to $8.5 billion. Now let's review each segment within Buildings in more detail. Turning to slide 9, North America, sales of $2.1 billion grew 1% organically driven by low single digit growth in our commercial HVAC & Controls businesses and modest growth in our Fire & Security business. We did see our Solutions business down low single digits in the quarter. Overall service revenue grew 3% organically with installation revenue up modestly. North America adjusted EBITA of $244 million increased 7% year-over-year and EBITA margins expanded 60 basis points to 11.6%, but I would note that this includes a 50 basis point benefit due to a lost contract charge that we talked with you about in the prior-year quarter. Excluding that benefit, the underlying margin expanded 10 basis points as the benefits of synergies and productivity, volume, and mix were substantially offset by the 70 basis point headwind from the planned lower margin backlog conversion and our sales force investments. Orders in North America increased 4% organically, including improved margins on those orders, and we saw strong order intake in both our conventional HVAC install and service business as well as Fire & Security. Backlog of $5.3 billion increased 5% year-over-year. So let's move to slide 10, EMEA/LA. As expected, sales of $907 million declined 3% organically given the lower project backlog we had entering fiscal 2018 in Europe and the Middle East. Europe declined in the low single digits, driven primarily by lower installation revenue in Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC. However we did see double digit order growth in Q2, led by demand for Fire & Security and Industrial Refrigeration. In the Middle East, revenues declined mid-single digits driven by a decline in HVAC installation while in Latin America, revenues increased low single digits led by the strength in our subscriber business. Adjusted EBITA of $78 million declined 1% and EBITA margins declined 30 basis points to 8.6% as our productivity savings and cost synergies were more than offset by the volume deleverage. Orders in EMEA/LA increased a very strong 10%, led by growth in continental Europe and Latin America with backlog up to $1.7 billion. Moving to APAC, sales of $586 million declined 2% organically due to high single digit declines in installation activity, but this was versus a tough compare of a 12% increase last year. This was partially offset by high single digit growth in service. Adjusted EBITA of $71 million increased 6% with related margins expanding 20 basis points including a 40 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. The underlying margin increased 60 basis points, reflecting cost synergies and productivity save and favorable mix partially offset with costs associated with our ongoing sales force additions. Asia PAC orders also increased 10%, and I would just comment that it was up 5% excluding one unusually large order we secured in Q2. The 5% was driven by solid increases in service, Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC, and our backlog now is up 15% to $1.5 billion. So let's turn to slide 12 and go through Global Products. Their organic sales increased 6% to $2 billion with mid-single digit growth in Building Management and HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment and low teens growth in Specialty Products. Let me provide you with a bit more color on each of these businesses. In Building Management, we saw solid growth across the board in controls, fire detection, and security. In HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment, North American residential HVAC grew revenue in the high teens despite a tough compare in the prior year of plus 19%, very strong performance by our North America residential team. Global residential HVAC which includes sales through our consolidated Hitachi JVs with operations in Japan and Taiwan increased mid-single digits in the quarter. Light commercial HVAC was up low single digits against a tough compare in the prior-year quarter. Our VRF business in Asia saw low single digit organic growth in the quarter but we did see strong double digit growth in our unconsolidated Hitachi joint ventures in China. Industrial Refrigeration also had a very strong quarter with double digit growth while our applied HVAC distribution increased modestly as growth in North America and the Middle East was partially offset by a decline in EMEA/LA. Low teens growth in Specialty Products was driven primarily by increased demand for fire suppression in North America and APAC. Segment EBITA of $237 million declined 6%, reflecting the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, with related EBITA margins declining 100 basis points. However, this includes 120 basis point headwind related to Scott Safety. The underlying segment margin expanded 20 basis points to 11.6% as the benefits from cost synergies and productivity and volume leverage was more than offset by 110 basis points related to the planned product and channel investments and the 40 basis points of price/cost pressure we've talked to you about before. So let's move to slide 13, Power Solutions. Sales of $1.8 billion declined 2% organically as favorable price and technology mix was more than offset by a decline in unit shipments. Our global battery shipments declined 5% year-over-year with declines in both OE and aftermarket. The overall 2% decline in OE shipments is in line with lower global auto production in the quarter. Aftermarket shipments declined 6%, primarily due to Q2 weather impacts in the U.S. and Europe. We continue to outperform in the China market with units up mid-teens and continued strong growth in both OE and aftermarket. I would also note that in Q2, we did see global shipments of start-stop batteries increase 14% year-over-year with another strong growth quarter in the Americas and China and a modest increase in EMEA. Segment EBITA of $314 million increased 4% with related margins declining 90 basis points year-over-year to 17%, but again this includes a 60 basis point headwind from FX and lead. Powers underlying margin declined 30 basis points as favorable mix and productivity savings were more than offset by product investments, start-up and launch costs, and increased transportation and logistic costs, all planned for the quarter. As expected, we continue to see higher freight costs in Q2, while this headwind declined as we moved through the quarter, and we do not expect this headwind to be significant in the back half of the year. Let's move to slide 14. Corporate expense was down a strong 14% year-over-year to $110 million as we continue to see the benefits of synergy savings and productivity savings. For the full year, we continue to expect corporate expense in the range of $425 million to $440 million. Turning to slide 15 on free cash flow, we generated free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the quarter. Excluding $200 million of integration restructuring cash, adjusted free cash flow was a solid $600 million, primarily reflective of timing between the quarters in fiscal 2018. Free cash generated in the first half was essentially flat on a reported basis but $300 million on an adjusted basis. We are clearly beginning to see the early benefits of the cash management office and are on track to deliver the 80%-plus adjusted free cash flow conversion for the year. Moving to the balance sheet on slide 16, our balance sheet position continues to improve with net debt down another $100 million in the quarter to $11.8 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage of 2.5 times is now within our target range and our net debt-to-cap declined slightly to 36.2%. Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $50 million, in line with our normal pattern. For the first half, we have now repurchased 4.9 million shares for around $200 million and our outlook for the back half of fiscal 2018 assumes another $100 million of share repurchase as originally planned. I would just comment in summary here that from my perspective, it was a very solid quarter from an operational standpoint, and we've got clear momentum building in each of our businesses and across all of our key initiatives as we look to the second half of fiscal 2018. So with that, let me turn it back over to George. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I wanted to make a couple of comments on the impact of tariffs and what we are seeing related to price/cost. Starting with tariffs on slide 17, as you are aware, Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs were enacted in March of 2018. Our direct buy of steel and aluminum totals approximately $225 million on an annual basis. All steel purchases are sourced in-country and 70% of our aluminum needs are supplied in-country. As such, the direct impact related to steel and aluminum tariffs are nominal and will be fully offset. We are reviewing the proposed Section 301 tariffs. Given the fluid nature of the proposal, we continue to monitor developments and update our analysis. Included in the proposal are motors in various electronic components which would impact our Buildings businesses. We would not expect much of an impact at all in our Power Solutions business. As part of our ongoing assessment, we are simultaneously identifying mitigating actions to minimize any direct impact. Based on the analysis we have done so far related to our exposure in mitigating actions, we have already worked this down to a very manageable level. The more relevant impact from the recent tariff discussions has been on raw material inflation and our price/cost position. As I mentioned earlier, we entered the March quarter planning for a price/cost headwind of $20 million to $25 million based on the raw material inflation we were projecting at the time. Despite slightly higher material inflation during the quarter, we exited the second quarter with a price/cost headwind of less than $10 million with the outperformance driven primarily by achieving higher price realization. We have announced a couple rounds of price increases so far in fiscal 2018 across various product categories and end markets. For example, as many of you are aware, we proactively announced a 5% to 12% increase in North American based unitary and applied HVAC equipment to get in front of some of the recent material inflation. We have made good progress yielding price so far this year, which will continue over the course of the year, and we expect to be in a net positive price/cost position in the second half. As we roll forward our outlook on price/cost for the full year, factoring in continued inflationary headwinds and our expectations for price realization in the back half, we are currently tracking ahead of plan relative to our guidance for a $40 million headwind for the year. Translating that to a margin rate, $40 million would equate to roughly a 50 basis point headwind to Global Products margin and a 20 basis point headwind to the consolidated Buildings margin. Between the pricing actions we have road mapped in our plan and the incremental direct materials productivity, we have an opportunity to close the gap even further. Turning to slide 18, let me take a minute to highlight a few changes to our underlying assumptions as it relates to our full-year guidance. As I mentioned earlier, our operating performance is on track. First half results played out largely as anticipated, underlying fundamentals continued to improve and we are building momentum across the organization. We have a strong and growing backlog in Buildings, and the quality of the backlog continues to improve. The changes we have made to the sales and service organizations are helping to drive increased order pipelines, and service growth has returned to more normal levels. We are beginning to see more material returns on our investments in products with growth continuing to accelerate. And although commodity inflation is higher than we anticipated at the start of the fiscal year, we have strong pricing and productivity actions in place and we are in a position to drive positive price/cost variances in the back half. In Power, we have secured key new customer wins and order activity which should begin to flow through the back half. With all of this said, we are well positioned for the second half, and I am confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year commitments. We have slightly adjusted our revenue expectations for the year, factoring in additional FX and lead tailwinds, but continue to expect overall organic growth in the low single digit range for the year. No changes to our underlying assumptions within the consolidated Buildings segment. Given the sustained rise in lead versus our initial plan, we are updating our revenue and associated margin impact for Power. Despite the volume pressures in the first half, we are on track for low single digit organic growth for the year. Given the continued rise in lead prices year-over-year, we have adjusted our lead assumption for Power from $2100 per metric ton to the expected average for the year of $2445 per metric ton. As you know, lead is a pass-through cost. The increase in lead prices will increase our top line, but has minimal impact on our EBIT dollars and therefore no impact to adjusted earnings per share. However, this does put 70 basis points of incremental pressure on Power Solutions margin rate. Additionally, some of the headwinds we saw in Power in the first half related to transportation is an incremental 40 basis points. As Brian mentioned, we do not expect transportation costs in Power Solutions to have a significant impact on our second half performance. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Power Solutions top line to grow 5-plus percent organically in the second half which will lever very nicely. On a reported basis, we expect Power Solutions margin to be down 100 to 120 basis points year-over-year, again primarily related to the flow-through of increased lead prices. We are reaffirming our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 which represents a 6% to 10% increase year-over-year. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : And our first question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Maybe just a question firstly on the slide 24 with the first half/second half bridge items. So I just wanted to double-check that we're thinking about it roughly the right way. The gross margin and investment pressures in the first half were collectively about $0.13, I think, year-on-year. So do we assume that those shrink sort of drastically in the second half as a year-on-year headwind and then you get an extra sort of $0.04 or $0.05 each from currency and extra synergies? Is that the right way to get to that $0.13 tailwind? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so, Julian, I'll take that. When you look at our performance, we typically are 40%/60% split first half and second half. This year, we are a little bit more skewed to the second half, about 38% on the first half, 62% on the second half. And so as you look at \u2013 and as we planned the year, we knew we had a lot of headwinds in the first half, and those headwinds were the backlog conversion on gross margins coming through mainly in the first half and a little bit in the second half. We had the price/cost pressure of about $40 million, most of which was in the first half, we're going to turn positive in the second half. The sales force investments were weighted to the first half as we added significant capacity within our sales channels. And the product investments also were weighted to the first half. And then when you take into account the transportation headwind that we had in Power, and then net all of that with the productivity and synergies, when you look at that, we had headwind of about $0.02 in the first half. As you play out the year as we begin to accelerate our \u2013 we begin to convert backlog, we continue with strong product growth, we accelerate service and we start to pick up significant volume in our Power business, when you look at the overall benefit in the second half, it's about $0.13. And so the net impact of first half to second half is a delta of about $0.15. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. And then just within the free cash flow, as my follow-up, was there any particular color between the two segments in terms of that better free cash flow performance in Q2 or were the improvements in cash pretty even across Buildings as well as Power? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Think it was generally spread pretty evenly across the businesses. We did see a slight increase in inventory in Power Solutions as a result of some of the lower volumes we talked about. But they did a really nice job on the receivable front in Power Solutions and as well as the Buildings performance in receivables was strong as well. The reason that we've commented that this is really timing between the quarters is there is a little bit of pull-forward, I would say, on the collection of receivables, and we pulled forward a bit of our harmonization of our vendor payment terms in the Buildings business as well. And I would also say that when you look at the CapEx delta between first half, second half, there might be $50 million to $100 million worth of timing there as well. But we're still going to spend the $1.3 billion for the year. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Steven Winoker from UBS. Your line is open. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, all. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. So I just wanted to spend some more time on the cash question. Again, obviously, there's a lot of investor skepticism or has been around the ability of JCI to drive sustained cash flow conversion improvement. And while it's early days and you just addressed across segments, George, maybe talk about the cultural shift. And I'm not sure I \u2013 I understand the CapEx dynamic that you talked about, but I don't see why you wouldn't be able, even if there was a little bit of timing here, why you wouldn't be able to sort of sustain into 2019 some of the actions that are going on now given kind of the major improvements in the organization on this front. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so I would start, Steve, that this, as I said in my prepared remarks, this is one of the top priorities for the company, and this topic comes up in every meeting that we have and is front-and-center as far as a deliverable for all of our teams across the businesses. And so what I would say is we're making \u2013 and we've put the accountability of the cash, we've reinforced that with all of our incentives across the business. So we definitely are going through a cultural change. This is front-and-center. And no matter what element of cash, I can tell you that wherever I go across the globe, whether it be sales leaders making sure that they're enabling and helping to collect on the receivables, whether we're looking at entitlements of inventory and pushing out production and balancing production more with our sales demand, whether it's our sourcing teams that are matching our payables in line with our contract terms, we've made significant progress. And so I would tell you that every step of the way, we've got full engagement. We've got the accountabilities in place. We've got the incentives reinforcing that. And I would tell you we are making really good progress. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. George, that's helpful. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : And, Steve, on CapEx, if you look at the first six months of the year, our CapEx was about $500 million, and our guide for the year is $1.3 billion. And so I would just tell you that there's still going to be spend closer to the $1.3 billion level for the full year, but there probably has been a bit of a delay on a few projects that have moved from what were planned to be in the first half of the year to the back half of the year. But the guide is still $1.3 billion. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned last quarter, I think you had about 30 basis points in backlog margin expansion due to some of the initiatives. Where are you now? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, we're making good progress, Steve. As I said last quarter, we had booked margins about 70 basis points better. This was a big focus in North America. That's where the pressure was coming into the year. We had roughly $40 million of pressure, which was about 75 basis points on a backlog in North America that was about $5.2 billion. And so with that performance in the first quarter, we had increased the margin and backlog about 30 basis points. This quarter in Q2, we were able to book margins about 100-plus basis points, and that brought up the margin in backlog about 40 basis points. And so that gives us a lot of confidence that, as we now project the turn of these orders in the margin, we're going to start to see a pickup in the margin rate on a go-forward basis. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. That's helpful. I'll go back in queue. Thanks. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. How are you? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hi, Steve. Good. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I think you mentioned the applied business on revenue was kind of low-single digits, I guess, in North America in the quarter. What were the orders for your applied business in North America? Just roughly year-over-year? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so orders, when you look at our \u2013 we track our products, our applied products as well as the revenues that are achieved in our channels across the globe. And orders were up about 5%, mid-single digits roughly across the base. We are seeing, if you look at the overall applied HVAC equipment revenue globally, we're actually up about 2%, and that includes all of our revenues achieved with the applied technology and conversion of that into projects. And what's very encouraging, as you all know that we've launched our new chiller, and when you look at the chiller orders coming through in the second quarter, we're seeing very strong demand. And so that's across all of the \u2013 most of the regions. We're seeing very strong demand and I'm projecting that that's going to continue with the success that we've seen to date. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And as far as pricing in commercial, I mean, obviously, all you guys are doing a good job of banking on offsetting this raw material headwind in the second half. I would assume that means commercial pricing is holding up reasonably well? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Absolutely. Absolutely. You saw the price increases we've taken. I can tell you we have a regular rhythm of not only with the increases that have been made, making sure that we're getting the full yield on those increases. And what I would tell you is that we're progressing very well. And that gives me confidence that we're going, from a price/cost standpoint as we get through the second half, we're going to have positive price/cost in the second half. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. One last one. Seasonality on the rest of the year, should we assume that 3Q and 4Q are normal seasonally from an EPS perspective? Or is there anything that's slipping in and out of either quarter to make that performance unusual? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : No. Except for some of the headwinds and tailwinds that we discussed earlier in the call, what I would say is that we have normal seasonality with volumes coming through. We are seeing good progress, as I said, with products. I'm very encouraged by the new product launches and the technology we're bringing into the market. The 6% was strong. And a note on products, we actually had a 9% increase in Fire & Security products within the quarter. And so the investments that are being made are paying out. The service we brought within the field businesses, the importance of service and the ability to be able to create more value for our customers, at the same time being able to really drive mix. And that 3% service growth we're looking to continue to expand that as we go through the second half. And then we begin to see the turn on our installation base, and so that's where we've been a little bit behind where I'd like to be to date. But with the backlog that's been built, we're up 6% and the margins in backlog are better. That's going to start to come through. And then in Power, we'll see the normal pick up here on the volumes in the third and fourth quarter and a lot of that is in anticipation for the next season here with replacement batteries and the like. And so I am encouraged that when you look at the year-on-year, we're going to continue to see momentum, and we'll be well positioned to deliver on the commitments. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Steve, just the one thing I would add in terms of as you're modeling out Q3 and Q4, keep in mind that Q3 is the seasonal high for Hitachi so we typically have a higher non-controlling interest number in the third quarter. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good day, everyone. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hi, Jeff. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey George, just back to the idea of backlog margins. What has the experience been recently on execution of backlog, right? These are booked margins, but you've got a lot of new people and new organizations executing on projects. Has the actual experience versus booked expectation been playing pretty much as you've expected? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Absolutely, Jeff. What I would say is that we always \u2013 when we book, we always do better than what we book through execution. We've been very much focused, especially with some of the headwinds in what we're doing from a productivity standpoint, to be able to continue to bring down the cost of the conversion of the project. And so I'm encouraged. This is something we're going pretty deep into to make sure that as we're projecting the cost of these projects with the inflationary pressure that we have seen, that we've got that grounded and then we're taking other actions whether it be through sourcing or other execution that we can not only meet the margins but continue to execute better through execution. So I'm encouraged that that trend is continuing. Like I said, we went into the year, we had some pressure, but as we're now remixing the backlog and beginning to convert, we're now starting to see the pickup in the margin rate. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I was also wondering, the last couple years we've seen kind of an elongated disconnect between orders and actual sales conversion. Do you see that normalizing in the next several quarters? Or is there something in the nature of the business, bigger projects? Or how should we think about order growth or backlog growth converting to sales growth the next few quarters, let's say? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so what I would tell you is that as we looked at the backlog, there were \u2013 last year there were some larger orders that were longer cycle projects that ultimately has created the pressure as we get into 2018. What I would tell you is that through the sales excellence that we have driven across the businesses, we're now segmenting our sales team with the proper incentives. So we're getting the full mix of the overall projects. And so you have transactional projects, you've got long term, you've got upgrades, you've got longer-term developments. And what I would tell you is that through that process with the sales excellence that we've been driving, we're getting much better line of sight to the mix of projects that we're putting into backlog. And so, therefore, you can then project on a go-forward basis how that backlog is going to convert. So I would tell you that on a go-forward basis, those two lines over a cycle will start to converge. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just finally from me, you said the strategic review you're making progress. Obviously it hasn't come to conclusion or you'd have an announcement, but how do you define progress? Does that mean you're seeing avenues to do something more tax efficient? Or you're seeing more combination options than you originally conceived? What if anything does that really indicate? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, I would start, Jeff, by saying we are working closely with advisors, with our board. When we launch this, we're going to look at all opportunities and ultimately how do we position the business not only long-term but also to create the most amount of shareholder value. When we announced this, we said we would provide an update when the process was finalized. We're right in the middle of the process, working through it, and so there's not much more I can add at this point. But, certainly, as we reach a decision and complete the analysis, we'd be positioned to be able to update and communicate to all of you. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Jeff. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey. I was curious if you could expand upon the field order growth that you saw, the plus 7%, and just thinking about how much was the lift due to better pricing, if you will. Because when I look at the next couple quarters, you have fairly easy comparisons in terms of field order growth. I'm just wondering like what the pricing actions will net us just before even considering volume? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so when you look at what we're going to be yielding here in the second half, we have been ramping up pricing not only in how we're pricing projects, but also when we talk price/cost. It's mainly focusing on our product businesses. What I would say is in the second half, we're going to be continuing to get a lift here in margins. So on the sales orders secured, we're probably picking up 1% to 2% as far as real pricing within that backlog. And then, as we're converting, we're executing better on that and achieving better margins. And so there could be \u2013 on the overall pricing side, could be 1% or 2% impact to the overall booked orders. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Brian, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity on what we should anticipate for free cash flow in Q3 versus Q4. And then, if you can update us on the recovery timing of the tax payment related to Adient this year and next. I remember some of it moved into next year, but if you could quantify it? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : So the Adient tax payment, we received $200 million, as you know, Gautam, in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We expect the remaining portion, around $700 million, to be received either in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 or the first quarter of fiscal 2020. There really isn't an update on the timing yet. It really depends on how it goes through committee and what that process will entail. Given the size of the refund, it's one that could move from one quarter to the other, but we're confident that we're going to get that money by the end of calendar 2019. As it relates to cash flow, first half, second half, we had $300 million outflow Q1, $600 million cash inflow Q2. I would expect Q3 cash flow to be within the range of Q2 cash flow. And then, we would finish it out in Q4, which is always our strongest cash quarter to get to the 80%-plus free cash flow conversion. Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Good luck, guys. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Hey. Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): George, if we think about the Building business over the last couple years, it's obviously had some noise, whether it be the salesforce integration or the lower margin project backlog. But it does seem like in the last couple of quarters, the noise level in the business has started to die down. So can you talk about your confidence level that JCI really is out of the woods in terms of bigger noise in Buildings quarters, and now you have good visibility into what's really going on in the overall business? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, as I've discussed here in my prepared remarks, as well as through the Q&A, we have made significant progress in getting to fundamentals of the businesses that are totally visible across the organization and ultimately is what we're focused on in driving improvement. And that starts right from the sales process and making sure that we're now all on one common system, tracking pipeline development, conversion of pipeline to orders, understanding the segmentation of those orders, large projects, small projects, service, service contracts, transactional service. And so we now have line-of-sight to how we're now taking our strategic initiatives. We're bringing those to market, and we're ultimately now converting those from a sales standpoint. From an operations standpoint, as far as margin structure, we know exactly what's coming through our margin structure. And as a result, we've been very proactive in taking pricing actions to be able to offset the inflationary pressures we've had. And normally, we get very strong productivity which, in addition to that, contributes to increased margins year-on-year. And then the last is the conversion of cash, as Brian talked about, getting the fundamentals across the businesses, line-of-sight with the accountability throughout every functional organization and then across each of the businesses so that we know exactly how we ultimately deliver on the cash. And so what I would tell you is that the visibility, the accountability, the incentives that are in place all position us to be able to deliver on those fundamentals and deliver on the commitments we've made. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for that, George. And can you quantify how much of the new \u2013 you mentioned original equipment and aftermarket ones in Power Solutions that will help you inflect to grow 5% in the second half of the year. As you guys know, it's been a more difficult business to forecast lately. So what's the visibility there? How much do these new wins help you in the second half of the year? And how exposed is the business going to be to weather, as it always is? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so we're certainly we're positioned well across the globe with very strong positions. We have a pretty good line-of-sight to what our customers are doing, not only in the OE base, but also as we serve the aftermarket. And so we work very closely in understanding what they're projecting on point of sale and what do we need to do to make sure that they've got the inventory to be able to achieve their sales plans. And then as we go through that planning, we then make sure as we're executing, we balance that with the ability to pivot if we need to, depending on how volumes come through. And so what I would tell you is through the early phase here, we've done that with all of our customers, both OE as well as aftermarket, and all of that suggests that, given what I would tell you, is that with the softer demand that we saw in this last cycle, some of that converts to higher demand depending on how the weather plays out in the next cycle. And so making sure that we are positioned to capitalize on that opportunity and then working closely with each of our customers to make sure that they have the right supply, the right service to ultimately fulfill the sales for them. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : And, Andy, it's Antonella. The only thing that I would add is keep in mind that OE production decline started last year in Q3. So as we get into our second half of this fiscal year, that starts to stabilize as well. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And it's fair to say this is an unusually high amount of wins that you got in the quarter? That's kind of why you called it out? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : That's correct. Absolutely. Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Could we just stay on the Power Solutions topic? And George, could you just put a finer point on some of the nuances when we talk about weather? How precise can you get? Is this on a degree-day basis versus normal weather patterns? Just what is that visibility and how does that translate? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, so there's some correlation there, and what we've been working to do is try to make it a little bit tighter. But what I would tell you is the way the battery fails is you have a severe heat, and then you have severe cold. And a normal cycle in a winter, you typically have two or three cycles of severe cold. And therefore, that's what makes batteries fail. This year, when you look at what happened in the two big bases that we have within Europe and North America, we didn't have those cycles. And so therefore it did impact our volumes in those two key markets. And so what I would tell you, Deane, that we always hope to have a nice hot spell in the summer and then two or three cold spells in the winter, and that typically is what correlates to the failure of batteries and ultimately our demand. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Well, it looks like New York is about to get its first hot spell this week. So that may bode well. And then just a follow-up. On the point regarding the better margins in backlog, I'm curious to hear what internally are you doing in terms of like the traffic cop on what types of projects will you pass on? Is it an iterative process on pricing, or it's just, hey, this business does not have enough follow-through in a potential aftermarket? But just the kind of decision-making on what projects you'll reject. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, Deane, what I would say is our goal is not to reject projects, our goal is to make sure that we're positioned with the right solution that leverages our technology and capabilities so that we can create the value that the customer is expecting, and then we ultimately get paid for that value. So there's different levels of solutions that we bring into the market leveraging our technology. And so what I would tell you is that there's a lot more discipline upfront now relative to how we serve the customer and ultimately develop the projects that ultimately will fulfill their need. And so with that, there's incentives from a sales incentive standpoint that's incentivizing our sales teams to get that margin upfront, right, and that ties to making sure that we've got the right solution, the right product and that ultimately we book it at that rate. And so it isn't necessarily walking away from volume, it's making sure that we've got the right proposal, that we're pricing that proposal and then ultimately converting that to higher secured margins. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. Thank you. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : All right. Operator, as we're at the top of the hour, I'm going to pass it over to George for some closing comments. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : All right. Thanks again, everyone, for joining our call this morning. As I said, we are building momentum. I do expect a very strong second half earnings and cash flow, and I'll certainly look forward to seeing many of you soon. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.",

Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Welcome to Johnson Controls Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls third quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call we will be providing certain forward looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.78 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.03 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to integration costs. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.81 per share compared to $0.71 in the prior year quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to George. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let's get started with a high level review of the strategic highlights in the quarter starting on slide 3. Last quarter we began laying a foundation based on the theme of building momentum. As I think about the progress we have made in the third quarter, I would say the momentum continues on each of our key initiatives. Starting with sales capacity, based on our success in attracting high performing talent during the first half, we continue to accelerate the pace of sales adds in the third quarter, hiring an incremental 375 sales professionals. This brings our year-to-date net additions to the Building direct channel and indirect sales force to about 775 globally versus our previous expectation of 500 to 600 net adds. We expect to end the year with 900 net adds. By leveraging the Johnson Controls commercial excellence programs throughout the organization, the hallmarks of which are an appropriately designed attractive incentive compensation structure, proper onboarding and training models as well as ongoing sales management and coaching, we have seen a significant increase in the productivity of our new and existing sales teams. That, in turn, improves the customer experience and drives order growth as evidenced by the continued acceleration in Buildings orders and organic revenue growth. Our initiatives surrounding our sales force resegmentation and improved pricing discipline continue to bear fruit with further improvement in margins on orders secured in backlog. For example, margins on new orders in North America increased 110 basis points year-over-year, which compares to the 70 basis point increase we saw in Q1 and 100 basis point increase we saw in Q2. Despite a more difficult prior year comparison, our Global Products team continued to accelerate top line growth, reflecting outstanding execution and converting on the substantial investments made in capital deployed over the past several years into engineering, R&D and expanding our distribution footprint. I should also call attention to the aggressive pricing actions we have taken, particularly over the last six months to combat rising raw material and other input costs. We have achieved above average levels of price realization relative to our announced price increases year-to-date, which has enabled us to move into a modest positive price/cost position earlier than expected. Based on the timing of price recovery and assuming recent levels of inflation, we are well positioned into the fourth quarter. Buildings service revenue growth accelerated once again in the third quarter to 5% year-over-year compared to the 3% growth we experienced in the first half. I'm extremely pleased with our execution in our service businesses across the globe, particularly given the intense focus we have had on expanding our commercial capabilities and strengthening operations, while increasing our service technician capacity. At Power Solutions, we had strong organic performance in both the OE and aftermarket channels, benefiting partly from the new platform wins we discussed with you last quarter. The success in ramping shipments on the new wins can be directly attributed to the Power team's solid execution and commitment to serving our customers. On free cash flow, we continued to drive operational improvements and I am very pleased with our progress in establishing sound fundamental processes and metrics across the organization. Cost synergies and productivity savings remain on track. At this point I would say these initiatives are well-weaved into the fabric of Johnson Controls. We delivered nearly $70 million or $0.06 of incremental savings in the quarter, as expected. We are on track to deliver our $250 million savings target in fiscal 2018. Lastly, let me provide you an update on the strategic review of our Power Solutions business. As we previously discussed, we are analyzing multiple options, including a spin or a sale versus retaining it as part of our portfolio. We are analyzing the viability and benefits of a tax-efficient spin of the business and, in parallel, have been discussing the potential sale of the business with interested parties. Management, along with the Board of Directors, have decided to continue to explore these alternatives and expect to conclude the review by the release of our fourth quarter earnings. We will communicate more details when a final determination has been made. Let's turn to slide 4 for a quick look at the macro environment. Despite recent FX volatility, inflationary pressures and trade policy concerns, the macroeconomic environment generally remains supportive of continued growth across most of our key geographic regions. By most accounts, U.S. economic fundamentals continue to strengthen; spending in non-residential construction markets remains favorable. Despite recent choppiness in a few of our macro indicators, the forward looking components are still pointing to modest growth over the next 12 months and we are seeing that in our orders, led by strength in the institutional verticals. Trends in Europe remain somewhat mixed with lower growth for construction markets in larger developed economies and higher growth in the Eastern European economies, where those countries continue to invest at rates above their GDP. The sustained rebound in oil prices continues to support investments in the Middle East, and is also driving increased demand for our fire protection and suppression products that serve the harsh and hazardous end markets globally. China is an area we are monitoring closely, given the potential for trade disruptions with the U.S. that continue to escalate. Although China's economic growth has slowed somewhat, it remains one of the fastest growth regions and recently-announced government policies aimed at reviving growth may start to take shape over the next several months. China non-residential construction starts remain flat overall, with continued weakness in commercial verticals, offset by continued growth in the industrial and infrastructure verticals. In Power, global auto production is stabilizing, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and the recent platform wins position us well to gain share. The increasing electrification in vehicles, combined with a regulatory environment still pushing for stronger efficiency standards, are supportive of our core battery technologies. Changing demographics also remain favorable, as evidenced by the growth we are seeing in China, which continues to outpace the market and has been a source of growth in both channels. Overall, the underlying fundamentals within most of our key geographies remain supportive of continued order and revenue growth momentum. Turning over to slide 5, Buildings Field orders accelerated again in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year organically with continued strong quoting activity. This compares to low-single-digit average growth in fiscal 2017 and 6% average growth in the first half. Underlying order strength was most notable in our North America and EMEA/LA businesses across most of our core product domains, and including bookings for both installation and service. Our North America Fire business experienced its highest bookings quarter in over two years. Our growth in backlog provides confidence in continued improvement in revenue growth. Turning now to slide 6, let me recap the financial results for the quarter. Sales of $8.1 billion increased 6% on both a reported and organic basis, with 5% organic growth in Buildings and 10% in Power. Adjusted EBIT of approximately $1.1 billion grew 6% on a reported basis and 12% when adjusting for the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, foreign exchange and lead. Favorable volume mix and the benefit of cost synergy and productivity savings more than offset incremental organic investments back into our business. Between incremental product and sales capacity investments, we initially planned to spend approximately $35 million in the third quarter and we came in closer to $45 million, taking into account the significant number of sales adds I discussed earlier. Overall, EBIT margins expanded 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or 70 basis points excluding the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, FX and lead. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.81, up 14% over the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was just short of $650 million, which when added to our first half free cash flow, which was north of $300 million, brings us to $1 billion year-to-date. Turning to our EPS bridge on slide 7, as I mentioned earlier, synergy and productivity savings added $0.06 to the prior year. Volume and mix contributed an additional $0.08, driven by solid growth in both Buildings and Power. The cumulative benefit of synergies and volume/mix was partially offset by incremental investments. Lastly, the combined benefit from lower tax and FX was offset by below-the-line items. Overall, this resulted in $0.81 adjusted EPS for the quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. So let's start on slide 8 and take a look at the performance of Buildings on a consolidated basis. Total Buildings sales in the quarter of $6.3 billion increased 5% organically with Products up 7% and Field up 4%, led by strong 5% growth in service across all geographies and a return to growth of 2% on project installations. A three percentage point headwind from M&A, primarily related to the Scott Safety divestiture, was partially offset by a 2% benefit of FX in the quarter. Buildings consolidated EBITA of $954 million grew a strong 10% organically with balanced growth across our Field and shorter cycle Products businesses. Buildings reported EBITA margin expanded 20 basis points versus the prior year to 15.2%, but this includes a 40 basis point headwind from the Scott Safety divestiture and a 10 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. On a normalized basis, the EBITA margin expanded a solid 70 basis points in the quarter. As you can see in the margin waterfall, the combined benefit of 130 basis points from synergy and productivity save, volume leverage and mix was partially offset by 60 basis points of planned headwinds from incremental product and sales capacity investments. As expected, gross margin pressures from the conversion of lower margin backlog and price costs were not significant in Q3. And in fact, as George mentioned, we ended the third quarter with a positive price cost variance. Field orders increased by 8% organically year-over-year with backlog, up 7%, now standing at $8.5 billion. Now, let's turn to each of the individual segments within Buildings and starting on page 9 with North America. Sales of $2.2 billion grew 5% organically with strong growth in our applied HVAC & Controls and Fire & Security platforms each growing mid-single digits. Our Solutions business, which represents less than 10% of North America's revenue, declined low single-digits in the quarter on a tough prior year compare. Service revenue North America grew mid-single digits organically led by increase in activity in both HVAC & Controls and Fire & Security, while project installation revenue also grew in the mid-single digit range led by strength in Fire & Security. North America adjusted EBITA of $318 million grew 10% year-over-year with EBITA margins expanding 60 basis points to 14.2%. We saw the benefit of volume leverage and favorable mix and synergies and productivity being partially offset by higher than planned investments in sales force capacity and the residual lower margin backlog conversion. Orders in North America increased 8% organically, another great quarter for our North American team as we saw strong bookings in both our conventional HVAC & Controls and Fire & Security businesses, including strength in project installation as well as service. Backlog of $5.4 billion increased 7% year-over-year. So let's move to slide 10, EMEA/LA. As expected, sales of $926 million were flat organically year-over-year as we started the fiscal year with lower project backlogs in both Europe and the Middle East. Europe declined in the low single-digits driven by lower project installation backlog in our Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC businesses; however, orders did increase in the mid-teens organically in Q3 led by strong demand in IR, fire suppression and security. In the Middle East, revenues grew low single-digits as low double-digit growth in service activity was substantially offset by continued softness in project installations. Latin America revenues increased mid-single-digits led by strength in our recurring security monitoring business and fire suppression. Adjusted EBITA of $98 million increased 10% and EBITA margins expanded 60 basis points to 10.6% including a 40 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. Underlying margins increased 100 basis points driven primarily by productivity and synergy save. Orders in EMEA/LA were up a strong 13% with solid growth across all regions and across both service and project installation, driven primarily by strength in IR and Fire & Security. Backlog in EMEA/LA ended at $1.6 billion up 6% organically. So let's turn to slide 11 and discuss APAC. Sales of $681 million grew 4% organically, largely driven by low double-digit service growth led primarily by China and Southeast Asia. Project installation revenue grew low single-digits driven by Fire & Security and IR. Adjusted EBITA of $97 million increased 15% over the prior-year with margins expanding 90 basis points, and this includes a 50 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. The underlying margin improvement of 140 basis points reflects the continued benefit of productivity and synergy save as well as favorable volume and mix, partially offset by investments in sales force. Asia Pacific orders did decline 1% in the quarter primarily due to a tough prior-year comparison of 9%, but also reflective of an increasingly competitive market dynamic in the region, especially in China. Backlog increased 9% to $1.5 billion. I would point out that, based upon what we see today, we expect continued competitive and margin pressures as we move through Q4 and into fiscal 2019. Turning to Global Products on slide 12, sales increased a strong 7% organically to $2.4 billion, led by high-single-digit growth in both Building Management Systems and HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment and mid-single-digit growth in Specialty Products. In BMS, we saw strong growth across our controls, fire detection, and security businesses. In HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment, global residential HVAC, which does include sales through our consolidated Hitachi JVs, primarily in Japan and Taiwan, grew high-single-digits in the quarter. Our North America residential HVAC revenue grew in the low-double-digits despite a tough low-double-digit compare in the prior year. Favorable weather in the latter part of the quarter drove higher replacement demand, and we are seeing strong price realization in the channel. Based on continued favorable weather trends, we do expect strong North America residential market demand will continue in Q4. Global light commercial HVAC grew mid-single-digits in the quarter led by high-teens growth in North America on a relatively easy prior year compare, but this does reflect strong growth in our national accounts. Our VRF business saw high-single-digit growth in the quarter with strong double-digit growth in our unconsolidated Hitachi joint ventures in China, which continue to perform exceptionally well. IR also had a strong quarter with high-teens growth, and our applied HVAC equipment business grew high-single-digits led by solid growth in APAC and North America, partially offset by a decline in EMEA/LA. Mid-single-digit growth in Specialty Products was driven by increased demand for fire suppression with solid growth in EMEA/LA and APAC, partially offset by a modest decline in North America on a tough prior year compare. Segment EBITA of $441 million was up 11% excluding the impact of Scott Safety. The reported segment EBITA margin declined 30 basis point, but this includes a 90 basis point headwind related to Scott Safety. Underlying margins expanded 60 basis points to 18.2% as higher volume leverage and the benefits of cost synergy and productivity save was partially offset by 70 basis points of continued product and channel investment. As mentioned earlier, price cost inflected positive in the third quarter, but really didn't have a significant impact on the margin rates in Q3. So let's move to slide 13 in Power Solutions. Sales of $1.8 billion increased 10% organically, driven by higher unit shipments as well as favorable price and technology mix. Global battery shipments increased 6% year-over-year with both OE and aftermarket up 6%. The growth in OE shipments outpaced market growth as we began shipping units on several new business wins, which we expect to continue over the next several quarters. Aftermarket shipments increased 6% driven primarily by higher demand in Europe, reflecting a benefit of a modest pull forward in customer orders as lead prices began to rise toward the end of the third quarter. Growth in the China aftermarket channel was also strong. We continue to outperform in the China market with units up 30% in both OE and aftermarket as well as across the various technologies. Global shipments of start-stop batteries increased 30% year-over-year with strong growth in the Americas, China and EMEA/LA. Segment EBITA of $310 million increased 7% organically. EBITA margin declined 200 basis points to 16.9%, but this includes a 150-basis-point headwind from FX and lead. Power's underlying margin declined 50 basis points as the higher volume leverage, favorable mix and productivity save were more than offset by planned product investments, startup and launch costs and the continued headwinds from higher transportation and logistic costs. Freight costs do remain at an elevated level; and although, we made further progress in our pricing and productivity initiatives in Q3, we did not fully offset these costs. Looking to Q4, we expect continued margin pressure related to transportation costs in Power Solutions. So turning to slide 14, Corporate expense was down 16% year-on-year to $102 million as we continue to see the benefits of the synergy and productivity savings. For the full year, we now expect Corporate expense to be approximately $415 million, slightly below the low end of the range we previously provided. So turning to cash flow on slide 15, we generated free cash flow of roughly $450 million in the quarter. Excluding approximately $200 million of planned integration and restructuring cash as well as a planned non-recurring tax payment, Q3 adjusted free cash flow was approximately $650 million; two back-to-back quarters of very solid cash flow performance. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is now $1 billion, up $800 million over the prior year. We are very pleased with our Q3 progress and are on track to deliver our 80%-plus adjusted free cash flow conversion for the year, excluding the net one-time items we've previously discussed with you. It is clear that our cash management office now has traction across the enterprise and is making improvements on various trade working capital initiatives and aggressively managing our CapEx spend. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 16, our balance sheet position continues to improve with net debt down $150 million, sequentially, to $11.7 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage of 2.4 is well within our target range and our net debt to cap declined slightly to 36%. During the quarter, we purchased 1.6 million shares for approximately $60 million, in line with our normal pattern, and this brings our year-to-date to repurchasing 6.5 million shares for just over $250 million. Our outlook for Q4 assumes another $50 million of share repurchases, which will bring the full year to around $300 million, consistent with our original plan. On slide 17, let me touch on just a couple of other items. Our Q3 results do include a favorable impact from a lower effective tax rate. At the beginning of the year, we expected our fiscal 2018 rate to be 14%. Given additional tax planning specific to fiscal 2018, we now expect our annual tax rate to be 13%. This resulted in a $0.01 benefit in the quarter versus our planned rate of 14%. I would also point out that the benefit for Q1 and Q2 has been excluded from our Q3 results and reported as a special item only for this quarter. We do expect the tax rate for Q4 to also be 13% as well as the full year, which will result in a $0.03 benefit versus our previous guidance. Finally, I wanted to touch on a new revenue recognition Accounting Standard that will become effective for Johnson Controls in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The impact of this Standard on our Buildings business is not significant. For Power Solutions, although there is no material EBIT impact, the reporting classification of battery core returns changes and will now be included as an increase to sales versus a contra cost of sales item, thereby grossing up sales and impacting our EBITA margin rate by 200-plus basis points. Again, this will be effective for Johnson Controls beginning the first quarter of next year and we will provide disclosure on a quarterly basis regarding the revenue gross-up and the related EBITA margin rate impact. With that, let me turn the call back over to George. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the lines for questions, I wanted to provide a quick update on the tariffs and make a few comments regarding our full year outlook. Starting with slide 18, retaliatory tariffs related to Section 232 Steel and Aluminum were announced at the end of May. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, the direct impact related to steel and aluminum tariffs are nominal and will be fully offset. In terms of Section 301, the first phase of tariffs was enacted in early July. A second phase is currently under comment period. Given the evolving changes, we continue to monitor developments and update our analysis. Included in the tariffs are compressors, electronics, motors and valves, which impact our Buildings businesses. As I mentioned last quarter, we do not expect much of an impact at all in Power Solutions. As part of our ongoing assessment, we are simultaneously identifying mitigating actions to minimize any direct impact. We expect minimal impact in Q4. As we look further ahead, we are well-positioned given our existing global and regional supply chain and sourcing strategies. Additionally, we are actively managing price, both within the Supply Chain and externally. Based on the analysis we have done so far related to our exposure and mitigating actions, we have already worked this down to a very manageable level. We will continue to monitor developments. Turning to slide 19, let me take a minute to highlight a few changes to our underlying assumptions as it relates to our full year guidance. As I mentioned earlier, our operating performance is gaining momentum and we expect an incremental $0.06 benefit related to higher revenue growth. Given our traction with the incremental adds to the sales force, and the productivity we are gaining from our new and existing sales force, our overall investments will be about $0.03 higher than previously planned. Additionally, as Brian mentioned, transportation costs continue to rise, which drives an incremental $0.01 of pressure net of cost recovery. As you can see in the last column, there are various puts and takes between FX and below-the-line items which net a $0.01 benefit. This takes the midpoint of our previous range to $2.81. We are tightening our full year guidance range for diluted earnings per share before special items to $2.80 to $2.82. Again, I am pleased with the underlying momentum in our operations and the improvement in the fundamentals we have been able to achieve this year. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker, UBS Financial. Your line is now open. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Steve. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, so it's good to see the growth, but I want to focus on free cash flow, given I think, George, you said it's how you started most of your meetings. The step up that is implied in the fourth quarter to hit that 80%-plus number, I think it's about $1.1 billion, if my math is right, which is \u2013 sounds like the same as last year. But last year, you also had some puts and takes around inventory, et cetera, in the fourth quarter. What are some of those dynamics in this fourth quarter? And maybe you could put that, also, in context of some of the initiatives and actions that are in place. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, Steve, you're right. Last year in the fourth quarter, we generated $1.1 billion and the implied fourth quarter based upon our 80%-plus this year is also $1.1 billion. Last year, we did have the benefit of having a $100 million reduction in inventory related to the build that we saw in Q3 last year. And there was also a $100 million reduction in the fourth quarter of last year for receivables. So you could argue that the comparable number is really $900 million last year going to $1.1 billion this year. There's really three buckets that bridge that for you. There's probably about $50 million, round numbers, in growth just in income. There's another $50 million that we've got line of sight to in Power Solutions inventory flushing in the quarter. And then, there's another $100 million of very specific CMO initiatives that we've got planned for Q4. So that really kind of bridges you to the $1.1 billion that we expect this year to get us to the 80%-plus free cash flow. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. On the Building Solutions North America front, you mentioned a lower gross margin conversion on the backlog. Are we \u2013 how far through are we kind of the pre current regime new pricing approach? I'm just trying to get a sense for what kind of product I'm looking at in terms of \u2013 I mean, what kind of pricing levels I'm looking at here, or were there cost issues or \u2013 maybe dig into that a little bit for us? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, Steve, George here. When we started the year, we laid out that we had roughly about 75 basis points of pressure in our backlog in North America. And with that, we laid out a plan here to be much more disciplined in how we're pricing projects and through the year that we'd be able to turn positive. So through the year, that would have amounted to about $40 million of pressure coming through 2018. And about three-quarters of that was felt in the first two quarters. We did see some impact in the third quarter and that's going to \u2013 we have a little bit of an impact in the fourth quarter. What's important to note is that the orders that we booked in the year were up about 70 basis points since the beginning of the year that we put into backlog. And more recently, in the quarter we're up 110 basis points. And so, we feel very good about being able to \u2013 as we get through this year, position for 2019, that our margin rates will continue to accrete now on a go forward basis with the mix that we put into backlog, with the service mix, and feel very good about that as we move forward. And this has been driven by \u2013 we changed the incentive plan this year not only in line with delivering on the revenue or the booked orders, but also making sure that we're focused on booked margins. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Just before I pass it on, one more question, George. It's been \u2013 I guess it's been almost two years since the Tyco deal closed with JCI, so we're normally well into kind of the cost side on synergies. It sounds like revenue is starting to pick up. Maybe just give us a little of an assessment of where you see things as you kind of stand apart in terms of the road map, how far we are \u2013 how much \u2013 how far you say we have to go, that kind of thing. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. What I would say is when we started the year, we knew that we had \u2013 this was going to be a transitional year. We had lots of headwinds that we needed to overcome; and then, from an operational standpoint, making sure that we're positioned not only for growth, but continued margin improvement across all of the businesses. And what I would tell you, Steve, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made, with the way the team has come together and really focused on fundamentals of the business. We've created this growth machine on the front-end and our ability to be able to not only add capacity, but make sure that we're getting productivity out of that capacity. And that's playing out extremely well. We're getting 8% booked orders in Buildings; and the work that we've done in Power, we've been able to add new platform wins in Power. So that is going extremely well. In the Field businesses, we knew that we needed to pick up service because, with the installed base that we create, we create a lot of value not only for our customers, but for our shareholders with the service growth. We've created a service council and that is going extremely well. And we're going to continue to accelerate there. We've put a big focus on price cost and, although we've had headwind in the first half, I think you can see from the results we've made a lot of progress here over the last nine months. And I'm confident that on a go-forward basis, strategically, we're going to be pricing ahead of cost on a go-forward basis. And then, on the productivity and synergies, we have executed well on the integration and been able to achieve or perform at what we thought we would be able to achieve when we started the merger. I believe that, although we've made a lot of progress now as we've been able to focus the organization on fundamentals, there's still a lot of room for improvement as we continue to not only drive growth, but continue to drive our margin structures to be able to deliver accretive margin rates. Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning and congratulations, George, on a good quarter. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. So just wanted to turn to the portfolio, and I understand that probably there's been some reports of interest on (29:47) probably on the call, but maybe just talk about \u2013 maybe this is a question for Brian. You've got a large NOL and I'm wondering that if you do decide to spin or sell this asset, to what extent do you think you can utilize that NOL against any gain that you might realize on the sale? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. The NOL that exists today would not be available to be used against any gain on the transaction, so \u2013 it's specific by jurisdiction, right, so we'd have to unpack all that. But right now, I think we'd look at the major NOL that's disclosed in the footnotes to the financials, which I assume you're referring to, and that would not be available in a meaningful way to offset the tax costs. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, okay. And then, just to follow-on, sticking with Power, so with the revised guidance for this year, and then the impact of the new Account Standard on revenues, are we looking at maybe a 16% to 17% margin for next year, all things being equal? Is that a normalized margin run rate for Power going forward or do you still think high-teens is where this business contracts? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : You're referring to the Power Solutions margins? Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Power Solutions \u2013 the impact of the new standard in fiscal 2019 will be between 200 basis points and 240 basis points, in that range. I mean, it's a gross-up of about 10% to 15% on revenue, and so you do that math off this year's expected margins and that's where we would expect to be in fiscal 2019, plus or minus. Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question, Jeffrey Sprague, Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you, good morning. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning, everybody. Hey, just back to Power, just the nature of the deal with Tyco, the inversion and the like, I thought that precluded the ability to do a tax-free spin possibly for a five-year timeframe. Should we assume, if you're moving forward to spin, you've found some way to make it tax free, or is there the possibility that we could be looking at a taxable spin here? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : So Jeff, when we were referring to the five-year limitation in order to do a tax-efficient spin, that would be based upon a straightforward spin of the Power Solutions business in September of 2021 or beyond. There are structured transactions that could be put together that would potentially allow a spin prior to that time, but when you put together a transaction of that nature, it would be very complex and there could very well be tax risk associated with that structure. And so, one of the things that we're doing as part of this evaluation of our options is also evaluating any tax risk that would be associated with a structured spin. And so, it's an option, but we're evaluating it in line with the other options that are on the table. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I guess I would take that to then maybe believe the offer on the outright sale side is not that appealing, the fact that you're going down that path? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : No. I mean, as we said right from the start, I mean, this is a great business that \u2013 the business is performing well. We're continuing to gain market share. We've got a strong industry position, Jeff, and the fundamentals are, although we've been a little bit pressured here this year because of transportation, are positioned well here for a long-term. And so, as we have looked at this business and with the strategic review we announced back in March, I would say that we're very pleased with the significant progress we have made with this review. As we said in our prepared remarks, we're looking at multiple options : spin, sale versus retaining it. We have been evaluating, as Brian discussed, a tax-efficient spin and, in parallel, discussing with potential buyers. And we do expect, with the progress we've made, that we'll be able to be more definitive here by the release of our Q4 earnings. And so, I think at this point, we don't want to make any further comments until a specific determination has been made, but I would tell you that I'm very pleased with the progress the team has made. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : I wouldn't read anything into it, Jeff. I think we continue to look at all the options. I wouldn't read anything into the spin versus sale. I think we're trying to look at everything on a detailed basis and we'll conclude that review some time before our earnings call in Q4. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks. Totally unrelated, if I could ask another one, just interestingly today, Fortive is spending 20-25 times EBITDA for a business that pulls data off of equipment for facilities management, asset management, and the like. I would think some of that type of information comes off of BMS; some of it might even \u2013 some of those capabilities might be resident inside of BMS. I'm not expecting that you saw this Fortive deal this morning, but do you have the capabilities to do that sort of thing in your existing business? And perhaps, give us a little color on that if you do. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Sure. As we have put the businesses together, Jeff, we have an incredible position with our Building Management Systems. And as you've seen the growth as we go-to-market today in multiple systems, we've had strong high-single-digit growth across all of our Building Management Systems. In parallel to that, we're putting all of those systems together into an integrated platform. And we are making incredible progress in being able to simplify the platform, be able to set it up so that we can collect all of the data not only off our platforms, but any other systems that connect to our Building Management, and we can now tailor specific solutions to each of the verticals that we support, depending on the problem that customers want to solve. We're going to \u2013 on a go-forward basis, because of the growth that we're achieving in this space, the investments that we're making organically, we're going to be positioned to be able to segment this revenue to show that it is beginning to accelerate in the strategy of putting these businesses together. We're going to be positioned extremely well to be able to support the building in incorporating all of the data that's collected within a building. Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just starting on the Buildings business, George, as you said, you've had some sort of clean-up work to do around gross margins and such over the past nine months or so, but when you're looking forward on Buildings with those issues behind you now that the entity has got to grips with price cost, what kind of incremental margins do you think Buildings can generate with this portfolio mix, leaving aside any remaining cost synergies from the transaction? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Like I said, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making. When you look at our margin structure about \u2013 when you look at our product businesses, we're getting nice leverage on our product businesses with the strong growth that we're achieving and the volume mix and productivity is offsetting a significant reinvestment in that business; and that business was up 60 basis points net of that. And so, we see that continuing with the reinvestments that we're making. When you look at the Field businesses, we have, as we discussed, significantly improved our service businesses. We've been focusing not only in segmenting the markets that we serve, building out the sales force, and then building out our field capacity with our technicians. And I would tell you, based on where we started at the beginning of the year and where we are today, we have made incredible progress. We have an installed base that's second to none to be able to mine and be able to build services. The growth that we've achieved in the first half was about 3%. We ramped up to 5% in the third quarter and I see that continuing going forward. And then, the other piece of that is how we're booking installation projects across the board. We're booking at a higher rate, making sure that our sales force is focused on the value that we deliver with the projects that we deploy and ultimately execute on. And with the progress we've made in \u2013 I highlighted North America up over 110 basis points in the quarter. The combination of the higher book margins in backlog, the service mix and the leverage we're getting on our technology and investments in our products, the three will combine to very attractive margin accretion here as we go forward. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. And then, my second and last question would just be around the EMEA and Latin America region, specifically. The margins there are some way below the other two regions within Building Solutions. Do you see that as anything structural or it just requires a lot of heavy lifting and self-help and you should be able to get to the mid-teens margin range in the medium-term? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. Our team in EMEA/LA has done an incredible job as we took the businesses, put them together and we've gone through a very large restructure here over the last year. If you look at the overall performance, although it's flat, organic sales in the quarter, service was up 3% and that will continue. Install was down because we did have a lower backlog within our HVAC and Industrial Refrigeration. The orders in the quarter was up 15%, and that's with strong demand both in Industrial Refrigeration and Fire & Security. I have complete confidence with the work \u2013 and then, when you look at margins, although reported they're up 60 basis points, they're up 100 basis points ex-FX. With the work that we've done to restructure the business, with the volume that's beginning to come through, we're going to be in a good position here to be able to get much more leverage and to get to much more respectable margin rates on a go-forward basis. And so, I feel very good about the progress we've made over the last nine months. Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Joe. Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So obviously, really nice to see the organic growth acceleration and the investments paying off. George, maybe you can touch on what you think the incremental investment will be in 2019. Where do you plan to continue to invest, whether it be in the sales force or on the product channel side? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yes, so as a percent of revenue, we're going to begin to see leverage on all of these costs as we go into 2019. So recall, this year as we started the year, we were relatively flat last year in our sales force. And so, we've had a significant ramp up here through the course of the year. We have a lot of \u2013 from a mix standpoint, we have a lot of new sales leaders and sales people that are now getting up to speed. We're seeing tremendous momentum. And so, on a go-forward basis from a sales standpoint, we now have segmentation of the markets that we're serving. We're making sure we have the right footprint and that we're getting not only the productivity, but we're adding in line with the market growth that we expect. So we've made a lot of progress this year. So on a go-forward basis, you'll see much more leverage on that cost that we've put into place this year and we'll be adding sales to offset attrition and be able to get net productivity and then some incremental sales adds to that. So on that basis, I feel a lot of improvement here as we go forward. On the Products side, as you can see, we're getting tremendous results from the investments that we've made over the last two or three years. And so, I see, as a percentage of revenue, we're going to continue to accelerate our revenue growth and the incremental reinvestment will be levered. We're not \u2013 as a percent of revenue will continue to come down. And so, we're beyond where we're adding or reinvesting more heavily than our revenue is growing. I believe that we're now at that peak where we start to see leverage on the investments we're making. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's good to hear. And I guess my follow on question, as you kind of think about cash flow next year, obviously there are a bunch of one-time items that you guys have highlighted this year, roughly $800 million to $900 million that are excluded from the cash flow number. How does that number step down in 2019? And are there other opportunities from a working capital perspective that you're working on as well for 2019? Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yes. So as far as 2019, you probably recall we did make a payment related to the Adient spin that was like $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion, and we knew that we were going to get that back in a couple of tranches, one of which we'll get back either in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 or the first quarter of 2020. Assuming we get that back in the fourth quarter \u2013 and the reason there's a question on that is because the refund is in that $600 million to $700 million range. And given the size of that, it needs to get special committee approval in order to release that refund to Johnson Controls. And so, we think we'll get it in the fourth quarter, but it could move into the first quarter of 2020. Given that inflow of cash and given the one-time special items that we've got for ongoing restructuring and integration, clearly our adjustments in 2019 should be favorable relative to where we've been historically. So our reported cash flow in fiscal 2019 should actually be better than the adjusted cash flow, because we'll adjust out the one-time refund we get related to the Adient tax payment. Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning, all. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : George, on revenue synergies relative to the $500 million that was talked about a couple of years ago, how much would you say has been realized to-date at this point? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : So we're tracking well. Originally, when we started we had identified it was about $0.5 billion to $1 billion over time that we'd be able to achieve. I'd say, as we've integrated the teams, we have a much more seamless structure as we're working \u2013 as the businesses have come together. I think when you look at our pipeline of opportunities, our pipeline is up over double digit pretty much across the board. And this is a result of these teams now working together. We've segmented the markets to make sure that we're positioned to serve the markets appropriately to capitalize on the growth. The leads come in into a central process, and now the teams are executing well. So it's hard to begin to segment that because now we're operating seamlessly, but I would tell you from a pipeline development it's been a big contributor to being able to create that base that we're working to be able to convert into orders. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So is the way to think about this is there's probably not that much in current backlog, but your quoting staff and that's a function of this targeted focus combining the teams, etcetera. So as yet \u2013 more or less yet to come in the backlog? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah, we're beginning to see it. I would tell you that if you look at Fire & Security, Fire & Security businesses are up mid-single digits across the board. And I think this is a result of the strong footprint that we had with the customers that we're serving within HVAC & Controls and being able to bring in Fire & Security. So we've had very strong growth in our Fire products with fire detection and suppression up high single digits. And then, when you look at \u2013 Security is still up, but up to kind of low to mid-single digits. That is definitely a reflection of these synergies that we're getting in the sales force in being able to create those leads. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up on \u2013 can you level set us on China, your exposure in Building Solutions percentage of sales. Obviously, that's going to be a headwind here for the time being. How much is that going to eat into some of the improvement you're starting to see in North America on margins as we think about 2019? George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. I'd start by saying we have a extremely strong position in China, both commercially as well as with our residential HVAC. And that's combined with our strong partnerships that we have, our JV partnerships. As Brian talked a little bit about, there are some new competitors. Some of those are local competitors. We are positioned well locally with how we're not only designing new products, but also with our supply chain and manufacturing footprint and being able to serve the market. We are \u2013 we have, like I said, a strong position and we're continuing to invest, and I believe from a cost structure standpoint we're going to be well positioned to be able to continue to deliver there. Short term, we have seen some projects that have come through at lower margins, but I don't believe that that's systemic. I believe that the work we're doing, we're going to be able to continue to grow and continue to grow profitably, and we're going to continue to invest. Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next question is from Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning, Deane. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Good morning. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, there's lots of discussion about the investments in the sales force. I'm just \u2013 I'd be curious to hear what is the typical timeframe for a new salesperson? When do they start being productive? And then, a bit more about the allocation of these resources, are they going after new customers, like middle market? Are they generalists? Is there specialty sales? And maybe some color there because this is a significant investment that you've laid out. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. So, Deane, we started right out of the gate this year. This was our top focus here. We've lead it with a sales leadership council. We've made incredible progress and it starts with understanding our markets and how we serve our markets, and then making sure that we've got the right sales structure to be able to serve the markets. We've made a tremendous amount of changes in doing that, and then understand, now, where we're adding, we see line of sight to significant growth. And so, with the adds we've made, it typically depends on whether it be installed projects or enterprise type projects, versus, let's say, T&M and service. So there's a varying level of skill sets that we're recruiting to be able to capitalize on what we see as the biggest opportunities. So the cycle time of getting a sales \u2013 a new salesperson up to speed, it can be months in the service side or it can be one to two years, depending on the complexity of project sales that we're doing. And so, I would tell you, is that we have metrics across the board. We're actually ahead of our metrics on the onboarding and then the production that we're getting out of our new sales force as well as getting strong performance out of our veteran sales force. And so, what I would tell you is that, based on where we started the year, where we are, we're actually ahead of where we thought we would be. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And just one follow up on Power, and I can imagine what the answer is, but just \u2013 it's worth asking is \u2013 you're in this period of, I'll use the word, limbo on the disposition or potential retention of Power. Have you lost any talent? Are the OEs \u2013 with the feedback from them of any of your competitors making inroads and using that against you? Doesn't seem like it is, especially in China, but it's worth asking. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Not at all. I mean, let me start \u2013 go back to \u2013 this is a great business. The people in the business are very proud of the business and very passionate about what they do. We're winning across the board. We're winning in both OE as well as aftermarket. We're winning across the regions, gaining share. The team is executing well. We've minimized the distraction that this has caused within the business. And so, when you have a business like this that is positioned well for a long term, you've got leaders that are very committed and very passionate and are very understanding that as we go through this process, we want to minimize disruption. So we have not seen significant attrition as a result. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. Thank you. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Thanks, Deane. Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc : Operator, I'd like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments. George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc : Yeah. Just to wrap up today's call, I want to thank everyone for joining the call this morning. As you can see, we've made a tremendous amount of progress this year, not only improving our fundamentals, but as we're leading with clarity, simplicity and confidence and certainly look forward to seeing many of you soon. So operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we\u2019ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release, and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.83 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.10 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to restructuring and integration cost in the quarter. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.93 per share compared to $0.87 in the prior year quarter. Now let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u2019s get started with a high level review of what we have accomplished over the last 12 months starting on Slide 3. 2018 was a year of significant progress for Johnson Controls. We executed on our commitments and exited the year with strong momentum. We made significant strides on all of our target metrics and key initiatives. And I will touch on a few of those in just a minute. We executed a disciplined approach to capital allocation, have been paid down nearly $2.6 billion in debt and returning excess cash to shareholders, including $300 million in share repurchases and almost $1 billion in dividends. We established the cash management office and challenge the team to drive operational improvements by establishing sound fundamental processes and metrics across the organization, which resulted in a 30% increase in cash from operations year-over-year and improved free cash flow conversion to 88%. We changed our annual and long-term compensation incentives to better align with shareholder priorities. And lastly, we have made significant progress over the past several months related to the strategic review of Power Solutions. We have assessed multiple options and are now in the final stages of that review as we weigh all possibilities before reaching a final decision. We will provide an update when complete. While I am very proud of what the team accomplished this year there is still a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And we are taking action to make sure we capture it. Turning now to our scorecard on Slide 4. In the interest of time, I won\u2019t spend a lot of time on each item listed here on the slide, but these were eight major commitments that we made to you at the start of the year and how we performed against each of those. Contributing to our successes here is our effort to better align senior leadership with driving execution and creating a performance culture. Over the course of the year, we focused on setting more grounded expectations with increased transparency and increased accountability. Just to touch on a few of these themes, you will notice the top floor all pertain to improving the organic growth trajectory within buildings. In 2018, we delivered 5% organic growth in aggregate across our Buildings platforms, which compares to our original guidance of up low single digits. One of the major drivers of the upside was improved execution in our service businesses across all of our regions, which is the result of the work we began in 2017 to expand our commercial capabilities, strengthened operations and increase our service technician capacity. Service revenues grew 4% for the full year, and we exited with Q4 growth of 6% with momentum continuing into next year. We set an exceeded an aggressive target to increase our global sales capacity in Buildings, adding 950 sales people net of attrition representing roughly an 11% increase on the existing salesforce. Additionally, by applying our commercial excellence principles, we were able to improve sales productivity for both the new and veteran salesforces. The combination is visible in the 7% organic order growth performance across our field businesses this year. Against a backdrop of healthy end market demand, orders for our service equipment and install businesses should see continued strength in 2019. You will notice two yellow checkmarks on organic growth in Power and underlying EBIT margin expansion. In both cases, we came in at the low end of our original targets. On the margin front, although we are at the low end of what we communicated to you at the start of the year, we navigated through an accelerating inflationary environment and offset all with $30 million of costs with incremental price in 2018. We also continue to reinvest in our businesses, primarily through engineering and R&D within our products divisions, but also the incremental costs and under absorption associated with the salesforce additions I just mentioned. Lastly on free cash flow, we exceeded our target for 80%-plus conversion at 88% for the year, driven by solid performance and underlying cash from operations as well as a disciplined CapEx reduction. Turning over to Slide 5. Buildings field orders continued to accelerate in the quarter up 9% year-over-year organically. Underlying order strength in the quarter was broad-based with all three regions up high single digits or better. We are seeing continued strength across most of our core product domains, including bookings for installation and service. Orders for large applied systems grew low double digits in both North America and EMEA/LA. I am very proud of the work our teams have done over the course of this year, driving 7% organic order growth for the full year. Our project pipeline remains robust and we expect continued order momentum across our end markets as we look into 2019. Backlog ended the year up 8% at $8.4 billion. With the combination of a solid backlog position and strong order growth expectations, our visibility into 2019 has improved and gives me confidence in our outlook for continued growth in field revenues next year. Turning now to Slide 6. Let me recap the financial results for the quarter. Sales of $8.4 billion increased 3% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic basis with 8% in growth in Buildings and 2% in Power. Adjusted EBIT of approximately $1.2 billion, grew 4% on a reported basis and 9% when adjusting for the impacts of the Scott Safety divestiture, foreign exchange and lead. Favorable volume and mix as well as the benefit of cost synergy and productivity savings more than offset incremental organic investments back into our business. Overall, EBIT margins expanded 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or 50 basis points excluding the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, FX and lead. Underlying performance was led by Buildings, which expanded core margins by 60 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, which brings the full year to $2.3 billion, representing 88% conversion. Brian will discuss our performance in more detailed later in the call, but I would like to recognize the cash management office as well as the numerous dedicated individuals throughout the organization who put in a tremendous amount of effort this year. Significantly improving our cash processes and positioning us to deliver a sustained strong free cash flow. Slide 7 bridges our EPS growth year-over-year with respect to some of the items I just discussed, as well as the number of other small items, which impacted us during the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.93, up 7% over the prior year. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments. Brian Stief : Thanks, George, and good morning. So starting with Slide 8, let\u2019s take a look at performance of Buildings on a consolidated basis. You can see that building sales in the quarter of $6.2 billion increased 8% organically with our products revenues up 9% and field up 7% and that was really led by a strong 6% growth in service and accelerating growth in project installations, which were grew 7%. Divestitures, primarily the sale of Scott Safety were a 3 percentage point headwind and FX was about 1 percentage headwind. Buildings consolidated EBITA of $939 million grew 11% organically with strong growth in both our field and shorter cycle products businesses. Buildings EBITA margin expanded 10 basis points to 15.2%, which includes a 50 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Scott Safety and FX. So on a normalized basis, our margins expanded a solid 60 basis points. As you can see in the margin waterfall, synergy and productivity save and favorable volume leverage and mix contributed 120 basis points, which includes positive price cost in the quarter. And this was partially offset by 50 basis points of planned incremental product and sales capacity investments. As George mentioned field orders increased 9% organically and our backlog is up 8% to $8.4 billion. Now let\u2019s review each of the segments within Buildings. So turning to Slide 9 in North America. Sales of $2.3 billion grew 8% organically as we saw project installation activity accelerating 10% were service growth up 4%. We saw another quarter of solid performance and applied HVAC and controls platforms, which grew mid-single digits organically, led by an 8% growth in core applied HVAC equipment installation and service. Fire and security grew high-single digits with balanced growth across each platform, led by mid-teens growth in security project installations. Our solutions business, which is only about 10% of North America\u2019s revenue, grew high teens on a relatively easy prior year compare just as a reminder, this business can be a bit choppy for an order and revenue standpoint on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So if you look at North America adjusted EBITA of $336 million, it grew 7% year-over-year, and EBIT margin was flat at 14.5% as we saw the benefits of volume leverage and synergy and productivity save being offset by the planned salesforce investments and an unfavorable mix as we saw installed revenues grow at more than twice the rate of service in the quarter. Orders in North America increased to strong 8% organically, driven by applied HVAC orders up low-double digits, and fire and security orders up mid-single digits. Backlog of $5.4 billion increased 6% year-over-year. So moving to EMEA/LA on Slide 10. Sales of $948 million grew 6% organically with continued strength in service, which was up 8% and we saw an inflection and project installations plus 4%, which had been soft as we worked off the lower backlogs as we entered 2018. Growth was positive across all regions and across all lines of business with the exception of the Middle East HVAC business. Europe grew high-single digits driven primarily by a rebound in Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC and orders in Europe, increased high-single digits organically in Q4 led by strong demand in IR, HVAC, fire suppression and security. In the Middle East, revenues were up slightly as continued growth in service was mostly offset by continued softness in HVAC project installations. In Latin America, revenues increased high-single digits led by strength in our security monitoring business, in addition to solid growth in controls and fire suppression. Adjusted EBITDA of $103 million increased 8% on a reported basis, with 15% organically. And EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points to 10.9%. But again, this includes 30 basis point headwinds from foreign currency. The underlying margin improvement of 90 basis points was a result of favorable volume and mix and the productivity in synergy save, which was again offset by salesforce investments. Orders in EMEA/LA increased 10% with solid growth in all regions across both service and project installation. And our backlog ended up at $1.5 billion, up 9%. So moving to Slide 11 on Asia-Pac, sales of $689 million, grew 4% organically driven by strength in service. Project installation revenue grew a modest percent for strong growth in fire and security and IR, offset by continued weakness in HVAC. Adjusted EBITDA of $105 million, declined 4% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin declined 90 basis points to 15.2%, where we again saw the benefit of productivity save, cost synergies, and favorable volumes more than offset by salesforce additions and underlying margin pressure. As we highlighted for you at the end of Q3, we did expect to see some margin pressure in Q4 related to the highly competitive environment in China, but we do expect our margins to stabilize in the early part of fiscal 2019 and expect overall modest margin expansion throughout the year fiscal 2019. Asia-Pac orders increased 8% driven primarily by service orders, which are up 20% in the quarter. And our backlog increased 11% to $1.5 billion. So turning to global products in Slide 12. Our sales increased a very strong 9% organically to $2.2 billion with high-teens growth in Building Management Systems, high single-digit growth in HVAC and Refrigeration Equipment and low double-digit growth in Specialty Products. In BMS, we saw strong growth across our controls, fire detection and security businesses. Sales across the HVAC and Refrigeration Equipment grew high-single digits, global residential HVAC, which does include our consolidated Hitachi's JVs in Japan and Taiwan through low double digits in the quarter. Our North American residential HVAC revenues grew just over 20% in the quarter, which was aided by a relatively easy prior year compare, but we did see the favorable weather which drove higher replacement demand and we gained market share with new product introductions as well as the expansion of our distribution footprint. We also saw strong price realization in the channel during the quarter. Global light commercial HVAC grew low-single digits led by mid single-digit growth in North America, despite a real tough mid-teens prior year compare. IR equipment revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by high-teens growth in North America and our applied HVAC equipment business grew low double digits reflecting strengthen our indirect channels in both North America and Asia. And finally, our low double-digit growth in Specialty Products was driven by an increased demand for fire suppression, with broad-based growth across all of our regions. Segment EBITA of $395 million was up 3% on a reported basis, but up 18% if you exclude the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture. Our reported segment EBITA margins of 60 basis points include 100 basis point headwind related to Scott Safety. So our underlying segment margins expanded 160 basis points in the quarter, the 17.8%, where we saw the higher volume leverage and mixed positive price costs in the quarter and the benefits of cost synergies and productivity save, partially offset by the planned channel and product investments we've talked to you about in the past. So let's move to Slide 13 and talk about Power Solutions. Sales of $2.2 billion increased 2% organically on a tough prior year compare, and this was driven mostly by a decline in unit shipments, primarily in our aftermarket channel. Total battery shipments declined 1% year-over-year with shipments to OE customers up 5% and aftermarket shipments down 2%, and I would just note that on a comparative basis, we shipped a record number of batteries in Q4 of last year after a relatively soft Q3. Our growth in OE shipments outpaced global market growth and also reflects several new business wins that we expect to continue as we move forward. In addition to tough prior year compare shipments to the aftermarket channel were impacted by about 1% percentage point related to Hurricane Florence. Global shipments of start-stop batteries increased 20% year-over-year, with strong growth in the Americas, China, and EMEA. Segment EBITA Power of $424 million decreased 2% on the reported basis and 1% organically. And margin declined 80 basis points year-over-year to 19.4%, which included a 10 basis point headwind for FX. So Power's underlying margins declined 70 basis points, which is reflective of the continued pressure around transportation costs, some unfavorable volume and mix, lower fixed cost absorption in our plants. And those items were offset by some favorability and productivity save. I would point out that freight costs do remain elevated and we expect some continued pressure in the near-term in transportation costs as we work to offset these incremental costs through pricing, as we renew agreements with our customers. On Slide 14 corporate expense was down 11% year-over-year to $95 million and again, we make good progress on the synergy and productivity saving front. So let me turn to Page 15 and talk about cash flow. Our reported cash flow was $1 billion in the quarter and if you exclude the planned integration and restructuring payments and a non-recurring tax payment of about $300 million, our adjusted free cash flow was a strong $1.3 billion in Q4. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $2.3 billion, which is up roughly $1 billion over the prior year, and as George mentioned represented free cash flow conversion of 88%. For the full year, we delivered significant improvement in cash from operations and also reduced our CapEx spend by about $200 million relative to our original plan of $1.25 billion and as we go forward, we'll continue to use a very disciplined CapEx approach. If I look forward to fiscal 2019 adjusted free cash flow conversion will approximate 90% and that guidance excludes special cash outflow items of about $300 million to $400 million and also excludes the $600 million tax refund that we expect either in late fiscal 2019 or early fiscal 2020. Turning the balance sheet on Slide 16. Our balance sheet position continues to improve with net debt down nearly $1 billion sequentially in the quarter to $10.8 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage is 2.2 and our net debt to cap declined to 33.8%. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $45 million and for the year, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for $300 million in line with our original plans. Additionally, as we look to 2019, we're now in a better position to return more cash to our shareholders. The Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which is in addition to the $900 million that remains in prior authorizations. We do expect to complete approximately $1 billion of share repurchases during fiscal 2019. And finally, let me just touch on a couple of other items on Slide 17, before I turn it back over to George. I'd like to give you a quick update on U.S. tax reform, as you know, our original assessment was that the effect on our fiscal 2019 rate could be in the range of up to a rate of 16% to 18%, and as we work through the details of the provisions of the new tax code, we now expect our effective rate to be 16% in fiscal 2019, which compares to the 13% rate in fiscal 2018. And then lastly, as we mentioned on the third quarter call, we've got a new revenue recognition accounting standard that will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2019. The impact of the standard on buildings is not significant, but for Power Solutions, even though there's not a significant impact on EBITA. There is an impact on revenue and as a result, there'll be a gross-up in sales which will impact our EBITA margin rate by 200 plus basis points. We have provided in the appendix to the deck normalize financials for the quarters for Power, so you can update your models with the new information. So with that, I will turn it back over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to provide you with our outlook for 2019. Let's start by walking through the puts and takes embedded in our 2019 guidance on Slide 18. As Brian mentioned, our tax rate for fiscal 2019 increases to 16% from the 13% effective rate reported in fiscal 2018, and this equates to a $0.12 headwind year-over-year, which normalizes our fiscal year 2018 EPS to $2.71. We expect mid single-digit organic growth, which will drive approximately $0.28 of earnings and we expect this growth to be primarily driven by improved volumes and price. Additionally, we will have the continued benefit of synergies and productivity savings, which we will realize over the course of the year that will contribute an additional $0.23 of earnings. As you are all aware, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, based on recent rates, we expect this to result in an $0.08 foreign currency headwind year-over-year. Additionally, the carryover of the salesforces investments, as well as a few cents of incremental investments in our product businesses are expected to total about $0.07. As you can see there are various other items which net to $0.07 headwind in fiscal 2019. All of these factors contributed to our fiscal 2019 EPS guidance range before special items of $2.90 to $3.05. This represents growth in the range of 7% to 13%, adjusting for the impact of the increased tax rate. The full details of our guidance is included on Slide 19. Our guidance is based on strong underlying EBIT growth of 8% to 12%, driven by strong top line performance in synergy and productivity benefits. While we are pleased with our 2018 results and continuing momentum into 2019, there is still a lot of opportunity ahead and we remain focused on driving execution. With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, George and Brian, and Antonella. George Oliver : Good morning, Nigel. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Right. So I'm sure this is a question, you don't really want to address, but I think it has to be asked at least. I'm sure you were hoping to have an announcement about the outcome of your portfolio review that the lot of press reports around potential bidders for that business. Can you maybe just talk about, how you narrowed the range of options for Power? And if you have maybe just address that and alternatively, is everything still on tape? George Oliver : Yes, what I would say, Nigel. We've gone through a very thorough process and have been assessing multiple options. I would tell you, we've been very disciplined in making sure that whatever the outcome is that we're going to be positioned to be able to create the most shareholder value. A little bit disappointed around the timing, but it's something that we can't control. What I would say that we have made significant progress. There are a significant number of considerations that we've taken into account. And what I believe is most important now is making the right decision versus keeping to a set timeline. We are evaluating all of the multiple options before we reach the final decision, as I said all options are still on the table. Nigel Coe : Okay. I'll leave it there, maybe there'll be other questions then. And maybe just turning into the cash flow outlook for 2019, maybe this is for Brian, maybe just talk about, what CapEx number is in there? I'm sorry if I missed that in your prepared remarks. And then the one-timers, the $3 million to $4 million of one-timers, can you just maybe just talk about those? Are there discrete tax items in there as well? Brian Stief : So the guidance at 90% free cash flow for fiscal 2019 has in it, roughly $1 billion of CapEx. So on a comparable level with where we ended this year, Nigel. And as far as the special items for fiscal 2019, that represents really a lot of the integration costs and restructuring that we've taken as part of the whole JCI Tyco integration, if you recall the $1 billion and save over the four-year period, we've commented that was probably about a dollar for dollar cost to save and that really reflects the remaining portion of the cost to deliver the $1 billion. There are not any unusual or non-recurring tax items in that amount. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just a quick one on top of that. The cash tax rate is that going forward, is that going to be similar to the GAAP tax rate? Brian Stief : It will be certainly closer than it's been in the past, I think 2019 could be quarter-to-quarter, may be a little choppy. But for the year pretty normalized and then when we get to 2020, it should be back very close. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question on the Buildings margin guidance, I think you've guided that to grow about 40 bps to 60 bps in fiscal 2019. If I look at the Q4 margin performance, you are up about 60 bps, excluding Scott Safety and I would have thought that maybe with less investment spend, maybe less price cost headwind, your margin improvement may accelerate from Q4. So maybe just help us understand what are some of the offset, is it tariffs or mix or something? George Oliver : Yes, Julian. We've made a lot of progress here when you look at the overall margins and when you look at the aggregate of what we're forecasting here for 2019. What we'll see is very nice progress on the price cost within our products business and that's coming through as you've seen here in the last couple of quarters. And then within our field businesses, when you look at the field businesses, we've got the headwind of the salesforce investments that we've made through the course of 2018 and that becomes in \u2013 especially in the first half of this year, some headwind on the margin rate. And so if you look at the overall margin rate, we pick up about 30 basis points on volume with the continued strong organic performance, we pick up about 60 basis points of price \u2013 I'm sorry, productivity and synergy save. And then that's being offset with the reinvestments that we have, the little bit of a headwind that we have from the salesforce expansion that we made, and then some incremental investments here in products. As we go through the course of the year though, as we position now through 2019 and into 2020. You'll see those headwinds subside because now that we've got the growth machine working. We've got the orders now at a rate that we believe is well above the market. We're now driving our service growth and with the investments we've made in products, that's ultimately what's going to drive the growth and the overall margin expansion longer-term. And so there is a little bit of headwind here in 2019, but we feel good about the 40 to 60 basis points that we've guided here for our Buildings business here in 2019. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just my follow-up question would be \u2013 apologies if I missed. But any clarity you could give on the impact of tariffs. Maybe just what you saw the fiscal 2018 impact from tariffs was on a gross or net basis, what you're assuming it is for fiscal 2019 and maybe just any detail on how it affects the two segments differently? George Oliver : Julian. When we looked at this, in total, for the total years, so we started to get hit with the 232s in 2018 and then subsequent to that the 301s, when you put order of magnitude across both, it's roughly about a \u2013 I'm going to say roughly about a $130 million, $140 million, and we saw about half of that come through in 2018. And I would tell you from a pricing standpoint as you all know, we got behind the price cost curve early in the year in 2018. We've been very aggressive with price through second, third and fourth quarter. We're in very good position right now from a cost standpoint taken into account, all of our inflationary costs including tariffs that on a go-forward basis here, we're going to start to see price cost being positive throughout the year, with the work that's been done from a pricing standpoint. So we feel that we've taken all of the 301s even the full \u2013 when you look at the 301s as it relates to China, all of the potential headwind that that would potentially create, we packed that into our cost base and we've taken the pricing actions to be able to offset that. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : George, field and installation picked up nicely in the quarter to 7%, helping you get to overall field revenue growth of 7%. Are if the point, given your increased salesforce, where you can feel revenue growth can basically match field backlog growth, and installation growth at the same time. Can you sustain that mid single-digit growth that you saw? And separately, just on the applied HVAC product acceleration, are you seeing new products really starting to gain traction or is it just a strong institutional markets there? George Oliver : So let me start with the overall \u2013 the backlog, the work that we've done this year within our salesforce and how we built the backlog. All of that has been broad-based across our field businesses, across HVAC, Industrial Refrigeration through, across our Fire & Security businesses. So I would tell you it's been globally very much broad-based. Now with that backlog, we've also been able to accrete the book margins. So we've been booking better margins in backlog and that's what ultimately is going to support the margin expansion, as we go forward here through 2019 and beyond. Now when you look at the growth rates, so we got an 8% backlog going into 2019, that is what gives me tremendous confidence that as we go through 2019, the guidance that we've given is firm, because as you look at where we started 2018, we started off with a backlog, I believe it was somewhere around 2%. And then we ultimately were able to accelerate through the course of the year to be able to get to the 5% Buildings organic growth. So in regards to your question, I absolutely believe that you'll start to see the organic revenue growth in line with the order growth that we're achieving, you started to see that in the fourth quarter and through 2019, you'll start to see those two lines converge, on the installation side. What I'm very excited about is service, from a service standpoint, we've been expanding service. We're trying to expand service as rapidly as we're expanding our install business. As you all know, that's where we get significant improved margins and across the board, we've expanded our not only our commercial teams, but also the fulfillment capabilities to be able to drive service. Recall, that we were \u2013 modest growth in 2017, like 1% or 2%, we were able to ramp up 3% to 4% to 5% to 6% during the quarters in 2018, and that gives me confidence we're going to see the orders that we've been able to achieve in service, begin to convert to stronger revenue here in 2019 and beyond. So in regards to that, I do believe that through the course in 2019, you'll be able to see the convergence of the organic revenue to what we've been able to achieve from an order standpoint. Now, the second question? Antonella Franzen : HVAC. George Oliver : On the HVAC, when you look at our HVAC performance, I couldn't be more excited about the progress we've made relative to \u2013 with the new products that we brought into the market and then the expanded distribution that we've put into place across the globe. If you look at a couple of segments, our North America residential HVAC equipment revenue was up 21%. Now I would say that, that's to an easy compare from last year. But overall, when you look at whether it'd the favorable weather that Brian talked about, the channel expansion that we've made, the price realization, that gives me tremendous confidence here that we're gaining share and making a lot of progress with the new products we've launched. When you look at light commercial, when you look \u2013 we were up about mid-single digits, but that's to a much tougher compare from last year where we were up double digits. And then when you look at our global applied HVAC equipment business, we've launched a lot of new products in that space, we're beginning to see the pickup with those new products. Now globally, we're roughly at mid single-digit growth. But I would tell you in North America, the success of the products and the expansion that we've had, is driving double-digit growth in North America. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in that space. Andrew Kaplowitz : George. Just a quick follow-up on Power Solutions, if you look at the volume mix component in your margin markets slips, I think plus 30 last quarter to minus 80 this quarter, obviously slower growth this quarter, so little bit more under absorption. But how much of the change was warrants related disruption in the quarter. And does that impact go away in Q1 this year? George Oliver : Yes. So that was part of our challenge that we had with a little bit of volume and then the margin pressure that we had. I would tell you that most of it was driven by the mix. So when you look at our Power Solutions business last year, the compare we had a record year of volume fourth quarter of 2017. In 2018, our OE volume was up 5%, and then our aftermarket volume was down 2%. So that was a significant impact to the margin rate, organically, we showed 2% overall, and that was driven by price and mix. But then when you look at the mix between OE and aftermarket is what drove that margin pressure. That in addition to all of the headwinds that we've had with our transportation and logistics was \u2013 couldn't that has been offset, we had strong productivity, but if Power offset is the productivity that we achieved during the quarter. What I see going forward is more balanced mix, as we project the volumes here, as we get into 2019. We are seeing some decent volumes, given that this is our strong season, and I am encouraged based on the volumes, I see coming through, and that I think that will normalize the margin rate on a run rate basis, as we go through 2019. Brian Stief : I would just add to that. I think the way to think about the impact of the hurricane and Power, it was probably, roughly a $0.01 in the quarter impact to us. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. How are you? George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just a question on the CapEx. How much this year will be battery CapEx? And then how much are out of the billion is battery next year? Brian Stief : I would look \u2013 I think in terms of probably a third of the CapEx will be Power Solutions and two-thirds Buildings and corporate. Steve Tusa : Okay. And that's going to be kind of consistent for next year or the Buildings CapEx stays flat and most of the reduction is kind of the sustainable reduction is in \u2013 is on the Power side? Most of the change? Brian Stief : It's going to be pretty consistent Steve, between 2018 and 2019. So one-thirds, two-thirds. Steve Tusa : Okay, got it. George Oliver : Just a comment on that. When we look at CapEx, what we're going through is we're being very disciplined. I mean, we are investing, we are supporting the growth that we're achieving, and we're making sure that all of the capital expense that we incur is truly aligned to being able to achieve this accelerated growth. So I can assure you that from a payback standpoint, we're well positioned with these investments. Steve Tusa : Yes, absolutely. I\u2019m just curious. So when you kind of look at the improvement in conversion. Is that coming \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to kind of discern, is that \u2013 part of that is from battery CapEx coming down obviously, as you guys are discipline on that business, correct? Is that kind of how we\u2019re looking at it? Brian Stief : Yes, I mean, I think there\u2019s probably, when you think about Buildings CapEx versus Power CapEx, there\u2019s probably 10% to 15% difference in conversion between Power Solutions and the Buildings business. So\u2026 Steve Tusa : Okay. Brian Stief : Yes. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then just anything around quarterly sequencing when it comes to kind of seasonality of the year? Anything on cash or EPS that we should be aware of? Brian Stief : No, I think historically, we\u2019ve been about 19%, 20% EPS in the first couple of quarters, probably just short of 30% in the third quarter and then low 30%s in the fourth quarter, based upon the plan that we put together, we don\u2019t see any major shifts from that Steve. Steve Tusa : Great, that\u2019s super helpful. Thanks for the color. George Oliver : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Deane Dray : Just want to follow-up on Steve\u2019s questions on CapEx. And George you emphasize a point about staying disciplined on CapEx. There were some projects that got deferred. Just give us a sense of what were those projects? And are they being added into 2019 or are they canceled altogether? Brian Stief : Yes, when we did the review, I mean there were certainly things that came out. But there was nothing that was deferred into 2019. I mean, we did it strictly as George mentioned on a return on invested capital basis, and if it didn\u2019t have the payback, it\u2019s something we\u2019re not going to move forward with. So I don\u2019t think you should view the reduction in CapEx in 2018 as something that closed into 2019. 2019 will be evaluated on a stand-alone basis between the businesses. Deane Dray : Got it. And then on the salesforce investment, George it be interested in \u2013 since it has had such an impact across your businesses. Could you talk a bit about how the new sales folks have been deployed the businesses to geographies? And at what point do they become productive? You made a comment earlier about salesforce productivity and you measured the veteran versus the newer folks and what\u2019s baked into your assumptions into 2019? George Oliver : Yes. So, right out of the gate, Deane, as I took over last fall, this was front and center and we immediately embarked on putting some type processes around sales and putting the discipline and getting the right targets and getting the right incentives, and most important is segmenting the market and how we serve the market. And so when you look at our salesforce, we\u2019ve got multiple segments, you have enterprise selling, you have HVAC equipment, you\u2019ve got fire security, you\u2019ve got long-term contracts, you\u2019ve got short-term service. And so getting that right was very important. And so we did that across the board. And then we said, where is the market growth? How we\u2019re going to compete? Where do we need to add? What skill sets do we need? And so by doing that, we\u2019ve been adding through the course of the year, like I\u2019ve said, we netted 950, and then within that making sure that as they\u2019re ramping up within each one of their segments, that we have an expected level of production during that ramp up in every segment is a little bit different and how it works. But what I would tell you with the discipline, with the process, with the accountability, with the incentives, we\u2019ve been exceeding the ramp up in each one of the segments. And so I have a lot of confidence here based on the output, we\u2019re still expecting here from an order standpoint to be high-single digit order growth again through the year as we\u2019re getting our salesforce up to speed. But I can assure you \u2013 and then through the process it also allows us to be able to address low performance, to make sure that, that we\u2019re getting high quality sales people coming in, we\u2019re giving them the right targets, they\u2019re ramping up appropriately and ultimately delivering on the expectations of the reinvestment we\u2019re making. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thanks, good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : George, I was wondering if you could give us some context for the consideration of exiting Power Solutions. The math, when we look at it, looks like it could be dilutive if it were sold, assuming reasonable multiples. I\u2019m just curious, how you balance the potential for dilution versus the right portfolio long-term, how do you make those trade-offs? George Oliver : Yes, so we\u2019re looking at all of that. So as you look at a business and the fundamentals of the business, the ability to be able to create value, short and long-term, we\u2019ve taken all of that into account. And as we\u2019re looking at not only continuing to run, I mean this is an incredible business with a market-leading position that is in an attractive vertical and it will be for some time and we\u2019re focused on how do we continue to deliver value with that. And then making sure as we look longer-term that we can position it to be able to create the most amount of shareholder value. And it also factors in as we look at the portfolio and how the overall portfolio is performing, how do we continue to be positioned with optionality within Buildings, so that we can continue to strengthen our Buildings position because we do have an incredible platform there that I believe both with the combination of our strong product technologies and capabilities combined with our channel that we\u2019re positioned extremely well now to be able to capitalize in that space. So we take all of that into consideration, we\u2019ve gone through thorough reviews as we\u2019ve gone through the process, we made a lot of progress, there\u2019s been a lot of learning in some cases, but it\u2019s making sure that we do what\u2019s right, not only for our investors, as well as for the employees that are part of that business. Gautam Khanna : That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. And just a quick follow-up on, you mentioned the applied business in North America, it looks really strong. Where do you think we are in that cycle? I mean, how many years left do you think we have of kind of this mid-to-upper single-digit or perhaps double-digit growth? And maybe what\u2019s the underlying market growth you think and how long might we actually sustain that? George Oliver : Yes. All of the indices that suggested this continued expansion, whether it be ABI or \u2013 there\u2019s other indices on starts and the like, we\u2019ve been very successful in being able to expand our footprint in capacity and at the same time also be able to get more attractive projects with the pricing that we\u2019ve been putting into place in the market. So I\u2019m feeling, I\u2019m still pretty bullish at least over the next a year or two, that this is going to continue, based on what we\u2019ve seen with the activity, what we\u2019re quoting on, lot of the large projects that I\u2019ve been involved with, with some of the key customers that we support. And so it\u2019s hard to predict, I mean, I hear all the same reports that you hear and some of the concern that we\u2019re at the mid or end of the cycle. And based on what I see today, I see it continuing and because of that we\u2019re doing very well. I mean, we\u2019re with the expanded footprint in the sales capacity that we put into place, we\u2019re getting more than our fair share. Gautam Khanna : Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steven Winoker from UBS. Your line is open. David Silverman : Good morning. This is David Silverman on for Steve. Antonella Franzen : Hey, David. George Oliver : Good morning. Brian Stief : Hey, David. David Silverman : Good morning. So in the past, you\u2019ve talked about potentially speaking about divesting 5% to 10% of the Buildings portfolio, that you considered to be non-core. From a portfolio management standpoint, is that kind of still on the table, and if so, can you give us an idea of what you might be thinking of as non-core? George Oliver : Yes. So we continued to review the Buildings portfolio, we have made a number of small divestitures that most don\u2019t hit the radar screen. These are very small businesses that are distractions and we\u2019ve continue to look at those. We\u2019ve also made some small bolt-on acquisitions mainly in our Building Management Systems space. Overall, one of the divestitures you might have seen where, we did a \u2013 we entered into a JV with Con Ed on our distributed energy storage business here late in Q4. So there\u2019s a lot of activity like that, that we\u2019re working to clean up the portfolio. When you look at the overall 5% to 10%, I would say, we\u2019re still in that range. These are businesses that when you look at our core strategy of strengthening, our HVAC platforms. And then leading in Building Management Systems, these are businesses that might not fit either of those two categories that are good businesses are running well in timing wise would be, what\u2019s the way to be able to then potentially divest or reinvest that into core HVAC businesses and/or Building Management System. So as we review the portfolio that would be \u2013 we\u2019re still in that ballpark 5% to 10% of the overall buildings portfolio. Brian Stief : Yes. I would say as it relates to that. Just, I think the way to think about it is, these are smaller businesses that would be transacted over time, and it\u2019s probably a multi-year journey that we\u2019re talking about that gets to that 5% to 10%. And I think as we\u2019ve talked about in the past to the extent that there are non-core Tyco businesses that could be sold as you\u2019re aware, we can use the proceeds from the sale of those businesses to pay down the original Tyco TSarl debt of $4 billion, which as we sit here today is now down to like $1.4 billion after a couple of years. So, that would be another item that would be taken into consideration as we think about some of the portfolio moves. David Silverman : Okay, understood. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Brian Stief : Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning. John Walsh : So also late in the \u2013 or I guess early in Q4, we saw the small Lux deal here around smart thermostats and home automation. But I was wondering, if you were to take a look at your deal pipeline, as it stands today, if there is any color around if it\u2019s more opportunity around, consolidating existing building systems you\u2019re already strong in or if there is some opportunity to move into places where you might not be as strong in terms of building systems, thinking about a slide you presented a couple of year back around lighting and electrical. George Oliver : Yes. So what I would say is that, right now we\u2019re focused on \u2013 these acquisitions have been bolt-on mainly \u2013 bolt-on acquisitions, mainly driven by technology or capabilities that we felt as we\u2019re looking at our organic investments required to ultimately lead and/or filling gaps inorganically. These are the size of businesses, so they\u2019re relatively small in the grand scheme. Now, my belief is as we go forward and develop more capacity here, we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities to be able to take our platforms here and position them, so that we can continue to accelerate. So at this stage, our focus has been execution, driving strong organic growth with the investments we\u2019re making. And then if there are gaps, we\u2019ve been building a pipeline to fill some of the small gaps. So there\u2019s been nothing significant at this stage. John Walsh : Okay. And then one from a higher level perspective here to Buildings. I think a lot of times these systems are \u2013 particularly around HVAC are being sold more around energy efficiency. And one of the trends we\u2019re starting to see is a movement more toward wellness, so kind of moving away from \"energy star rating\" to more of a wellness rating. Are you actually seeing this in your business today? Or is that not something that\u2019s on the radar screen? George Oliver : Well, I mean I can\u2019t speak for our team. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019ve been directly involved in that type of dialog. But I would tell you our teams are absolutely assessing the current trends, it\u2019s happening in HVAC and making sure that from a technology standpoint, we\u2019re leading those trends. And when I think about the work we\u2019re doing in our digital solutions, it\u2019s being able to take all of the data that\u2019s collected through these multiple systems, and then ultimately \u2013 not only optimize performance and reduce energy, but also now it\u2019s tied to improving comfort, an individualizing comfort and a lot of other outputs with the work that we\u2019re doing. So a lot of our work around digital solutions in the Controls piece of what we do in HVAC is a critical component to being able to achieve that outcome that I believe you\u2019re talking about. John Walsh : Great, thank you. Antonella Franzen : Operator, let\u2019s turn the call back over to George for some closing comments. George Oliver : So, thanks again for all of you joining our call this morning. As you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress in 2018, and we\u2019re fully committed to build upon that momentum in 2019. And look forward to engaging with many of you here over the next coming days and weeks. So, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you, speakers. Thank you, and that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating, you may now disconnect.",

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls first quarter fiscal 2019 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release, and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our Web site. Given the announced sale of our Power Solutions business, the results of Power are reported as discontinued operations. The focus of this call will be on continuing operations. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.12 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.14 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to integration cost and discrete tax items in the quarter. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.26 per share compared to $0.21 in the prior year quarter. Now let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. What I thought I'd do is start with a brief strategic overview then turn it over to Brian to review the financial results and end with an update on 2019 guidance. As we discussed with you on last quarter's call, 2018 was a year of significant progress for Johnson Controls, having set and achieved several ambitious goals to improve the operational performance with a bottoms-up and top-down approach. This included harmonizing our various legacy policies, establishing better processes around cash generation, better aligning our top executives to driving the fundamentals of our businesses in concluding the strategic review of Power Solutions. Although I said it last quarter, I really can't thank our employees around the globe enough for all of their hard work, extra hours, and in many cases assuming new responsibilities. As we've entered into 2019, our goals are the same, continue to build upon the success in 2018 to further improve the operating fundamentals of our businesses and across all of our key initiatives. We have dedicated teams in place working on the power separation, and I can tell you at this point everything is progressing well, and we are on track to close no later than June 30. We continue to see the return on investment from several years of elevated R&D spend and engineering spend as a percent of sales aimed at refreshing our product portfolio. For those of you who joined us at this year's AHR Expo in Atlanta, I am sure you walked away with a good sense with some of the new products we are bringing to the HVAC and building controls market. New product introductions are continuing to ramp in 2019, and we are well-positioned to continue gaining share across our product categories. We have built a complete global portfolio of proven solutions to help our customers design, build, retrofit, and manage the next generation of safe, smart, and connected buildings. As a global leader in sustainability and energy efficiency, our approach to innovation focuses on enabling our customers and communities to reduce energy consumption, lower operating costs and minimize the environmental footprint of their facilities. We achieved this with tools and technologies that make those facilities smarter by using sensor-based automated monitoring of environment and security systems, as well as data mining and artificial intelligence whether that be the latest release of our Metasys software platform, our smart connected chillers, or our cloud-based digital solutions offerings. We were able to offer compelling value propositions across all of our key verticals. As we continue to drive top line growth, we'll remain focused on improving returns in increasing our operating leverage. We continue to strengthen our processes around large project approvals to ensure we are achieving appropriate margin rates. We have enhanced pricing desks, and have set consistent productivity metrics across sales, service and installation to drive improved performance. Turning to slide four, orders in our field businesses increased 7% organically. And as you can see on the slide, although we are beginning to lap more difficult prior year comparisons our momentum increased sequentially. The increase in orders was driven by mid teens growth in global, commercial HVAC and mid single-digit growth in fire and security, partially offset by a significant decline in our North America solutions business. Brian will provide you with some order details in his segment review, but we continue to see broad-based strength in our order books across all three regions, and across most of our core product platforms. Our backlog ended the quarter at $8.5 billion, up 7% organically versus the prior year, which puts us in a much better position in 2019 with strong visibility to execute on our revenue expectations. Our project pipeline remains robust and we continue to see -- expect continued order momentum across our end markets over the course of the year. Taking into consideration the increasingly difficult comps as we move throughout the year, we expect continued strong order growth in the mid to high single-digit range. Before I move to the summary of our first-quarter results, just a quick comment on the macro environment, as evidenced by the continued strength in our orders in revenue, our end markets remained healthy. Generally speaking, we are not seeing a notable slowdown in any of our internal leading indicators as our short cycle book-to-bill trends, service growth in both small and large project bookings remain robust. We continue to monitor global economic conditions. And although it seems clear that GDP growth rates in some key regions are beginning to moderate to some degree, we feel good about our position. We have made the right technology investments and have expanded our sale force as well as distribution footprint. We have been expanding capabilities in our service business which is over $6 billion in annual revenue with roughly two-thirds recurring in nature. In addition to leveraging our industry-leading installed base, we have developing new technologies enabling us to create new value propositions for our customers. We are focused on execution and are continuing to take our cost and drive productivity. Turning now to slide five, let me recap the financial results for the quarter. Sales of $5.5 billion increased 6% on an organic basis led by 7% growth in products and 5% growth in the field businesses. Adjusted EBIT of $400 million grew 10% on a reported basis and 15% on an organic basis despite the anticipated pressure in our Asia-Pac business and the carryover impact of sales capacity investments driven by solid growth in segment profit as well as lower corporate expense. Overall, underlying EBIT margins expanded 60 basis points year-over-year excluding the impact of FX and M&A. Adjusted EPS of $0.26 increased 24% over the prior year driven by solid top line performance and a modest benefit from below the line items. Adjusted free cash was an outflow in the quarter of approximately $200 million better than the historical use of cash in Q1. The cash management office continues to execute well driving improvements across our cash fundamentals. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in more detail. Brian Stief : Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. So, let's start on slide six and take a quick look at the year-over-year EPS bridge. As you can see, segment operating performance stand at $0.08 versus the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by $0.02 of continued product and channel investments and the carryover run-rate impact our fiscal '18 sales force investment. I would also note that net financing charges provided a $0.02 benefit primarily driven by favorable interest rates and some FX gains. This was more than offset by a slightly higher year-over-year tax rate and some pension amortization and FX headwinds. So let's move to slide seven. Buildings on a consolidated basis had total sales of $5.5 billion, which was up 6% organically. This was led by strength in products of 7% and field businesses which were 5% driven by continued strength in both service and project installation activity which grew 6% and 4% respectively. Segment EBITDA of $590 million grew 9% organically driven by strong growth in both our field and shorter cycle products businesses despite some continued high investment levels. I would note that fiscal Q1 is typically our lowest quarter from a volume leverage standpoint given the seasonally lower revenues in our buildings business. Our segment EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points on a reported basis to 10.8%. And as you can see in a vertical chart, this includes 90 basis points of underlying operational improvement partially offset by continued product investment as well the run-rate sale force investments and indirect channel cost expansion cost. Now, let's review each segment within buildings. Starting with North America on slide eight, you can see that sales grew 6% organically to $2.1 billion with install activity up 6% and service up 5%. We saw another quarter of strong performance in our applied, HVAC and Controls platforms which grew in aggregate mid-single digits organically led by 5% growth in core applied, HVAC equipment installation and service. We also saw fire security grow mid-single digits led by high single digit growth and fire and our solutions business, which was up 30% and quarter and I just find out as you know that the Solutions business can be quite choppy on both in order intake and revenue standpoint quarter-to-quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $253 million grew 8% on a organic basis. North America EBIT margin expanded 30 basis points to 12% as we saw the benefits of volume leverage and synergy and productivity save partially offset by the year-over-year impact of our run rate sales force investments and unfavorable mix as install revenue growth outpaced service growth in the quarter, margin was also impacted by mix within the individual platforms. Orders in North America increased 5% organically driven by applied HVAC orders of mid-teens. We do thank this benefit is partly from some equipment pull-forward ahead of prices and fire security was up mid-single digits including strength and project installation and service. This growth was partially offset by a significant decline in large orders and solutions, which as I mentioned earlier, can be quite choppy. Backlog of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year. Now let's move to EMEA/LA on slide nine. There we saw sales of $907 million, which grew 4% organically with continued strength and service partially offset by a modest decline in project installations. Growth was positive in most regions and across most lines of business. Europe grow mid-single digits led by continued recovery in IR and HVAC, which combined a roughly one-third of the revenues for the segment. Orders in Europe increased 10% organically led by strong demand and IR security and HVAC. In the Middle East, we saw revenue decline low double-digits as continued growth and service activity was more than offset by softness, we're seeing in HVAC project installations but this was also driven by a tough compared with the prior year, which was up strong double-digits. Latin America revenues increased mid-single digits led by strengthen our security long-term position business and solid growth in IR on fire suppression. Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million increased a strong 17% organically and our EBIT margins expanded 70 basis points to 8.5% and this includes 30 basis points headwinds from FX. The underlying margin increased 100 basis points as favorable volume and mix and productivity and synergy save more than offset the run rate impact is other sales force investments in '18. Orders in EMEA/LA increased 9% led by solid growth in Europe and Latin America across both service and installation. In the Middle East, orders decline low double-digits again driven by a top compare with the prior year. Overall backlog ended at $1.6 billion up 15% organically. So let's move date back on slide 10, sales of $613 million gross 6% organically driven by an acceleration and project installations, which grew 8% in the quarter growth and install was led by HVAC and Investor Relations. Adjusted $66 million declined 9% on an organic basis. And as expected EBITDA margin declined 160 basis points to 10.8% as the benefit of the favorable volume was more than offset by the higher install mix, run rate, sales force investments and the as expected competitive pressures in China. Asia-Pac orders increased a strong 9% in the quarter driven primarily by service and we are beginning to see some improvement in year-over-year secured margins, particularly in service, which should benefit the latter half of this year. Overall backlog increased 12% to $1.5 billion. Turning to global products in slide 11, sales increased 7% organically and this was on top of a mid-single digit growth last year. Sales totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. Buildings Management Systems grew low double-digits with strength across all three of our platforms control security and fire detection. Sales across our HVAC and IR equipment businesses grew high single-digits collectively and global residential HVAC, which is you know include sales to our consolidated Hitachi JVs in Japan and Taiwan grew mid-single digits in the quarter. North American revenue HVAC grew high single-digits benefiting from favor or weather trends and strong price realization. And our global light commercial HVAC grew mid-teens in the quarter with North America up low-teens. IR equipment revenues declined low double-digits in the quarter due to a very difficult prior year compare, which was up a strong double-digits. Our applied HVAC equipment business grew high-teens reflecting strength in our indirect channels in both North America and Asia. We saw specially products grow mid-single digits on strong demand for fire suppression products. And this was broad-based across all regions, particularly in a APAC. Segment EBITDA of $194 million was up 15% organically and the margin expand 60 basis points driven by higher volume leverage and mix, positive freight costs in the quarter, and the benefit of cost synergies and productivity save partially offset by our continued product and channel investments. So let's move to corporate on slide 12, corporate expense with down 11%, the $93 million as we continue to see the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives. For the full-year on a continuing ops basis, we expect corporate expense in the range of $380 million to $395 million. This does not include any take out like the Power Solutions divestiture, which will begin post transaction close. As a reminder, overtime we expect to reduce corporate expense by about $50 million. Moving to cash flow on slide 13, as George mentioned, reported cash flow was an outflow in the quarter, slightly above $200 million. If you exclude a little less than a $100 million of integration and transaction costs, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of a couple $100 million. And as you know, our first fiscal quarter is typically a cash outflow, but we will place with the continued year-over-year improvement we're seeing in the cadence of our cash generation. For fiscal '19, we expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 95%. As I mentioned on the Q4 call, this excludes special cash outflows of $300 million to $400 million related to some special integration costs, and a $600 million tax refund that we expect either in Q4 or in early fiscal '20. Moving to the balance sheet on slide 14, you can see that our gross and net debt increase to $1 billion sequentially as planned, which reflects a higher CP balance to support a Q1 trade working capital needs as well as a more aggressive share buyback program that we implemented. Assuming a June 30 close for Power Solutions, we expect to pay between $3 billion and $3.5 billion of its outstanding debt in Q4 with a portion of the net proceeds. This will result in a reduction of financing costs of about $25 million or $0.02 in the fourth quarter which is included in the full-year guidance that George will provide. Our net debt to cap increased to 36.6% from 33.7% in Q4, related primarily to the share repurchases as well as a reduction in equity related to a Q1 adoption of a new income tax accounting standards. Given our current stock price, we are being very aggressive with our buyback program. We made significant progress toward our full-year share repurchase target of a $1 billion, which will be completed before the closing of the Power Solutions transaction. In Q1, we were purchased just over $14 million shares to approximately $465 million. I would also note that we expect to utilize a portion of the power sale proceeds later in the year to purchase additional shares, which is expected to contribute about $0.03 in incremental earnings for the year. Given our planned share, we post strategy for fiscal '19. We now expect our diluted weighted average shares to be approximately $905 million for the year. Finally, let me touch on a couple other items on slide 15, before I turn it back over to George for fiscal '19 guidance. First based upon some additional tax planning that's been done in part related to the pending sales, Power Solutions, we now expect our effective tax rates and continuing ops in fiscal '19 to be approximately 13.5%. As Antonella mentioned, the results of Power Solutions are now reported as discontinued operations and all historical financial information is presented in the comparable basis. We are well underway with the separation activities and expect the sale to close no later than June 30, and also mentioned the Power Solution shut adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of about $100 million, which is right in line with expectations. And lastly, all the guidance that we provide will be on a continuing ops basis. And we have provided normalized financials in the appendix for competitive purposes, so you can update your models. And with that, I'll turn it back over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to provide you with our outlook for 2019 continuing operations. Let's start by walking through the year-over-year impact of the significant items embedded in our 2019 guidance on slide 16. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we expect mid-single digit organic growth and buildings, which will drive approximately $0.20 of earnings. We expect this growth to be primarily driven by improved volumes and price. We will also have the continued benefits of synergies and productivity savings in buildings in corporate, which we will realize over the course of the year they will contribute an additional $0.19 cents of earnings. Additionally, as Brian discussed the benefit in fiscal 2019 related to the deployment of a portion of the Power Solution sale proceeds is expected to add about $0.05 of earnings. The carryover impact of the sales force investments as well as a few cents of incremental investments in our product businesses are expected to total about $0.07. As you are all aware, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. Based on quarter end rates, we expect this to result in a $0.06 foreign currency headwind year-over-year. Lastly, as you can see, there are various other items, which led to a $0.10 headwind with the most notable being a $0.03 headwind from tax and a $0.02 headwind from both pensions and amortization. All these factors contributed to our fiscal 2019 EPS guidance range before special items of a $1.75 to a $1.85. This represents growth in the range of 10% to 16%. The full detail of our guidance is included on slide 17. Lastly, as a significant portion of the benefit related to the deployment of the Power Solution sale proceeds will benefit fiscal 2020, I wanted to provide a framework for how our earnings are expected to progress as we move forward. As you can see, on slide 18, the incremental benefit of proceeds deployed in 2019, additional share repurchase in 2020 and a reduction in corporate costs is expected to contribute an incremental $0.50 to $0.60 of earnings, which takes our fiscal 2020 EPS in the range of $2.25 to $2.45. This would be prior to any operational growth or benefits from additional capital deployments. Recognizing that we will not receive the full benefit of our reduce share account in fiscal 2020 there will be an incremental benefit of $0.10 to $0.20 in fiscal 2021. Over the last two years, we've been merging two businesses into one and have made a significant amount of progress. During that time, we have reinvested heavily back into the businesses. Now, it's about capitalizing on those investments with how we are going to market. We have been building backlog, which provides us visibility in our field businesses. We've been strengthening our service business, which tend to be more resilient and our short cycle products business is seeing good growth across all three platforms. We are watching closely what is happening economically around the globe and our focuses on execution, and delivering for our customers. We feel good about our position in a very attractive market, and we expect to grow our underlying operations at or above the market for industrial peers as we look ahead. With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question in the queue is from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thanks, good morning, and I appreciate the detail. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Gautam. Brian Stief : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if, George, if you could just maybe directly address the capital allocation with the proceeds of the Power Solutions bin -- just to be clear, we should expect or we should model in that besides the $3 million to $3.5 million of debt repayment, it's all going to be directed at share repurchase, is that a fair conclusion? George Oliver : That is correct. As I said, we're very much focused on executing on the strategy, delivering on the growth, delivering the operational performance, and ultimately delivering results, and our plan today is to take the proceeds from the Power Solutions sales, and as we have said, deploy those as quickly and as efficiently as we can as we -- once we complete the transactions. Gautam Khanna : Got it, that's very helpful. And just in terms of M&A appetite, I mean, do you guys have really any interest in North American resi HVAC as an area of acquisition growth? George Oliver : Well, Gautam, as you know we've been investing heavily back into our products over the last three or four years. We feel very good about our portfolio and the progress we've made and -- with the new products we bring into market, although we are not a leader in that space today, we feel very good about the progress we're making with the share gains that we're making and how we're positioned for the future. So at this stage, we're continuing to focusing on executing on the investments we've made and ultimately delivering the results. Gautam Khanna : Thanks a lot, guys, appreciate it. George Oliver : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. The next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thanks. I was speechless by that last question. George Oliver : Good morning, Jeff. Brian Stief : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Hey, just a couple of things from me. First, Brian, as you may know, there's a lot of noise out there in kind of tax right now with this deductibility issue creating some uncertainty. You know, I assume your guide encapsulates all that, but can you give us a little bit of a update on what change to get you to this lower tax rate in '19 than you were previously thinking, and is there any upward risk to that rate if some of these tax law changes take full effect? Brian Stief : Yes, so I would say that a reduction in the rate, Jeff, to 13.5% was just a function of a lot of planning that was done in contemplation of the Power Solutions sale. You know, we had guided a year or so ago that with -- tax reform is going to impact us by about 2% to 4% prior to any tax planning. And I think our tax team has done a great job of minimizing the impact of tax reforms on our rate and so that 13.5% we're really comfortable with for fiscal '19. As it relates to these proposed reqs that are out that I think you're referring to because we're a fiscal year company, Jeff, that doesn't impact us until 10/01/19, which is our fiscal '20 and at this point in time given the tax structure and footprint that we've got in place, we don't expect a significant impact in 2020 from those proposed reqs. Jeffrey Sprague : Great, thanks for that. And then George, maybe just on kind of the overall price execution, maybe a little bit of an update on what you're actually seeing on price realization and kind of how your price cost dynamics play out in 2019 and how that plays into your margin outlook? George Oliver : Sure. As you know in 2018, we made a lot of progress, we started off with a lot of headwinds and through the course of the year executed extremely well, executing on price. And as we planned for 2019, we not only took into account all of the inflationary pressures on the commodities, but also the impact that we're going to see from tariffs, and so we feel very good about the progress we've made and what we continue to make that we've got not only the inflationary pressures, but the tariffs fully covered in our plan. I would suggest at this stage, we'll see -- of the margin improvement, there's probably 10 to 20 basis points of margin improvement that's attributed to price. And I would tell you across the board, cross all of our products as well as across all of our regions we're now seeing margin accretion as a result of the strategy, the pricing strategy that we've deployed. Jeffrey Sprague : Great thank you. Operator : Next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, guys. It's [indiscernible] speaking on for Andy. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : So, your global products business has been quite strong with the high single digits for over a year now, I think, organic growth. Can you talk about your confidence in sustaining that elevated growth and if there's any way to think about sort of how much of it is market driven versus outcomes of everything you've been doing on your product investment? George Oliver : Now as you know, we've been investing extremely heavily, reinvesting over the last three or four years across each one of the product platforms in what I would say is across the board we are gaining share with the investments we've made, with the new products we're bringing to the market. Brian went through the details here, but if you look at our building management solutions, a combination of all of our digital businesses, we're growing low double-digits and that's a result of the reinvestments we're not only making in our Metasys building controls, but all of the other electronic platforms that now are going to be integrated within our Metasys platform. And so we feel really good about the position that we have in that space. If you look at the other segments in the HVAC space, you know, residential, we're seeing a nice growth across the globe, and that's a combination of what we're doing in North America as well as within our Hitachi JV. In North America, we are seeing -- I think if you look at the last year, over the last year we've had very strong double-digit growth and as we see ourselves going forward, we see that continuing. So the investments we're making there have been very, very strong. The other is in the light commercial. We're seeing very nice growth in the quarter in our light commercial business globally. That again is double digits. And then when you look at our applied business with the investments we've made not only in our chillers, but in our air handling equipment, and the deployment of that in new projects, we're seeing very nice pickup in share gain, pretty much across the globe. And so I think it's a factor of both the space -- the HVAC space is continuing to expand and with the investments that we had been making and executing on, it's given us an opportunity that within that expansion, we're enabling ourselves to be able to gain share. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, it seems like your applied business has continued to accelerate and I know you mentioned some potential equipment pull forward here at of pricing, but are you also seeing U.S. institutional markets accelerating and how much contribution are you getting from new products like your new chiller that you rolled out? George Oliver : Yes, so as we look at this space, we do see the institutional vertical is coming back pretty strong, and as you know that we have a very strong position in that, you know, if you look at our North America applied business, when you look at our orders, our orders are up mid-teens, and as I said earlier, a very strong sudden push [ph], and I think that again is because of the verticals we support, the investments we're making in the new products, and then our go-to-market in making sure that we're getting more than our fair share as we execute on the pipeline. Our pipeline right now is up double digits across the globe, and so as you look at our orders globally, we achieved 7% with a backlog up about the same, and with the confidence that I have in the pipeline and the way that we've been converting on that pipeline over the last three or four quarters gives me confidence that we're going to be well-positioned here to deliver on 2019 and beyond. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Hello. Can you hear me? Antonella Franzen : Yes, we can hear you. George Oliver : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Thank God, I mean, just to make clear [indiscernible] music. So that's got to be very clear. George Oliver : We enjoyed the music, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Thanks for the second part of the apple here. So just to just be very clear, George, you're encouraged not to bake in all the proceeds $8 billion or whatever it is from the disposable x debt reduction into share repurchases as of 4Q, 1Q next year, is that the message? George Oliver : That is correct. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's pretty clear. Can we just turn to -- I got two quick questions, one do you have a handle on the free cash flow profiles to new JCI? Obviously, the old JCI has a very backend loaded free cash generation. How does the new JCI look? Obviously, you had a negative in 1Q, which I think was expected but how does that then progress through 2Q and into second-half of the year? George Oliver : Yes, I think it's going to be consistent and we will continue to be backend loaded. I mean, if you look at our building's profitability it's in the back half of the year. So I think you can look at this and assume it's going to be pretty consistent with what we've seen historically. First quarter is a cash outflow. We get most of that back plus or minus breakeven, maybe a little positive year-to-date in Q2 and then it will be the back half what we delivered, the majority of the cash to get us to the 95%, but all thanks for tracking for that right now. We're pretty pleased with how it came out first quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then, turn to China and the competitive nature of that market you pulled out, what specifically you have seen the competition, is it foreign securities, that's HVAC commercial versus residential, it sounds like it's commercial, and you've seen it mainly from local players, or MNCs and any color there will be helpful? George Oliver : Yes. so I mean, we're making good progress in China when you look at our revenue or up low double-digits pretty much led by HVAC and refrigeration, so we're seeing good execution there, most of our footprint there is in the commercial space, very strong in the applied HVAC, we've got a tremendous position as well as we're position locally with our supply chain, with a very one of our -- let's say highest performing plants and so we're positioned well within that market our orders. When you look at our orders is up almost double-digits and in addition Nigel to making sure that we're building the install base we've been accelerating our service growth and so we're seeing orders in our services now up kind of 20 plus percent in that space. And so, not only are we continuing to expand our install base, but on top of that, being able to execute now in the service opportunities. So when we talk about margins, we did as we look at the overall region is mainly driven by the mix of install, and then the mix of the China growth relative to the overall APAC region. We are beginning to execute and accelerate service growth, which will help mitigate some of that that acceleration of install. But I feel confident that the fundamentals were ultimately driving, how we're going to be positioned for the rest of the year. We'll see continued improvement there. Nigel Coe : Okay. George you are really the best. Thanks very much. Antonella Franzen : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : I wish I had that fancy theme music\u2026 Antonella Franzen : Are you in-charge? Steve Tusa : Yes. That's good marketing by Nigel. George Oliver : Good morning Steve. Steve Tusa : Good morning. The just kind of the -- I know you guys have a lot of different businesses in there. But residential HVAC pricing is obviously been very strong, can you maybe dig into what you're seeing from a price perspective on the kind of core applied side and what you expect to kind of put through for 2019 calendar in the various regions? George Oliver : Yes, so across the board, we -- as we get into this starting out last year with my transition, we got deep into each one of the segments not only the product segments, but regionally and went about making sure across the board we had good understanding of the cost structure and the inflationary pressures coming through as well as what we could expect from a tariff standpoint. And so, Steve across the board we've been executing strong pricing in every one of our categories, every one of our regions. Now what I would tell you is that when you look at our growth last year I believe we suggest you it's about 1% or 2% of our growth, given the progress we made across the board that's going to be elevated here in 2019 additional, percentage of our growth and I think given the work we've done, you could see similar type improvements across the other product segments as you're seeing within our residential business. Steve Tusa : Got it. Okay. And are you seeing any pockets of competitive behavior from your domestic competitors? I know, carriers trying to come out with the new products and it doesn't seem like train is mucking it up. So any anything out of your kind of a domestic kind of North American competitors, you're seeing anybody get aggressive to get new products into the channel? George Oliver : I mean, I think across the board, there's some, you could go through each one of our competitors and the new products coming to market. I think you would have seen it at AHRI this year that's pretty much across the board. We've been focusing on how do we create value in each one of the segments for our customers? What's, from a technology standpoint, what is going to differentiate us from the competitors, I think we're executing well, and as a result of that, when we bring these new products to the market, there's a much higher value proposition that we make to our customers, which allows us to be able to get additional price. And so, I think you would have seen that there are some other new products coming in the market. I will tell you my assessment, given the investments we're making, I feel very confident with what we're doing and how it compares to our competitors and truly believe that as we continue to move forward with these product introductions, we're going to continue to gain share. Steve Tusa : Yes, clearly a great presence at AHRI and good nice espresso bar upstairs as well. I appreciate that late in the afternoon. One last question for you, just on kind of seasonality and anything unusual, seasonally here as you move into the second quarter, and how that should behave financially, anything moving around? George Oliver : No, I mean, what I would say Steve is when you look at the total year. I mean, when you separate Power Solutions, the remaining company we are typically now historically been 30% for staff 70% back half. Obviously, we are off to a nice start here in 2019. I see that continuing. And so, when you look at our performance, we're going to continue to drive strong order growth, we're going to continue to convert revenue, kind of mid-single digit based on the backlog we see and how that's going to flow and then we'll continue to deliver a very strong cash flow, as we continue to execute to the year, so I don't see anything significantly different than what historically we've done. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Next question is from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Hey, good morning, everybody. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Good Morning. Tim Wojs : Maybe just on the building's margins, how much of a kind of the sequential improvement that's implied for the rest of the year? Is really Asia kind of getting back to EIBT margin expansion versus, extra synergy realization or some of the investments? George Oliver : Yes. When you look at the underlying margins that we're projecting for buildings here in 2019, it's -- was the overall it's going to be 40 to 60 basis points. And that's being driven by strong -- the pickup that we get on the volume in the mix, the strong productivity, synergies productivity that we're delivering, and that's being then offset by this is a few headwinds which we talked about which was we still have the run rate of our sales investments from 2018 coming through the first-half of this year, and that's roughly about 30 -- about 30 basis points. And then, the other as we do have as Brian talked about some pension headwind as well as equity income that year-on-year is a little bit of a pressure, but operationally with what's coming through not only the growth what's coming through on price is ultimately is what's delivering on that 40 to 60 basis points. That's pretty broad base across each of the businesses. You know, what I would say in APAC, we had said we're going to have pressure in APAC given what we had in backlog that was going to convert the first part of this year, I would tell you that we are executing on the fundamentals, we are improving those fundamentals, we are growing the service business which is higher margin and the combination is what's going to be able to flow through the year and be able to contribute to that 40 to 60 basis points of improvement. Tim Wojs : Okay, so it sounds like that 30 basis point headwind on investments that should taper as you go through the year? George Oliver : That is correct. Tim Wojs : Okay, great. And then just on free cash flow, I know the gap is closer now. It's 95% plus ex-power. What do you guys need to do internally to maybe get that in line with better than earnings? Are there any big buckets that you can tap to, to improve that metric? Thanks. Brian Stief : Yes. I mean we have made good progress I guess just to comment on trade capital, I mean our DPO year-over-year has improved by six days. Our DSOs improved by a couple days. We are flattish relative to inventory. So if there was an area that I think we need to go to work on a bit more inventory is probably an area that we are going to be spending some more time on in fiscal '19. When you actually look at trade working capital as a percentage of sales, December 31 last year versus December 31 this year, we are actually improved by 130 basis points which is giving some of the basis for why we are moving to a 95% plus free cash flow number here. But I think we are making progress. There are certainly areas that we continue to look at across the globe. I mean we looked at our larger markets first. So I just expect gradual improvement as we move into 2020. Operator : Next question in the queue is from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : George, just wanted to follow-up on your comment on some of the unitary businesses and the share gains, the investment. I guess the piece that it's harder for us to see is on the distribution side and getting these products out to market. I think historically that's been one of the challenges for anyone trying to gain share. With all the new products, are you finding the ability to kind of add store fronts or add distribution points within in resi and commercial unitary? George Oliver : Absolutely. As you look at all of the regions certainly we tailor our strategy depending on the region and where we have a strong position, where we have weak positions. We are not only putting our own distribution in place, but also other distributors that we are working with to expand our presence within the each of the key markets that is absolutely tied to reinvestments that we are making within the new products to assure that as we are reinvesting, we are positioned from a go-to market to be able to return to get the returns on that investment. So absolutely, and I think when you look at our relative performance over last year, we have been able to do what we have said relative to continuing to launch new product, expand distribution, and grow at or above the market rate. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, that's helpful. And then just taking a step back on margins and operating leverage at large. We are kind of halfway through the synergy calendar at this point. I guess looking at incremental margins here understanding you can get a little tailwind from price that investment is a drag but obviously something that needs be done. How should we think about structural incremental margins here? Because it seems like some of the synergy upside you are deploying back into business and there is only another year left after '19. Is the underlying incremental margin in the business still around 20% or how should we think about that shift over time? George Oliver : Yes, so I'd frame in up, if you start 2018, our incremental margins as you suggested in the low 20s. When you look at and a lot of that was driven because we had reinvestment in sales in the sales force ahead of our growth. And we've had historically over the last three or four years, the reinvestments in our product and technology was ahead of our growth. What you see happening in 2019 now that begins -- that reinvestment now begins to level out as a percent of revenue. And so our field businesses should be -- on a go forward basis should be in high teens to low 20s recognizing that that business is very much driven by variable labor. And in the products businesses now with the investments that we have made and the growth that we are achieving should now become more like mid to upper 20s. And so, I think as we get through the year as we lap some of these headwinds that we had in the first half with the year-on-year compares, we are going to start to see some nice leverage going forward. So I would target incremental is to be over the next couple of years kind of mid to -- kind of mid 20s plus over the next couple of years. Josh Pokrzywinski : Inclusive of synergies? George Oliver : That's correct. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks, George. Operator : Next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Noah Kaye : Hi, thanks for taking the question and great to see the continued solid execution. And George, I think I would like to return to the capital allocation question for a minute. You were very clear this morning that the power proceeds will go towards debt pay down and share repurchases. And I guess my question is given that the new JCI is really about smart, safe, efficient, sustainable buildings, how are you thinking about opportunities for additions or adjacencies whether it's HVAC as someone mentioned earlier or lighting? And why wouldn't you be looking to augment the portfolio at this point if it's sort of where you think the cycle is, is it evaluation? Help us understand that. George Oliver : Yes. I mean we are always looking at the portfolio to make sure that from an organic standpoint we are making the right investments for getting the intended returns on those investments. And what I would say is that we feel really good about the progress we made with our organic investments. And that being said, as we look at the trends, customer trends and industry trends, we are also making sure that we look forward we are making or comparing our organic investments against what can be done from an acquisition or investment standpoint. And so what I would tell you is that as we look at our position, we feel really good about our position with the work that we have done here over the last couple of years. Now we are always looking at to make sure that as we look at the ability to be able to create value, I will tell you we are always looking to make sure that we are standing on offense and understanding the trends and what we are going to do to be positioned to be able to achieve those trends. So, at this stage given where we are, given the progress we have made with reinvestments, given the success we have had with our sales force, we are focused on executing and being able to deliver on the commitments we have made in delivering strong results. Noah Kaye : Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks very much. Operator : Next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, just want to go back to slide 18, just to make sure I understand that footnote and maybe it's earnings fatigue, and you have already mentioned it, but what's the -- when you say that the $0.10 to $0.20 benefit is excluded that's coming in fiscal '21. Could you remind us what that piece is? Brian Stief : Yes. So if you look at the overall $0.75 that we have kind of talked about historically, there was a nickel of that that's in '19 that we talked about for '19 guidance. So then we were saying that was the midpoint of $0.55 in fiscal '20. And then there is midpoint $0.15 in 2021. That's how you get to that full $0.75 we have talked about historically. And the reason there is $0.15 still coming in 2021 is because no matter what share repurchase approach we use, we aren't going to get the full benefit likely in fiscal '20. And so, there will be a carryon effect in 2021 from an EPS standpoint that will get that's really a byproduct of the whatever repurchase program approach we use whether it's open market purchases, whether it's ASR, or whether it's some form of a general combination of those. But the way we have model it now, there is $01.5 more than would come in 2021 to get us to full $0.75. Deane Dray : Right. That was a great explanation. Thank you. And then for George, couple of times you have mentioned the service opportunity. And I heard you say that today service is two-thirds recurring. And what's the right mix? Or, what's the right ratio there in terms of optimizing the service offering from a margin standpoint? George Oliver : Yes. So, Deane, we made strategic -- we have made service growth one of our strategic imperatives when I took over. And it's an incredible business. Like I said, it's over $6 billion globally. And traditionally, it's been more of the maintenance and repair of the installed base, getting some recurrent revenue through PSAs, doing some monitoring in the -- within the Fire & Security businesses. And what I would say is we have been incredible opportunity to takeover we have done today in the 60% to 65% is mainly contracts that get renewed for that type of work, and what we are doing today is above and beyond that we are deploying now new solutions utilizing the data, using AI, and now it enables us to be able to optimize not only the maintenance of those -- that equipment, but also beyond what we historically have done to be able to create new value propositions through new business models and leveraging technology. So, I'm pretty excited about the progress we have made, recognize that we started at a standstill in 2017, our service growth was, I think 1% in 2017, through the course of 2018, we ramped from 3% to 4% to 5% to 6%, and then again in the first quarter here, we are all pretty strong with 6% growth. And so, it's a combination of not only getting a higher percentage of the traditional work that we get on the install-base we create, but it's also creating new business that we deploy on top of that install-base, which is more wide space for us, which is a significant opportunity for us to be able to contribute to the growth. Deane Dray : Terrific. George, just lastly, any encouraging words for the Patriots on Sunday? George Oliver : No comments. Deane Dray : Come on. A guy from Worcester you think would be\u2026 George Oliver : No, go past, I guess. Deane Dray : Okay, thank you. I got what I was looking for. Antonella Franzen : Operator, I would like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments. George Oliver : All right, thanks again everyone for joining our call this morning. As you have seen, we have made a tremendous amount of progress in 2018, and I think most important now is that we are building on that momentum in 2019, and certainly look forward to engaging many of you here over the next few weeks. Operator, that concludes our call.",

I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls second quarter fiscal 2019 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site at johnsoncontrols.com. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Let me start with some of the high level strategic highlights from the quarter, beginning on Slide 4. We delivered another quarter of solid results with continued improvement across a majority of our underlying fundamental metrics. The investments we\u2019ve made throughout the sales organization and into new product development, combined with our ongoing efforts around commercial excellence, continue to drive strong organic top line growth across the board. We continue to grow our service business. A key element of our overall strategy in enhancing value for our buildings customers. And as I will share with you in just a second, these efforts are increasingly being acknowledged by our customers. With the exception of Asia Pacific, margins were higher in each segments as we remain focused on driving productivity optimizing our cost structure and improving our pricing discipline across our product categories as well as in our project businesses. Operational leverage is improving, which will become more evident over the next several quarters as the pricing we\u2019ve built into the system over the last 12 months fully matures and raw materials and tariff impacts have stabilized. Brian Stief : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. So let's start on Slide 7 and look at our year-over-year EPS bridge. As you can see operational performance including synergies and productivity contributed about $0.10. And this was partially offset by $0.02 of continued product investments and the carryover run rate of our fiscal '18 sales force additions. We also saw some other items create $0.02 worth headwinds related primarily to FX, and its below the line items. But as George mentioned, overall EPS in the quarter was up 23%. So moving to Slide 8, let's take a look at buildings on a consolidated basis. Sales of $5.8 billion increased 6% organically led by continued strength in our shorter cycle product segment, which was up 7% and 6% growth in our field businesses where we saw continued strength in service and project installation, which were up 5% and 6%, respectively. The continued strength in our field business is a reflection of the strong backlog we've been doing over the past several quarters. Total segment EBITDA of $671 million grew 11% organically, driven by strong growth from our field and product businesses as well as ongoing productivity and cost synergy save. Total segment EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points on an organic basis to a 11.6%. And as you can see in the waterfall underlying operational improvement contributed about 100 basis points and this was partially offset by the product investments and run rate sales force additions. George Oliver : Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the lines for questions, just a quick update on our 2019 guidance starting with our EPS walk on Slide 17. The only change to our bridge versus what we shared with you last quarter is the EPS benefit associated with the use of proceeds related to the Power sale. With the earlier close, we've updated all of our assumptions with respect to net interest savings associated with our planned debt reductions as well as the reduction in share count, we should be able to achieve with our planned share tender. There are no changes to any of our operating assumptions or other below the line items. The additional $0.10 benefit from use of proceeds results in an increase to our adjusted EPS from continuing operations range to $1.85 to $1.95. This represents year-over-year EPS growth of 16% to 23%. Just to reaffirm some of the details of our underlying operating assumptions on Slide 18, again you will see there are no changes with the exception of the two items we\u2019ve a boxed for you. And just a few final comments before we get to your questions. We are encouraged by our performance year-to-date and feel very confident in our outlook for the second half. Our end markets due remain healthy. Our competitive position is strong and we are well-positioned. As we close an important chapter in the history of Johnson Controls with the Power Solution sale, we're extremely excited to capitalize on the opportunities we have in front of us as one of the industry's leading building solution providers. With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions. Operator :  Thank you. The first question in the queue is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on closing the deal early. Brian Stief : Thanks, Nigel. George Oliver : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Good morning, guys. I\u2019m not that familiar with the modified Dutch auction process. Maybe just why $4 billion, if you kind of push up to $8 billion, could it not have been up to closer to the $8 billion number. And then, does -- once it's closed, does that in anyway restrict you on further repurchases in the open market, ASRs or deal flow? Brian Stief : So as it relates to the modified Dutch auction, I mean, the way that process works, that will be launched this week. And as I mentioned, it's got a floor price of 36, and it's got a top end price of 40. And as the book gets built over the next 20 business days or so, we would expect that tender to be completed sometime in early June. As far as the amount of the tender itself, I mean that was -- there's a lot of discussions with our -- among the management team here and outside advisors regarding what the right limit is for going into the market and buying back shares at this time. And I think $4 billion was a number that we all landed on. I would just point out that there's an opportunity for us to upsize that by $500 million should we decide to do that. So right now I think in terms of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, but our initial play is going to be at the $4 billion level and we'll see how demand plays out. And your second part of the question, Nigel? I\u2019m sorry it was what? Nigel Coe : Yes, Brian, so thanks for the detail. Just -- does it in anyway bind you from a time period on further repurchases, so M&A any restrictions following the close of the deal? Brian Stief : No, not at all. Not at all. There's -- the implications of the tender really provide us more optionality after the tender is complete to decide if we move forward share repurchases what approach we may use. Nigel Coe : Great. And then just my follow on is, George, here, obviously, you\u2019re expressing a high degree of confidence in your end markets and the order flow. Turning to your short cycle businesses within products, I mean, in '15, '16 we did see some pressure from channel from oil and gas pressures in some of the businesses. Have you seen any signs of pressure in some of the shorter cycle businesses? George Oliver : Not at all, Nigel. If anything, we\u2019ve seen a very robust market within these businesses. If you look at our -- mainly in our Fire & Security product businesses, we are up low teens and that\u2019s across both all three of the key platforms here, fire detection, security as well as in specialty products with our fire suppression business. In addition, that\u2019s supported with the field up above mid single digits and that's pretty much broad-based across the globe. So there's really no signs right know on the short cycle metrics that would suggest that there's any significant slowdown here. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Molinari : Good morning. This is Jeff on for Gautam. Thanks for taking my question here. George Oliver : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Molinari : So a quick one on the Power proceeds. What's baked into your guide assumption as far as the debt reduction? Is it the $1.5 billion or the $3.4 billion? And also what about -- which -- what repo assumption is baked into that guide, the math like a tender dollar amount for '19? Brian Stief : Yes. So the debt pay down, so $11.6 billion is net proceeds. Debt pay down is $3.4 billion. The $1.5 billion is actually a tender that's part of the $3.4 billion to buy back that debt. The remaining $1. 9 billion will be taken out over the next several weeks through either normal maturities of debt or commercial paper pay down. So $3.4 billion of debt which will generate $40 million a save this year in annual run rate of a $100 million. As far as the share repurchase, what\u2019s baked into the guidance we've given you is $4 billion in a tender that will be taken out by early June. And then the remaining $4.2 billion we had to make some assumptions relative to what we were earning to calculate our guidance based upon. So we've assumed the remaining $4.2 billion for now will be put on our balance sheet in some intro on -- some interest earning investment. And then as we make final decisions on what approach in share repurchase we\u2019re going to use, we will update the guidance accordingly. Jeffrey Molinari : Okay. That\u2019s clear. So any -- that would be incremental. And then maybe one on order pipeline, if I may. So you mentioned Q3 orders are tracking mid to high single digits. Can you kind of dissect that a little bit by HVAC product like unitary, applied, resi, kind of which is the strongest or just any color there would be helpful? Thank you. George Oliver : Yes, when you look at our -- if you just look at what played through in Q2 is that strong product growth and that\u2019s been pretty much across the board, double-digit growth in our building management systems. Mid to upper single-digit growth in our HVAC platform, and as we talked about in our specialty products, we had nice double-digit growth. So that\u2019s continuing. When you look at our field and our installations as well as service, it's broad-based across all of the domains with the project pipeline that\u2019s been building and what we\u2019ve been able to convert here in the quarter and what we see in the pipeline to convert here in the third and fourth quarter. So it's -- obviously, we are performing very well in HVAC. When you look at our HVAC businesses across the globe, I would say that we are beginning to really accelerate our performance and then with that we're seeing the volumes come through. That is putting a little bit of -- from a mix standpoint at the gross margin level, a little bit of pressure on our business, but overall we\u2019ve been performing well. So just to sum up, I would say, it's broad based. It's across all domains, across all regions and a nice split between both project based business as well as service business with service grown above 5%. Operator : Next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. George, you made a comment in your opening remarks about I think operating leverage really picking up or kicking in the higher gear or words to that effect in the back half. I just wondered if you could elaborate on that a little bit more right from our seat, kind of the observed incremental just that the segment levels 28%, which is solid underneath that its actually better, right, with the currency and other noise. But it's not clear to me from the guide that we would observe much more than high 20s, maybe it's 30-ish or so in the back half. But any other color on all those dynamics, the leverage, how price cost is playing through and how to think about how that scales up into the back half will be helpful. George Oliver : Let me start by saying that when you look at our incremental margins today, Jeff, they were actually in the low 20s and that\u2019s before productivity and investments. So when you look at the mix of that, it's really driven by high teens within our field businesses and upper -- mid to upper 20s in our product base businesses. And so on a go forward basis, when we look at what we're doing both from a pricing standpoint and productivity standpoint, we are -- we\u2019ve a roadmap to get those businesses on the incremental margins to mid 20s. And that's driven by getting our field businesses up to 20% plus in our product base businesses, up to 30% plus over the next couple of years. Now recognize when you look at our price -- pricing activity this year, we made significant progress. Last year we got behind and for the year we were negative. I think it was roughly about $35 million. Now with all of the actions that we took in the second half of last year and then we\u2019ve continued that this year taken into account not only the inflationary pressures, but also the tariffs, we feel very confident that through the course of the year that\u2019s going to continue to accrete margins pretty much across the board and very confident of that. So when you look at the year, we are going to continue to grow kind of mid single digits across the board. That levers nicely. So it's -- when you look at the total year, it's about 30 basis points of leverage. It's about 60 basis points of productivity in synergies that somewhat offset with the reinvestments that we're making, that kind of the business through sales force as well as technology. We do have a little bit of pension headwind and that nets us to being able to achieve about 40 to 60 basis points for the year across all of the businesses. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thanks for that additional detail. And then just back to redeployment, as I\u2019m sure you know, HVAC consolidation speculation has been ramped for the better part of six months or so. Can you just update us on your view on that? It would seem going ahead with plan A on the tender and the debt reduction would be a fairly clear indication that in the near-term you don't see an opportunity there, but I don\u2019t want to put words into your mouth. Just what do you see kind of the optionality moving forward for this pure play building efficiency company that you\u2019ve created. George Oliver : Yes. So, I mean, when I look at where we are, it's been as I\u2019ve communicated multiple times, we are very much focused on execution. We have an incredible portfolio that has historically underperformed. We are beginning to accelerate our performance, beginning to get more consistent performance, delivering on our commitments and as I said there's tremendous runway here as we continue to improve. And that\u2019s been the focus. And so when we announce that we were going to redeploy the proceeds not only in the debt pay down, but also the buybacks it's believing that we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity here in front of us. We did announce the $4 billion tender. And as Brian mentioned, we'll see how that plays out and we have every intend here to continue with the plan that we have to buy back up to roughly $8.2 billion in buybacks. Now relative to the industry, certainly a lots of speculation. I\u2019m not going to speculate on it. Certainly, when I stepped up to take over, we recognize that the building space is a very attractive end market and we had tremendous opportunity to reinvest and be able to deliver on growth. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing. And as you\u2019ve seen others, they\u2019re doing similar, right? They\u2019re streamlining their portfolios and positioning to do the same. But at this stage, I think we have a tremendous opportunity with the investments we've made and the continued investments we're making to be able to deliver a strong performance. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Steve. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing in China. You put up some pretty good growth there. Obviously, the order slowed a little bit, but maybe just delve into a bit of the dynamics there on HVAC? George Oliver : Yes, let me start, Steve, by saying it's roughly about 6% of our total revenues and it's broken out into about two thirds in the field and a third in products. And so we were -- this is something we\u2019re watching closely, because as things with all of the trade discussions and maybe seeing a little bit of the slow down we were concerned for the year. I think through the course of second quarter, we are feeling a little bit better that I think as Brian went through the segment, we are seeing good order growth, good pipeline development. And then from a revenue standpoint, we actually did better than what we originally thought and how we converted revenue in the quarter. And so we still want to make sure that we\u2019re watching this closely to make sure that with the investments we're making there, that -- they\u2019re going to play out as planned. But at this stage and the other part I notice from a service standpoint not only is it important to get higher market share in the install base, but we've been very much focused on getting the service revenues. And so right now it is ramping up. It's about a third of our revenues in China. We see this as a big opportunity going forward, especially as we -- if we were to get into a down cycle, this would be a very attractive segment for us. Steve Tusa : Thanks for that. Also just following up on Jeff's question, how do you view the market share dynamics of commercial? I know there is really only three major applied guys -- applied suppliers in the U.S. But obviously applied is kind of a loose term, if you will, it's customized work. I mean, when you kind of look at the market structure, do you look at it as three major players in the U.S and pretty consolidated or do you look at it as there's various verticals within, in which there are kind of a range of solutions that compete in those markets. Does that make -- does that question make any sense whatsoever? George Oliver : Yes. Let me give it a shot. Let me start with the residential, because I think it builds into the commercial. Residential is a space that we\u2019re obviously not in the top two or three. And this is based that we\u2019ve been reinvesting in North America with new product and as well as expanding our distribution and that\u2019s playing through pretty nicely. Our residential North America business was up 11% and that\u2019s to a tough prior year comp. Steve Tusa : Right. George Oliver : And a lot of that not only is the technology and the product, but also of course would be the pricing increases that we've seen here over in the last 12 to 18 months. Now if we talk about commercial, this is where we\u2019ve been relatively strong and then there are three key players here in this space. Certainly that we had over the last decade had underinvested. Over the last two or three years, we\u2019ve significantly ramped up that investment. And I believe with the products that you see coming to market now are going to be very well-positioned to be able to gain more of that share. A big focus, our strength here is in national accounts, so there might be some segmentation of the market with how we serve customers. But I think when you look at our commercial HVAC equipment, it's up 13%. Steve Tusa : Yes, I guess, I\u2019m just asking about market structure. I guess a very simple way to ask it a little bit -- put it a little bit more of a finer point. Is it consolidated or am I -- are we looking at it the wrong way? Should it be segmented in a, hey, there are various solutions for these buildings, and so it's not as saturated or consolidated as it would look when we just talk about a chiller, which is basically Carrier, York and Trane, right? That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m asking. George Oliver : Well, I mean, when you look at the commercial space, what I would say, it's similar. When you look at the landscape within the market, its similar to the applied space we have five or six key players. Now there's differing footprints and different product mixes within that, but there's mainly five or six key players within the commercial space. Steve Tusa : Okay. Would you consider that that saturated and consolidated or not? George Oliver : I\u2019m not going to -- I mean, at this stage I think I\u2019m not going to speculate, Steve, relative to each of the players in the market positions. But what I would say is that we're focused on the investments we're making and making sure that we've got the right footprint in how we go to market to be able gain market share and grow within the key end markets that we\u2019re serving. Steve Tusa : Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot. George Oliver : All right. Operator : Next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning, Andy. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : George, despite the slowing in field order in the quarter, you obviously seemed quite positive about your pipeline. You made a comment in the presentation, I think for the first time around your field backlog that you now have some visibility into fiscal '20? Could you elaborate on what that means? Do you have enough projects now in backlog where you feel that field sales growth has a good chance of continuing to grow in the mid single-digit range in 2020? George Oliver : Yes, let me start by saying that when we book projects, on the short end, they turn within three to six months or some can be multi-year. Our average project turn is somewhere around depending on the mix, it's typically about a year. So we are now building a pipeline, as I said, we\u2019ve a very strong pipeline. Pipelines were up high single digits. We continue to add sales force. Now we\u2019re maintaining our sales cost as a percent of revenue now, because we\u2019re getting productivity with the sales force that we had added last year. So in line with that, we continue to expand our sales force. We are going after this pipeline, converting the pipeline and what we are turning now, we have some projects that will support the second half, but there is -- a lot of the projects that we are executing today that will set us up with backlog for 2020. And so, that\u2019s what gives me confidence that as we continue to execute through 2019 that we will see that -- we will see continued progress here as we are setting up 2020. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, George. At this point though in the year, you would say above the average visibility into the next year versus what you've seen? George Oliver : Absolutely. I mean, we have -- we are halfway through the year. Like I said and with the pipelines that we have, all of our pipelines attract across the board now. We can see that by segmentation, by region, by install, by service and through our regular reviews, monthly reviews, I'm very encouraged in our ability to be able to continue to support the execution through the second half of 2019, but even more important now, setting up for that continuing in 2020. Andrew Kaplowitz : And Brian, I just wanted to ask you about cash flow. Obviously, you\u2019ve kept the guide at 95% conversion. Seasonally, we'd expect a bigger ramp up in the second half of the year. You talked in the past about needing to go after pockets of inventory that you have in your business, maybe standardizing cash collection in some of your smaller markets and collecting more from your JVs. So can you give us the confidence level that you have to get more cash out of your business in these areas, and how important are they to reach the goal for the year? Brian Stief : I think if you look at last year and the third quarter, our free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow was $0.5 billion. We are expecting about $600 million in Q3 of this year. And then last year Q4 was about $900 million and we're expecting -- I'm rounding number here, $1 billion, $1 billion plus in Q4 of this year. So with those numbers, we deliver the 95% free cash flow. I would tell you from the standpoint of improvements that we are making, if you look at year-over-year trade working capital as a percentage of sales, we\u2019ve made a 40 basis point improvement in March of last year to March of this year. And I also look at things sequentially and sequentially we've gone from 12.1% at the end of the first quarter to 12% at the end of the second quarter. So, we are seeing improvements in trade working capital as a percentage of sales. Now having said that, if I look at trade working capital globally and where we've made progress with our cash management office over the last 15 months or so, I would tell you that payables, we standardize terms with our vendors. I think we've got things in really good working order in most major locations as it relates to payables. When I look at inventory, I would say there's probably a couple of pockets, one in Japan, one in North America that we need to go to work on. But we are talking huge numbers. It's probably $50 million to $100 million of opportunity. And the area that I think we really can continue to improve on is accounts receivable and we've kind of got all hands on deck on that as we speak and we are going to see that gradually improve and actually that improvement is what\u2019s driving some of the year-over-year improvement that we are going to see in the back half of this year versus the back half of last year. And then the last thing I'd say relative to joint venture dividends, we continue to have conversations with our joint venture partners, regarding whether or not we take out current dividends or reinvest those in the business and we will update you as we move through the rest of the year. Most of those conversations take place in the back half of our fiscal year with decisions made at that time. So we are hopeful that over the next several months here, that we can get some positive developments relative to our joint venture dividends as well. But that\u2019s all kind of baked into our 95% guidance we provided. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. David Lu : Good morning, everyone. This is David Lu on for Deane. I just have one question. I know you mentioned orders tracking on mid to high-single digits for the third quarter, but did you see any level of pull-in of customer spending from the second half of the year into the first half to get ahead of tariffs or price increases? Any material impact there? George Oliver : No, I think we saw a normal flow in the quarter and we track these year-on-year, but nothing unusual or significant as far as that. Antonella Franzen : David, the only thing we talked about last quarter remember is in North America we did see some pull-forward from Q2 to Q1, but nothing from second half into first half. David Lu : Got it. And then if I can just sneak one more in. Any update on tariff headwinds? I know the list three tariffs kind of stay at the 10% range, but you were projecting for I think 130 to 140 of total headwinds between 2018 and 2019. Could we potentially see some upside from lower cost increases here? George Oliver : That\u2019s about the range that on a 2-year basis the impact that we are seeing, and as I've said earlier that, we are well positioned from a pricing standpoint to offset those. Certainly, we\u2019ve been planning our supply chain so that on a go-forward basis, we can mitigate some of that. But our plan right now is we are planning for these tariffs and that\u2019s what ultimately is in our guidance. David Lu : Great. Thank you very much. George Oliver : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Wojs : Hi, everybody. Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Tim. George Oliver : Good morning, Tim. Tim Wojs : Just wanted to go back to pricing and just try to -- George, is there a way to kind of frame what pricing in backlog and your orders is right now versus what might be running through the P&L or what that looked like maybe a year-ago? George Oliver : Yes. So, the easiest way to frame it up is a year-ago pricing on our revenue was -- impacted our revenue by 1% to 2% and then pricing this year is going to be 2% to 3%. And so, think about it as an order of magnitude what\u2019s coming through on price. And so that is in our product businesses, it's shorter cycle. So you see the realization quicker. You will see realization on service increases quicker and then the one that's been more of a -- of a cycle time impact is the work we are doing around our installation project-based business. Tim Wojs : Okay. Okay, great. And then, I think you had mentioned this, but I missed it. On the gross margins is -- I think they\u2019re down slightly year-on-year, year-to-date. Is that really more a function of mix relative to price cost or anything else that\u2019s kind of running through there? George Oliver : Yes, the two areas that we\u2019ve had the pressure, let me start with APAC. It's been -- mainly we\u2019ve been foreshadowing that here this year because of what we had in backlog. That\u2019s going to play out in the second half of the year, but with the work we are doing that will begin to improve and we will see that in 2020. The other is the mix of -- when you look at North America -- when you look at the domain together, we are performing in HVAC very well, and at the gross margin level, that's less in Fire & Security. But other than that, we are getting price and margin expansion across all domains and across all regions in the plan as we execute on the second half. Tim Wojs : Great. Well, good luck on the second half. Thanks. Antonella Franzen : Thanks. George Oliver : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Brian Stief : Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Josh. George Oliver : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground on the quarter, maybe shifting gears thinking about where we are at in the cycle. I think one of your competitors yesterday -- I will put words in their mouth a little bit, it seems like we are in a bit of a golden age for HVAC and kind of building investment in general that between energy, efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions that folks are just spending a lot more and putting a lot more attention on that, which seems to favor the JCI portfolio. Within that, do you feel like you are winning your entitlement or have you seen new entrants or kind of new product lines pop up in the space? First question there. George Oliver : So, you are absolutely right. The opportunity that we have around sustainability and energy reduction does play to our strengths. I highlighted a couple of examples that we\u2019ve recently won. We are executing with the University of Hawaii and the other is a new project that is all focused on sustainability and being the smartest building in the Middle East. So the reason why we are well positioned not only do we have leadership HVAC, which as we know is a significant consumption of energy, but that combined with our building management systems and our ability to optimize not only the equipment, but beyond the equipment, the rest -- the use of the building is what ultimately delivers on the vision of our customers. And so what I would tell you is that in our building management systems, we had double-digit growth. I mean we are at low teens in the quarter. And that's the way that we serve the market today. What\u2019s happening is, as we move forward, those capabilities are converging. It's enabling us now to use our digital vault, which is our proprietary cloud-based data solution to be able to deliver on what I would say is entitlement of energy reduction. And so for us, I think in spite of the cycle, that\u2019s going to be an attractive space for us and one that we are well positioned. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. So you don\u2019t see anything competitively changing or new entrants or anything like that? George Oliver : No, what I would say is that it's a combination of having leadership product, having technology platforms and then having a footprint in the key markets that you're serving that is close to customers and being able to take their vision with ours and convert it into what the next generation solution is going to be and that\u2019s what we are doing. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just to pivot a little bit off of that, how pleased are you today with your mix, George? I think looking at some of the other folks in the HVAC landscape or in the buildings landscape, you do a bit more your own installation and you have kind of a wider range of service from the super high-end stuff to I think the things that would be maybe a bit more locally competitive. Within this kind of new regime for building investment, do you think JCI's organization does too much, too little, the right amount as it pertains to kind of product mix and what that ultimately means for operating leverage? George Oliver : So let me just simplify it. When you look at the portfolio, we are about -- say about 40% installed, about 35% or 30% service and about 25% product. And what I would tell you is the investments we are making product is to put ourselves in a leadership position across each of the platforms. I think we are making great progress. We are now where we would like to be, but we are on track to the plan that we\u2019ve got in place with the reinvestments. And if you look at our -- and that is core not only for our direct channel, but also making sure that we leverage all distribution to lead the industry. The second is our field based businesses. We\u2019ve got an incredible footprint across the globe and it's not only leveraging the product, but also our technology platforms that enable us to bring compelling solutions that ultimately drives sustainability, energy reduction and ultimately efficiency for the customers that we serve. And while we\u2019ve done well, especially during the cycle is that we\u2019ve had significant growth in our installed business, creating that installed base and what I\u2019ve been doing here since I've taken over is, put a big focus on service, that are field-based businesses we have significant opportunity to expand our services and how we service that installed base. And so that is an another area that we believe that we can -- there's a lot of room to grow. It's very attractive from a margin standpoint and it's going to be a key contributor to our long-term success. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks. I will leave it there. Antonella Franzen : Great. Operator, I'd like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments. George Oliver : So, thanks again all of you for joining our call this morning. As I said earlier, our end markets remain healthy. We are strengthening our competitive position, and I believe we are well positioned not only for the remainder of this year, but setting up 2020. We are very excited now with the sale of Power Solutions to capitalize on the opportunities that we have in front of us and truly position Johnson Controls as the industry's leading building solutions provider. So on that, I look forward to seeing many of you soon, and operator that concludes our call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now like to turn over the call to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls third quarter fiscal 2019 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our Website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. George R. Oliver: Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm going to start with a few strategic highlights from the quarter beginning on Slide 3. Looking at our results for the quarter as a whole we remain encouraged by the ongoing progress we've seen over the last several quarters. We delivered another strong quarter of organic revenue, order and backlog growth and also delivered on our commitment to generate $600 million in adjusted free cash flow. These results reflect the continued emphasis on driving underlying fundamentals focused on innovation and new product development, talent management, enhancing commercial excellence across the organization, and optimizing our cost structure.  As I think about the reinvestments we have made and continue to make to support future growth I am confident that we are strategically strengthening our market position. As we highlighted in the examples we provided to you last quarter our objective to lead the evolution of smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable buildings and infrastructure is coming more into focus every day. In pursuit of developing our strategy in connected buildings we are actively partnering with our customers, technology providers, and integrators to create comprehensive digital solutions with attractive value propositions that assist our customers in achieving their goals and missions. Our broad portfolio of smart edge devices, connected equipment and systems in cloud based data analytics capabilities provide Johnson Controls the unique competitive advantage as the industry begins this transition. Brian J. Stief: Thanks George and good morning everyone. So starting on Slide 6 let's take a look at our year-over-year EPS bridge, operational performance including synergy and productivity save contributed $0.10 which was partially offset by $0.02 of continued product investments in the fiscal 2018 run rate sales force additions we have talked about in prior quarters. Other below the line items contributed a net $0.03 to our Q3 results of $0.65 which was up 20% year-on-year.  Moving to Slide 7 let's review our segment results on a consolidated basis. Sales of 6.5 billion increased 6% led by 7% growth in products and 5% growth in our field businesses. During the quarter we saw solid service growth in North America and tempered growth in EMEA/LA and APAC. Overall service growth was 2% in Q3 and we continued to convert our project backlog with installation revenue up 6% led by solid growth across all regions. Segment EBITDA of 992 million grew 7% driven by volume leverage from our field and products businesses as well as productivity and synergy save. Q3 segment EBIT margin provided 20 basis points to 15.4% as volume leveraged across our businesses, favorable mix in global products, and synergy and productivity save is partially offset by a 30 basis points headwind related to mix in North America that George mentioned. As you can see in our margin waterfall, underlying operational improvement contributed 60 basis points which was partially offset by continued product and run rate sales force investments.  Now let's take a look at each of the segments in more detail, so starting with North America on Slide 8, sales group 4% driven by continued strength in both installed and service which were up 4% and 3% respectively. Q3 growth was led by strong high single-digit growth in our applied HVAC and controls businesses as we saw double-digit increase in Applied Equipment sales. Our Fire & Security service and installed businesses grew low single-digits on a tough prior year compared to 7%. Our performance solutions business declined high single-digits in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA declined 3% and EBITDA margin decreased 90 basis points to 13.3%. Benefits from synergy and productivity save as well as volume leverage were more than offset by unfavorable mix within the individual platforms and the year-over-year impact of our run rate sales force additions. So just to comment on mix as this was a primary driver of the North American margin headwind we saw in the quarter. You may remember that in Q3 last year we benefited from very favorable mix in our North America segment. This was a result of a higher margin Fire & Security businesses growing at a faster pace than our HVAC business. Additionally within Fire & Security our high margin retail business had a very strong Q3 last year driven by several large shipments to big box retailers. George R. Oliver: Thanks Brian. Before we open up the line for questions let me provide you an update on our 2019 guidance starting with our EPS walk on Slide 18. Just a couple of changes versus what we shared with you last quarter, there is no change to the EPS benefit from operations, synergies, and investments in sales force additions. You can see the impact of our capital deployment on net financing charges and share count. Compared to our EPS guidance range last quarter there is $0.04 of additional benefit at the midpoint of the range. This primarily relates to a benefit in net financing charges due to favorable interest income rates and less interest expense given our significant debt paid down activity during the quarter. As well as a start to right size corporate costs resulting from the sale of Power Solutions. As a result we are tightening our EPS guidance to the high end of our previous range and now expect the EPS before special items to be in the range of a $1.93 to a $1.95 representing EPS growth of 21% to 23% year-over-year. This includes an expected Q4 adjusted EPS range of $0.76 to $0.78. Turning to Slide 19, we have updated some of our operational assumptions as well as the below the line items to reflect our year-to-date performance and current outlook for Q4. For the full year organic growth is now expected to come in at the high end of our previous range up 5% to 6%. Given the higher expected revenues coupled with the Q3 mix in North America our segment EBITR margin expansion is now expected to be approximately 30 basis points for the year. As I mentioned earlier we are continuing to see top line momentum across the businesses and our focus remains on driving the fundamentals both from a P&L and cash perspective. With that let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions. Operator : . Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey, thank you, good morning everyone. Antonella Franzen : Good morning Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Just on cash use and kind of the outlook for that, clearly on the repo it looks like you're holding back and Brian actually used the term like if we see the need to preserve cash, so can you just give a little bit of color on what you're thinking, do you see something more worrisome from a macro standpoint, or are there some particular reason you're kind of keeping a 1 billion in your back pocket here? Brian J. Stief: No, I think what I was trying to communicate there Jeff was simply that we've got a formal program right now for 3.1 billion and our plan is to make sure that gets executed during fiscal 2020. As we move through the year we could very well use that other $1 billion for share repo as we move in the back half of next year but we are going to just maintain a bit of flexibility both from a macro standpoint to see how things play out and there might also be some product line gap fillers or other M&A that we want to look at as well. So we just didn't want to fully commit right now the entire 4.1 but we're going to do the 3.1 and the remaining $1 billion will kind of keep you updated on as we move throughout fiscal 2020. Jeffrey Sprague : And then maybe as a follow up on that George, what are you thinking on the M&A front, you have an active bolt on pipeline, anything moving through that pipeline? George R. Oliver: Yeah, let me start Jeff by saying relative to our performance as we've communicated we're continuing to focus on execution, delivering our commitments and delivering results. That all being said we continue to look at M&A with bolt ons that as we're reinvesting with our organic reinvestments we're making sure we're supplementing that with strategic bolt on. So there is a pipeline that we've been working, a lot of that is in the building management systems as we build out our capabilities within our digital solutions, and so we are continuing to pursue acquisitions. As Brian said we do believe that the environment we still see a very good environment, pretty much across our markets. And we're continuing to capitalize on that as we're converting not only the pipeline to orders but now the orders to grow. And so we're going to stay focused on execution, we're going to make sure that we're also keeping track relative to what's happening in the M&A and as we go forward we want to continue to strengthen what we're doing organically. Jeffrey Sprague : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Antonella Franzen : Good morning Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : George, we know you had a relatively significant mix issue that you talked about in Building Solutions North America. You mentioned Fire & Security is growing more slower than HVAC & Controls but it did slow down a little bit in Q3 versus Q2. You mentioned a difficult comparison on retailers this quarter but any of the store growth a little slower in U.S. retail economy and how much would you expect a 90 basis points of mix headwind on the business to improve in the quarters ahead? George R. Oliver: Yes, so as we look at what took place in third quarter, as you said it was mainly driven because last year we had very strong growth in Fire & Security and within that very strong growth in retail. And then year-on-year although we are outperforming the market in Fire & Security in 2019 it's at a much lower growth than our HVAC business which we're continuing to execute very well. And so as we now project North America going forward we see in fourth quarter roughly about 30 basis points with the mix that's going to come through in third quarter. And for the year I mean it will be relatively flat for the year.  Now when you look at the year it suggests that our productivity and synergies is offsetting the investments we're making in sales force as well as the pension headwind. And then the volume that we are achieving now is offsetting some of that negative mix. But we're very confident with the fundamentals we have in place, the way that we're driving improved fundamentals to be able to on a go forward basis see improved leverage as we go into 2020. Andrew Kaplowitz : George maybe if I could follow-up on that, the incrementals in your products business were much stronger than usual. We know that pricing versus costs are strong but did you actually have lower investment than usual in the quarter in that segment and you talked about incrementals in products getting up to 30% over time, I know you mentioned op investment in Q4 but you are actually ahead of schedule on improving the execution on the products in that segment? George R. Oliver: Yeah, when you look at our product business year-on-year this is where a lot of the work that we've done around price cost has come through and as you know we had significant commodity headwinds as well as tariffs. We've done a nice job ultimately driving price as well as productivity to get positive price cost and that within the quarter is about 40 basis points. So overall that has been a big strength for us. With the leverage when you look at our investment profile it is -- it was pretty much spread through the year and as Brian said, we'll see some additional reinvestment in fourth quarter based on the timing of our product launches. But it's not -- it's in line with what we expected.  So as we look at these businesses what I would say is we're building the fundamentals, we're getting the lift with the reinvestments we're making and that's coming through the growth, and that we're executing very well the price cost which is adding to the overall margins. On a go forward basis we believe with the continued performance with growth, with the work that were driving fundamentals we're going to be in a position to be able to leverage the product. The leverage margins will be 25% to 30%. Andrew Kaplowitz : And you see that 40 basis points being pretty stable going for the price cost? Brian J. Stief: Yeah, I mean based on what we see today I mean you can't predict all of what's going to happen in the future but I feel confident now that we're -- we have a good understanding of what's happening from a cost standpoint, what's happening with tariffs, and that from a pricing standpoint we're now pricing -- taking that into account on a go forward basis. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Stephen Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Stephen Tusa : Can you maybe talk about what you are seeing on the global applied markets, what your order pipeline looks like for the next several quarters including in China? George R. Oliver: Yeah, what was the -- which markets are you referring to Steve? Stephen Tusa : Global applied. Applied equipment, just the order pipeline there, HVAC applied. George R. Oliver: So, let me just give you a perspective on our overall HVAC businesses globally. When you look at our performance our orders are up 6% globally. Our revenues we converted revenues at 7% and when you look at our pipeline we're continuing to build pipelines pretty much across the globe that are up kind of mid to high single-digits both in our commercial and residential businesses. So overall I feel very good about the work that we've done to be able to take advantage of that market. When you break out into the segmentation you see our commercial HVAC businesses are growing 7% and that's been driven by applied as well as with the service that we're getting and as a result of the installed base that we're putting in place. And then when you look at rev  we're up kind of mid single-digits and that's a combination of our UPG business up kind of mid single-digits in North American and our  business up high single-digits. Up high single-digits globally and so overall Steve we still feel very good about the pipeline, how we're converting the pipeline, and then how that's setting us up here as we go forward in 2020. Stephen Tusa : Okay, and any specific comments on China, what you're seeing in China commercial HVAC? George R. Oliver: Yeah, so China when you look at the China market it continues to perform. I mean we're seeing kind of orders in the mid single-digits, we're seeing a little bit better in service which is high single-digits. So we're watching this closely but as you know we have a strong presence there. We have a strong positions from a market share standpoint and we've been making sure that we've got the right product. And we're ultimately capitalizing on the growth that's occurring. So we have not seen any significant change in the activity or the pipeline that we're building and as I said we're continuing to build our service business which over the cycle is very important to make sure that we're getting the recurring revenues. Antonella Franzen : Steve the only thing I would add is that China specifically orders were very -- although APAC was up 1%. China orders were really strong and it was a mix between install and service. Stephen Tusa : Great, thanks for the color guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Just wanted to go back to North America  and the retail headwinds, you have obviously covered that already but can you just recap how big is the retail exposure there and it does feel like the physical footprint of the retail effect is starting to shrink in an accelerated pace, I'm just wondering how you think about that business going forward in light of this online transition that seems to be occurring? George R. Oliver: Globally Nigel the retail business is about $1 billion business. It is a global business with a significant piece of that in North America. What happened last year we had very strong growth in the quarter last year and it was mainly driven by some significant product shipments in the quarter which obviously didn't repeat this year. Overall as you know we got multiple businesses there, we have the antitheft security business as well as we've been building a digital traffic business. As well as our inventory management business, those businesses are performing well. Certainly with the slowdown in some of the challenges in retail, some of the projects have been pushed out which we've seen here in third quarter and we're watching that closely for fourth quarter. But as you know overall this is a good business. We've had a lot of growth, we had a lot of growth last year obviously seeing the impact this year, but we're going to watch this closely. Nigel Coe : Okay, great and then just a quick one on the NPI line, it's up quite a bit from your prior guides and I'm just wondering what's -- what business is driving that? George R. Oliver: So those would be the Hitachi businesses where we own 60% of those ventures and they perform -- continue to perform very strong and that Q3 and Q4 and even into fiscal 2020 we're going to continue to see that NCI line move up simply because of the strong performance of Hitachi. Nigel Coe : And then just Brian quickly is that better revenue or better margin and where do we stack up right now on getting cash out of those JVs? Brian J. Stief: So you probably saw in the quarter if you look at the cash flow statement that was attached to our release we did get a big dividend in the quarter as we expected. As I think I've mentioned on this call in the past the second calendar quarter of each year is when we have certain of the board meetings related Hitachi entity -- entities I should say and we did receive a large dividend in the third quarter as we had planned so the good news is it's at a larger amount than we've got in prior years and we continue on a go forward basis. We'll have to work on getting out a similar level of dividend or again as I've talked about in the past it may require some reinvestment in the Hitachi business to support the growth. So on a go forward basis we're just going to have to monitor the level of dividends that we get out of the Hitachi joint venture but in the quarter we got a large one. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question on the corporate expense, very, very good progress there again. And when we think about the sort of go forward run rate I think we've been thinking maybe another 50 million or so reduction into next year. Does that sound about right so the sort of go forward to run rate is closer to 330 million figure like that? Brian J. Stief: Yeah, that might be a little heavy. I would just say that I was very pleased with the actions that our corporate team took immediately after the Power sale to begin taking costs out to right size. I would say this year there's probably going to be $10 million taken out. Realistically as we transition through fiscal 2020 I would say that cost will be taken out during the course of the year so if you assume we take them out pro-rata that's going to probably give you another 20 million minimum and if we can accelerate some of that maybe 30 million to 35 million would come out next year. And then the full run rate of 50 million we would see as we move into 2021. So I think more along the 30 million to 35 million is probably a better number to work with. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, I'm not sure how specific you can get but you did book that 140 million environmental reserves in the quarter, so maybe just give us a mark-to-market of where the environmental reserves sit now in total at present at JCI and this charge obviously cleaned up that Wisconsin issue you mentioned in the Q and the noise on a triple S around municipal and individual actions, any upcoming events you think we should watch for, all points on that as they pertain to JCI? Brian J. Stief: Well let me comment on your first question regarding environmental reserve. I think we are appropriate reserved for the Marinette issue based upon all the work that we did in the quarter. Incremental of that $140 million reserve I believe we've got reserves globally for other matters less than $100 million. I want to say between $50 million and $100 million. There's a footnote disclosure on that in the Q's and K's but this particular matter in Marinette at 140 million is the largest one that we will manage over the next several years. So I think from an environmental research standpoint we feel comfortable with where we are. George R. Oliver: And Julian let me address the other part of the question on the civil litigation. I think we need to put this in perspective. Tyco and Chemguard make life saving firefighting foam, PFAS chemicals. They purchased the compounds that contain trace amounts of PFAS which they then blend to make the foam. And the fire fighting foam is made to exacting military standards. So majority of the foam at issue is specified and used by the U.S. government and military and therefore subject to the government contractors defense. And Tyco and Chemguard have always acted responsibly in producing these firefighting foams and we feel very confident in our ability to defend these clients. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning guys. So you made a comment earlier George about some of the channel inventories in the unitary side just still being high at the end of the quarter. How long do you think it takes to work those down and then if you seen any pushback or softening in the price environment just as other folks in the system as well are trying to move inventory along a little bit in the back half of the cooling season? Brian J. Stief: I think we should see a normal bring down of that inventory during Q4 and I don't think it's going to have any impact on our pricing in the market at all. So I think it's more seasonal that will come down here as we move through the fourth quarter. George R. Oliver: And we've been managing the inventory as this has played out over the last quarter and some of the impact of weather and the like we've been managing that appropriately. We are watching that closely as we get into the latter part of the season here but we are positioned as we have planned. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it, that's helpful. And then just a follow up on the retail Fire & Security exposure there. I guess I knew mix was strong last year, I didn't appreciate exactly where that came from. But just thinking about the pipeline in that piece specifically is -- does that tend to be lumpy over time, are there any other quarters that we should keep in mind over the past several that have had outsized mix there as you comp that could be could be a challenge? George R. Oliver: When I look at -- I've been part of the business for a number of years, when we look at the profile of business you do have some year-on-year compares occasionally because of the way the projects are executed with retailers. There is a seasonality to the business as you look at the four different quarters. So I don't think it was anything unusual based on what we've seen. Certainly we're pretty much aligned with all of the big retailers given the presence that we have in retail and we are staying close to what their plans are relative to their investments and the like. So I don't see anything that's significantly unusual at this stage. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey, would like to get some color as you see it in North America non-res construction, just kind of trends, there's some anxiety in some sectors that the macro uncertainty is weighing on project releases and just are you seeing anything along those lines and just to be clear on the retail push outs that you've seen, is that more retail sector specific or would that be attributed to some of the broader macro ones certainly? George R. Oliver: So let me start with your first question there Deane relative to the environment. I think when we look at all of our industries whether it be ABI, Dodge  forecast and what the overall activity is it's still given where we play and a lot of that is in the institutional space we see continued expansion. Now we've also expanded our sales force and our footprint so I think at this stage you could it would suggest we are picking up some share. So our pipelines are continuing to grow, we're converting those two orders are North America orders. We are up -- North America orders in total are up 6% but HVAC was up double-digits. And so we're high single-digits -- we're performing well and creating a backlog and we feel confident that we're going to see that continuing here at least in the near term.  As it relates to retail the discussion around retail is retail specific. I mean this is a project by project as we look at our customer base and what their plans were and what ultimately played out. It's specific to each of the retailers and so as I have said we have pretty good visibility especially with the large retailers, what their plans are, and we're going to monitor that as we go forward. Deane Dray : Great and then just what's embedded in the 4Q guide, you typically see during summer months some verticals make bigger project implementations like K through 1 colleges, are you seeing that those projects going through as expected? George R. Oliver: Absolutely, I mean when we look at our growth as we suggested we're going to grow mid single-digits in Q4 and that will get us to 5% to 6% organic growth in total. And when you look at the compare that's over a 7.6% growth last fourth quarter. So we look at our current pipeline of projects that we're executing to deliver on that, those are all moving forward as planned. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. John Walsh : Hi, so we were actually talking to a couple of integrators and they were really excited about a new product release you guys had put out enterprise management 2.0 and what they were basically intimating to me is it seems like JCI and Honeywell are really taking the lead on smart buildings AI and really bringing additional capability to occupants. Is there anything you can point to around metrics you've seen not necessarily specific to this product but other control products, obviously there's been good growth there that we're actually going to see building owners willing to upgrade and pay for some of these newer services that you're offering? George R. Oliver: So this is core to our overall strategy for the company as you think about our portfolio leading in our HVAC equipment and then leading in building management. And building management it's how this is on top of what we're doing to integrate all of our digital platforms, create a data layer with our Digital Vault, and then to be able to create new solutions on top of that data to be able to create value for our customers. And so what you're referring to the enterprise management is what we call our jump which is John's controlled enterprise management taking all of that data and positioning that data to be able to deliver and execute for our customers things that they ultimately see value in. And so we've got that deployed now across a number of installations and very successfully and as we think about not only that but we've got a number of other digital solutions that we're deploying today that we can take our installed base that we have with our service business to be able to add on these digital solutions and be able to accelerate our service growth with the customers that we're currently supporting. So as you said its core to the strategy how we ultimately create more value for our customers and then leverage all of our digital capabilities to do that. John Walsh : Yeah I guess maybe as a follow on, do you have any numbers around the size of the business either what your pure software component is, things like that if you can share? George R. Oliver: We don't segment our revenues today but as you know across our business we have a lot of software embedded in the products as well as the solutions that we bring to the market. So when you look at that we have software within our building controls, within our security platform, within our fire platform, and what we're doing now is taking all of that, integrating that as well as building a data platform that enables us to be able to create apps and be able to create new outcomes that ultimately is going to create service growth for us. So we don't segment it that way but as we go forward that's something as we look at how we're taking our building management solutions forward is something that we'll focus on and how we can create some metrics so you can track the progress that we're making with the investments we're making? John Walsh : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Good morning, thanks. Just going back to China you talked about service maybe outpacing install. Just your thoughts on I guess one install coming back, reasons for any kind of delays there, and then your confidence and ability to drive price and favorable mix on the business you quoted? George R. Oliver: Yeah, the comment on the low single-digits was in order as I think overall our orders were somewhat flat on the install side with the service being a little bit higher. But as we project what we're going to do there when you look at the overall growth in the pipeline we suggest that we're still going to see kind of mid single-digit growth in both orders as well as revenue. And that from a service standpoint we're continuing to put resources in place to be able to accelerate the service off the installed base that we've got in place there. And so this for us is a big market for us, it represents in our field business it's about -- represents about -- well in the overall buildings business 6% of our revenue and in the field business in APAC it's about 35% to 40% of our APAC business. So obviously a very important market for us. Noah Kaye : And I guess not just generally -- not just for APAC but generally can you talk about some of your initiatives to drive greater recurring revenues, your previous comments on software and obviously there are tools here to make business more sticky but just generally how should we think about kind of the growth of recurring as a percentage of the total? George R. Oliver: So in total when you look at the overall company service represents a little bit better than 25% of the revenue. About 60% of that is recurring and how we contract that revenue. And a lot of that is supported by software and so as we have been driving our service strategy there is a couple of key components making sure we get the right sales force that we're deploying globally. And as you know we've made tremendous progress over the last year, year and a half with the sales force getting the right footprint in the key markets that we're looking to grow within which we've been expanding our footprint. And then enabling that with the right solutions leveraging our technology incapability. So it's a combination of all three. We've been able to get to our run rate overtime that's roughly been about mid single-digits and our goal is obviously not only to continue to grow at the same rate that we're growing installed but also grow with a higher percentage of recurring revenue. So that's 60% that we contract that's recurring and then creating more stickiness with the digital solutions that we can ultimately deploy that becomes more recurring longer-term with the solutions that we put into place. And that's the overall strategy. Noah Kaye : Perfect, thanks George. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. Tim Wojs : Yeah, hi, good morning everybody. Just -- maybe just one question I had on the investments that are you're kind of incurring right now, what's the right level of kind of ongoing incremental investment that we should think of as we kind of think in the out years, it was 60 basis point headwind to margins last year. I think it's probably closer to half that this year. How much of that can kind of go away over time and how much of that will kind of continue incrementally each year? George R. Oliver: Well there is two elements that drive that reinvestment. The first is the sales increase that we were adding ahead of the growth actually coming through and that's been the headwind for the last two years. We are now adding at a rate that is sustainable so that the cost as a percent of revenue now has flattened out. So we shouldn't see any additional headwind going forward relative to our sales cost. The other big bucket is our reinvestment in R&D in new products and as you know we've been ramping that up over the last three to four years. We're now ending as we get through this year and we project going forward we should be able to maintain that level of reinvestment as a percent of product revenues more flat. So we shouldn't see any significant headwind there on a go forward basis. Tim Wojs : Okay, so if we kind of look into 2020 the investments that you've seen over the last couple years you'd actually think that would be more kind of flat on a year-over-year basis versus a headwind? Brian J. Stief: That's correct. George R. Oliver: As a percent of revenue so we'll be spending more dollars but as a percent of revenue we won't have the headwind on the EPS bridge. Tim Wojs : Right, right, exactly, okay. And then Brian just -- just on the debt pay down what's the average cost of the remaining debt now. Brian J. Stief: About -- the remaining debt there's 97% of that that's fixed and it's at an average rate of just a little bit above 3%. Tim Wojs : Okay, great. Thank you. Antonella Franzen : Operator I would like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments. George R. Oliver: So again I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. As you see we're pleased with our continued momentum in growth orders and backlog. As I mentioned earlier we are keeping a close eye on the macro environment but overall our end markets are remaining healthy and our order pipeline robust. And I certainly look forward to seeing many of you soon. So operator that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. Please disconnect at this time.",

This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn over the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. You may begin. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls\u2019 fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we\u2019ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis excluding the results of Power Solutions. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls\u2019 ordinary shareholders was $0.77 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.01 related to special items which Brian will address in his comments. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.78 per share compared to $0.57 in the prior-year quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I thought I would kick things off with a quick look back at our year to recap some of our strategic initiatives and financial commitments. Starting with Slide 3, one of the most significant strategic achievements in 2019 was the successful divestiture of Power Solutions and the subsequent capital deployment actions. I am extremely pleased with our execution from start to finish. Large transactions like this never go completely as planned and usually take longer than expected to execute. Our teams effectively navigated the transaction process, monetizing the business with lower-than-expected tax leakage, resulting in net cash proceeds of $11.6 billion. Brian Stief : Thanks George and good morning everyone. So, let's get started with the year-over-year bridge of EPS on Slide 7. As you can see our operational performance including synergies and productivity save contributed $0.09 and this was partially offset by $0.01 of investments. We also benefited in the quarter from the redeployment of the Power Solutions proceeds from both the share count and net financing charge perspective which added $0.12 and $0.05 respectively. And below-the-line items netted to a $0.04 headwind which resulted in fourth quarter EPS of $0.78 which was up 37% year-on-year. So, let's move to Slide 8 and take a look at segment results on a consolidated basis. You can see sales of $6.3 billion increased 3% on an organic basis and this was led by 4% in our Field businesses. And this is partially offset by some softness in our Product businesses which was flat in the quarter. I would point out that in Q4; we were facing our most difficult comp from the prior year up 8% in aggregate with every segment facing its toughest comp. Within the Field businesses, total service revenues grew 4% in the quarter which was consistent growth across all three regions. As you know growing and expanding our service offerings has been an area of significant internal focus and we've now established a consistent cadence of mid-single-digit growth for the past two years. Going forward we look to augment our service growth, enabled by digital solutions to continue driving similar growth level in service. As you know our service business represents just over $6 billion in revenues, which is about 40% of our field revenue base and this provides us with a very profitable, resilient revenue stream as we move forward. We continue to convert our project backlog in Q4 as well driving install revenue, up 4% and this was solid growth across all regions. Segment EBITDA of $990 million grew 7% organically and this was driven by the volume leverage from the field, strong price cost realization and products and our ongoing productivity and synergy save. Lastly, Q4 segment EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points to 15.8%. And as you can see in our margin waterfall, underlying operational improvement contributed 100 basis points. And this was partially offset by some product and run rate sales force investments as well as a minor headwind through pension and other items. So let's review each segment in more detail. George Oliver : Thanks Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to provide you with our outlook for 2020. Let's start by walking through the waterfall chart on Slide 17. Overall, we expect low to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth which will drive approximately $0.15 of earnings. Additionally, we will have the continued benefit of synergies and productivity savings which we will realize over the course of the year and will contribute an additional $0.15 of earnings. As Brian mentioned last quarter, we are moving forward with a plan to continue repurchasing our shares. We expect to deploy approximately $2.2 billion of Power Solutions sale proceeds during the course of fiscal 2020 which is expected to result in an incremental benefit to earnings of about $0.33. This assumes we continue to hold the remaining $1 billion of Power Solutions sale proceeds on hand. There is -- other small items result in a $0.04 headwind. These items net to our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance range before special items of $2.50 to $2.60. This represents earnings growth in the range of 28% to 33%. And the full details of our guidance is included on Slide 18. Our guidance is based on strong underlying EBIT growth of 8% to 12%, driven by solid top line performance and synergy and productivity benefits. Lastly, as a portion of the benefit related to the deployment of the Power Solutions sale proceeds will benefit fiscal 2021, I wanted to provide an updated framework for how our earnings are expected to progress as we move forward. As you can see on Slide 19, the incremental run rate benefit of proceeds deployed in 2020 and a reduction in corporate cost is expected to contribute an incremental $0.06 of earnings. This takes our fiscal 2020 EPS to a range of $2.56 to $2.66 on a run rate basis. This would be prior to the deployment of the remaining $1 billion of Power Solutions sale proceeds as well as any operational growth or benefits from additional capital deployment in 2021. Over the last two years, we have made significant progress in aligning our portfolio, improving our underlying fundamentals, and reinvesting back into the businesses. As we move forward, it is all about execution and controlling what is in our control. Although we are watching the macroeconomic environment closely, we feel good about our position entering fiscal 2020 as our backlog provides us visibility in our Field businesses, our service business tends to be more resilient, and we continue to benefit from self-help and our capital deployment. We remain focused on driving execution and delivering for our customers and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin our formal question-and-answer session.  The first question is coming from Gautam Khanna, Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Hey thanks. Good morning guys. Antonella Franzen : Good morning Gautam. George Oliver : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : So, George I was wondering if you could just talk about the applied HVAC pipeline? What are you seeing in terms of front log if you will projects RFPs, what have you? Any slowdown yet to speak of in that domain? George Oliver : No. I mean as you've seen we continue to execute very well in the commercial HVAC space. When you look at our revenues in the quarter we're up 8% with strong growth for both applied equipment and service and that was spread across North America and APAC. We've had light commercial unitary up mid- to high single-digits. And a lot of that has been a result of the new products we've been launching with our rooftop products. If you look at orders, the orders show a 3% in the quarter but that's off a strong plus 9% last year. So that's important to note. And when you look at where that's occurring it's pretty broad-based. So then if you go and look at our pipeline on projects, we continue to have a very strong pipeline that we're working pretty much across the globe and converting and that has given us confidence with the backlog we have going into 2020 and the continued progress we see - continuing maybe a little bit lower on our growth rate mid- to single-digit here through the course of 2020. But I believe that that gives us confidence that we're going to be positioned here to deliver on the commitments we made here in 2020. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And just a quick follow-up. On consolidation, you guys have kind of earmarked $1 billion for M&A. I just wondered if you could update us on your pipeline there? And do you think there's going to be any broader consolidation, any bigger moves in the space? And just your thoughts on how things might shake out with Ingersoll becoming an independent climate company and CCS spinning. Any thoughts on that? Thank you. George Oliver : Yes, Gautam. Let me just give you my perspective. I think in any industry there's always opportunity for consolidation. But I think it's been clear based on what we've been doing with the reinvestments we've been making in products with the work that we're doing to build out our channels globally that we're focused on continuing to execute for our customers, being able to build strong pipelines of potential orders converting and ultimately executing. And I think, as we look at the future and a lot of this is tied to what we talked about with the Chief Customer Digital Officer that we've added, we see an incredible opportunity to take a very strong portfolio and position ourselves to be able to outperform on a go-forward basis. And so that's our focus. When we look at M&A, we certainly are working pipelines as we look at our each of our product businesses and our regional footprint. And we're opportunistic looking at opportunities that would strengthen our organic investments. But the focus for us is continuing to execute, delivering strong performance and then continuing to do bolt-ons as needed. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Nigel Coe : George, it sounds like you  your voice sounds bit creaky. So hopefully answer to the questions here. So maybe just talk about pricing broadly speaking. Obviously Asia Pac is a bit more challenging but how are you seeing pricing across the board, especially with raw materials starting to move to and then maybe just comment on price costs and how that shaped up this quarter versus expectations? George Oliver : Nigel, I'd go back, if you look at the last two years we had a headwind in 2018. And we began to overcome that headwind at late in that year. And that positioned us well for 2019 where we got -- when you look at our top line it was roughly two or three points of the top line growth in 2019. And that contributed to a positive price/cost in 2019. Now that being said, as we've set up for 2020, we continue to make sure that we're staying disciplined from a pricing standpoint. And that we're projecting that on the topline, it will contribute about 1% to the overall topline. So, that combined with our productivity and the like will continue to offset inflation and we'll continue to be price cost positive as we go through 2020. It is important to note that with that price the impact to the margin rate is relatively neutral in 2020. Nigel Coe : Yes, great. Thanks George. And then Brian I wanted to dig into some of the cash flow items for next year. So, you're flagging $0.3 billion of one-time outflows just maybe just talk about that. And then the tax refunds obviously as-expected, but does that came up that item? And then on the conversion question to what extent is pension income putting pressure on that conversion next year? And then the final point I know there's four points here. There's a large outflow this quarter in disc ops, just wondered if you could just discuss that as well. Thank you. Brian Stief : So the large outflow in disc ops this year relates to the tax payment that was made associated with the gain on the Power sale. As it relates to the $600 million tax refund, we've kind of been flagging that for several quarters now. We do expect that in the first half of 2020. We're hopeful it's December-January timeframe. But I mean that because of the size of it as we've talked about previously had to go through committee with you. So, we do expect that to come in in the first half of 2020. And then the $300 million of outflow that we're flagging really relates to prior cash costs -- or current cash cost of prior restructuring charges as well as the ongoing activities that we have to support the $150 million of synergies that we're going to generate related to the $900 million target we've got through fiscal 2020 that we've talked about previously. So, was there one other question there? Nigel Coe : Sorry yes. The pension income. To what extent is that putting some pressure on conversion? Brian Stief : Yes, I mean pension income provides some pressure for us as does the joint venture dividends being less than our equity income, but we also get some benefit from our amortization as well. But net-net, I think when we look at our free cash flow conversion target next year at 95% as I think about how that improves on a go-forward basis to get closer to 100%, I would say there's two areas. One would be to close the gap between equity income and our joint venture dividends that we get on an annual basis. And secondly, I still think there's some improvement in trade working capital that will come through continued efforts of our cash management office team around the globe. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is coming from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Antonella Franzen : Hi Jeff. George Oliver : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Could we dig in a little bit more George into synergy and productivity? And I'm kind of sure at this point of the game just getting a little blurry on what's synergy and what's productivity, but I'd be a little more explicit on what it is you still have yet to capture? What is kind of embedded in that number? And I'm sure you're never going to stop seeking productivity but will this bring that program to a close in 2020? George Oliver : Yes. So as Brian laid out, we are still positioned here to deliver very strong synergy in addition to productivity here in 2020. On a go-forward basis, when you look at our cost base and our ability to be able to get continuous productivity on that cost base, normal productivity would generate about 30 basis points of net margin expansion And so our goal is to continue to keep strong pipelines of opportunities to reduce the structural cost. And then from a process standpoint with everything that we do whether it be in our manufacturing product businesses or within our field installation and service business, really driving strong operational improvements on a continuous basis going forward. And so our -- when we project beyond 2020, we're still going to have a very strong pipeline for productivity to continue to expand margins. Jeff Sprague : And George just looking at backlog I think it goes a little bit to one of the earlier questions, right? Some of the macro indicators for whatever they're worth, right? Dodge starts the ABI, the put-in-place data all is kind of wobbling here. And it really hasn't shown up in your orders or really any of your peers' orders yet. I just wonder, if there's any additional insight you could share on maybe what you think the disconnect is there and your visibility to convert backlog as you look into 2020? George Oliver : So I would start Jeff by the macro indicators when you look at ABI or Dodge forecast, they do suggest they are a little bit lower but they have stabilized. And when you look at some of the areas where we have strength, obviously institutional, we still believe that that has yet to peak in some of the end markets that we support there. And I think that's driving a lot of the order pipeline and the conversion of that pipeline. So what I would tell you is that when we projected the year in 2020, we're starting with a nice backlog. We have suggested that the order rate will slow a bit to kind of low mid-single digits based on what we see in the pipeline today. And the two combined is what gives us confidence that we are positioned to be able to deliver kind of low to mid single-digit growth throughout the year. Certainly we're watching this closely and making sure that from a cost standpoint that we're going to do what's necessary to adjust as needed. And what I would say is that for us, our service business is about a little better than $6 billion globally. And if you've seen our progress in the last two years, we've been able to sustain our growth rate up over 4%. So we were short of 4% two years ago. And then this past year we're north of 4%. And our goal is that we believe with the installed base that we have that we've built that there's still a tremendous opportunity to build our service business. So at the same time that we're watching the big project in that pipeline and making sure that we're going to be able to adjust appropriately as this plays out, we also are working hard to be able to execute on our service strategy that we believe that if it does soften much we're going to be positioned well with our service franchise to be able to try to make up to some of that softness. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about what you're seeing specifically in China on kind of the larger equipment and services side? Things there for everybody seem to be holding up pretty well. You guys are obviously continuing to lead the pack there to a degree on your growth. So, any color on -- is there any timing here in the next 18 months or this is going to slow down? Is it some project phasing concerns? Or are things -- think things are pretty robust there for the next -- for the foreseeable future? George Oliver : Yes, let me frame-up China for us Steve. China overall is about 6% of our total company, about $900 million of that is in the Field and $400 million is in Global Products. When you look at the Field business, China is an important market for us in Asia-Pac. It's about 35% 40% of the Asia-Pac region. And we are seeing -- as you said, we are seeing good revenue growth. We had low double-digit organic growth here driven by HVAC equipment as well as our ability to be able to expand our service here in the quarter. And I believe that we are now lapping the tough backlog that we had in margins on a go-forward basis. Now, that being said, we -- as I was just -- I just spent over a week there, met -- I was in Shanghai, I was in Chongqing. I was in Chengdou and working with the teams and meeting with customers and meeting with the local governments. And I have to admit I left feeling really good that the work that we're doing, we're continuing to make progress. We're positioning our capabilities appropriately to capitalize on the infrastructure, expansion, and the like. And so I don't -- I'd say it's going to continue to grow. It my temper a bit based on what's happening here with some of the trade wars and the like, but overall, I have to say I feel good about the growth in the China market. We're also going to make sure that we stay competitive not only from a cost standpoint, but in how we create value with the type of projects we go after, but that's my current view Steve. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot for all the detail and the comprehensive answer. Thanks. Operator : The next question is coming from Julian Mitchell, Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi good morning and congratulations Brian on the Vice Chairmanship. Brian Stief : Thank you. Thank you. Julian Mitchell : In terms of I guess my first question just looking at the EBIT margin guide fiscal 2020, so it's up 60 to 80 bps with some corporate cost reduction within that. Just wondered when you're thinking across the four segments, do we think about that expansion being sort of APAC margins flattish and the other three in 2020 being up say 50 bps? Is that the right way to think about the segments in 2020? George Oliver : Yes. So, when we look at -- well, let me give you a high level that obviously we're positioned here to expand margins as we've guided 40 to 60 basis points and -- for the total year. And that's going to be pretty much we'll see expansion across the Board. It's -- we're going to get better leverage out of our Global Products. And so as we look at our Global Products, we're going to be closer to a 70-plus type basis points. And then our Field-based businesses kind of the -- where we're seeing good leverage here is the work we've done in EMEA/LA being a little bit better. The one that's going to be -- the lower margin is going to be North America roughly about 30 or 40 basis points. And that's purely when you look at the total -- when you look at how we achieve the margin expansion, we get about 20 basis points on volume mix. We pick up about 50 basis points on synergies and productivities. And then we are pressured a bit on a total year with APAC as well as some other pressure we have within the overall portfolio. So that's what gets us in total. Now when you break that out into as I said North America, a little bit more pressure there because of the mix of HVAC versus Fire & Security, as well as the headwind that we've had in the retail business continuing because of the pressure that we see there in the end market that we're serving. And so overall, it's -- we're going to see improvement across the board. But the strength will be driven by Global Products as well as the EMEA/LA continued performance of EMEA/LA and then beginning to recover here in APAC. Julian Mitchell : Thank you very much. And then my second question just around that Global Products residential revenue aspect. So you had as you said down low double-digits revenue in Global Resi HVAC in Q4. Just wondered if you could give a bit more color around the Asian piece? You talked about Japan and Taiwan being culprits. Is there something going on market share-wise there? I think numbers in Japan have been okay. So I just wondered what your outlook was on that Asian piece within Global Resi HVAC? George Oliver : Sure. So let me frame it up here Julian, when you look at Global Products organic revenue growth being flat in Q4, let's start that it was off of a plus nine last year. And that we did expect a decline in North America Resi, given that a year ago we had 20-plus percent growth. And when we -- coming into the quarter we knew that there was going to be distributed inventory levels that we're going to have to be burnt off. Now what was softer as Brian talked about was the APAC residential business. And just to frame that up it's about $1.8 billion in annual revenue. It's primarily the Hitachi JV and that -- with the strength and the position that we have in Japan and Taiwan. The overall decline, it was a low-teen decline. That impacted as Brian said three points of our global products growth. Now if you break it out into Taiwan and Japan, the decline in Taiwan were partly due to a mild summer. We had -- distributors had to burn through their inventory as the cooling season was coming to an end in our fourth quarter. And then as we look at it today, we see the inventory levels to be back to normal at the end of September. Recognize that we have about a -- we do have a very strong share position in that market. And so we do believe on a go-forward basis we're going to be positioned well and continuing to maintain share. In Japan, we had a very strong first three quarters ourselves in Japan. And then the market decline began to occur in Q4. And so with that we saw our distributors burning off inventory. And I think right now I just came back from there. I spent a few days with our team there. What I would say is that the inventory levels are back to where they need to be. We are a little bit concerned about continued softness here in Q1. So we're going to watch that closely. I would tell you from my visit and the deep dive that I've done on all of our investments, I feel really good about the business with the investments we're making and being able to maintain a very strong position in these markets. And so that's kind of the way I see it today but we are going to see a little bit of pressure here in Q1 because of the Japan market. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : George in Building Solutions North America you mentioned mix issues Q4 versus Q3 as service is better. But put a really large EBITDA improvement 40 basis points versus last quarter, which I think was down 90 despite Fire & Security growth still being lower than HVAC. So can you give more color into the improvement? I know you just said that retail pressure didn't really go away. Did it abate at all? Or was it really just a better service mix or maybe better sales force productivity? George Oliver : So there's a lot of -- let me try to frame this up, so you can kind of put the pieces together. Overall, as you said, we had a lot of pressure in the previous quarter with mix and the like. And now in the fourth quarter we were 40 basis points year-on-year improvement. When you look at the breakdown of that volume and mix was about 20 basis points. We're seeing good volume come through continued volume. We're seeing very strong productivity savings and cost synergies, which was up 40 basis points. There is a little bit of a headwind on pension. And then there's -- we're almost done with the headwind that we've seen in sales investments. And so when you walk that through that's where which ultimately achieve the net 40 basis points year-on-year. And so it's -- we're obviously watching this closely as we get into Q1. We are looking and making sure that on a year-on-year basis we're a continued -- positioned to continue to expand. I believe that right now it's going to be somewhat flat because of the way the mix is going to come through and some of the pressure that we're seeing in retail. But we're going to continue to focus on driving strong productivity and cost savings while we're executing on the growth. Antonella Franzen : And Andy, the only thing I would add as a reminder is just keep in mind that in Q3 for North America, part of that decline really had to do with the really strong performance we had in the North America retail business in Q3 of 2018. And we didn't have that same dynamic here in our fourth quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful, guys. And then George can you talk about the Fire & Security markets in particular? I think you mentioned that Fire & Security products growth was good. Your field orders have hung in there reasonably well. But how much of it is sort of the markets being strong? I know fire detection generally has been pretty strong. How much of it is sort of self-help over the last few years for you guys in markets like security and digital improving the business versus the market? Are you outperforming the market? George Oliver : So let me start Andy by breaking it out into products and field. And so if you look at our Fire & Security products, we were up although it prints 2% but that was on a low double-digit prior year compare. So, on a two-year stack, we're still doing extremely well with our product businesses. Now if you dig into that fire detection was up 7% and that's a result of both reinvestment in new products, continuing to expand our channel and the sales force and then ultimately being able to convert backlog. The security was flat. Now that's on a very tough comp also year-on-year. I believe it was high teens And we are continuing to invest and position ourselves with the right products and mix and how we want to compete in security as it relates to our overall -- when we look at our digital solutions, the importance of having that product mix within the portfolio. And then the last is our fire suppression business continues to perform very well. I believe that we continue to gain share. We're up mid-single digits pretty much and that's pretty broad-based across the globe. When you look at our -- the Field businesses, we're up 4% and that's both install as well as service and it's broad-based. It's across all three regions. There's been a big -- like I spoke earlier about our focus on building services. We continue to focus on how we build out our service capabilities. But overall I would say that we're performing -- we are performing at above the market with both our product and technology businesses as well as how we're executing projects and service. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. Operator : The next question is coming from Deepa Raghavan, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Hey good morning all. Would you say at this time your Field backlog -- just given your Field backlog and your visibility into fiscal 2020, now your visibility is at least three quarters out? Or you think that's lower perhaps you declining? And any color on how that visibility splits across regions? George Oliver : Yes. It's pretty -- what I would say is the -- if you look at our order rate in 2019, right, we had a good pace of order growth throughout the year. It was driven by pretty healthy end-market demand, pretty much across the Board, some softness in the Middle East and a few soft spots, but overall, pretty broad-based across all three of our regions. With the work that we've been doing in expanding our salesforce as well as our service technicians, I think at the end of the day, we're positioned well now to be able to convert that. And if you look at the mix of projects, it's a balanced mix of small, mid, and large-sized projects. And so what we do is we take that backlog and we look at how it's going to convert over the next year, much of which is in backlog. And with the continued -- as I said earlier, with the idea that there might be some -- a little bit of pressure here to maintain our mid to upper single-digit order growth that we've seen in the last two years, we're suggesting that might be more of the low to mid order growth that we're putting into the backlog that that's what then pretty much ties to our organic revenue growth of low to mid-single-digit for the year. And so again that's something we'll watch closely, but we are starting the year with a healthy backlog. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. My follow-up would be on cadence of month. Can you talk about how the quarter progressed? I mean did momentum strengthen or weaken in any of your geographies or any of your Products or Field businesses? Thank you. George Oliver : The -- just a clarification on that. So, how the quarter -- the quarters progressed through 2020? Deepa Raghavan : No, the month -- and in the quarter how did your F Q4 -- fiscal Q4 progressed by month. Did you see increasing momentum as in or momentum decreasing in certain verticals or certain geographies? George Oliver : Yes. I mean when we look at our businesses and it differs a bit. But typically the third month of the quarter is where a lot of projects close and a lot of the shipments get made. So, there is a little bit of an anomaly here on a quarterly basis where the third month is always our strongest which ultimately was the case in the fourth quarter. So, I don't believe that there was any change in the profile of how the quarter played out with what we expected. I think we did see as we knew as the quarter played out that from a residential standpoint that was a little bit of where we saw additional softness from what we were expecting when we started the quarter. But that was probably the only spot that as the quarter played out, it didn't play out as we would have normally expected. Brian Stief : Yes, I think the cadence in Q4 of fiscal 2019 was very similar to the cadence of the monthly in Q4 in 2018. So I don't think there was anything unusual at all. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. Thank you for the color. Operator : The next question is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning all. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Brian Stief : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just wanted to follow-up on -- I think something has become a bit more topical recently, maybe more of the applied space than anything else. This whole concept of refrigerant upgrades, more energy efficiency, it seems like something that the whole industry has been talking about for decades on end. That's really starting to come into its own. George could you size for us, how much of the business is really around some of these kind of energy efficiency upgrades versus something that's more break-fix or maybe new install focused and how that's been doing? George Oliver : Yes. So while there's a couple of different questions, I guess embedded in that question. When you look at what we do today, certainly as we're bringing new products to the market they are more efficient. They're in higher demand. And ultimately there's a payback from an energy standpoint. So I think consumers and even from a B2B standpoint when you're -- when we do a performance solutions, we bring our new equipment. It delivers energy efficiency. We deliver value and ultimately we get paid for that value. I think for all of us we are anticipating -- there's a lot of pending legislation around HFC refrigerants. And ultimately what's that going to mean? We're taking a very active role and we support bipartisan federal legislation being introduced that gives the EPA authority to phase down the high global warming potential of HFC refrigerants in a manner that's consistent with the Kangalee amendment in the Montreal protocol. That being said is we want to work with the industry as a whole in -- with a consistent approach to the HFC transition rather than a patchwork of individual state laws, targeting different sectors or having different transition date. So all of the investments that we've made is -- in our R&D is to develop new low GWP product platforms. A good example is our YZ chillers in anticipation of these regulations. And so we're very active in the industry, making sure that as we project what's going to happen here from an efficiency standpoint, making sure that we're delivering the highest efficiency, as well as being able to drive the regulation appropriately. That's what our commitment is. And we believe that that would benefit our customer\u2019s, shareholders as well as the environment. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then just a follow-up. If I remember back to the Tyco days and I think early in the integration there were parts of the products business, I think around oil and gas that showed a little bit of surprising cyclicality that were a drag on the business. I think today those are probably some markets that are a little choppy themselves. Is that something that's still in the portfolio? Did some of that leave with Scott? Maybe just kind of update us on how that's performing relative to the whole? George Oliver : Yeah. So the -- what remains is our fire suppression business has a strong position in the oil and gas space with high hazard technologies that they bring. And so -- and as we said earlier that business is actually continuing to perform very well. And when we look at our field based businesses, obviously, we restructured a lot of those businesses in the downturn. And we've been very careful in how we grow those businesses on a go-forward basis, capitalizing on where we believe the opportunities are and ultimately where we don't want to play. So, our footprint is much smaller than it was back then without the Scott Safety business as well as the way that we've restructured our field businesses over that time period. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. It\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color. Antonella Franzen : With that operator I'd like to turn the call back over to George for some closing comments. George Oliver : Yes. Just to wrap up here today, I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. We have made a tremendous amount of progress this year. And we'll build upon that momentum in 2020 as we laid out our guidance and I am looking forward to seeing many of you soon. So operator that concludes our call. Operator : That will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.",

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls\u2019 first quarter fiscal 2020 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver and our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we have included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis, excluding the results of Power Solutions. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls\u2019 ordinary shareholders was $0.21 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.19 related to special items, which Brian will address in his comments. Excluding these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.40 per share compared to $0.26 in the prior year quarter. Now, let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I would like to provide a few thoughts as we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2020. Starting on Slide 3, we continue to see good momentum across the majority of our key performance metrics with Q1 providing a strong start to the year. We saw 70 basis points of margin expansion this quarter. This resulted from a reduction in structural costs, improved project execution, accelerated service growth, expansion in gross margins and driving innovation. All of these initiatives will remain key focal points for us as we go forward. We have also made significant progress in improving our cash generation profile with important steps towards better management of our trade working capital and continued discipline around CapEx spending. We still have more work to do to bring free cash conversion up to 100% on a sustainable basis, but I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made to-date. As we will discuss on the next slide, orders were flat in the quarter, but I am confident given the continued strength we see in our pipeline we will see acceleration in Q2. Our primary end markets, commercial HVAC, building controls, Fire & Security remained healthy and we are well positioned as leaders in each market. We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet over the course of the last 9 months with ample flexibility when it comes to future capital deployment opportunities. Finally, as I have said many times in these calls over the last couple of years, we remain intently focused on execution in building a strong performance culture to drive sustained performance and maximize shareholder value. Turning to some of the details for the quarter starting with orders on Slide 4. Orders for our Field businesses were flat in aggregate in Q1 as we faced tough prior year comparisons given the timing of announced price increases. Last year, our announced price increases were effective in January, which resulted in a pull-forward into Q1 fiscal \u201819. This year we accelerate our announced price increases to be effective in October, which resulted in a pull-forward into late fiscal \u201819. Looking forward, our order pipeline remains robust with an attractive mix of service and a balanced profile of small and large projects. We expect order growth in Q2 to be in the mid single-digit range and we remain very confident in our low to mid single-digit growth target for the full year. Backlog ended the quarter at $9 billion, up 6% organically versus the prior year and up 2% on a quarter sequential basis which provides high visibility through 2020. Turning now to Slide 5 for a quick recap of the financial results in the quarter, sales of $5.6 billion increased 3% on an organic basis. Within the Field businesses, total service revenues grew 3% in the quarter on top of mid single-digit growth in the prior year. Our service business represents over $6 billion in revenues or a little more than 40% of our Field revenue base and provides us with a very profitable, resilient revenue stream. As growing and expanding our service offering has been a key priority, we recently appointed a dedicated global service leader. Ganesh Ramaswamy joined the team from Danaher and will drive improved consistency of fundamentals across our global direct channel, leverage our infrastructure and investments and work closely with regional leaders to execute on our strategic priorities. With the strength and depth of our portfolio, we have a tremendous opportunity to strengthen our core service business, while building and deploying new service solutions leveraging our digital capabilities. Adjusted EBIT of $448 million grew 13% on an organic basis driven by solid 7% growth in segment profit and a continued focus on reducing corporate expense. Overall, underlying EBIT margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year excluding a 10 basis point headwind from FX. Adjusted EPS of $0.40 increased 54% over the prior year with solid operational performance and a significant contribution from the deployment of proceeds related to the Power Solutions sale. Adjusted free cash was an outflow of under $100 million in the quarter in line with our normal seasonal pattern, but a significant improvement over the last 2 years. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in more detail. Brian Stief : Thanks, George and good morning everyone. So, let\u2019s get started with a look at our year-over-year EPS bridge on Slide 6. You can see that operational performance including synergies and productivity save contributed $0.09. Deployment of the Power Solutions proceeds benefit both our year-over-year share count and net financing charges which added $0.06 and $0.03 respectively. Other net items in the first quarter were roughly $0.01. This results in our first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.40, up 54% year-on-year. So let\u2019s move to Slide 7 and look at our segment results on a consolidated basis. Sales of $5.6 billion increased 3% organically led by 4% growth in our Field businesses and 2% in global products. Segment EBITDA of $625 million grew 7% organically driven by volume leverage from the Field, strong price costs realization in our products businesses and continued productivity save and cost synergies. Lastly, Q1 segment EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 11.2%. If you look at the margin waterfall, underlying operational improvement contributed 50 basis points and this included a 10 basis point headwind related to our retail business in North America. This was partially offset by 10 bps related to other items in the quarter. Now, let\u2019s take a look at each segment in more detail, so starting on Slide 8, North America. North America sales grew 3% organically with balanced growth in both install and service activity. Growth was led by Fire & Security, which grew mid single-digits in the quarter led by higher install activity. Our applied HVAC and control businesses increased low single-digits in the quarter given the double-digit growth in equipment last year. Performance Solutions declined low double-digits this quarter due primarily to a tough prior year compare of over 30%. As we expected, adjusted EBITDA increased 2% and EBITDA margin was in line with the prior year at 12%. Favorable volume leverage and benefits from synergy and productivity saves were offset by a 30 basis point headwind related to our retail business. And as we mentioned on our Q4 call, we expected to see continued margin headwind in retail given the change in mix to increase project revenue. Orders declined in the quarter as George mentioned and this was primarily due to the timing of price increases in our applied HVAC business which did provide a 3 percentage point headwind. We expected to start the year off a bit slower in North America, but we are confident that orders will accelerate to mid single-digit range in Q2 given current pipeline activity. Backlog in North America remained strong at $5.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Turning to EMEA on Slide 9, sales grew 7% organically with the install up 10% and service up 5%. Growth was positive across all regions and across HVAC and Controls, Fire & Security and Industrial Refrigeration. Our HVAC and Controls business grew high single-digits helped in part by easier prior year compare, but also benefiting from order strength in the back half of 2019 for our shorter cycle controls business. Growth was particularly strong in Europe which increased low double-digits and in the Middle East which was a soft spot through fiscal \u201819 we saw mid single-digit growth. Fire & Security grew mid single-digits with solid growth across both install and service activity and in all regions led by mid-teens growth in our subscriber business in Latin America. Industrial Refrigeration which was predominantly in Europe remains a bright spot in the region and that was up high-teens in the quarter with solid growth in both install and service. Adjusted EBITDA increased 21% and EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points to 9.7%. We continue to benefit from favorable volume leverage as well as our continued efforts around reducing structural costs and improving project execution in this business. Our orders in EMEA/LA increased 4%. This was led by continued strength in our Controls platform, particularly in Latin America. Orders in Europe were up slightly on a tough prior year compare and backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, up 8% year-on-year. So, let\u2019s move to Slide 10 on APAC. APAC sales grew 3% organically led by higher demand for project installations, which grew 9% in the quarter. Fire & Security, which as you know, represents about 30% of APAC sales saw continued strength of low single-digits overall. HVAC and Controls which represents remaining 70% of APAC sales was relatively flat year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% with margins up 60 basis points to 11.4%. Favorable volume leverage, productivity and synergy saves and improved execution were partially offset by a higher mix of install versus service in the quarter. Asia-Pac orders were up 1% against the tough 9% prior year compare consistent with the trend we have seen over the last several quarters. Backlog in APAC increased 2% year-over-year to $1.6 billion. I just point out that the environment in APAC remains competitive and the economic conditions in some areas remain uncertain. We continue to experience macro related headwinds in some of our key markets in Asia, including the ongoing trade dispute and now the coronavirus which are overhangs in China as well as the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong. That being said, we are seeing nice improvement in the underlying fundamentals in our APAC businesses, but we are monitoring the situations very closely. So, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11, Global Products. Global Products sales in the quarter increased 2% organically driven primarily by strong price realization. We saw BMS sales grow high single-digits in this quarter despite a low double-digit compare in the prior year and this was led by strength in our Security Products business. HVAC and refrigeration equipment was flat with mixed performance across the individual platforms. I\u2019d also point out that we have recently restructured our distribution channels in Canada to allow us to better serve the residential and light commercial markets and to accelerate our growth. Total resi HVAC declined low single-digits driven a high single-digit decline in our APAC residential business as well as a mid single-digit decline in our North American business. Let me go through that in a bit more detail. As we detailed for you last quarter, we expected continued pressure in our APAC residential business, primarily due to the softer market conditions in Japan. Our North American business was negatively impacted in the quarter by the Canadian distribution restructuring I mentioned previously and as well as the lower than expected shipments in our furnace business due to lower heating degree days in the quarter. Given the low double-digit prior year compare, we expect this weakness to continue into the second quarter. Light commercial unitary grew low single-digits on a low-teens prior year compare with sales in North America flat due to weakness in our national accounts business. Our VRF business continues to outperform growing mid single-digits while our applied HVAC equipment declined mid single-digits primarily due to the pressures in APAC. We continue to see very strong demand for replacement chillers in North America. IR equipment grew mid single-digits in the quarter, helped by a relatively easy prior year compare. Finally, Specialty Products grew low single-digits on solid demand for fire suppression products, particularly in North America. Product segment\u2019s EBITDA increased 6% and the EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points as the under-absorption on lower volumes was more than offset by positive price costs and the ongoing benefit of cost synergies and productivity. So, let\u2019s move to Slide 12 in corporate expense. Corporate expense was down 13% year-over-year to $81 million driven primarily by the continued benefits of synergy and productivity save, as well as our ongoing actions to reduce our cost structure given the Power Solutions divestiture. On Slide 13, free cash flow, reported Q1 free cash flow was just under $400 million. Excluding a little more than $100 million in one-time cash outflows related to integration and the $600 million tax refund that we received in the quarter, adjusted free cash was an outflow of less than $100 million which is $100 million improvement versus last year. This was primarily due to continued improvement in working capital management as we saw trade working capital as a percentage of sales declined 60 basis points. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of 95% excluding the $300 million in one-time cash outflows related primarily integration and the $600 million tax refund. So let me turn to the balance sheet on Slide 14. Net debt was up slightly as we continue to deploy cash towards share repurchases despite Q1 being our seasonally weak cash generation quarter. You can see share repurchases in the quarter were $650 million roughly in line with the cadence that we expect for the full year. Before I turn it back to George for his closing remarks, I\u2019d want to briefly mention a couple of items on Slide 15. First, during the quarter, we recorded a restructuring impairment charge of $111 million, about half of that is cash and about half of that is non-cash. And the cash impact of that, we\u2019ll expect to see in the current year and is included in our guidance. The cash restructuring charge reflects cost associated with the final year of the JCI-Tyco merger integration activities as well as the ongoing reduction in costs related to the Power Solutions divestiture. Secondly in the quarter, we recorded a non-cash stock charge of $30 million related to Swiss tax reform and this will not impact our 13.5% rate for the year. And then lastly, we also adopted a new accounting standard related to operating leases which results in a gross up of other non-current assets and other current and non-current liabilities in our balance sheet. So, overall we are off to a great start in fiscal \u201820 with strong earnings and cash flow and improving margins. And with that, I will turn it back over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I just want to reiterate that we continue to expect our fiscal 2020 earnings per share before special items to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, which represents earnings growth of 28% to 33%. We have included the full details of our guidance as previously provided in the appendix to the slides. Our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the fiscal year and a continued commitment to solid execution into improving the underlying fundamentals of our business. I am confident that we are well-positioned to deliver continued long-term shareholder value. With that operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Mr. Coe, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning guys. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Nigel. George Oliver : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Just of the nice margin trends in the Asia-Pac and EMEA Latin America segments, you have had some challenges especially in Asia-Pacific. Do you feel like you are now in a better position going forward and based on the backlog and the mix kind of outlook do you expect to continue to see sort of margin leadership from those two segments? George Oliver : Yes, Nigel. We have made really nice progress as Brian talked about within the margin structure within Asia-Pac. With the growth being in low single-digits we have worked \u2013 this quarter we delivered 60 basis points year-on-year. And that\u2019s also with unfavorable mix with our installed growth growing faster than service, but I think the fundamentals the way that we are pricing \u2013 the way that we are selling value, all of that is playing out within the structure and we believe that now with the fundamentals we are going to continue to improve on a go forward basis. Brian Stief : I would just add to that, that in 2018, Nigel, as you probably recall, we took a restructuring charge and some of that related to our European businesses. And I think we are really seeing the benefit in \u201819 and now into \u201820 of the results of some of those actions that were taken in 2018. Nigel Coe : Great, thank you. And then my follow-up is your comments on the residential HVAC markets, we all know it\u2019s quite a warm winter, very warm winter, but the comments on continued challenges in 2Q, is that more a function of the some of the restructuring you are doing in Canada or is that a reflection more with the market? George Oliver : Nigel, what I would say, it\u2019s both. When you look at our performance here in Q1, it\u2019s been mainly globally we are down a bit and a lot of that is driven by our performance or the market in Japan, which we are down in line with the market in Japan. In North America, it\u2019s been, too. When you look at the overall furnace market, we are extremely strong in that space and that market is down kind of high single-digits and right now that\u2019s continuing. And when you look at our restructuring of our Canadian distribution channels, what we have done is we have taken multiple channels. We have consolidated that and now we are going to be expanding our points of distribution to be able to effectively now be much better positioned to accelerate growth in that region. That is all playing out here in the first and second quarter and we will be positioned in the second half to be able to pickup from a growth standpoint from there. Nigel Coe : Thanks, George. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Mr. Sprague, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thanks for pulling your call up to kind of accommodate all of us. I appreciate that. George, on the price kind of pull forward on orders, we normally think of that being potentially kind of a residential phenomenon, but not something that would kind of impact the larger company given the nature of kind of applied and commercial projects, you just kind of speak to how broadly the timing of orders might have been affected by pricing and your kind of visibility on Q2 orders? George Oliver : Yes, I mean, we have \u2013 historically, we have had our price increases in January. And as we have been working on price cost over the last couple of years, we have made a lot of progress. And so as we have been planning for 2020, we have made a decision to pull forward. And with that with the announcements there is a behavior that goes along with those announcements. And when you look at last year and for instance in North America, we had high-teens growth in our product last year in North America because of the price being effective in January. When we announced the increase in coming \u2013 being pulled into October, certainly we benefited in the fourth quarter of last year, because of the same phenomenon. So there is a behavior around our price increases. What I would tell you, Jeff, is that the underlying activity is very strong across the board. Our pipelines pretty much across the board are high single-digits \u2013 mid to high single-digits. And so my confidence in being able to deliver low to mid single-digit order growth in the second quarter and be positioned here for the year is very strong and that ultimately correlates to the revenue that we are projecting for the total year. Antonella Franzen : And Jeff, just as to quantify the impact of that for you, when you look at our overall Field orders, they would be up low single-digits on an underlying basis. Jeff Sprague : Okay, thank you for that. And just on investment spend, not called out in the bridge, has this now kind of normalized and it will just kind of track with revenue growth from here or should we expect kind of other initiatives maybe to pop up and be part of the earnings equation? George Oliver : As we have committed over the last couple of years, our reinvestment in the sales channels as well as the reinvestment in products now as a percent of revenue is flattening out in 2020 and beyond. And so what\u2019s happening Jeff is that we are continuing to add sales in line with what we see the market activity to be. So, we are continuing to add sales, but we are getting productivity with all of the expansion that we have done over the last couple of years. In engineering and R&D, we are continuing to obviously increase the dollars with the reinvestment, but maintaining that now as a percent of the overall revenue that\u2019s being achieved. And so we feel good \u2013 we are also similarly we are doing combining the footprint, we are making sure that we are getting good productivity on the dollars that we are spending and ultimately tracking that to the new product introductions that we are bringing to market to make sure that we are getting the appropriate volumes and returns on those investments. Jeff Sprague : Great, thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open sir. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : I just want to follow-up on Jeff\u2019s questions on pricing and George, just so we are clear, will price increases be more of a dynamic decision based upon material costs or will there be strategy around anticipating customer behavior, but just may address the timing of price increases going forward? George Oliver : Yes. What I would say, Deane, if you go back 2 years ago, we had negative price costs and the market \u2013 with the market changes we weren\u2019t positioned to be able to move quickly to stay ahead of that. We have made significant improvement now building out our strategic pricing capability across our businesses. So, it is more dynamic where we are tracking the markets, we are tracking our win loss. We are making sure that we are selling value and bringing value propositions to our customers, instead of this just annual price increase. Now, there is historically that\u2019s what\u2019s happened within the industry we are in. But I believe that now we are much more dynamic relative to what\u2019s happening in the markets that we are serving. And as a result of that, you saw nice progress with our price costs last year, where we actually turned the headwind that we had in \u201818 to a tailwind in \u201819 and that\u2019s continuing now in 2020 with probably I estimate over a point of our top line will be driven by continued very positive price cost. Deane Dray : Thank you. And then just as a follow-up now that they have declared the coronavirus a global health emergency, I know your 2020 guidance does not anticipate impacts, but it\u2019s likely happening giving all the shutdowns going on? Any sense of where and how you are tracking, steps you are taking internally? Just anything you would share would be helpful? Thanks. George Oliver : What I would start by saying about 6% of our revenue is achieved in China. So, overall, it is significant, but in the grand scheme, relatively small. We\u2019ve been working very well across all of our teams that are positioned in China. We\u2019ve got not only all of the business units totally aligned, but we\u2019ve got full support of our EHS professionals, our facilities leaders and security where we get a daily update from our Asia-Pac leader, certainly, a top priority for us to make sure that all of our people are safe and protecting them. As you know, most provinces have mandatory holiday extension now through February 10 and that most of the travel within China now has been curbed or curbed significantly. And so what we \u2013 we are also assessing the supply side to have a pulse on what\u2019s happening with our supply. There could be some supply chain disruptions. To-date, it\u2019s been minimal. What I would say it is a fluid situation and that we are monitoring it very closely. At this stage, Deane, it\u2019s hard to assess \u2013 difficult to assess, but could have some deferral of activity. I mean, certainly, we will have to keep everyone updated. Deane Dray : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for you question. Our next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open sir. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Scott. George Oliver : Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : I don\u2019t want to fixate too much in the price, because it\u2019s been beaten to death, but it\u2019s pretty interesting that after all these years, pulling it forward to October did \u2013 were the competitors been \u2013 do they do the same thing or were you out there for a whole quarter with higher prices generally than your competitors and that would have had some negative volume impact perhaps? George Oliver : Yes, I believe that given the way that price increases occur within the industry, we are now ahead. And so therefore, we have the issue that last year we had a very strong first quarter with our HVAC equipment and then this year, because we had pulled it forward, we had seen some of that benefit, Scott, in the fourth quarter of last year. And then what I would tell you is that when you look at the underlying pipeline and how the pipeline converts. We have a very strong pipeline. It\u2019s high single-digits. We usually \u2013 there is pretty good predictability of how we convert into percent. And so I have confidence that we are going to get back to like I said kind of low to mid single-digit order growth in the second quarter and for the year, very strong pipeline to deliver the mid single-digits. So, I mean, overall, we are in line with where we thought we would be. Scott Davis : Okay, yes. Just the mechanics are interesting. My follow-up is just on the replacement chiller, the North America replacement chiller market, is there a sense I have never seen the data out there on kind of the age of the installed base when you are talking about the bigger chillers. Is there a sense that the installed base is old and there is a long tail that there is a greater sense of upgrading or replacement for energy efficiency, any \u2013 just some of that is a little bit obvious, but just trying to get a sense of how long that tail of demand is? George Oliver : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s all of the above. I think given the value proposition with our new chillers and the ability to be able to reduce energy consumption and drive efficiency, there is certainly a big value proposition there. And so, it\u2019s looked at in total value. So, when you look at what their current cost is to maintain and what the energy consumption is we typically will go in and create a value proposition that not only we can improve their operating cost, but also reduce energy. So, you got to look at it as in total cost. And so I think as we now launch new products, we bring our digital capabilities in how we optimize the operation of the equipment, how that integrates with the overall building systems? I think there is a real attractive value proposition for our customers. So, we are seeing a nice pickup there. Scott Davis : Okay, thanks. Helpful. Thanks. Good luck guys and good job this year. Thank you. George Oliver : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open sir. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. John Walsh : I guess a question around the retail business you kind of called it out the last couple of quarters it\u2019s now in the bridge. Just wondering it can be lumpy, how long should we expect to kind of hear you calling out the retail headwind as it relates to the North America business? George Oliver : Hey, John. Our retail business, when you size the business, it\u2019s roughly about $900 million. We have a presence globally. We have the industry leader. I mean, loss prevention inventory intelligence, traffic insights. It\u2019s a very profitable business, because it\u2019s a high value proposition for our retail customers. And now that all being said, there has been lots of change in the industry given the proliferation of online shopping requiring as we look at our overall offering, more towards digital solutions, a lot more installations that occurred during the quarter. But I believe that with the value proposition the way that we are aligned we are going to continue to see the business perform, but is going to be a different mix within the business. So, it\u2019s something that we are watching carefully. We are working very closely with each one of our retail customers and laying out what the year looks like and how we are going to be positioned to be able to support their year, but it is given what\u2019s happening within the retail space, there is a lot of change that\u2019s happening and we are going to make sure that we are positioned to be able to capitalize on that change and support the customers through that. John Walsh : Great. Thank you for that. And then I guess some in the past, you have talked about the impact around PFAS and the AFFF, wondering if you can just provide us any kind of update there? George Oliver : John, there is no change in our position. You have to keep this in perspective. Tyco and Chemguard make life-saving firefighting foam, not PFAS chemicals. And Tyco and Chemguard purchase compounds that contain trace amounts of PFAS, which they blend make the foam. And their firefighting foam is made to exacting military standards. The majority of the foam in issue is specified and used by the U.S government and military and therefore is subject to the government contract to the defense. And so, Tyco fire products and Chemgaurd have always acted responsibly in producing these firefighting foams. And therefore, we feel confident in our ability to defend these claims. But I also would like to share a few other facts. PFAS chemicals have been used by other companies since the 1940s in many products and applications. And we didn\u2019t start producing firefighting foam until the mid 1970s, which was over 30 years later. And these foams are used only intermittently and predominantly at very specific sites such as military basis. And then last is when you look at third-party scientific studies that are also recognized as firefighting foam accounts for only a very small percentage of PFAS that has historically been used in this country. So, overall, position has been changed. We feel very good given what we have done for our government military customers and certainly, there is really no additional updates. John Walsh : Great. Good quarter and thanks for the updates. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next call or question \u2013 I am sorry is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Steve. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : What\u2019s going on in the \u2013 so, I think one of our businesses in North America I think was down, it was a solutions business or something, is that like the performance contracting business, you guys still do that stuff? George Oliver : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 our solutions business saw the large performance contract, Steve. And as we have always talked, the order intake on that can be pretty choppy given the size of the contracts and then the flow of those contracts can give you some pretty significant variations quarter to quarter, but it\u2019s not a huge part of our business but it can impact when we talk about that particular business, you can have some big swings quarter-to-quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then any \u2013 just to kind of level set people, any color on whether the second quarter, anything standout as far as abnormal seasonality anywhere, you mentioned \u2013 do you expect the orders to pickup a bit, anything on free cash or the underlying business results that we need to kind of keep in mind for second quarter? George Oliver : Steve, I\u2019ll take that. On the organic growth, we are looking at low single-digits and that\u2019s again against a prior year compare of 6%. When you break that out, the Field businesses will be low to mid single-digit and that\u2019s to a compare of 5% and products will continue low single-digits and that\u2019s to a compare of 7%, so overall continued performance on the top line. There will be, as Brian mentioned, within products some additional pressure here in Q2 on North America resi, but as we go through the year, we still feel very good in the second half of the year. EBITDA margins, expanding in line with the guidance for the year, 40 to 60 basis points and we see expansion across all segments. And as you know, the normal seasonality to our year is typically 30% in the first half, 70% in the second half, but because of the share repo this year, it\u2019s a little bit more skewed to the first half. And then when you look at the overall consensus, it is in line with our guidance for the year and the guidance that I reiterated earlier was EPS range of $2.50 to $2.60 and that would be an increase, Steve, of 28% to 33%. Steve Tusa : Wow, great. Brian Stief : I would just add to that, Steve, I think from our corporate expense standpoint we had a pretty low quarter. As you have probably seen in the past, the second quarter tends to be a little bit higher. So I think we are \u2013 our guidance sits out there for corporate expense. It\u2019s still pretty solid as we sit here today. And then when it looks \u2013 when you look at cash flow, I think cash flow we would continue to see some improvement like we saw in the first quarter. So, I think all-in-all, we feel real good about the second quarter. Steve Tusa : Hey, George. Just one more quick follow-up on the \u2013 one just the general strategic question, I don\u2019t think anybody has asked it yet, but obviously, a lot of these companies progressing on their splits? How do you guys view? Is any change in your view on kind of the strategic imperative to grow the residential business, more structurally? George Oliver : I mean, we have been focused. When you look at our strategy, Steve, we have been focused on executing and getting the fundamentals in place delivering on our commitments and ultimately driving results. That\u2019s the focus for us here in 2020. We have been returning in line with what we committed, a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. And we have a lot of underlying momentum across the organization whether it be the margin fundamentals on how we are launching new products, we are upgrading our leadership and ultimately now deploying our digital strategy. So I think when you look at our positions, that\u2019s one that we have been investing heavily in the residential spaces that we have been investing heavily with new products and technology. We are seeing progress, because it is a critical element of our line card and how we ultimately support our customers. And so we are going to continue to stay focused on executing, on delivering on the commitments and certainly keeping a pulse on what\u2019s happening within the industry as far as any type of consolidation. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks for the detail guys always. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just a question around the EMEA/LA region, mainly Middle East Africa piece for you and a lot of your competitors that\u2019s been pretty soft for much of the past sort of 12, 18 months albeit lumpy? I think you sounded better, Brian, in the prepared remarks on trends in Middle East, Africa, so maybe just help us understand how you are looking at the applied markets there? And also just remind us of the scale of that piece today? George Oliver : Yes. So, Julien, I\u2019ll give you the overview of EMEA/LA. We have made a tremendous amount of progress in EMEA/LA over the last couple of years, not only in expanding our footprint from sales \u2013 from a service standpoint pretty much across the region. And when you look at our performance in the first quarter, organic growth 7%, it was both install and service, HVAC and control is up high single-digits, Fire & Security up mid single-digit and Industrial Refrigeration as Brian said to an easy compare, but up high-teens. We have made tremendous progress. And with that, we have seen good leverage on the margin rate would be the volume \u2013 good productivity savings in cost synergies. And so overall, we are executing extremely well even within the current environment, we are seeing a pipeline continue to expand and we are converting orders kind of mid single-digits with the backlog up 8%. So overall, we have done over the last couple of years the restructuring as Brian talked about the work we have done from a go-to-market is really beginning to play out. Now, that all being said in the Middle East, certainly part of that, it does represent about 10% \u2013 12% of the overall EMEA/LA revenue. Last year was a tough year. 2019 was a tough year for us, but we are beginning to see obviously with easier comps. The work that we are doing around service and seeing some of the project installations come back. But I mean, overall, I\u2019d say when you look at the whole region, we have made a lot of good progress in the last couple of years and competitively I think we are positioned in an extremely strong position. I don\u2019t know, Brian, you want to? Brian Stief : No, I think you summarized it well. I think we had a pretty easy comp in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of fiscal \u201819 and so that benefited certainly in the current year, but I think we are better positioned today than we were a year ago for sure. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then my second question just around corporate cost, I heard the color on second quarter versus first quarter, but for the year as a whole, maybe just highlight the confidence in that range, so corporate costs that you have given on Slide 21, particularly in light of a very good performance in Q1? And also, where do we stand today in terms of realized stranded cost reduction since the Power divestment and how much stranded cost is still left to come out from that and whether that view has changed in the past 9 months? Brian Stief : So, our corporate expense guide for the year is $330 million to $340 million and we ended up at $81 million in the first quarter. That tends to be a lower quarter for us. And so I think there is going to be a tick up in the second and third quarter. So I think that guide of $330 million to $340 million is still a pretty good number maybe on the lower end of that, but I think that\u2019s probably a good number to use for now. As it relates to the Power Solutions, stranded costs take out, I think we had communicated that we were going to have about a $10 million benefit that we saw in \u201819. There was going to be about $30 million in 2020 and then the full run-rate $50 million benefit we would see in \u201821 forward. We saw probably about what you would expect a pro rata portion of that $30 million here in the first quarter. And we would expect that $30 million to be delivered throughout the course of the year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Sir, your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : George or Brian, obviously it was nice to see that tax payment helping your GAAP cash, but adjusted cash is maybe slightly better than your normal seasonal weakness? When you look at 2020 and the initiatives that we are going to keep your cash conversion down to 95%, such as equity income from our JVs versus dividend and pension? Did you see anymore improvement in trade working capital versus your expectation that can help you in 2020 and how are you thinking about your ability to collect dividends from your JVs in 2020? Brian Stief : So the trade working capital as a percentage of sales as I mentioned did improve by 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We saw a day improvement in DSO, a day improvement in DPO. We saw 5 day improvement in days on hand in the inventory side. So all-in-all, we made progress really across the three key metrics. As we look at the 95% for the year, that type of improvement was contemplated when we gave the 95% guidance. I would tell you that as you know this is the first year that we are going to end up in the situation where we have got reported cash flow in excess of adjusted cash flow. Because of that $600 million tax refund we got in the first quarter, but we still tend to be a little bit short of 100% converter, because of the level of our CapEx, the fact that we don\u2019t get is the entire amount of our equity income out in terms of dividends from our JVs. And then we still have this pension income that doesn\u2019t come with any cash. Now, that\u2019s offset with some amortization benefit. So I think longer term, we are going to get to that 100% level, but sitting here today, the headwinds are still a little bit more than the tailwinds we have got. So our targets are 100%, but I think 95% is a good number for this year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, Brian. And then George, can you give us some more color into the inventory destock situation that you had last quarter in Japan and Taiwan, resi HVAC was still down in Q1 there, but it was not embedded last quarter I know you talked about the headwinds in North America impacting Q2, but do you still see the APAC situation not being a headwind as we go into Q2? George Oliver : The unitary commercial is that what you have asked Andrew Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes on the because you said Japan might sort be an over head and as you go Q1 looks like that may be getting a little better but just your comments on Japan and Taiwan in next couple of quarters. George Oliver : Yes so when you look at the we talked a little bit about the softness we had in our furnace business which the market itself is down about 9% we have a strong presence in that market and certainly that hit us and then Brian did talk a little bit about the restructuring that we are doing in our Canadian distribution which short term we did see a little bit of a headwind I think as we get through this first and second quarter that\u2019s going to turn into a tailwind on a go forward basis and we are going to significantly increase our points of distribution and so you will see a little bit where you get a lot of different factors playing together here we think that Q2 will continue to be a little bit soft but as we get through the year we are going to be positioned to get back to above market growth within our business so does that get out what your Antonella Franzen : And Andy just specifically related to Taiwan and Japan as we said last quarter we expected the stocking to be complete in Taiwan in Q4 and it was so our Taiwan business was fine on the A-Pac side and as expected we did continue to have some pressure in Japan in our A-Pac residential business we do expect that to start flattening out as we get into the second quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Yes thanks. Good morning guys. Couple of questions. First I was wondering if you could comment on the M&A pipeline I know you talked about $1 billion sort of set aside for potential acquisitions where do we stand there? George Oliver : We are constantly looking at both Gautam. We are continuing to reinvest organically we have got a pipeline across our businesses where we have gaps technology or products looking at both. So, at this stage there is nothing significant but we are continuing to strengthen our regional footprint and continuing to look at our product portfolio to make sure that we are making the appropriate place in line with the organic investments for making. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And just as you look at the portfolio do you see any incremental potential for divestments as we move forward? George Oliver : Yes we have been continuing to review the portfolio across the board and we have been making small divestures where businesses that are non core and businesses that we don\u2019t want to continue reinvest in but again there has been nothing significant there but that\u2019s a process that we continue constantly looking at the portfolio Gautam. Brian Stief : Hey, Gautam. I would just say that I think when you look at the activity in the current year we have got our business held for sale right now we would expect that to close in the current year and there are some other investment that we will probably make but I think you can almost look at our M&A activity in the current year as with the inflows and the outflows will be relatively the same I don\u2019t think there is going to be anything significant in fiscal \u201820. Gautam Khanna : That\u2019s helpful, Brian. One last one for me just as we look at the fiscal \u201821 what do you think the\u2026 George Oliver : Let me just frame \u201821 and we gave our framework that we gave guidance for 20 and what that ultimately would look like in 2021 as it relates to the deployment of capital with the buybacks and like in addition to that I am very confident that when you look at the fundamentals that we are building across these businesses from margins stand point on a go forward basis that we are going to be positioned we have a pipeline of productivity and savings that ultimately is going to position us to sustain margin improvement year on year similar to what we have seen here over the last couple of years so, I wanted one to understand that that\u2019s going to continue now with that there is some restructuring as it relates to some of the take out of some of the structure that we have in place across the globe. And normally, that would probably be in the 50, maybe the $50 million maybe a little bit more range on an annual basis, well with very strong payback within the year relative to the margin rate that we can achieve. So I feel very confident that with the framework that we have provided relative to the buybacks and how that\u2019s going to play out as we positioned for 2021, the work that we have done in reducing the debt cost and then now with the margin rates that we are achieving, we are going to be positioned to deliver what I would say is incrementals that are 30 plus on our incrementals. And so that will position us extremely well to continue margin expansion and be able to deliver longer term on the margin rate that we originally said we could get to which is somewhere 15% to 16%. Gautam Khanna : Thank you very much guys. Antonella Franzen : Thanks, Gautam. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir. Noah Kaye : Thanks. Good morning. If we can look at North America, we are seeing some improving indicators, both indicators, ABI and Dodge Momentum. Can you maybe just talk about the pace of quoting activity on the longer cycle project business and what kind of confidence that gives you in sustainability of growing the backlog? George Oliver : When you look at North America, I know if you look at the quarter, organic growth was 3%, a mix pretty much across all of the domains, the capabilities. Margins were flat, but overall, the margin rate we did operationally deliver not only with the volume and the productivity 40 basis points, but that was offset with the retail mix and some of the cost pressure there. When you look at orders, we did talk about the orders down 1%, a lot of that was timed because of the price increases. But when you look at the backlog, backlog was \u2013 backlog year-on-year is up 7% to $5.8 billion. So when you look at the mix of that backlog that is both short and long-term projects and as we project the year, we are positioned here for kind of mid \u2013 low to mid single-digit top line growth. We are positioned here to continue to deliver orders that are kind of mid single-digit, low to mid for the year, mid single-digits in the second quarter. And then within the mix of those orders then we will be positioned to be able to convert those orders similar to what we are doing this year as we positioned for 2021. So the cadence that we have and how we look at backlog and how we look at churn, I absolutely support what we are going to achieve for this year and as we build the backlog as we plan for 2021 we feel confident that with the pipeline that we are currently working to convert that will position us well for 2021. Antonella Franzen : And operator, with that, I am going to pass it over to George for some closing comments. George Oliver : So, thanks everyone for joining our call this morning. Again, as we discussed, we are off to a strong start to the year, positioned well to deliver on our full year commitments. As it relates to orders, I feel very confident in mid single-digit order growth in Q2, which then ties to the overall guidance of low to mid single-digit growth for the full year. And with all of the sessions that are coming up, I do look forward to seeing many of you soon. So, on that operator that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you everyone. You may now disconnect. We thank you for participating and have a great rest of your day.",

This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' second quarter fiscal 2020 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. You may have noticed from our slide presentation, we are taking a very different approach compared to our traditional quarterly earnings call format. In order to focus our discussion on addressing the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the steps we have taken as a company to partially mitigate the financial impacts and position the company to capitalize on the eventual recovery. Although we have withdrawn our guidance for the year, I will provide some color commentary on how we are thinking about the second half later in the call. We'll allow plenty of time for your questions. Let's get started on Slide 3. Clearly, we are navigating through unprecedented times. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had profound impacts on the way we live our daily lives and the way companies run their businesses. We believe most of these impacts are largely transitory, but the dramatic slowdown in global economic conditions presents very real challenges. Brian Stief : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with a quick look at our year-over-year EPS bridge on Slide 10. Volume and mix including the estimated sales impact from COVID-19 of $350 million to $390 million, was a $0.10 headwind and this was offset by $0.04 of mitigating actions and a $0.02 tailwind and non-controlling interest as a result of lower earnings in our consolidated Hitachi JV. The net $0.05 to $0.07 estimated EPS COVID impact we discussed on Slide 8 is included in these three columns. As expected synergies and productivity save, net financing charges and share account with tailwinds in the quarter. George Oliver : Thanks, Brian. Let me spend a few minutes on our thoughts for the second half of our fiscal year on Slide 17. We are planning for an organic revenue decline in the range of 15% to 20% with the most significant impact expected in Q3. As I mentioned, we have taken numerous actions both temporary and permanent in nature to help mitigate the financial impact. The benefit of these actions will keep the net decrementals on the revenue decline in the low 20s, which speaks to the value of the mitigating actions we are taking. It is important to keep in mind that the $400 million to $450 million of mitigating actions are in addition to the $150 million of synergies and productivity we have committed for the year, of which $80 million is expected to be delivered in the second half. Our focus is on controlling what we can control and that is ensuring we are financially and strategically well positioned when we exit this crisis. The permanent actions we have taken will ensure we have a lean cost structure while protecting our product and channel investments to lead the new norm as we go forward. As the largest pure play buildings provider, we are leading the change to provide more resilient and flexible building spaces, safer environments, touchless or frictionless access and remote monitoring service delivery. This combined with our position as a leader in intelligent and sustainable building solutions, enables us to deliver the outcomes that matter most to our customers. Depth and breadth of our product portfolio combined with proven expertise and an expansive global footprint provides us with a unique advantage as the evolution of the built environment accelerates. With that, operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're all well. George Oliver : Good morning, Jeff. Brian Stief : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Just two from me real quickly. George, we did see a pretty abrupt impact on your orders and obviously this is unprecedented type situation. But I wonder if you could spend a little time on what the forward order, kind of horizon looks like. Is there wavering in the pipeline? How are people feeling about kind on new construction projects? Obviously, the backlog is nice and gives you some support for awhile, but just wondering what's kind of on the new horizon to kind of backfill on the backlog? George Oliver : Yes. Let me start Jeff by just giving my thoughts on the non-resi construction and then I'll give you a kind of sense on where we are here in April. We are tracking the macro trends and third-party data closely. I would say that we've had incredible discussions with our customers and understanding what their plans are. I would say that through, as we look at our order pipeline, although it's still up, it has moved to the right, purely timing. What I would say about a quarter. Certainly because of that it is what drove us to take the actions that we're taking now, both temporary as well as the permanent cost \u2013 the cost structure changes. And I do believe that there'll be some continued disruptions here which we have limited visibility today. But I think it's kind of tough to look beyond the next six to nine months. I believe short term, our backlog position as Brian discussed positions us here to bridge the gap. And if I were to play out what's happened here, when I look at Q2, we did have a demand air pocket and started certainly in China, Hong Kong, Japan, some of our larger markets in Asia Pac. And then with the shutdowns that occurred in North America and EMEA/LA, that continued and we see that continuing here in third quarter. We did see an impact on service a bit, but that was mainly because of sites being shut down. We do expect that to come back pretty well here as we get through the quarter. So as we laid out our plan based on what we learned on the second half of March obviously, we looked at April and we said orders would potentially be down somewhere kind of high teens, 20%. Based on the daily activity that I've seen and we're watching this every day. It's coming in at about that level. What I would say within that Asia Pac is better. And so what you can see in the pipeline and the orders suggest that that will get back to a more normal by the fourth quarter. And so that is encouraging based on what we're seeing happening in APAC. But certainly as you would expect with all of the shutdowns that occurred in EMEA/LA as well as in North America until our customers come back to work and we're actively engaging with them. It's hard to put that clearer picture together, but based on the interactions I've seen, I am fairly confident that over the next three months we'll see continued improvement. So, although it's kind of high teens orders in April, that'll continue to improve as we go through the second half. Jeff Sprague : Thanks for that. And maybe a follow up, maybe it's for Brian. But on the $400 million to $450 million of cost reductions, how much of that is kind of structural in nature that we could kind of think about carrying over into next fiscal year? George Oliver : So as you would expect, we started early. What we saw happening in China, obviously, we have a big footprint there. And so we began immediate actions. Now some of the actions are temporary, such as unpaid time off, furloughs, other employee compensation, reduced travel. You can imagine all of those actions. And then the other is looking at this from a structural standpoint that we've been able to now proceed with and we'll have a much bigger impact as we move forward. As we look at the world today and what has happened, what I would tell you it has really changed the way we're working virtually. And very quickly we had all of our salary teams working remotely with full security as well as access to Microsoft Teams and the like so we could stay engaged. And so with all of that happening, as we look going forward, it gives us opportunities to think differently and think about our cost structure and ultimately enhance our productivity. And so as you look at the actions we took of the $400 million to $450 million of the mitigating actions expected to come through in the second half, about 80% are temporary. And then the other impact in the quarter are the structural actions that we're taking. Recognizing that though, that's only one \u2013 it's only really the benefit of about one quarter. Then as you project that in 2021, we actually have a margin structure that with the volumes that we're anticipating, that we\u2019ll actually have better margin structure.  And when we look at the buckets of cost, you will about 60% is comp and ben, and that's the result of the furloughs and other employee comp and some of the restructuring. You get 30% that\u2019s indirect spend and about 10% in facilities, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : All right, thanks for that. That\u2019s all I have. I will talk soon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey guys good morning. George Oliver : Good morning Steve. Antonella Franzen : Good morning Steve. Brian Stief : Good morning Steve. Steve Tusa : Thanks for all the detail on the breakout and all this costs. Lots of big numbers being thrown out there. Temporary, you guys seem to be doing some structural stuff as well. So that seems to be a positive. Any color at all on kind of how this 15% to 20% breaks down kind of quarter-to-quarter, or should we just assume that it's within a band kind of stable for third and fourth quarter? George Oliver : Yes, so Steve, as we looked at the third and fourth quarter and try to model this and how it's going to play out based on what we learned in March, certainly the larger impact will be in Q3. And we are tracking Asia-Pac will be better because they are now in the recovery mode. But as you look at EMEA/LA and North America, April will be the toughest month and that'll continue to get better through the quarter. But if you look at the two quarters, the larger impact is going to be in Q3. Steve Tusa : Got it. George Oliver : And so that's why as we saw this happening, we took the actions that we took on very proactively with the temporary actions and then, really then went into the next phase of our permanent cost reductions, which is going to play out, well not only in the second half, but it will set us up well for 2021. And that's what gets us to the net decrementals to be in the low 20s, in the second half. And then when you look at that combined with the \u2013 that combines with the addition of the $150 million of the plan, synergies and productivity that we\u2019ll achieve for the year. About $80 million of that is actually in the second half of the year. Steve Tusa : Got it. Antonella Franzen : Just to help you with the models as well, then below the decrementals, I mean, we continue to take a hard look at our corporate cost structure. I have taken additional actions really as a result of The COVID situation, so our corporate expense now which original guidance was $330 to $340, we would now be in that $265 to $275 range. And then for net financing cost, even though we've taken on some more debt since we suspended our share repurchase program, those two pretty much offset. So net financing costs, we're going to retain at that $245 to $255 level. And then when you look at minority interests or non-controlling interests as a result of some of the pressures that we're seeing in our Hitachi JV, our original guide for non-controlling interest was $210 to $220 and we're moving that down now to $150 to $170, given the pressure we're seeing in Hitachi. So those are kind of three below the line items that'll be helpful to you as you update your models. Steve Tusa : Great, very helpful. Just one last one from me. So if you are down at kind of the lower end of the range of that in 3Q, kind of the 15 to 20, I mean does that mean like install related stuff, because I would think services would maybe hold up a little better or maybe there's some shutdown impacts, maybe that's the difference, but does that mean install is down like in the 30s? George Oliver : No, no. When you look at the way this plays out is the install \u2013 the pressure on install is actually access to sites and all the shutdowns that have occurred in EMEA/LA, it started in China. So when you look at what happened in China in the second quarter, our install was done about 30%, I believe, or thereabouts. And so that will be coming back in third quarter and fourth quarter. When you look at service in Asia Pac, it was down about 7%. Now a lot of that is purely because of access to facilities in the sites that we provide service to. When you look at EMEA/LA and North America, certainly that started at the end of March and that's continuing through April. So we do see an impact, like I said, starting out. And when I, when I gave those previous numbers, those are orders. As far as revenue we\u2019ll be similarly at the higher end of the decline here in April, but we believe that that will sequentially get better as a quarter plays out. And so installs mainly access to sites and then service was purely temporary because of the shutdowns. But we believe that that will \u2013 April be the toughest and we'll get better monthly on a go-forward basis. Steve Tusa : Totally, totally makes sense. Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from, Scott Davis, with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. George Oliver : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Thanks for the color on everything. So it\u2019s early in the morning. But I'm just kind of curious George, a couple of your comments about just what perhaps the building customer may do going forward from whether it's UV-light, or filtration, or some sort of retrofit to perhaps just improve the air quality the building is. Is it too early to have those conversations with your customers? Is it just everybody just scrambling to stay alive right now? And is that a real theme you think that there will be a fair amount of spend that needs to occur to clean the air? George Oliver : Yes Scott, what I would say is we\u2019re in very active engagements with our customers in defining what the new norm is going to be and what technology can do to ultimately address some of the new challenges. Some of what you discussed is absolutely front and center. Initially it's as simple as adding IR scanners so that we can do temperature checks and the like, it's sanitation, it's enhanced filtration and other technologies that can ultimately drive purification of the air. What I talked about in my, my prepared remarks, I would categorize it in four key buckets. What we learned in this hospital response, in this healthcare response is, I think, there is a view that that space is going to be much more flexible and that's across verticals and what can be done to create flexible space. It's going to be safer environments as you say, not only the air purification but then touch-less and frictionless, everything within buildings and infrastructure. What I would say is it's going to be more automation that ties to more automation, which ultimately plays to our strengths. So those are the trends. And I would tell you Scott that very actively engaged with other CEO's and a bunch of our customers in really defining what the new norm will be. And then from an innovation standpoint, we're already deploying resources, very actively working in partnership with our customers to be able to deliver on these types of solutions. Scott Davis : Okay. That sounds interesting. So just to somewhat separate less positive topics, just when you think about your backlog, is there a certain percentage of it that you can consider at a high risk, like hotels, things like that, that just \u2013 the projects just may not get off the ground in the next few years? George Oliver : So right out of the gate we have really gone through all of the backlog recognizing that there is going to be some industries that are going to be extremely challenged given what the impact that this has had. And I would tell you that most of what we've seen from that has been where projects have been pushed to the right. And so although we've seen short term, the inability to convert, although I would tell you the activity is still very high. We've had thousands of customer engagements via video meetings on continuing to stay engaged and ultimately executing on their demand and being able to support them. And so when I look at the backlog where it was actually up 4% that's purely because of the way how things played out from a revenue turn standpoint. I believe that \u2013 and the pipeline is actually up then, although there'll be some that are going to be delayed and potentially canceled because of the state of the industry, I think, that there's new demand that's back-filling that that's coming into the pipeline as fast, given what we see today. Brian Stief : I would just add to that we haven't done a backlog review of the $9 billion though. And as George said, sitting here today, we have not seen a significant number of cancellations. We have seen more delays versus cancellation. So it's something we monitor every month in the ops meetings that we have with our business units. And we'll keep a close eye on it. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you. That's encouraging. Good luck guys. Stay safe. Brian Stief : Likewise. George Oliver : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning guys. George Oliver : Good morning Nigel. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Good morning. So I want to go back to the second half outlook, recognizing that the 15%, 20% is a planning range. Could you maybe just I mean, I think Steve might have tried \u2013 kind of dug into this a little bit, but how do you see service within that 15% to 20%? And then if you could break out how you view Fire, versus Security, versus HVAC service within that kind of range you put out there? George Oliver : Yes, so we look at \u2013 well, I'll give you a sense on Q2 and then how that continues to play out here over the third and fourth quarter. When you look at products, let's start with products down 8% in Q2 will continue at \u2013 that'll be a little bit worse in Q3 mainly because of the residential HVAC, which we talked about in the prepared remarks. And then when you look at the mix of that it will be pretty much across all of the domains. Although BMS is actually holding up pretty well, our digital businesses are holding up well, so most of the decline is being driven by HVAC, as well as Fire & Security. When you look at the Field, the Field was down 3%, service was up one, but that was with North American EMEA/LA up offset with the decline in Asia Pac down 7%. And so as I said earlier, I believe that service, we will see some short term impacts in service even in EMEA/LA in North America here over the next one to two months. But I believe that the service based on our backlog and the demand from L&M, that'll continue to come back over time. On the install side, as I said, we have a good backlog and purely \u2013 right now it's purely because of the shutdowns that's impacting our ability to be able to convert the install revenue. And so as we saw, as I said, it's going to start off at the higher end of that impact. In some cases maybe a little bit worse because even in China, we saw our install get impacted by 30% with the complete shutdown. But as that goes forward with more access to customer sites into projects, we see that continuing to improve through the quarter with service coming back sooner than the total install. Nigel Coe : So would you expect sales to be within that range at the low end, or would it be below the low end of that 15%? George Oliver : Yes, so Nigel, as everyone we\u2019re trying to project what we see happening. This is really based on what we've seen in the last few weeks. I am encouraged that because we've been deemed essential everywhere we work across the globe, recognize that we've stayed pretty much in operations, although we've had some disruptions, we maintained our operations because of the criticality of what we do, supporting our customers. And so most of the impact is purely because we haven't had the access to be able to perform what we do at customer sites. And so a lot of its dependent on that, and how countries open up, and how businesses open up and sites open up. So it's really dependent on that Nigel. But based on what we see here in April, I'm encouraged based on what we've provided for a framework that we are in line with that. Nigel Coe : Okay and I recognize it. Brian Stief : Another way to think about that, Nigel, is our service business is roughly what, 25%, 30% of the consolidated, we're giving a range here of 15% to 20% enterprise wide. So if you look at that and say our products business is about $8 billion, our service business is $6 billion and the remaining is the install piece. I think the service decline is going to be lower than the 15% to 20% range we're given. And then install will be on \u2013 will be higher, a bit higher on the high end. And then products is just somewhat dependent upon how we ramp up in some of our manufacturing facilities. George mentioned in his comments that right now we are in pretty good shape, we\u2019re monitoring some things in Mexico and India, but some of it is dependent upon how quickly we can ramp back up from a manufacturing standpoint. So the 15% to 20% is intended to be kind of a broad guide post here, but service would be lower on the low end or lower certainly than the 15% to 20% range. Nigel Coe : Okay. Yes, that what I was trying to get to. Obviously, recognizing that there's not a lot of decimal points here on the numbers. But George, can you quickly just address in China and Asia Pacific in April which businesses you've seen spring back quickly and which businesses are still somewhat depressed? George Oliver : So when you look at Asia Pac in total, it's pretty mixed. Starting with China, most companies are back to work. I wouldn't say things are back to total normal, but I would say probably in the 80% to 90% area. And we're coming back nicely. We've seen some nice pickup in orders and activity there. Obviously there's still travel restrictions within the country. We are watching, what I would say, we're watching a couple of other areas closely, Singapore and India because of the current lockdowns and there are some pressures there. So when you look at our headquarters, we're back full operations at our headquarters in Shanghai. So overall, I think, we're using that as a model and understanding how that plays out across these other countries. We do expect to see continued challenges in the region in the second half of the year with the larger impact in Q3. If you look at specifically your question on China, I would say the biggest impact, as I said earlier, overall it's about 6% of our consolidated revenue. The revenues were down about 35% organically in the Field, in the Field-based businesses. And a lot of this was driven by our install business in China. But even with that, the good news there is with the work we've done around gross margins with pricing and productivity, our margins are up nicely. And so on a go-forward basis, we feel good with the recovery that's going to play out there. And that seems to be happening as we sit here today through April. And so we are somewhat encouraged by that trend. Now on products, we also have had the impact in products. It's about 5% of the total segment. As Brian talked about, we do have our facilities back in running. The customers are coming back up, but it's not \u2013 I wouldn't say it's at a hundred percent, but it's encouraging that the activity has picked up pretty significantly here over the last few weeks. Nigel Coe : Okay thanks George. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. George Oliver : Good morning Julian. Julian Mitchell : Maybe \u2013 good morning. Maybe just following up on that mix aspect, so is it fair to assume that your decremental margin outlook for the second half that should be embedding or could be embedding a fairly handsome margin mix tailwinds just because service is down a lot less than install. And maybe just clarify that. And also how are you seeing the discipline on pricing across service, install and products, in terms of maybe the marketplace, as well as your own discipline in pricing practices? George Oliver : So let me start with the first question there Julian. When we talked about in the quarter and second quarter install was down greater than service in Asia Pac. And that was true as well as in North American and EMEA/LA. So that where we had a little bit of mix here in the quarter to come through because service was down less than install. When you look at on a go-forward basis, that will probably still be true as it plays out, right. So that the install will be \u2013 there will be pressure there with the install coming back, service, we believe, will come back quicker. But we've seen pressure in both. When you talk about pricing, we have been very successful in continuing to execute on price. For the year, we're still expecting about a point on the top line coming through our price realization. And that has continued even through this period of time with the pandemic. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question really just around the free cash flow conversion. So you've raised that guidance for the year. Maybe I missed it, but if you could clarify perhaps what's changed on the capital spending front for fiscal 2020 and how confident you are that you'll be able to get those sizable working capital cash tailwinds in the second half? Are you seeing payment terms proving fairly regular? And is it easy to manage that balance of receivables and payables? Brian Stief : So the free cash flow conversion going now from 95% to greater than a 100% is really a function of the net income pressure we're going to see in the second half. As it relates to the metrics, I would tell you at the end of the second quarter trade working capital as a percentage of sales, we saw a 10 basis point improvement year-over-year, so not as much as we saw in the first quarter, but still we continue to make progress. It is an area we\u2019re watching very closely in today's environment. I think DSO is flat in the quarter and it's an area that we're watching very closely as we move forward. But I think with the policies and practices that we've got in place now through our cash management office, it's going to be a challenging environment from a cash flow standpoint. We'll manage our trade working capital appropriately and we feel pretty good about landing someplace north of a 100% right now. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Hope you are all well. George Oliver : Hey, Joe, good morning. Joe Ritchie : George, maybe my first question, I know a couple of people have touched on this service versus install piece. But clearly like the service that has held up better in China during the COVID-19, shut downs. And clearly from an install perspective you need to be on-premise. I guess the question that we are trying to understand is from a service perspective, how much of the business is \u2013 does not need to be on-premise, how much of it is kind of subscription based and can be more resilient in this downturn? George Oliver : Yes, so getting back to the service, service held up in Asia Pac better than the overall install and in China was down almost in line with the install, but coming back faster if I misled you there. And so when we look at now and it's mainly because of access to facilities and sites that we provide service to. The rest of it overall Asia that only impacted overall Asia being down 7% with our install in Asia down even greater than that in total. So just to clarify on the first question. And then the second part could you repeat that? Antonella Franzen : Yes, Yes. Joe Ritchie : I guess the second part really was how much of the business \u2013 how much do you have to be on-premise for service for you to generate service revenue versus how much of it is potentially subscription-based, one is more resilient and you don't necessarily on-premise. And just is there a portion of it that is a little bit more resilient that is not location? Antonella Franzen : Hey George, why don't you let me jump in on this one a little bit? George Oliver : Yes. Antonella Franzen : So Joe, I think, one way to think about it is when you look at our total service revenue, about half of it is performance service agreements and the other half would be more non-recurring time and material and things of that nature. Now clearly when you look at that part, that's performance service arrangement, some of that is going to still require to be on-premise but some of it will be remote like monitoring and the such. So I mean don't have it all to that level of detail, but that's one split you can think of as you're trying to think about the piece that's more resilient. And to the point you made earlier, I mean, if you take the performance in APAC during the quarter, clearly you can see that service held in better than the install side of the business. Even if you take a look at the global financial recession in the 2008, 2009 period, you would see something very similar to that as well. Service went down, but clearly not to the extent that install did. So your point well taken, service is much more defensive, particularly in this type of environment and will definitely hold up better. Joe Ritchie : Helpful, thank you. And if I could maybe just follow-up with Brian just from a balance sheet perspective, obviously, pending the buyback at this point, I guess just from a timing standpoint, how would you guys think about, reinstituting a buyback and being a little bit more aggressive with capital deployment from here? Brian Stief : Yes, I think, the current plan is we'll continue to hold off on the buyback through the end of this year. And we think that's a prudent thing to do. And we'll reevaluate it as we think about 2021. But at this point in time I would tell you that as far as your models and so forth, I wouldn't assume any buyback for the remainder of fiscal 2020. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. Hope you are well? George Oliver : Good morning. Brian Stief : Good morning. George how are you thinking about your Fire & Security businesses in general moving forward? When you look at APAC, Field is down 14%, but you see Fire & Security in the Field down only low single digits. So how are you thinking about these businesses, which should be less cyclical than the rest of your portfolio versus that second half guide and down 15% to 20%? George Oliver : Yes, the Field when you look at Fire & Security for the quarter, the Fire & Security products were only down, low single digits and it was a mix. What really drove that was fire suppression and a lot of that was just timing of projects. And on the Field we were down about 2% and that was our low single digits and it was spread across the regions. Now when you play that out, we're going to see similar type impacts in the third quarter, third and fourth quarter relative to the shutdowns and how that plays out. But it is a higher mix of service. So you see less of an impact in total because of that. And that's what we've got modeled. We've got the businesses have been performing well and in spite of the challenges that we faced and we're prepared to continue to execute. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful. Maybe the opposite of that is if I just look at applied HVAC in products, it was down in the teens in Q2. I guess most of that was APAC related weakness, but does that suggest applied to be down more than 15% in 2020. Maybe you can give us your outlook and sort of what you're seeing there are sort of larger projects? Are they just sort of getting deferred right now? George Oliver : Yes if you look at a commercial applied HVAC, revenue is down mid single digits and it's mainly driven by the Asia Pac decline, in being down high teens. And that was the bulk of it. When you look at orders about the same, it was down low-single digits and it's mainly driven by APAC and the full impact that we saw in the quarter because of the virus. And so as we look at our pipeline, we really, as Brian said, we were trending pretty well on our secured orders right through February in EMEA/LA, in North America. And that was true with applied. And so with the impact here we think it's temporary. The pipeline is still there. Some of the pipeline is being pushed to the right because of the timing of projects. But we still feel very good about our position, what we see in the pipeline our ability to be able to convert, now obviously pushed to the right. Antonella Franzen : And Andy, just one thing to jump in here. If you think about the criticality of the things we do both within Fire & Security and HVAC, clearly both very important, especially in the environment we're currently in. I think the important point is what George said, is there is a higher mix in service in the Fire & Security business versus HVAC. So to that point as service will hold up better that kind of gives you an indication of the two different platforms. Andrew Kaplowitz : Great, helpful. Be well guys. Antonella Franzen : Thanks. Operator we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning. John Walsh : Maybe just as a follow-up to that question, just wanted to know what you were, I think, you talked about the healthcare vertical earlier, wanted to know what you were hearing on kind of more of the public side, whether that's municipality, federal and maybe also education if you're \u2013 if that's part of where that pushing to the right is if decisions are being slower coming out of those verticals. How you're thinking about that? George Oliver : Yes, what we've seen there \u2013 short term we've seen a push to the right within those projects also. We do believe we have a pipeline now of new projects that are coming in based on the way that we have responded to the crisis and creating new capacity and new capabilities. And so there is a lot of new projects that have been identified. But when you look at the overall project base, it's been pushed to the right similar to what we've said with some of our other backlog. I do believe that there's going to be some stimulus here in the institutional verticals relative to what's going to happen with the new norm as we discussed earlier, what's going to be required to get these facilities back in operating. So we see an opportunity there, although we're in the early stages of that. And so that's something we're going to watch closely because, I think, based on what we do in the buildings that we support, I think, there's going to be a lot more opportunities. That all being said, I think, there is going to be some financial constraints. And so we're going to have to watch that closely as this plays out. John Walsh : Great. And I'll just leave it there. In the interest of time, I appreciate the color. George Oliver : Thank you. Antonella Franzen : Thanks. George, do you want to make a couple of closing comments? George Oliver : Yes, just to wrap up the call, I want to thank everyone again for joining our call this morning. We are, as you know, we are navigating through these challenging times very well. We're well positioned both financially and strategically to capitalize on the recovery as it plays out. And again, I hope that you and your families remain safe. And I look forward to speaking with many of you soon. So operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. Please disconnect at this time.",

This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn over the call to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. And thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls\u2019 third quarter fiscal 2020 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. I hope you and your families are continuing to stay healthy and safe. Before we get into the detailed review of our third quarter results, I\u2019d like to start by providing you with several highlights and key messages coming out of the quarter on slide 3. I am extremely pleased with how we executed in the quarter and have been encouraged by the monthly sequential improvement. Conditions are beginning to normalize. Our facilities are operating at near-normal levels and access to customer sites is improving more and more every day. And although global macro conditions remain challenging, and the political and social climate in many parts of the world remains extraordinarily dynamic, we are capitalizing on near-term opportunities to engage with our customers as they enhance the health and safety of their buildings and position ourselves long-term as a leader in intelligent building solutions. Brian Stief : Thanks, George and good morning everyone. So, let\u2019s take a look at the year-over-year EPS bridge on slide 10. As you can see, operations net of mitigating actions was a $0.16 headwind in Q3. And I would point out that although volumes were down significantly year-over-year, we did benefit from slightly favorable mix. Price/cost was again positive, and we achieved significant cost savings during the quarter. Ongoing synergies and productivity savings were additional $0.04 tailwind, as planned. And non-controlling interest was a $0.03 tailwind, as a result of lower earnings at our Hitachi joint venture. Lower share count, given our significant share repurchase activity over the past 12 months, provided us $0.10. In total, the quarter benefited from approximately $300 million in mitigating cost actions in response to COVID-19. So, let\u2019s take a look at the segment margin bridge on Slide 11. As I mentioned, we saw broad-based volume declines across all four business segments, as a result of COVID-19. However, our businesses did remain very-disciplined on price in an increasingly competitive environment and that accompanying with the benefit of a tailwind for most of our cost inputs, we were able to expand gross margins by 150 basis points year-over-year, and EBIT margins by 50 basis points. As a result, we held decrementals at 13% at the segment EBITDA level and 9% at the consolidated EBIT level. Relative to the framework we\u2019ve provided you on our to Q2 call for decrementals being in the low 20s net of mitigating actions and high-teens including ongoing synergies and productivity at the EBIT level, I would just point out that volumes came in better than we expected. And as George mentioned, we accelerated our cost actions. So, let\u2019s go to slide 12 and review our segment results in more detail. Total Q3 revenues declined 16% organically as our shorter cycle Global Products business declined 20%, while install and service declined, 18% and 7%, respectively. The impacts of the pandemic were widespread, particularly at the beginning of the third quarter, with lockdowns in many parts of the world restricting our access to customer sites and disrupting our production capacity. Although field orders declined 16% in the quarter, we saw sequential improvement. Backlog of $9.1 billion increased 3% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Looking at the segments individually. North American revenues declined 13% with install down 16% and service down 7%. Applied HVAC declined high-single-digits and Fire & Security was down high-teens with Performance Solutions growing mid-single-digits in the quarter. Segment margins in North America increased 200 basis points to 15.4%, given the acceleration of the cost mitigation actions that took place during the quarter. I would also point out that North American gross margins continue to improve year-over-year. Orders in North America declined 16% with similar percent declines in both, HVAC and Fire & Security. In June, North American orders improved sequentially, trending down high-single-digits. North American backlog end of the quarter at $5.8 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Moving to EMEALA, revenues declined 15% with install down 24% and service down 6%. By end-market, applied HVAC declined at a mid-teens rate, while Fire & Security, which accounts for approximately 60% of segment revenues, decreased at a high-teens rate. Industrial refrigeration outperformed relative to the other end markets, declining only mid-single-digits in the quarter. I would note that by geography, we continue to see challenges across the regions. Europe declined high-teens, while the Middle East fell off double-digits and Latin America was down high-single-digits. Although EMEALA\u2019s EBITDA margins were down 300 basis points in the quarter, given the various country shutdowns and our relative cost structure across the region, gross margins are improving. As many parts of the region are now reopened, we expect improved margins in Q4, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Orders in EMEALA declined 20% in the quarter with service only down mid-single-digits. EMEALA ended with backlog of $1.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Moving to APAC, revenues were down 12% with install down 16% and service down 6%. China\u2019s significantly improved from the mid-30s decline we saw in Q2 to down only 4% in Q3. Although activity in China continues to improve, we were negatively impacted by extended and renewed lockdowns in other parts of Asia. APAC orders declined 10% in Q3, but backlog remains up 4% year-over-year at $1.6 billion. So, moving to Global Products, which declined 20% in the quarter, just outperformed our original expectations. Our North America resi business declined only mid single digits in Q3, driven primarily by favorable weather in June, strong dealer acquisition and the sharp release of some pent-up demand. We also saw share gain in the quarter, primarily the result of our new 14 SEER split system and a competitor\u2019s production issue. We\u2019ve seen significant momentum into July, benefiting from unprecedented order growth in June and we expect a very strong Q4. In Asia Pacific, our residential business declined roughly 20%. However, we have seen signs of recovery in our largest markets, with Japan and Taiwan showing improvement in June. As you would expect, India was down significantly in Q3, due primarily to extended lockdowns related to pandemic. Overall, we expect our APAC residential business to show strong performance in Q4. Although our North America light commercial business declined more than 20% in the quarter, we saw strong signs of recovery in June with orders up 30%. Daily order rates continue to track higher in July, and we see good traction with our new higher tonnage rooftop replacement units. This will contribute to a significant sequential improvement in Q4. Applied chiller revenues declined around 20%, despite strong chiller and air handling unit replacements in North America as APAC declined due to continued project delays and elevated channel inventories. Fire and security products were impacted by production challenges early in the quarter, which we highlighted for you in our Q2 call. Overall, we saw a significant improvement in our Global Products segment in the month of June, exiting the quarter at a high single digit decline. So, let\u2019s see move to corporate expense on slide 13. Corporate expense was down significantly year-over-year to $48 million, reflecting cost mitigation actions, ongoing synergy and productivity save and our cost reductions related to the Power Solutions divestiture. We have not changed our guidance for fiscal \u201820, which implies Q4 corporate expense should be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. I would point out that certain benefits that we\u2019re seeing in the second half of this year do relate to temporary cost reductions, which will put some pressure on corporate expense in fiscal \u201821. I think, the way to think about it is directionally for next year, corporate expense will be in the range of $300 million to $330 million. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 14. As you can see, there are no significant changes versus what we discussed with you in early May. Our short-term debt increased as a result of the opportunistic financing arrangements we put in place in April. Overall, our net debt leverage remains at 1.8 times, well below our target range of 2 to 2.5. Given our strong balance sheet position and cash generation in Q3, as George mentioned, we did resume our share repurchases in Q4, which will approximate $750 million. We\u2019ve also made excellent progress on our refinancing plan for our short-term maturities, which we expect to complete sometime in Q4. We\u2019re very comfortable with our liquidity and balance sheet position and will continue to maintain flexibility as we move through the next couple of quarters. Turning to cash flow on slide 15. Another strong cash quarter with reported cash flow just over $700 million, driven primarily by solid working capital improvement, particularly receivable collections. Adjusted free cash flow was $800 million. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $900 million, well above the prior year. And for the full year, we continue to expect our conversion to be in excess of 100%.  Lastly, before I turn it over to George, we did have three significant special items which are listed on slide 16 that I\u2019d like to comment on. As we highlighted for you last quarter, we did take $186 million restructuring charge in connection with our COVID-19 cost mitigation actions. The majority of this cash outflow related to this restructuring will occur in Q4. In addition, we also took a $424 million noncash impairment charge, related to goodwill for our retail business, which was triggered by the current depressed environment for the retail industry. And finally, we had a noncash mark-to-market adjustment of $132 million in the quarter, primarily related to our pension plans. So, overall, a real strong quarter in the current environment and we\u2019re seeing continued momentum as we enter Q4. With that, George, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. George Oliver : Thanks, Brian. Let\u2019s turn to slide 17 for a look at our guidance for the fourth quarter. Given the trends in Q3, we expect to see a nice sequential improvement in revenue, which is expected to result in a year-over-year organic revenue decline in the high single to low double digit range, with sequential improvement expected across service, project installation and products. Although some temporary actions, such as furloughs will come back in Q4, we will continue to benefit from significant mitigating actions, which will keep our net EBIT decrementals, including synergies and productivity in the low teens range. Overall, we expect our fourth quarter earnings per share before special items to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72, another strong quarter, given the unprecedented environment. Versus our framework for a 15% to 20% organic revenue decline in the second half, we now expect the second half to only be down low teens. This coupled with strong execution, and additional cost savings puts us in a very strong position to finish the year. We now expect our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.16 to $2.20, which represents an impressive year-over-year increase of 10% to 12%. As we continue to navigate through these unprecedented times, Johnson Controls is well-positioned, both financially and strategically. The launch of OpenBlue demonstrates our continued commitment to innovation, enhances our service capabilities and future proofs our strategy. We are in a leadership position to capitalize on recovery and create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : George, could you give us a little more color on OpenBlue? It looks like there\u2019s going to be a lot here for us to digest, not just today but going forward. But, just thinking about how you might be selling different with this, how the customer interaction might change and any kind of early color on adoption or feedback as you roll this out? George Oliver : Yes. Let me just give the framework here. So, we\u2019ve been -- with the merger we did four years ago, this was obviously a big focus area where we could take our multiple capabilities across our products, our digital platforms, bring that altogether into one architecture. So, this is really the investments that we\u2019ve made over that period of time to bring the best together and ultimately create the platform. And with this, it\u2019s really combining products, new technology solutions and services in one digital architecture. And I think, when you look at that, it\u2019s taking what we do with our operational technology combined with IT systems, as well as a lot of new cloud applications that really does create a dynamic digital platform. And so, when you look at this, Jeff, it does enhance all of our domain today. So, in each one of our -- whether be HVAC or Security & Fire, a lot of these digital capabilities are being put to work today to enhance the services that we ultimately provide to our customers. This also gives us an opportunity to create an ecosystem to be able to bring together other technology companies, and where we\u2019re now deploying artificial intelligence and digital twins, to be able to deliver unrealized and increased value to our customers. And so, I think, as we see it today, we are selling this as part of our core. And now, with the announcement today, it\u2019s really now taken that to the next level and we think now more than ever, it\u2019s critical that building environments are safe and secure. So, it\u2019s not only making sure that we have the highest level of indoor air quality, but it\u2019s also combining what we do there with all of the other digital systems within the building to ultimately create the healthiest and safest environment for our customers. And so, I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019re already deploying this today in a number of our core businesses. And I believe that this is going to enable us now with the bigger problems that we\u2019re focusing on solving to be able to do a lot more and how we ultimately support our customers with their return to work. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. And then, just as unrelated follow-up. Obviously, distinguished yourself very nicely here with this decremental margin improvement. It looks like you\u2019re trying to make sure your position to also kind of leverage the recovery. But, I think that\u2019s a question on a lot of people\u2019s minds, as things go the other way. How are you thinking about incremental margins now, when your revenues do kind of flip to positive potentially here in the next few quarters? George Oliver : Yes. What I would say is -- what I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve done incredible job here really going after the cost, not only on a temporary basis, but really looking at significant restructuring that\u2019s going to position us here going forward in \u201821. And so, I believe that the permanent actions that we\u2019ve taken will absolutely offset the -- or mitigate the temporary actions related to the compensation that we ultimately got benefit of this year. And so, when you look at the incremental margins going forward, with all of the changes that ultimately have occurred, I believe we\u2019re going to be very well positioned post-COVID. And we believe that there\u2019s still lots of opportunity, certainly we\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019re playing offense and really focusing on the top-line and going after the new opportunities that we see, given the environment we\u2019re in. But, at the same time, we\u2019re being very-disciplined from a cost standpoint, not only executing on the restructuring, but also on the temporary costs that we address this year, making sure that they don\u2019t come back in -- at a level that doesn\u2019t align to the volumes that we\u2019re ultimately going to see as we get into 2021. And so, I feel very good Jeff that we\u2019d get incremental margins of 30% as we go forward. And with the work that the team has done here, I feel very good as we position for \u201821. Jeff Sprague : Thank you for that. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So, maybe just starting off, like, on the service versus install. I think, as expected, service did a little bit better than install this quarter. I\u2019m just curious, as you kind of progress throughout the quarters, how did onsite access work? Were you able to get into a lot more access into facilities. I think, when we talked had intra-quarter, you\u2019d mentioned that you had about 20% of your business that you had access to, but want to see how that trended as the quarter progressed? George Oliver : What we saw during this period of time is really unprecedented, given the shutdowns that occurred, and throughout most of the quarter what I would say, all of our field businesses experienced a lot of restricted access to customer sites, limiting our ability to perform our typical service and install work. And it was really an abnormal phenomenon relative to what we would see as a typical downturn. And so, even with that, like I said, I believe we outperformed, we were down 9% on a global basis, and we pretty much -- in line with where we saw the most significant lockdown. Now, when I look at our service days and in line with your question is that about two-thirds of our service revenue is recurring, and about 40% of that is actually done remotely, where over about 40% does not require access to the customer and requires access at an agreed upon time. And that typically -- it mainly inspire where you actually have to go on site, giving codes on on-prem inspections where they\u2019re performed. And that\u2019s a big chunk of our services. It\u2019s roughly a little over $1 billion in PSAs in Fire that are excluded from that 40%. And so, we do see that getting better, Joe, as we\u2019re going forward. We\u2019ve seen a significant improvement in June and then again now in July, with our overall service activity. And so, it does help. We can do it remotely. But -- and I think we\u2019ve done that extremely well, given the restrictions that we\u2019ve had. But, now with things opening up, we\u2019re starting to see that demand come back very nicely. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s great to hear, George. And I guess my one follow-on question -- and by the way, I should say also kind of congratulations on OpenBlue. But, the one quick follow-on was on free cash flow. Clearly, very strong, this quarter is better than last year, which is pretty incredible, just given the unprecedented decline we\u2019ve seen this quarter. I guess, Brian, just maybe provide a little bit more details on what drove the free cash flow this quarter, and how to think about free cash flow going forward. I know, it\u2019s a little early for \u201821. But, how are you guys thinking about that on a go forward basis? Brian Stief : Yes. And I think when you look at Q3, very strong quarter, I do think there was probably some timing between Q3 and Q4 which is why we didn\u2019t change our guide here to greater than 100% for the full year. But, when I look forward, I still believe 100% free cash flow is our near-term target. And I have all positive signs that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver that. I think some of the activities that our cash management office that we put in place two years ago, they have done a fantastic job of really getting policies and procedures and protocols in place on a global basis now. And I think, we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of that in the routine processes that we\u2019ve got around cash collection, cash forecasting. So, when we look at the second half, I think you ought to think of it in terms of second half getting us to that greater than 100% free cash. There might have been a little pull forward here in Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So, first of all, I appreciate the guidance. Most companies are still shying away from formal guidance. So, I appreciate that. My first question is really, can we just run through in a bit more sort of detail, the difference between the commercial HVAC performance in Global Products versus what we saw in the geographic segments? I think, it\u2019s probably due to destocking from channels. I know you typically go through independent channels in Global Products. But, can you maybe just talk about whether there is any geographic things to think about that or is it just primarily destocking? George Oliver : When we look at commercial -- on commercial applied, we were down, on a revenue basis, we were down about 9%. And that was split between, install being a little bit greater and service being down about 6%. And when you look at the orders on commercial applied, we were down about 11%. And that split where Asia started to recover faster and that was down a little less than North America, and EMEALA was down in the high teens. So that\u2019s -- I believe that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s on the applied. And then, when you look at the commercial unitary, HVAC was down about 25%. And when you look at what we said is that we are gaining traction as we look at share and the progress that we made in the quarter and then in June what we saw from an order standpoint really have seen a pickup there. And so, I think we feel very good about that space going forward. And then, that\u2019s on a commercial side. And did you -- I missed your -- I couldn\u2019t really hear you Nigel, were you -- as far as on the residential HVAC? Nigel Coe : No. It\u2019s really more about just explaining the difference between the performance we saw in Global Products where I think we saw much heavier declines in both, unitary and applied commercial versus what we saw in the geo segments. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand that dynamic. That was just my question. George Oliver : Okay. And then, on the -- when you look at the products, the pure products, I apologize, the pure products were down, roughly -- when you look at the different businesses, we were down, overall about 20%. And we broke that down out into residential, which as Brian said, North America was pretty strong that\u2019s coming back nicely. And orders in June were very, very strong, up almost 200%. And then, on the other side, on the North America commercial, look at that, like I said, we\u2019re coming back there. And then, the other one is on the APAC residential, we\u2019re down about 20% in Hitachi. And that\u2019s mainly driven by some of the challenges that we\u2019ve had in the markets there being shut down, as well as in Japan and Taiwan markets now beginning to recover, and they\u2019re actually coming back very nicely. And so, that was the -- so to your point, early in the quarter, we saw destocking and some challenges there. But, what we saw during the quarter, from an order standpoint, that\u2019s coming back very nicely within our Global Products business. And that\u2019s going to play out here as we get through the fourth quarter. Nigel Coe : And my follow-on is really about this return to work, getting customers prepared for that. And obviously, everyone\u2019s getting very excited about air quality, indoor air quality. And it seems that the breadth of your portfolio is pretty uniquely well-positioned to help customers solve these problems, be it tracing employees or access, continue access and even the changed filters and that kind of stuff. Our customers looking for complete solutions here? I mean, are you seeing that and therefore, the breadth of your portfolio helping or is it still very much bucket b bucket? Any color that would be helpful. George Oliver : Now, let me start, Nigel, by saying, the changes that are coming to buildings and infrastructure post this pandemic, absolutely does play to our strengths. Our entire strategy revolves around capitalizing on the evolution to these smarter, safer spaces. And why we have a unique competitive position? We do look at this holistically. And when you look at our service techs, we have the largest team of service techs and sales forces globally with the one of the largest install bases and an unmatched product portfolio depth and breadth. And so, if you go through the domain, so let\u2019s start with HVAC and indoor air quality. We\u2019re certainly addressing this when you start with -- you can start with active filtration. We\u2019re now -- the recommendation is going from a MERV 6 to 8 to a MERV 13, 14. And that we can do that. And we ultimately -- you can do that. But many times, it does require to upgrade the fan motor to be able to get the full airflow necessary to support the space that you\u2019re conditioning. So, yes, we\u2019re doing that. The other piece is with our controls, we\u2019re making sure that you get the proper flow of outdoor air. So, you get the maximum air purification with the outdoor air exchange. We\u2019re very much -- that\u2019s another part of the solution. And then, in our air handlers as well our rooftop units, where we deploy UV lighting technologies or bipolar ionization that ultimately -- depending on the space that you\u2019re serving, ultimately purifies the air. And then, at the high end with help of filters, we not only provide portable units, but we also attach our -- help our filtration units to ducted system. And we\u2019ve been the leader in being able to provide standup capacity for hospitals with this temporary space that we\u2019ve been building across the globe, with our capabilities. And then, with that, every one of these situations requires engineering. And so, how you go into a particular customer and whether it be filtration or air purification technologies, and/or how you change the makeup air or outdoor air flow, and then ultimately, how you upgrade the overall system to be able to achieve the highest level of air purification? That\u2019s one aspect, but what I see the opportunity to be is how does that combine with the other building systems that we ultimately deploy, which is Fire & Security. You might have seen where we launched our new camera, thermal imaging camera last week, that is got the -- it's approved by the FDA and it\u2019s got the tightest variation on being able to check temperatures, not only at entries, but then being able to be deployed more broadly across indoor space. And so, that can be attached to the systems that we deploy. Frictionless, as far as how we upgrade all of these devices within a facility and become frictionless. And then, the last is what\u2019s been most exciting for us is taking what we do today with those systems and being able to track and trace, so we can ultimately identify individuals where they\u2019ve been within a facility who they\u2019ve been with, and potentially if they were to be infected, who would need to be quarantined. And so, I believe this digital control does create a competitive advantage. It offers a unique, enhanced user experience with these type of capabilities beyond just any one of the domains, Nigel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : The OpenBlue seems pretty interesting and who -- just logistically, George, who installs the product? I mean, you\u2019ve got your field technicians, your 16,000 folks. Do you have an infrastructure of -- does it require some sort of specialization to install the product and customize it for the customer? And do you guys do that or someone else does that? George Oliver : So, one of our advantages, Scott, is that we do that. I mean, we have technicians in the field. And as we\u2019ve been deploying these capabilities, we\u2019ve been obviously enhancing the skill sets of the technicians required to ultimately deploy these types of solutions. And so, that has been ongoing as we\u2019ve been enhancing these capabilities. And so, I think when you look at our footprint, and not only having our core technologies that we deploy, but now being able to put all of those together into a simple architecture, and be able to then now create outcomes that our customers are looking for to solve some of these new challenges, this is going to give us some incredible advantage. Scott Davis : Yes. It seems interesting. But, when you think about your main competitors, George, I mean Honeywell has a pretty solid product, Snyder is the solid product, plenty of others. But, do you guys feel like you\u2019ve had a chance to see what everybody else has and come up with something that is better or is it just better because you\u2019ve got the installed base, you know the customer, you know the needs more, you\u2019ve got a broader set of product in the building, et cetera? I mean, just try to get a sense of where you think it stacks up versus perhaps the competitors? George Oliver : Yes. I believe that is absolutely a step forward because it\u2019s taken all of the operational technology that we have embedded within our products in edge devices. It\u2019s ultimately then integrating that with IT systems, allowing us with that with our platform to be able to create cloud applications. And so, it\u2019s built off of our core product technologies. And now with the integration of the software into one architecture, allows -- it allows us to be able to create a very dynamic digital platform that we can now create significant outcomes. It takes what I said earlier, very inflexible asset. It makes it very dynamic with the data that we can extract and then ultimately create new services for the customers. And it just happens to be timed when our customers are looking for a lot of new solutions, given the challenges that they\u2019re facing now with the pandemic and the return to work. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : The order pipeline, I mean, it just seems like we\u2019re kind of in across the industry, obviously residential, but even maybe commercial a little bit, everybody\u2019s showing these kind of tough order declines, but backlog is not going down. So, it seems like there is a little bit of kind of, pent up push forward. And you said in your remarks that the pipeline -- there haven\u2019t many cancellations, there\u2019s basically been pushed to the right. Is that -- what does that total pipeline look like on year-over-year basis? I assume it\u2019s not like growing. So, is it just that -- is it the same number of opportunities that are just kind of getting like pushed forward a bit? Maybe just talk about kind of that dynamic on the commercial side as we try and gauge orders to revenues, and how that\u2019s going to convert over the next several quarters? George Oliver : Yes. Let me give you some color there. I think throughout Q3, and of course, we\u2019re engaging with customers on a real-time basis, understanding what their demands are and what else we need to do to support some of the new challenges. So, we have a lot of good insight into what is happening. We did see, like I said, the field order pipeline being pushed a bit to the right. We haven\u2019t seen significant cancellations of existing orders. We have seen some of what was in the pipeline get removed from the pipeline now, given the economic conditions. But, even with all of that our pipeline was up 3% on a year-on-year basis. So, we did see steep declines in April and May, we did see material improvement in June. And so, I think that gives us the sense that now what\u2019s in the pipeline is beginning to convert. And then, as I said on the Global Products, we were challenged in April and May, and that we track book and bill there, but we did see on a recovery basis in June, and that\u2019s continuing in July, we\u2019re seeing very good order flow over that period of time. And so, we believe overall Steve that orders should continue to improve sequentially in Q4, supported by the pipeline, which I just discussed. And I think when you look at -- we continue to engage with customers in providing support to COVID-19 challenges. And I believe that based on what we\u2019re seeing here real time that it continues to improve. Antonella Franzen : I would just add in there, and just to remind folks that our orders for Global Products are not in our overall order number. And you mentioned earlier, like commercial and residential and a lot of activity that folks are seeing. And just to be clear, we saw a very similar trend and had really good order growth in both, the commercial side and the residential side in our Global Products business, particularly in the month of June, and as Brian mentioned, unprecedented order growth in the month of June in residential. Steve Tusa : Right. And that\u2019s that backlog of one that you showed in the slides there? Antonella Franzen : Yes. But that . Steve Tusa : Got it. And just one last one. Any way to kind of quantify any kind of -- what the mix benefits are when install goes down so much more than services? Antonella Franzen : Well, see, let me take that one. So, overall mix, there\u2019s a lot of different dynamics to think about, when you think about our business, because service and install is one component of mix. But then, remember, within each field business and even within Global Products, each domain has mixed up as well. So, overall for the quarter, when you look at all the businesses and various mix across the board, I would say mix overall was about a 20 basis-point benefit. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Could we go back to the indoor air quality topic? And George, what percent of your installed base you think have done their initial assessment of their HVAC systems, as well as their security systems. Because you do the initial assessment first and then you can assess what is needed in terms of upgrades on filtration and air handling and so forth? So, that\u2019s the first part. And then, can you provide us a framework for what you think that potential revenue ramp will look like, again, for all the COVID upgrades? George Oliver : I\u2019d just says, it\u2019s hard to predicting. But, what I would say is that every -- all of our customers with -- and I think this is true for all of us, right? As we\u2019re thinking about our own spaces, we\u2019re all -- I think, this goes right up to the CEO level, understanding what is being done within facilities to be able to safely return their employees to work. And so, I think there\u2019s active engagement and understanding what ultimately needs to be done and what the potential solutions can be. So, I think we\u2019re in that early phase with a very, very active engagement and putting forward what we can do and ultimately how we can address the challenges and what needs to happen to not only improve the indoor air quality, but how do you enhance that with our ability to be able to do temperature checking and be able to integrate that with their building systems and do track and trace. And so, I think, it\u2019s in the very early stages, but very active engagement with our customers. And so, I think, at this stage, it\u2019s hard to predict what that ultimately is going to be. But, I would tell you that the activity is significant across all of our customers. And so, we\u2019re already -- I can tell you with this thermal imaging camera for instance, you can attach that to an existing system, you can deploy that not only at the entrance to a site, but then maybe in some common areas within the facilities, so that you could detect very accurately temperatures of occupants. And then, you\u2019d be able to then quickly assess, if there was an elevated temperature, to be able to then isolate that individual. And then, if there were any other people with our track and trace around that individual, then you\u2019d be able to address and isolate the problem. And so, these are being deployed incrementally, as far as parts of solutions. And then, obviously working with customers and looking at more comprehensive solutions that ultimately address the new workplace. Deane Dray : And just, can you expand on the point on the importance of doing remote monitoring, now. You\u2019re already positioning Fire & Security for monitoring. But now, commercial buildings care so much about their indoor air quality on a go forward basis, not just in the time of the upgrade, but on a regular go forward basis. And maybe that\u2019s CO2 monitoring. But, what -- from the technology standpoint you are positioned today to incorporate HVAC monitoring going forward? George Oliver : Well, it starts with everything being connected. And so, we\u2019re making sure that all products that we deploy are connected, and then, with that connection, being able to provide services that ultimately address whether it be energy efficiency, whether it be monitoring the equipment operation and maintaining the service of that. So, connectivity is the start of it; and then, the ability to be able to collect data, not only on an individual piece of equipment, but how does that correlate to other systems within the building that enable us with now OpenBlue that we can provide the most enhanced solution or the most value for our customers and how we either drive sustainability, efficiency, health or safety. And that\u2019s the unique advantage that we have now with this connectivity and with this architecture within this platform. Deane Dray : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Markus Mittermaier of UBS. Your line is open. Markus Mittermaier : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe I can start with OpenBlue as well, the slide that you have on page five, here on the ecosystem map. If you consider sort of the profit pools behind this map, where do you see your current strength in the portfolio and gaps, and how does that then relate to the M&A priorities? I mean, do you think more sort of vertical atrocity, various thick layers or still sort of horizontal along the edge and device layer? Maybe let\u2019s start there. George Oliver : Yes. So, the idea of OpenBlue is we bring our domain and core capabilities to the platform and then it\u2019s open, so that we can integrate other systems within the building where we don\u2019t have that domain, and then bring that together into one platform that allows us to then be able to utilize the data and apply analytics, AI analytics to be able to create the outcomes that we\u2019re committed to achieve. And so, it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to have every one of these domains. Although what I would say, it does build off of our strength of being a leader in building controls, and then having the multiple digital systems that we have today within Security & Fire that comes together into the platform and gives us incredible opportunity to now be able to bring these types of solutions to the market with this connectivity. Markus Mittermaier : Great, thanks. And then, maybe second one on client security. Can you just peel the onion a little bit? You mentioned the production issues that you have flagged and sort of like extended and renewed locked downs in Asia. If you look at the supplemental data that you published, which is quite helpful, ex-retail looks like EMEALA was sort down low-teen, North America mid-teen, how much of that is sort of like really pushed out, rather than kind of disappeared? You mentioned $1 billion roughly, of your top line that you have access. So, how should you think about Q4, in light of all these access issues that you have? Thank you. George Oliver : Yes. So, we were -- when you look at -- I mean, we go through each of the regions. But in general, I think what\u2019s happened is, certainly with the shutdowns, there was a significant impact in Q3 and very unusual to these typical downturns. And so, what we\u2019re seeing now, with the return to work as facilities are opening, certainly now the demand is coming back as we would expect, in the month of June, and now even more so in July. And so, we\u2019ll see sequential improvement, as we\u2019re going forward in each one of these areas, based on -- I mean, we are concerned in a few areas where we\u2019re going through -- they\u2019re going through kind of a second wave or shutdowns and a couple of regions in Asia Pack and maybe Latin America and the like. But, where the opening up is continuing, we\u2019re seeing similar type demand come back for our services. Antonella Franzen : Operator, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments. George Oliver : Yes. Again, thanks again for joining our call this morning. I want to thank our employees for their extraordinary efforts during this unprecedented time. I am extremely pleased with our continued strong performance. And again, I hope that you and your families remain safe. And I look forward to speaking with many of you soon. So, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

Antonella Franzen : George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As the effects and impacts of COVID are still fresh in our minds, I hope you and your families are continuing to stay healthy and safe. Before we get started with the prepared remarks, I wanted to take the time to officially welcome Olivier to the team. Olivier is on the call today and will be actively participating in our guidance discussion and in Q&A. Many of you have already had the opportunity to speak with him briefly at a few of our investor conferences in early September. And if not, we look forward to speaking with many of you over the next several weeks. From my perspective, the transition couldn't be going any better. And it's clear to me that Olivier is already having a positive impact on the organization in his first 10 weeks. As we said at the time of his announcement, Olivier will formally assume the role of CFO immediately following the release of our 10-K in just a few days. Brian Stief : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. So let's get started with our year-over-year EPS bridge on Slide 6. As you can see, operations, net of mitigating actions, was an $0.11 headwind. Despite continued volume pressure and some unfavorable mix, freights cost was again positive, and we achieved significant cost savings during the quarter. In total, Q4 benefited from approximately $200 million in mitigating cost actions in response to COVID-19. Ongoing synergy and productivity save was a $0.04 tailwind as anticipated, and net financing costs were a $0.02 headwind. Our lower share count, given the significant share repurchase activity over the past 12 months, benefited us $0.05. Moving to our segment margin bridge on Slide 7. As I mentioned, despite continued volume pressure across all four segments due to the pandemic, we did remain very disciplined on price in an increasingly competitive environment. As a result, we delivered another quarter of strong gross margin expansion, up 70 basis points year-over-year to 34.3%. With the full quarter of run rate permanent cost savings in Q4 and the incremental benefits from our cost mitigation efforts, we were able to hold decremental margins to 20% at the segment EBITDA level and as planned, 13% of the consolidated EBIT level. Overall, segment EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points on an organic basis to 15.6%. So let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at our segment results in more detail, and my comments will also focus on the segment end-market performance that's included on Slide 9. For North America, revenues declined 6%, with install down 9% and service down 3%. We saw strong retrofit activity, particularly from our enterprise customers requesting solutions to enhance the health and safety of their facilities. However, demand in our conventional installed business related to new construction remains under pressure. George Oliver : Thanks, Brian. Please turn to Slide 13. As we have come to the end of our original full year integration period, we are at a point now where the difficult work around our internal transformation, portfolio rationalization and leadership changes is now largely complete. While there is always more work to do in an organization of this size, we are very excited about the growth opportunities in front of us. Our portfolio is very well aligned with the strong secular trends, including sustainability and energy efficiency, urbanization in smarter and safer buildings and infrastructure. We are uniquely positioned to serve these trends with a holistic approach that leverages the most comprehensive product portfolio in the industry, combined with the largest installed base and broadest direct channel footprint to enable extensive go-to-market advantages. Our vision for this merger five years ago was to ultimately lead the evolution from managing traditional building systems and becoming an outcome-based solutions provider, supporting more intelligent, connected spaces and places. Given the improvement in our growth and operational fundamentals over the last few years, we are very well positioned to accelerate and leverage our unique competitive advantages. As I mentioned earlier, we have developed three growth priorities, all designed and calibrated around gaining share, scaling OpenBlue, accelerating new product introductions and driving higher service attachment rates and sales growth. At the same time, in some respects enabled by these growth priorities, we will remain focused on driving improved margin performance, attacking the cost structure with the same intensity we have over the last four years. With the steps we've taken to strengthen the balance sheet over the last two years and the improvements we've made to our liquidity position and cash generation capabilities, we are now in a better position to pursue a more balanced but disciplined capital allocation plan. Please turn to Slide 14. The launch of OpenBlue represents the next stage in our journey. Although it is still very early, we have achieved significant success in creating momentum with customers and partners. OpenBlue is immediately compelling to a wide variety of customers looking to connect plan and manage space for enhanced security, sustainability and experiences. This platform addresses a series of solutions for a variety of environments. Worldwide, we saw engagement with a range of customers from one of the largest and most respected real estate developers in Asia to multiple sports venues across the world and everything in between. For example, let's look at universities. We began OpenBlue engagements at Stanford, Brown, Tulane, Kent State, University of Arkansas and others. Our work with the National University of Singapore demonstrates our deep collaboration with Microsoft, creating a living laboratory for a new breed of customizable, contact-free applications built on Johnson Controls' unifying digital technology suite, OpenBlue. From a technology perspective, I mentioned our collaboration with Microsoft. We've also begun new work with a portfolio of technology companies including Accenture, Cisco and Intel. OpenBlue is also fueling some of the most ambitious projects in the world such as BEA and the next World Cup. Over the last several months, we have had numerous releases under OpenBlue. For example, in August, we launched our comprehensive suite of digital solutions under the OpenBlue Healthy Buildings label, bringing together intelligent, connected hardware, software-based analytics in dashboards as well as mobile applications aimed at accelerating building occupancy by instilling confidence and assisting in the management of COVID-19 risk. We remain focused on creating the world's best technologies and proud that we received over 600 patents, and we earned the highly coveted ISA, Secured Development Life Cycle Assurance Certification, the highest standard in product security. Let's turn now to Slide 15. As we have mentioned to many of you over the last few months, one of the biggest benefits of OpenBlue will be our ability to tailor our service offerings to individual customers based on their unique needs. This platform enhances lead generation; improves attachment rates; increases average revenue per user; and over time, should sustainably accelerate our service growth rate by 2 to 3 percentage points with a very attractive margin profile. In late September, we launched a new flexible tiered service offering powered by OpenBlue, which increases our capabilities around real-time remote service and monitoring as well as predictive analytics. Lastly, turning to Slide 16. Demand for indoor air quality and healthy building solutions remain a key focus area. And we have seen significant uptick in interest from our customers since the beginning of the pandemic. For example, year-to-date sales of our YORK MERV 13 filters are up over 400% year-over-year. Our second half residential indoor air quality products were up 84% year-over-year. And in most cases, the revenue dollars for any one of these products individually are smaller, but in aggregate, have been enough to partially offset some of the weakness we are seeing. In addition to some of our core offerings that have always served these markets, we have also rapidly innovated or redeveloped several new products for customized applications. I won't spend time on each one listed on this page, but this collection represents why we believe we are uniquely positioned to fulfill the different customer needs regarding healthy buildings. This focus on targeted innovation is one facet of our goal to accelerating new product introductions. Over the next three years, we expect to gain nice share and plan to launch over 150 new products in fiscal '21 alone. With that, I would now like to turn things over to Olivier to provide you with his initial impressions and our thoughts on fiscal '21. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you on the call today, and I'm thrilled to be part of the Johnson Controls team. I've been in the office for about 10 weeks now and have fully immersed myself in learning the business and with the help of Brian and the finance team, understanding the strength and opportunities we have in front of us as an organization. I cannot thank Brian enough for his guidance and alliance through this transition. I thought I might quickly share with you my initial impressions and perspective, before I get into our forward outlook. I've been asked by some of you, why I was drawn to this role at Johnson Controls? And I would tell you, there were a number of reasons. From a personnel standpoint, how we do things is incredibly important to me. I wanted to be part of an organization with culture, diversity and inclusion matters. We are focused on the environment matters where developing people and meritocracy matters. I'm impressed by what the team has achieved over the last two years, its strategic vision and the operational discipline that has been established. I also recognize there is still work to be done, particularly around optimizing the cost structure of our business model. I am very positive about the growth opportunities of the end markets we serve, smart, safe, healthy buildings and by our vision around services, digital and product innovation. Finally, I'm excited about the ability we have to drive above-market growth with best-in-class margins. That seems like a natural point to transition to our outlook, starting on Slide 17. I mentioned my optimism about our served markets, and I think this depiction of our business mix shows a very balanced revenue profile, roughly split one-third each for products, install and service. We have one of the largest installed bases of buildings globally with an unmatched direct channel footprint, both of which we can leverage to generate very attractive service opportunities. As George mentioned, service, powered by OpenBlue, is expected to be an attractive vector of profitable growth for the Company. Looking at our installation portfolio, we are roughly evenly split between new construction and renovation retrofit, although many parts of this business remain challenged by the effects of the ongoing pandemic, our portfolio of LC building solutions and retrofit activity can moderate the weakness in new build. Product revenue at 35% represents those products sold through our indirect channels and will not include products and equipment installed through our direct channel. This is our short-cycle business that is typically booked and shipped. Turning to Slide 18. This slide provides our end-market exposure as well as a few economic indicators on the fiscal year basis we utilize as an input to our planning process. Construction outlook is a barometer for the new construction portion of our installation business in North America, which is about 15% of our total sales. GDP tends to be the barometer for service market growth. As the market forecast indicate, the global macro environment remains uncertain. However, given the attractiveness of our portfolio and the elements of our go-forward growth strategy George discussed, we feel very confident that we are positioned to outgrow our end markets. Now let's turn to Slide 19 with our views of fiscal '21 and our Q1 guidance. Current forecast for market recovery suggests a stronger second half of the year. We will continue to manage costs over the course of the year, keeping tight controls on the amount and timing of temporary cost reversals as volumes continue to normalize. We also have the carryover benefits from the permanent cost actions we took in the back half, which will partially offset the return of temporary cost. This, along with our focus on higher-margin revenue growth, is expected to result in ongoing EBIT margin expansion. Regardless of the presidential election outcome, we are very confident in our ability to maintain a 13.5% tax rate in fiscal '21. Free cash flow on a reported basis will approximate 95% for the full year and should follow a fairly normal cadence, with the majority of our cash being generated in the back half, in line with our traditional cash flow seasonality. With the majority of the large cash adjustments now being behind us, we are transitioning to an unadjusted cash flow metric. As part of our disciplined capital allocation, we expect to deploy the remaining $1 billion of proceeds from the Power Solutions sale to share repurchases. Now for our Q1 guidance, we expect to start the year off with organic sales decline in the range of 5% to 7%. The continued focus on the cost side will allow us to expand our EBIT margin 20 to 40 basis points and EPS should be in the range of $0.39 to $0.41. Overall, continued strong performance in a challenging environment. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you so much.  Our first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Deane Dray : Just to start off on the forward look and guidance, and we suspect that a lot of companies are still going to keep the annual guidance suspended, but you've given us enough data points in the forward look on free cash flow and the conversion to back into an EPS number. Just want to make sure our math is right, we're getting a $2.45 to $2.50 range. I just want to make -- and that looks like a bracket's consensus. I just want to make sure that math is right. And is it just the point of still heightened uncertainty that's keeping you from framing that guidance officially? Olivier Leonetti : So let me give you a bit of colors before to answer specifically to your question. We have, as you sense from the call, very confident about the position of the Company, and we believe we're going to be able to navigate this uncertain environment as we did last year. Now as you alluded to, at this point in time, there was a lot of uncertainty regarding what is happening in the pandemic. We have had, particularly over the last few weeks, additional lockdown and restrictions in Europe, and we have a second wave in U.S. So in this context, we believe we have a solid plan. We have momentum building, and we'll be agile. As you said, we have stress-tested our plan and we believe that despite the uncertain environment, we're going to be able to deliver a very good EBIT margin expansion and a strong cash flow performance. Now let me answer to your question specifically. Based upon the current market trajectory and all of that is still a bit known where that would go, we were looking at organic revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits range. Our sales force today is targeting growth part of the market, focusing on indoor quality and LC buildings and in verticals such as data centers, warehouse and institutions. And as George indicated, we're investing heavily in new product launches. Now if you look at your EPS range today, we believe it's not an unrealistic expectation. Deane Dray : Great. That's real helpful. And then on the -- I really appreciate all the new color on OpenBlue. A number of your HVAC peers have started giving at least some framework on what the indoor air quality funnel might look like. I was hoping you could quantify for us. You gave a data point on the filtration orders being up. But can you give us a sense of what the funnel looks like? We're seeing a bit of the retrofit North America business starting to come through, but I would hope you could frame for us that opportunity as it stands today. George Oliver : Deane, let me just kind of frame up what we're doing on indoor quality, how important it is, and then I'll kind of frame up what we see here within the pipeline. So I would start by saying it's clear that this is front and center with all of our customer engagement. So the education that has been had around air quality and the impact that, that has in mitigating the impact of the virus, that's certainly front and center. Now there's many critical elements to delivering clean air. It includes ventilation, filtration, disinfection and then isolation. And it's also combined with sensors around temperature, humidity, occupancy and ultimately ties to billing controls. And so our clean air strategy has been focused on finding the right balance between air quality as well as energy efficiency. And it's based on science, backed recommendations on clean air delivery rate which is ultimately clean air changes per hour. We're performing a number of assessments at starting points to align our solutions and services to each customer application and ultimately, their clean air delivery rate target. And we're not simply making product recommendations. And there's really no one better position now to be able to help our customers operate healthy safe buildings. It really is built on the combination of our HVAC portfolio with our security and building software platforms that do uniquely enable us to provide more powerful solutions based on specific customer outcomes. Now in addition to that, Deane, we've got over 16,000 service experts around the globe, which is the size and strength of our direct channel footprint, which we believe creates a significant competitive advantage. And so as we look at this today, with all of this activity right from assessments to deploying capabilities, we're looking at a pipeline of a couple of hundred million dollars for 2021. And now longer term, I think the focus on clean air and striking the right balance between proper ventilation, filtration, disinfection and then energy efficiency will ultimately lead to increased service activity, system replacements and other emerging solutions. So as we look out over a few years, we think clean air, the market itself is multibillions of dollars in incremental market. And then with that, not only with our strong position, but we've been expanding our partnerships to be able to accelerate our penetration in our go-to-market. And that's with universities, that's partnering with technology companies that have additional capabilities that we can combine with ours that ultimately drive the highest disinfection solution. And then that combined with our attractive channel, we believe that we have a unique channel where we can get partners and ultimately bring the best solution to the market. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open, sir. Jeff Sprague : Best of luck, Brian. Two for me. First, George, and this maybe picks up a little bit on what you were talking about. But you were kind of talking about OpenBlue adding one to two points to your sales growth. And now you're saying two to three. Your confidence level is clear in your voice this morning, but interesting that you're already thinking a higher number before we're too far into this. So I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on your thinking around that incremental growth rate and how the customer conversations are going. George Oliver : Yes. Let me start, Jeff, by talking about the strength of our OpenBlue platform. And so for everyone on the call, it is a complete suite of connected solution that enables the delivery of more impactful sustainability, new occupant experiences and enhance safety and security that does combine with our long-standing expertise and buildings with cutting-edge technology. And it does enable us, along with our customers and partners, to fundamentally transform how spaces and places are experienced and that are ultimately safe and protected. So what it does is it combines everything that we do in a building and through leveraging connectivity and data, allows us to be able to create new outcomes. And we truly do believe that this differentiates what we do through our direct channel footprint with the significant installed base of equipment and service that we have today that we can actually amplify this now with digital solutions. So let me talk a little bit about the progress we've made. In the last 90 days, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've had significant engagement, customer engagement right from the start. And we've kept the momentum going with the release of several new solutions, including OpenBlue Workplace, new tiered flexible service offerings under OpenBlue, OpenBlue Enterprise. And there's many, many more coming over the next several months, including five that are planned in the first quarter. Now let me move to customers. When you look at the customer wins, we're very excited. I mean, the one example I talked about was one of the largest real estate developers in Asia, who is the leader in facility management. They ultimately selected our OpenBlue enterprise manager solution, which is a software solution that helps customers manage large portfolios of properties. They've now deployed that across 42 of their buildings in Singapore. So we're embedding OpenBlue in everything we do and the enhancements we're making to our go-to-market strategy. We have already built -- when you look at the pipeline that now OpenBlue is connected to. So our multiyear pipeline is well over $1 billion of opportunity when you take what OpenBlue does not only as a stand-alone, but how that combines with our core capabilities in how we go to market. And then like I said, we've supported that with partnerships with Microsoft, Accenture, Cisco and Intel. And when you look at these partnerships, they're integral, I would say, on many levels to ultimately deliver a complete outcome-based solution that our customers are asking for. And we believe that we have a lot to offer as a partner. Jeff Sprague : Just on the cost headwinds and tailwinds, you gave a very explicit table and chart on the Q3 call. I'm wondering if all those numbers are basically the same, the $240 million to $260 million tail on permanent and kind of what you gave us on the temporary. And I guess whether the answer is yes or no, can you give us a little bit of color on how these kind of feather in and out over the course of this year? Olivier Leonetti : So Jeff, before answer to the specific of your questions, we have said that in the past, but we want to repeat it because it's very important. We believe we have the opportunity to improve the return on sales of our business going forward. And we believe we have opportunities in both growth margin and OpEx management. And if you look at the prepared remarks from Brian, improving the margin rate by about one full point year-on-year last year despite the environment was remarkable. So that says a lot about the execution discipline of the Company. And we believe we have said that, and we have done some modeling lately. We believe that the 30% incremental is an achievable and required goal for the Company. Now to answer specifically to your question, the net $40 million that Brian mentioned before is still valid. We would expect those costs to come back mainly in the second half of the year. So we believe that it's the best way to plan for those costs. However, we're still looking at levers to mitigate those costs to come back in the second half, but it's too early for us to commit, Jeff, at this stage. Operator : Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Nigel Coe : Just wanted to come on the back of Jeff's question there. So the -- obviously, the temporary costs coming in towards the back end of the year. The structural costs, is that more linear through the year? Or are we seeing some of those coming through in the 1Q guide? Olivier Leonetti : So at the moment, for the first half of the year, we have a net benefit to the P&L when you look, Nigel, at the permanent and temporary cost coming back. And the headwind will come in the second half and more in the Q3 fiscal quarter, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Great. And then obviously, the service kind of acceleration is really encouraging and also $1 billion pipeline. Is that $1 billion, that funnel, has that been built since you sort of soft launched OpenBlue? I think it was mid-2000. I can't exactly remember the date, but I think in the last seven months, has that all been built in that time frame? And do you have any indication on sort of the time line to the service revenue acceleration? George Oliver : Yes. Let me go back, Nigel, to the pipeline. That pipeline is when we do, as we're doing installs and now taking our digital capabilities with OpenBlue and combining that with our core capabilities and ultimately then deploying that as a solution. So that isn't just service, that is ultimately creating a much bigger installed base with our digital capabilities that will then spin-off services from that. And so that's when what I talked about there with the digital blue pipeline. As far as the services, what we get with OpenBlue, it allows us to be able to not only differentiate the core of what we do with our services, making everything connected, utilizing data to optimize our delivery of service and then adding new services on top of that. And that's what OpenBlue allows us to do. It enhances our ability to be able to immediately attach service contracts. And we're starting to see a nice pickup in our contractual services, and that will continue to improve as we go forward. And then from a revenue per customer standpoint, it ultimately allows us to now build, on top of that base of service, new capabilities and be able to deliver enhanced value, which ultimately then we get paid for. And so it's really a combination of not only expanding our installed base with OpenBlue, but then being able to mine that installed base with additional services on a recurring basis. Nigel Coe : Just to clarify, the funnel though has been built this year, correct? George Oliver : Yes. The funnel, I mean, when we look at our pipeline, what we've done, Nigel, is take everything that we do with how we go to market. OpenBlue now becomes part of what we offer and how we differentiate not only the solutions that we go to market with and install, but also the capabilities that we deploy to be able to attach service and then perform the service over the life cycle of that installation. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir. Steve Tusa : Just curious, how much does the one of the big differentiators versus you guys in your HVAC equipment peers, at least, is your control system, the kind of Metasys platform. Maybe that brand has changed. But how much of a differentiator is having that controls legacy, if you will, the building controls legacy over and above the kind of HVAC and Fire & Security? George Oliver : Yes, Steve, let me just start by talking about commercial HVAC and the importance of not only the equipment but also the digital capabilities. When we look at these markets, they're very attractive with long-term secular drivers that ultimately align with our core capabilities in both equipment as well as digital and the secular trends of energy efficiency and sustainability, enabling us to be able to now mine a much larger installed base with the connectivity with our digital offerings. And then the ability now, as we discussed previously with Nigel, which opens up an opportunity for us to be able to build on additional services; and then ultimately, capitalizing on the emerging trend with indoor air quality and healthy buildings. So all of these trends, the ability to be able to take a holistic solution with our equipment plus our digital platforms, which, from a building system standpoint, it is Metasys and then being able to connect every other device and every other system within a building, is what uniquely positions us to be able to bring the most -- the best solution, the most efficient solution and ultimately delivering on the customers' priorities. And when I look at what we do, we're very well positioned with that combination of not only leadership products that we've been reinvesting in, but also now industry-leading controls, embedded software with also our digital offerings and building automation software that all complement the core. So although we push intelligence to the edge, the ability to be able to take that intelligence within one platform and to be able to create new outcomes is a competitive advantage. And we're going to continue to not only differentiate what we install, but also how we go about capitalizing on the service opportunity, which is what contributes to being able to accelerate our service growth on a go-forward basis. Steve Tusa : Right. So said differently, the control system is key. And then just one -- maybe correct me, if I'm wrong, just one other nitpicky one, you guys bought in a JV, I think, at least on the cash flow statement, it suggests you guys had some activities there. Was there -- were there any P&L -- was there any P&L impact from that? Sometimes companies that we cover buy in JVs and they book a gain on their ownership. And any impact on the P&L from that front? Brian Stief : Steve that was related to the buyout of Qolsys, we had a majority interest in Qualsys already. And we bought out, during the quarter, the remaining 42% of those shares. So the activity that you're referring to was an entity that we historically have consolidated. So there was no unique P&L in Q4 related to that. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open, sir. Gautam Khanna : I had a couple of questions, George, maybe if you could elaborate on the IAQ opportunity. Carrier had talked about it at like $9 billion to $10 billion in aggregate. I wondered if you would agree with that assessment. Secondly, maybe if you can talk about whether you think IAQ sort of becomes a table stakes for some of these commercial building operators, because it seems like there is a conflict between energy draw going up when you utilize some of these solutions and what has been the compelling case to renew applied systems, which is the energy consumption drops with the new technology. Just how you kind of frame that. Do you think it's table stakes? Do you think it's kind of a short-term blip while we have COVID and then maybe you revert back or just your opinion on that topic? George Oliver : Yes. So when we talk about indoor air quality as part of as the market, and so you've seen numbers from Navigant where there's like 1.7 trillion of square footage and about a quarter of that is ultimately non-resi space. And then within that, today's level of air purification is well below what would be now in this environment, perceived as being acceptable. And so, as I talked about, there is a key element of being able to provide the right solution. It does include multiple domains or multiple capabilities, whether it be maintaining or maximizing the ventilation, bringing the highest level of filtration. So it might be today, MERV 8 and moving towards MERV 13. It includes deploying potential disinfection technologies, and then like in health care, it's isolation. And so what we do is be able to not only provide the best solution that ultimately delivers what we call the clean air delivery rate, which is clean air changes per hour with a level of purification, but also making sure that we're doing that and optimizing the energy required to ultimately perform and deliver on that outcome. And so, we are working feverishly here, not only in how we deploy these multiple capabilities, but how we optimize those with our building controls and ultimately bring in the best solution at the least amount of energy required. We believe that there's optimization that can be had, where you can get to a much higher standard while you're still delivering on the sustainability goals of our customers. And that's what we're ultimately focused on doing with the technology elements that we have underway. Operator : Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, ma'am. Nicole DeBlase : I just wanted to focus a little bit on the first quarter guidance. It looks like you guys are kind of projecting organic revenue decline similar to what you saw in 4Q. Just curious, if that reflects kind of stabilization in organic trends throughout the quarter or if you did see improvement into the later parts of the quarter and into October? Olivier Leonetti : So Nicole, we are seeing today, you're right, a gradual improvement in our business environment, both for our field business and our global product segment. So, if you look at our order book, and I'm not talking about revenue for now, we'll give you the specificities in a second. And order book is more representative of the current velocity of the business, we see Q1 as being an improvement over Q4. So if you look at our field business specifically, we saw -- we are seeing in Q1 orders velocity for our field business being sequentially better by one or two points relative to Q4. And what you see is you have our in-store business, which is book now, but the orders were recorded about two quarters ago, give or take. So you see this in-store business because of this lag in the quarter, being still down. And you see, as George mentioned, an acceleration of our service business, which is largely offsetting what is happening in installed. So that's for our field business. If you look at our Global Products, again, we see today that we are gaining shares in the product we sell. And we're experiencing because of our product portfolio, the impact of the delay in commercial HVAC and Fire & Security businesses. And as we move into Q1, we see today a slightly larger revenue decline relative to Q4. And what is happening, and you saw that in our opening remarks, Nicole, Q4 was very strong, and largely -- not largely, but in part due to the demand we satisfied in Q4 due to the depressed Q3 we had. So, if you look at this 2-year stack, Q1 financial year '21 will be similar to Q4. So overall, an environment from a revenue standpoint, which is comparable to Q4, and we believe it's a prudent approach, despite an improvement in the level of order velocity. But as you saw in our guide, we believe we're going to be able, nevertheless, to protect the bottom line due to our cautious cost mitigation activities. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. That's really helpful and then maybe just a follow-up also on first quarter. When we think about the 20 to 40 bps of expected margin improvement, can you just talk about any divergences between the segments? I know global products faced some unique challenges this quarter. Does that continue into the first quarter? And anything on the field businesses that we should make sure we think about? Olivier Leonetti : We believe that without going into too much details, we will still some negative impact on our Global Products business for two reasons : one, exception of fixed costs and to product mix and our field business is keeping its momentum from a margin improvement standpoint. Operator : Our last question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Mr. Davis, your line is open. Scott Davis : A couple of questions. But first, just is -- George, is M&A still on the table as a possibility in 2021? George Oliver : Yes. I mean, absolutely, we're going to be very disciplined. But certainly, as we look at our capabilities and as we look to enhance some of our positions in technology and as we build out open blue, there's certainly going to be opportunities that we're going to pursue and have been pursuing. We've done some in the past year. We've done some bolt-ons. We completed the acquisition of Qolsys, which has helped us from an interactive standpoint technology capability that we're now leveraging more broadly. So yes, that's going to be -- as we think about growth, it's part of our capital deployment. Scott Davis : Okay. And then on OpenBlue, George, and I know there's been a ton of questions, but just to clarify. When you do an install, I imagine there's a fair amount of upfront customization. And do you charge for that? Or is that part of kind of the SaaS pricing you expect over time to have perhaps a breakeven period and then a more profitable period after that? Is that a way to think about it? George Oliver : Yes. So Scott, when you think about our installed business today, it is an applied business where we apply engineering. We configure solutions. We deploy those solutions with install. And then ultimately, we look to attach and get the life cycle service. And so today, in many ways, we do incur a lot of engineering upfront before we ultimately get a contract, and then we take the contract and pursue -- continue to pursue that. What OpenBlue does for us, it really changes the level of engagement with our customers, where now with OpenBlue, we can significantly change the outcomes that we can produce with the installations or solutions that we propose And then with that, that is incremental to what we historically would have done and certainly get paid for that upfront with the ability now to be able to attach recurring revenue onto that service on a go-forward basis. And so that's why when I say when we look at our pipeline of projects and we begin to deploy OpenBlue with those projects, it truly does differentiate how we can go-to-market and ultimately create outcomes that historically we haven't been able to achieve. Operator : Thank you for your question. I will now turn the conference back over to George for some closing remarks. George Oliver : Yes. Just to wrap up here, I want to thank everyone again for joining us this morning. I'm incredibly proud of how our teams responded in the time of the global pandemic and the progress that we've made as an organization, and I'm extremely pleased with our continued strong performance and very excited about the future opportunities, which we discussed today. I hope that you and your families remain safe, and I look forward to speaking with many of you soon. So operator, that concludes our call. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls\u2019 First Quarter of Fiscal 2021 Results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentations can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Hopefully the New Year is treating you well so far. I will start with a brief strategic update in summary of our Q1 results. Olivier will provide a more detailed review of those results and update you on our forward outlook and we\u2019ll have plenty of time to take your questions. Let\u2019s get started on Slide 3. We are off to a strong start in the first quarter with solid financial performance and accelerating momentum on all of our strategic initiatives. As we will cover in a few minutes, top-line performance was at the high end of the expectations we communicated to you last quarter, which together with impressive operational execution across all segments enabled us to grow EBIT by 5% year-on-year, despite continued volume pressure related to the ongoing pandemic. Although the promise of a vaccine is sparking modest optimism in several of our end markets, many of which continued to show improving sequential demand, there is still many regions of the world facing second and third waves with varying degrees of lockdowns and restrictions. With that being the case, we have remained focused on the commitments we made to our employees, customers and suppliers. Our teams have come together to achieve truly extraordinary things, improving the fundamentals of our businesses and executing our overall strategy. During the quarter, we were honored to receive recognition from several organizations. Additionally, as you may have seen in a separate press release issued earlier this morning, we announced an ambitious set of new ESG commitments, reinforcing sustainability as a top priority in our leadership role in climate change. Lastly, we continued to gain traction on several of our core growth initiatives, which we have been discussing with you over the last couple of quarters, scaling OpenBlue, driving higher service attachment rates in sales growth and accelerating new product introductions. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. Continuing on Slide 9. Q1 sales declined 5% organically, improving sequentially compared to the 6% decline last quarter. Relative to our expectations global products outperformed primarily the result of continued high levels of demand for residential HVAC equipment, both here in North America as well as our Hitachi business in Asia Pacific including China. Segment EBITA expended 80 basis points year-over-year to 12%, the highest margin rate in any first half since the merger, despite volume headwinds related to the pandemic. EPS of $0.43 increased 8% benefiting from the higher profitability I just discussed as well as lower share count as we have maintained a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our free cash flow performance in the quarter was strong, up about 10% on a reported basis to over $400 million. I will provide the details on our cash performance later in the call, but the strong start in Q1 puts us on a path to achieve 100% conversion for the full year. Please turn to Slide 10. Orders of our field businesses continue to improve with the year-over-year decline moderating to just 3% despite our install business still experiencing pressure from slower non-resi new bill activity with retrofit activity showing signs of recovery. Service orders increased 2% overall driven by EMEALA and supported by the recovery of our core commercial fire and security businesses in Europe. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So first of all, thanks for all the additional details on the slides, been very helpful. So looking at the margin guide for the full year, the implied back half is obviously much flatter. I realize we've got temporary costs come back into the equation here. But is there anything else that we should think about in terms of mix, raw materials? Anything else that would kind of cause that margin to flatten out in the second half? George Oliver : So, Nigel, good morning. Indeed, we are \u2013 the guide implies that the margin rate for the second half is going to be marginally up. We discussed that in prior calls. In the second half of the year, some of the costs we mitigated last year are going to come back. The net for the year we discussed is about $40 million, but the second half is going to be a headwind. As I indicated last quarter, we're working on mitigating those costs coming back. We have plans in place. It's too early for us to commit to an improvement in margin in the second half, and we'll come back when those plans are a bit more structured, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Great, now that's clear. And then the attachment rate initiatives, 35% of service attachment rates, looking to increase that by a few hundred basis points for the year. I'm just curious how you're looking to achieve that. What sort of incentives do you have in place to either sales or technicians? And what role is obtain in that? So any help there would be helpful. George Oliver : So, Nigel, when you look at our $6 billion Service business, of course, as we've laid out, it's a very attractive vector for growth, and that has been accelerated with the healthy buildings trends. So when you look at historically, we've been under-serving our installed base. And so we've been going back after that, and we believe that, that's a real material opportunity and a competitive advantage for us. We have been increasing our market coverage with people as well as enhancing the technology that we're deploying within our solutions with OpenBlue. When you look at the margin profile, it's 2x the overall company EBITDA margin. And as we now look at our new capabilities, differentiating our services with connectivity and utilization of data that really gives us an opportunity to be able to get longer term contracts, being able to solve bigger problems, be able to attach contracts and ultimately drive that attachment rate. We've seen great progress here in Q1. We're up about 90 basis points sequentially in Q1. We expect for the whole year that our attach rate will move up 300 or 400 basis points and we will actually accelerate as we enter 2022. And so it's a combination of all of that, that truly positions us to be able to take what we've done historically and truly now move the needle with how we can attach a lot more to what we do to serve that installed base. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks, George. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Coe. Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open sir. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hi. I really like seeing the slide right upfront profiling the opportunity in Healthy Buildings, this whole indoor air quality theme that we think is really meaningful post COVID. And George, I was hoping you can give us a little bit more of granularity in how you arrived at that $10 billion to $15 billion. Maybe a sense of how much is equipment, services, digital. And how much of this benefit are you seeing today? George Oliver : Yes, so, when you look at what we launched here, Deane, the OpenBlue Healthy Buildings, it does represent our new comprehensive strategy to be able to address both the clean air, which we said was a few billion dollars previously, and then all of what else we do within a building around Healthy Buildings. And holistically, it's about $10 million or $15 million of new addressable market when you look at it holistically. Now when you look at across industries, more than half of businesses not only have implemented some type of Healthy Building initiative, OpenBlue Healthy Building now addresses this next phase, where not only are we driving efficiency, but we're driving health and safety and we're positioned to be able to then drive sustainability and reduce energy to be able to achieve those outcomes. When you look at what we do, it combines all of our core, it tailors what we do to each individual customer. And now we have about 25 unique solutions or services that, to your point, it takes our products, it takes our service technology, it now takes our data services that we're developing, truly now to be able to create these new outcomes. So it's aimed not only at helping customers return to work, but also optimizing their performance of their infrastructure longer term, not only through efficiency and energy reduction, all of which contributes to their sustainability goals. So it's really a combination of all of that that allows us to really differentiate what we can do to deliver these type of solutions. Deane Dray : Great. And just as a follow-up there. If you had to split the opportunity between, let's say, a onetime windfall of new equipment, higher filtration and so forth versus an ongoing service opportunity, the monitoring, the digital side of this, what's the split? How much is pure equipment upgrade versus the ongoing recurring connected building opportunity? George Oliver : Well, to give you an idea, and this will be within our global products, we've seen huge increases with filtration. Orders up strong 20%, 30%. We've got our ISO clean, our potable air purification units. We see growth of well over 100% year-on-year. We're seeing our pleated filters up 500%. We're seeing filtration products up kind of 50%. So we are seeing benefit in the products that ultimately go into our solutions in what we can do to look at every aspect, filtration, disinfection, the recirculation as well as isolation that ultimately we provide with our solutions. And so it really \u2013 it's a combination of all of that, Deane. And then as we're now upgrading these systems, the more connectivity that we can gain with how we utilize our \u2013 when we use our Medicines platform to collect data and then being able to optimize the outcome that we can produce is the advantage that we have with the 16,000 people that we have deployed across the globe that are intimately working with customers in delivering these solutions. Deane Dray : That\u2019s great. And just congratulations on all of your ESG commitments. That really does put you guys best in class here. Thank you. George Oliver : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Dray. Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open sir. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning everybody. George Oliver : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : George, is there a preference between M&A and buybacks in 2021? Or any kind of opening of M&A markets that get you more interested? George Oliver : Yes, so we \u2013 as we've been improving our fundamentals here, Scott, and getting a lot of confidence here with the continued improvement that we're going to deliver on, that we think that M&A is a space that, as we're building our pipeline, that is attractive in being able to take what we're doing with our organic investments and be able to contribute more in how we ultimately deliver growth. So as we look at our priorities for the year, we are not only supporting strong dividend, but also optimistically doing the buybacks. And we committed the $1 billion that's still remaining from the Power Solutions sale. But on a go-forward basis, see M&A as being an area that we can contribute 1% or 2% growth on a go-forward basis on an annual basis because of the pipeline that we see, the ability to be able to enhance our technologies, our go-to market, our services, and then accelerate the work we're doing with OpenBlue. Scott Davis : Make sense. And then just switching gears to service. You've, on Slide 17, referenced a mid-single-digit growth rate and attachments of 35%. What \u2013 I mean, you say the entitlement is double the current rate, but what can get you there? I mean, we're not there yet. So, what needs to happen either within the sales force or within perhaps customer education or something else that kind of gets you driving to a higher growth rate in Service? George Oliver : So, if you look before the pandemic, Scott, we had got our growth rate to 4%, 5% and it was pretty much at the market rate and that was a lot of blocking and tackling. Now strategically, we've been investing in new services. We've been enhancing those services with OpenBlue. We've been targeting our installed base in a much more aggressive manner, because we have an opportunity to be able to bring that forward with new technologies and to be able to address some of the new challenges that our customers are facing. So when you put all of that together and you look at our performance here, in Q1, we've been sequentially improving. We're only down, when you look at our \u2013 service was down 1%, it was down 3% in Q4. We're projecting here on a go-forward \u2013 and our orders were actually up 2% in the quarter. On a go-forward basis, we see our orders continuing to improve. We're getting a higher mix of longer-term contracts within those orders. And that we believe that from a revenue standpoint, we turned positive here in Q2 and it will continue to ramp Q3 and Q4. So, it's really a combination of not only mining the installed base, adding additional capabilities within the field and being able to do that, be able to enhance the offerings, be able to get it connected, utilizing data, creating new outcomes and then ultimately being positioned here to attach. Our attach rate in the first quarter was up 90 basis points sequentially and we see that improving 400 or 500 basis points over the year and then accelerating beyond that. So, that gives us confidence here Scott that through the year, we'll get to mid-single digit growth in 2021, and that we believe that we can accelerate from there with very attractive margins going forward. Scott Davis : Sounds encouraging. Good luck, George. Thanks, guys. George Oliver : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Davis. Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir. Steve Tusa : Hi, guys. Good morning. George Oliver : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just fill us in on kind of what you're seeing in your core, like the commercial HVAC equipment market in the U.S.? Just kind of hard to tell like what the real trend is? I mean, non-res construction, obviously remains kind of weak, but you've got all these opportunities on ESG and IAQ et cetera. But just curious as to how this cycle is shaping up versus prior may be on that front, equipment? George Oliver : Sure. So, when you look at our commercial HVAC market, let me start with applied. So, applied HVAC orders were down low-single digits, this is globally, now about 3%. We did see continued sequential improvement in the market through the quarter. We did see some pressure in North America, where it's purely due to timing of orders as well as some federal business, they got pressured and again timing. And then Asia-Pac continues to accelerate. China was up over 20%. When you look at the sales now following the orders the sales were down low to mid-single-digits globally about 4%. We did see sequential improvement in North America as well as APAC. APAC actually came back to being flat, and a lot of that's being driven by our service growth and the traction we're getting there. The North America install is better and we're seeing the \u2013 as Olivier said, we're seeing more retrofit quarter-on-quarter. And then when you look at unitary markets, they generally remain under pressure. They were down low-single digits in Q1. The mix of that is light commercial, smaller tonnage units was down slightly in the quarter. Larger tonnage units are actually weaker because of larger projects being delayed or deferred. We continue to gain share as a result of the investment that we've made in both new products as well as channel. So, when you look at the whole space, we're still pretty bullish that these are very attractive end markets with long-term secular trends that align very well with our core. And a lot of focus now on energy and sustainability, which is going to drive \u2013 I think is going to drive the industry. And we've been leading with the investments we've made in our YZ chillers and the increased tonnage that we're launching there, our rooftops, our premier choice in select rooftops. And ultimately, now we're investing more heavily in next-gen air cool technologies, electrification with heat pumps and heat transfer units and advanced VRF technology. So, when you think of the space, there is some changes happening in this space, but we're invested to really capitalize on that going forward. And now with our larger installed base and now with the connectivity with our digital offering does give us an opportunity to really leverage that and build the service business that we've been building. And so, I think the trends are sequentially positive, some pressure on the larger non-residential construction that we see being pushed to the right a bit, but we are seeing sequential improvement, Steve. Steve Tusa : And just a simple one, do you think the applied markets in the U.S. will be on a calendar basis down in 2021, the biggest ticket stuff in the market? George Oliver : So, when you look at the overall market driven by non-resi construction, the overall market will be slightly down. Steve Tusa : Okay, got it. George Oliver : Now, when you look at our mix, we have been remixing towards the higher growth end markets and we've been focused on obviously with the new demand around healthy buildings and the like we've been doing more shorter cycle projects and putting that into the backlog that we are projecting our North America business will be positive for the year. And now, that's gaining share. That's above the industry metrics that you follow, whether it would be ABI or construction starts. But with the work that we've been doing with remixing our capacity, focusing on high-growth end markets and then with the acceleration that we see with some of these upgrades and retrofits is what's going to drive our business for the year. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Tusa. Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open, sir. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Just two unrelated questions. First on, back on service attachment, I think you're actually probably being conservative saying 35%, right, because you're saying like a full service contract, so \u2013 but I wonder if you could give us a sense of your aggregate service reach? And it does seem like you believe you can score some early points on this. And so, I'm wondering if this is a function of really ramping up the service activity at customers you are engaged with, and you're taking it to kind of a different level or the service attachment is being driven primarily by kind of attachment on new installations? George Oliver : No, it's all of the above, Jeff. So, what we're doing is, as we've really brought our strategy around service to a whole new level here, we brought on new leadership, we've got it structured such that we've got all of the key metrics that we're driving. It starts with understanding the installed base, where we are today with the services that we provide. We have significant opportunity to go back into that installed base and bring that forward. And that includes bringing holistic solutions, being able to get longer-term contracts with how we deploy those solutions, and then ultimately getting a recurring revenue that comes out of that work. And so, it's been both. We're not only getting a higher attach with the new projects that we're engineering and deploying and getting a higher attach rate because of the value proposition that we can bring with our OpenBlue capabilities combined with our service capabilities in the field, but at the same time being able to get additional volume by leveraging the installed base and bringing that forward with some of the newer technologies and capabilities. And that all is supported with what we're doing in the field and being able to expand our technicians and the capabilities and capacity that we have in the field to be able to actually deliver the new solutions that we're providing. And so, as we look at going forward, we believe that not only do you get a higher attach rate, you get higher revenue per customer because of the connectivity and the data and the solutions that are being provided, which ultimately are going to both contribute to our ability to be able to get our growth rate, get that continuing to increase through the course of the year and then setting up 2022 very well. Jeff Sprague : And then second unrelated question, probably for Olivier, but I wonder if we could just dig a little bit further on what you're doing on cash flow? It's really encouraging to see the 100% kind of benchmark here now in the target zone. In particular to me, it seems like there is some huge opportunities in DSOs. I'm sure that's not the only thing we're working on, but can you elaborate on what you are driving to make this cash flow number work here? Olivier Leonetti : Yes, good morning, Jeff. So, we are very pleased with the performance we have had in cash flow in the quarter. By the way, last year was pretty good too. And if you remember Jeff during the prior call, we said that we believe, we are 100 plus free cash flow compression company. The debate was when. And we were concerned this year with some of the tax cash tax benefit we took in 2020 are headwind this year, but despite that we believe we\u2019re going to be at 100% this year. So what is happening? Few things first, the level of profit is strong and we believe, we have the ability to make that stronger. And to your point on working capital, we have a strong discipline happening to your point, DSO has been trending well. We believe we have to opportunities to improve DSO. And we have today at the top of the house weekly reviews to make sure we keep the momentum on cash flow generation. It\u2019s also part of our incentive plan at the level of the enterprise. So, all the lines are aligned today, Jeff, to keep performing on cash, we believe. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Sprague. Our next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi Group. Your line is open, sir. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : George, last quarter, you mentioned you might see a pullback in product related revenue in Q1, given somewhat of a pent up snap back that you saw in Q4, but products actually improved in terms of the revenue decline. So, obviously some of that improvement looks like it was North American residential, but it seems like Fire & Security products continue to improve. So, can you just more color and what you\u2019re seeing in that category in particular moving forward? George Oliver : Yes, let me start by, again I was very pleased with the performance in global products in the quarter with the underlying trends in the overall output we saw. It really is built on the depth and breadth of our product portfolio, which, as we have been reinvesting, is industry leading. We\u2019ve been gaining share. We\u2019ve had various new product introductions related to both the core HVAC and Fire & Security products as well now, products that are enabling the COVID response and healthy building opportunities. Just quickly, HVAC, we\u2019ve had the continued tonnage expansion of the YZ chiller platform. We\u2019ve had the Premier Choice Select rooftops. We\u2019ve had the York Affinity series in residential and as well as additional heat pumps. In controls, we continue to advance our Amedisys 11, with continuous upgrades to enhance the capabilities and the better user interfaces. Security with our Qualys business, we\u2019re now in a leadership position and we\u2019re leader now in providing smart home solutions. Electronic Fire, and that\u2019s been very strong. Electronic Fire has been more around connectivity, notification, enhanced interfaces. And in fire suppression, although we\u2019re pressured over the last year or so in the high hazard business, we have continued to advance our sprinkler heads, and we\u2019re getting good traction there. So overall, the business recovers nicely. There was some pressure in the non-resi space remaining. But when you look at Q1, we definitely saw better than expected performance in. It would really be broken down into rest of world residential, which is our JCH business with better performance and a better recovery there and gaining share. And then we saw a stronger sequential improvement pretty much across each one of our product businesses within the quarter. Olivier Leonetti : And Andy, we mentioned that in our prepared remarks, we are going to accelerate the number of new product launches in the rest of the year. So we have launched already some new exciting products in Q1, but that will accelerate. So we are optimistic about what this business can keep doing for us. George Oliver : And your second question, Andy, was around Fire & Security? Andy Kaplowitz : Yes, in particular. George Oliver : So, in total, I\u2019d start by saying Fire & Security remains very attractive to us. 40% of our revenues are in the space. It\u2019s core to building systems. Very attractive margin profile due to the Service mix. We\u2019ve got an incredible installed base, which creates significant recurring revenue in Service. And then when you look at these attributes, they\u2019re critical to what we\u2019re doing with OpenBlue and being able to really drive a comprehensive solution within the building, deploying technology in our go-to-market. And Security now is coming to the forefront because it takes all of what is done in a building, and it brings it together interactively and then being able to then manage the data that gets collected throughout the building. So that\u2019s been very important. When you look at the performance, we did moderate. The Service moderated in Q1. We\u2019re only down roughly about 1% \u2013 1% or 2%, We saw North America recurring Service revenue turned positive, and a lot of that was our ability to be able to drive long-term contracts in the fire business. EMEALA, the overall Service turned positive, and Asia Pac is slightly down. When you look at where the pressure is right now, it\u2019s an install. And it\u2019s mainly due to project delays and general prioritization of HVAC around indoor air quality that\u2019s driving some of the resource allocation of our customers. But I believe that that\u2019s only a timing issue. These projects will be released, and we\u2019ll be able to be positioned and capitalize on those going forward. And the only other one to note, Andy, is the retail. Retail continues to be under pressure. It\u2019s down about the same that it was down in Q4. So we are \u2013 it\u2019s a great business. It\u2019s a high-value proposition within the business. But given what\u2019s been happening in retail, we\u2019ve been working to reposition ourselves to be critical to the essential retailers at the same time, while we\u2019re helping the less essential of the apparel retailers to expand their omnichannels in addition to their brick and mortar infrastructure. So that\u2019s where we are in Fire & Security, but still a very attractive business for us. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And just a quick clarification on price versus cost. I mean, I assume it\u2019s in your forecast, Olivier, for 2021, but you\u2019ve been able to cover rising inflation in the past. Just any thoughts on price versus costs in 2021. Olivier Leonetti : It\u2019s still positive. It was in the quarter, Andy. And we believe the discipline in the organization is strong and price/cost will remain positive for the back of the year. George Oliver : And to reinforce that, Andy. We\u2019ve put in place, very strategic pricing over the last couple of years. And we\u2019ve demonstrated strong performance, being able to net 100 basis points to the top line every year. Yes, we are seeing the commodity costs increase. But I can tell you, with the work we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s more than enough mitigating actions across \u2013 with the other levers that we\u2019re deploying around BAV, direct material productivity, around supply chain, leveraging our buy. So, we\u2019re very well positioned to be able to have positive price cost and the margin guidance that Olivier provided incorporates the updated price cost headwind that we see. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, guys. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Kaplowitz. Our next one is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open, sir. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. May be just the first question around the installed outlook. So, the orders were down 7% in the quarter. Understood why there is some weakness in Fire & Security and so forth in different regions. But maybe help us understand globally, when you think that figure may return to growth? And also, what we should expect for installed revenues for fiscal 2021? George Oliver : Julian, let me start. When you look at the market indicators coming out of 2020, they were pointing to a weaker new construction. That was ABI and construction starts and the like and when you look at the verticals, certainly mixed. There\u2019s some verticals that still have strong growth and there\u2019s others that are being more challenged. So, when you look at new construction starts, it is still under pressure. We are seeing retrofit activity related to healthy buildings and service beginning to pick up \u2013 pick back up. We do see our installed business growing low single-digits this year in spite of those metrics, because we\u2019ve been reallocating our resources to the higher growth verticals and then being able to now capitalize on the retrofit opportunity that we see both short and long-term. When you look at the verticals, there are certain verticals that are under more pressure than others. When you think about the growth, there is better than 25% of our sales go into institutional markets in both healthcare and education. They\u2019re definitely receiving a lot of attention right now with respect to building health. And then when you look at commercial office, it is more mixed with lower utilization rates near term. But we do believe that there\u2019s going to be a demand, because there is a lot of interest in solutions now for what the new normal will be within these buildings. And so, when you look at the overall impact of COVID, we believe that it has delayed the investment decisions, which is creating some uncertainty and limited visibility beyond the six months. But we believe that what we see with our pipeline, our pipeline is actually been growing. And we see now in North America, for instance, with the access restrictions, continuing to be eased, we\u2019ll see some headwinds here in Europe and LatAm with some of the shutdowns and the like. But as we get into the second half of the year, we believe we start to recover on orders. I mean, orders are actually going to be recovering here in the second quarter. That will continue to improve through the course of the year and set us up well for 2022. We do have a $9 billion backlog and that is up year-on-year. We believe the mix within that backlog is shorter cycle. So, that is helping us book in turn through the course of the year, which is helping us be able to outperform the market within the non-resi market. And then, with service recovered now with PSAs, that is beginning to offset the pressure that we\u2019ve had with some of these site restrictions. So, I believe you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re going to outperform through the course of the year. The market will continue to recover and you\u2019ll start to see positive expansion within the industry metrics in 2022. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the margin outlook across the four segments. So, you got that plus 50 bps figure firm-wide for operating margin for the year. Anything you\u2019d call out on segments that should lead or lag that? And perhaps, in particular, what kind of operating leverage do we expect in Global Products? Olivier Leonetti : So actually, the margin profile of the business is going to be equally up in the year. If you look at the various regions, the various installed services or products, we see margin going up. And we have said before and let me repeat this \u2013 we believe we can increase the margin of the enterprise, EBITDA margin by about 50 basis points to 60 basis points. We have the ability to be at this level this year despite the negative impact obviously of the pandemic. But we feel good today about our ability to keep improving the profitability of this business and we are lining up several activities to deliver on this promise. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. George Oliver : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Mitchell. Our last question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for putting me in. George Oliver : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So, I\u2019m just going to ask one question, and I want to go back to the attachment rates that you were discussing. I guess my question is, when you think about the investments that\u2019s needed in order to expand those attachment rates, maybe talk about what\u2019s your quantification of those investments over the next couple of years? And then specifically around like where you\u2019re actually taking share? Any discussion around like the types of competitors that you expect to start to take some share from as you increase your attachment rates? George Oliver : Yes, so the investments that we\u2019re making is really what\u2019s enabling our ability to be able to get a higher attach rate. It\u2019s not only making sure we have the right capacity deployed across the regions and being able to go after. So, historically going after the installed base that\u2019s out there today that we\u2019ve underserved and then being able to bring those forward by upgrading and getting new technology deployed and getting a recurring revenue contract. But then on new, new solutions and how we now bring our technology investments and embed those into the overall solution and then being able to then tie that to a long-term contract, that enables us to be able to get that attach. That is the underlying strategy. So, the investments that are being made are built into our products within \u2013 at the product stage. They\u2019re built into our digital capabilities were building with OpenBlue. And then it\u2019s ultimately making sure that we\u2019ve got the infrastructure deployed within our regions to be able to successfully deliver that to our customers. And we have all of those elements that have been built into the plan in our reinvestment. And this has been ongoing here for the last 18 to 24 months. And so, we\u2019re starting to see the fruits of our labor with the work that we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re beginning to get the attachment rate on the new projects. We\u2019re beginning to get a pickup in service on the installed base. And all of that is leading to not only the higher attach rate, but higher revenue per customer and ultimately accelerating the overall service growth rate. Olivier Leonetti : Joe, just to make it clear, we will deliver those investments while scaling SG&A as a proportion of revenue. So, we do not believe we need to add OpEx as a proportion of revenue to deliver on this service strategic initiative. Joe Ritchie : Yes \u2013 no, that\u2019s helpful. But \u2013 and then I guess maybe just that second part question about where you\u2019re going to be able to take share; is there any color that you can provide at this point? George Oliver : Well, I\u2019d say, when you look at our \u2013 it\u2019s in line with our installed base. We are strong in each of the verticals. I think you\u2019ve got a breakdown of the key verticals. It\u2019s broad based. The strategy is such that that historically it\u2019s been more of a \u2013 just more of a mechanical service that we provided to maintain break and fix, and some of that was done through long-term contracts. The difference now, Joe, is that with the connectivity, with the use of the data, not only can we improve the value proposition or solve problems that customers haven\u2019t historically been able to solve, but then being able to do that on a longer-term basis with the connectivity and the use of the data. So, it\u2019s really across the board on all of our new product installations, whether it\u2019d be healthcare, education or industrial or government, any one of the spaces. I think we are uniquely positioned with our business model, with our performance contracting and some of the business model that historically we\u2019ve had that has successfully delivered an outcome. We are now embedding our service technologies and capabilities, so that we then with that installed base, we can generate a lot more service with the use of the data that we collect and ultimately deploy. Joe Ritchie : That makes sense, George. Thank you, both. George Oliver : Thanks, Joe. And I think we\u2019re at the hour here, so let me close. I want to thank, everyone, again for joining our call this morning. I\u2019m incredibly proud of how our teams continue to execute in what remains a challenging environment. I can tell you I\u2019m extremely pleased with our continued strong performance and the resiliency of our global teams that have just continued to execute across the globe in spite of the pandemic. I hope that you and your families remain safe and certainly look forward to engaging and speaking with you \u2013 many of you soon. So, operator, that concludes our call today. Operator : Thank you so much sir. Thank you all for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. And have a great rest of your day.",

This conference is being recorded. And if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President, Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls\u2019 second quarter of fiscal 2021 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentations can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site at johnsoncontrols.com. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. I will start with a brief strategic update while adding a few specific areas related to our growth initiatives. Olivier will provide a detailed review of Q2 results and update you on our forward outlook. We will leave as much time as possible to take your questions.  Let's get started on Slide 3. We delivered another quarter of solid financial performance. Organic sales and order growth reflected positive as anticipated, which when combined with our ongoing commitment to operational excellence enabled us to grow EBIT by more than 20% year-over-year.  Despite some challenges in the macro environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the lingering impacts of COVID-19, trends across most of our end markets continue to improve, and we continue to gain share.  We have maintained an incredible level of engagement with our teams globally, as well as with our customers and partners. And we continue to execute on all of our strategic initiatives; expanding our service attachment rate and driving higher recurring revenue, enhancing and connecting our installed base with our digital OpenBlue platform and advancing our role in addressing the environmental needs of our customers.  Lastly, as promised, we are announcing our cost of goods reduction program on today's call, which targets $250 million in run rate savings by fiscal 2023. In combination with the SG&A actions we announced earlier this quarter, we expect to deliver $550 million in net savings, which provides significant margin expansion over the next several years. These actions are a testament to our commitment of continuous improvement and will enable us to close our margin gap versus peers. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on Slide 10, organic sales inflected positive as anticipated in Q2 at 1% overall with strong growth in global products and underlying trends improving across our field businesses. The strength in global products was driven by continued high levels of demand in residential end markets, not only in our HVAC equipment business but also in security products. Operator : Thank you. . And our first question is from Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : This has been a strange quarter for . So yes, first of all, just want to touch on the COGS and SG&A actions. I'd be curious, what prompted the sort of the second round of efficiency programs and what prompted the review? And is it a case of having lived through COVID and remote working that you've found more efficient ways of doing things in the case of Olivier coming in and having a fresh look? I mean what prompted these actions? Olivier Leonetti : So, Nigel, good morning. Thank you for your question. After the merger -- following the merger, we created the conditions to go to another level of profitability improvement. And when I started, George asked us to now look at levers to close the productivity gap to our competition. So that was the driving force. And that was communicated, Nigel, about seven months ago. So we have been -- and we said we will go and update you as plans are unfolding. So first was SG&A. And today is our COGS plan. And as you can see from the numbers, Nigel, we believe we are going to add significant profit to the bottom line and we are well on track to close the gap to our competitors. George Oliver : And, Nigel it's really a continuation of the work that we did with the integration. We've got strong fundamentals now across the board. We've got the right leadership team. And then the work that we've been doing, we recognize that there's a significant opportunity to continue to improve. And what we've done as a team is be able to \u2013 to be able to detail that, and then we're very confident that we're going to be positioned to be able to deliver on those benefits. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, George. Thanks, Olivier. And then service orders down 3%. So I recognize the backlog is up. So maybe just talk about what caused that decline? Just given the initiatives you have in train  to drive growth in services. And I heard transactional was within a bit of pressure in North America. But what is your confidence that orders start to impact positive from here? George Oliver : Nigel, as you know, we have an incredible base of service, over $6 billion. And what I would say here, with the service strategies that we've been executing, I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made. It's one of our biggest growth sectors. It's being able to increase market coverage, enhance technology with OpenBlue, create new service capabilities, really now being able to leverage the underserved install base, and then ultimately deliver very attractive margin profile. When you look at the quarter, service orders were down slightly. And it's mainly just timing of conversion. We had an extremely strong March, which is continuing in April. Our service pipeline is up double digits. And then with the site access improving, that's also helping us to accelerate our L&M and our L&M contracts, which is labor and materials. And for our attach rate, when you look at our attach rate for service with our install projects is up significantly, up 300 basis points year-to-date. And so when you look at our backlog up 5%, the strong pipeline, and then the work that we've done executing on our strategy, we're very well positioned for a strong double digit second half in both orders and revenue. Nigel Coe : Thanks, George. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Yes. George, I wanted to ask in your opening remarks, I think you talked about supply chain constraints and wanted you to expand on that. And just did it actually prevent you guys from delivering equipment in the quarter, maybe if you have any sort of quantification of how that manifested in first quarter results. And then I have a follow up. George Oliver : Yes, Gautam, our team is doing incredible work across our supply chain as we're working to be able to support what we see to be an accelerating pipeline of opportunities across our businesses. We\u2019re gaining share in every platform. And so as we're working to make sure that we've got secured components and materials to be able to support that new demand, certainly we're working it hard. I believe that our team has done a good job to mitigate most of the impact. I think where we\u2019re seeing significant demand in residential, unitary as well as commercial unitary product, we're continuing to work that and not only expand our supply chain, but also our manufacturing footprint. And so we're working through that. Our backlogs are up in those businesses are record highs. And so we are working to continue to accelerate our supply chain to be able to address and support the increasing demand. But overall, I'm very proud of the team and the work we've done to be able to support our customers and ultimately deliver on the product that's being demanded. Gautam Khanna : And just as a follow up, George, any quantification of specific IAQ orders that you guys have in the quarter and perhaps any color on the front log of opportunities that are in IAQ specific? Thank you. George Oliver : Yes. When you look at the progress we're making with OpenBlue across the board, not only digitizing our core business but now being able to -- with the data that's being extracted and the solutions that now we're bringing to the market, truly now positioning us to capitalize on these significant accelerating trends. So when you look at healthy buildings, our OpenBlue Healthy Buildings launched in mid January with a solution portfolio of over 25 unique products and services, which is targeted at healthy people, places, planet. The market opportunity continues to grow. We originally sized it at $10 billion to $15 billion, and that continues to increase. Our pipeline is nearing $1 billion. Year-to-date, we've secured over $150 million. We expect this to continue to play through with a few 100 million in 2021. We've partnered with schools. We've got an incredible base of business with K-12 schools. We're working closely where we have presence with over 6,000 districts. We're working with sports venues and the like to bring back people to sports events. And so when you look at what we're doing, it's really a robust approach that ultimately starts with a detailed assessment, and then through monitoring, remote maintenance and optimization that we can do, ultimately driving the best solution. And so we're extremely excited. And then lastly, with OpenBlue in general, across the board, it's really translating to multiple elements. It's improving our service attach rates. It's improving profitability in our businesses with the book margins that we're booking. It's making us more competitive now in the overall smart buildings with our leadership and sustainability and decarbonization, which I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks. And then the overall acceleration of digitization within our existing service base through connectivity, going back and getting our install base connected, is giving us an incredible platform now to become much more intimate with our customers and bring our new capabilities to really change the game and how we serve them. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Two questions for me. First one, it looks like you're telling us you're going to absorb these cash restructuring costs and still convert at 100% free cash flow conversion. I just want to confirm that's the case. And if so, what's really allowing you to do that? I guess it has to be working capital. And if it is, maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on the working capital opportunity that's bridging you across that. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning, Jeff. So you're right. The 100% free cash flow will include both the restructuring cash impact of our SG&A and COGS programs announced today. You're right. More profit will be part of how we get there and also enhanced working capital. If you look at today, for the second quarter, we have improved cash conversion cycle by about 24 days; eight in DSO, about 11 days in DIO inventory and about five days in DPO. And we have built over the quarters even before I took the position, a great machine to have a high focus on working capital. And you see that keep delivering. And we are actually very confident in our ability to deliver a 100% free cash flow this year, but also the following years. If you do some math, Jeff, just in the first half, we are converting at 140%. So we have quite fair headroom to now achieve 100% for the year. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then maybe secondarily, just on the COGS program, the mix of savings are interesting. I guess if I was going to feel the guess of where the costs would come out, I would have surmised maybe more in manufacturing and distribution and less so in field labor. I wonder if you could just kind of address the manufacturing and distribution piece. It looks like you've got a $3.2 billion cost base there if I'm interpreting the chart right and you're targeting $70 million of savings there. I guess these plans might not be fully mature after a kind of a seven-month exercise, but would there be kind of more room in some of these numbers as you look forward? Olivier Leonetti : So a few things. We said it. I'm going to repeat it. Those savings are net. Meaning they would flow to the bottom line. If you look at the mix, our team has done a great job in managing direct materials over the few quarters and we think now the biggest opportunity, that's why we have announced the numbers we have announced are in the standardization of our field operation across all the elements of field operation; install, services and procurement. Now the other question was, is there more possible? That's, of course, the case. We want to be prudent. And we keep informing you as we go through the quarters, but we have a high level of confidence in our ability to execute this COGS program. George Oliver : And, Jeff, I think it's important to note that as we went through the integration, we developed a robust operating system for the field, which enables us to be able to take all of what we do to put into that one operating system. And then would that globally be able to focus on the variation at each one of the cost levels, and be able to drive improvement. So the work that we've done is we actually have that detail to that level across the board and how we're driving improvement within that operating system for our field-based businesses. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks. Very encouraging. Good luck. George Oliver : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, everybody. George Oliver : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : I\u2019m curious kind of logistically and otherwise what an outcome-based contract really looks like? Are you defying getting cash in the door? How long does it take to kind of prove the outcome that you're promising? Can you walk us through at a high level without giving away your trade secrets here or contract secrets, but can you walk us through at least at a high level what a contract like that looks like? I'll just leave it at that, George. George Oliver : Yes. So, Scott, it's similar to our performance contracting that we have today where we ultimately do a survey of a customer site. We identify opportunities to be able to reduce energy, improve operations and the like. And when we do that, there's significant improvement to be made. Buildings historically have been very inefficient. They've been very energy intensive. And so our opportunity here is to be able to create an outcome, energy savings, higher operations, and then do that. In some cases, we bring in financing for the project, and ultimately then get a recurring revenue that goes over. It can be over 10, 15, 20 plus years depending on the type of projects. These are great returns, great recurring revenue that's tied to that initial install project, and ultimately delivering on the outcome. And our track record in being able to deliver on the commitments that we make with these types of contracts is extremely high. So we do manage a bit of risk, but it's relatively low and we ultimately make sure that with the technologies and capabilities that we provide, that we deliver on the outcome that we commit. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : One statistic, Scott, and we haven't disclosed this before. If you look at the energy saving performance market in the U.S., which is a 4 billion market, the company has a market share which is 50% higher than our number two competitor. So we have a strong position in the energy saving outcome-based market, and we believe that we're going to leverage this capability going forward as buildings decarbonize across the planet. George Oliver : Scott, I think it's important to understand that today, buildings are about 40% of the carbon footprint globally, and about 75% of that is operational. And so when commitments are being made to get to net zero carbon emissions, buildings become very important in how they ultimately drive towards getting to that outcome. And so we have an incredible opportunity with the capabilities that we have now with the -- not only what we've done historically with performance contracting, but now with OpenBlue to bring together holistically complete systems that with the use of the data, we can drive a lot of optimization in what we ultimately deliver for the customers to be able to meet their objectives. Scott Davis : It totally makes sense. Is it harder to collect in those contracts? Is there kind of disagreements of what the data shows and the sustainability of that? And with the savings, it seems like there would be some gray area items in there, but perhaps I'm wrong. George Oliver : Scott, it's the opposite. It's very predictable. And I think our track record relative to the projects that we've executed, that has been very strong. So we make sure that as we look at these type of projects with the customers that we're doing these projects for, that we're obviously mitigating any risk and ultimately focus on executing on the commitments that we make. Scott Davis : Perfect. Thank you for the clarification. Good luck and congrats, guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. George Oliver : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about a little bit more about price cost? What was the spread in the quarter and how you're seeing kind of pricing and costs evolve over the next couple of quarters? And is there any \u2013 given your kind of fiscal year-end timing, any leakage into next year? George Oliver : Yes, Steve, let me start and I'll turn it over to Olivier for some of the more \u2013 more of the details. But as you know, over the last three years, we've really built strategic pricing capability across the company. And if you look at the last couple of years, we were able to be able to deliver net 100 basis points on the top line as a result. That has served us extremely well as we get into the cycle with accelerating inflation. So with that, we have improved discipline in the field. We're executing projects better at better margin rates. And then within our product businesses where you see the impact sooner because of the material costs, we've been able to have a very dynamic pricing model that has been deployed across each one of our platforms to ultimately not only see what's happening in the near term, but longer term being able to be very dynamic in how we pass that along into the channels. And so to date, we've -- in the second quarter, we had about a 30 basis point benefit. And we believe that the work we're doing, not only in productivity, VAVE, direct material productivity, designing material costs out of our products and then ultimately driving just improved productivity across the entire supply chain, that we're still in a position to be net positive here in the second half. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : No, nothing more to add, Steve. And when you look at the Slide 19, when we say 30 basis point base margin improvement, we are factoring also our best view on next year price cost, but we have a great process across the organization to maintain that going forward in this very fluid environment. Steve Tusa : Okay. Any other mechanical items for next year that we should be aware of as you've moved through this year that flip either positive or negative outside of the kind of obvious restructuring and the activities you've already kind of talked about? Olivier Leonetti : Nothing more than what we all read in the news. It's still a freed environment. We feel very bullish about how the economies across the world are rebounding. George mentioned that earlier in this call. Our order flow is increasing significantly. And something important, if you look at our install business, which is about 35% of the revenue of the organization, we see this business now growing, and that is done at the back of the retrofit market. Usually, 50% of install is associated with new buildings. The new buildings today are depressed. So as this new building is starting to rebound, and it is in the U.S. and across the world, we see our business really taking momentum, and that will translate into, of course, more global products, products being sold, higher service mix. So we feel very positive about what we see in front of us. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Morning. Maybe a first question around fire and security. You've got good sort of recovery trends, very evident on the HVAC side of the house. Fire and security sales still down mid-single digit. So maybe help us understand how you see the slope of that recovery from here? And perhaps how big of an impact is the sort of retail piece in there as a headwind? George Oliver : Yes. Julian, let me start by just framing up fire and security and what we saw in the quarter and what it means as we go forward. It is about 40% of our total revenues. It's core to building systems. It's got a very attractive margin profile due to the product and service mix. We've got a large installed base, which ultimately drives the recurring revenue. And this combined now with OpenBlue, we can truly differentiate what we do longer term to get a higher percentage of that recurring revenue. And security now in the new world, in the digital world, that now is becoming a critical asset as we think about our smart buildings to be able to collect data and apply analytics. When you look at the sequential trends, our short cycle business in fire and security is up nicely. When you look at products -- total products is going to be up -- it's up about low to mid-single digits. And then our service actually inflected positive in the field businesses, which, as you know, because of all of the shutdowns, we had a lot of difficulty over the last few quarters to be able to get in and perform the service. So I think as we go forward, those trends on the shorter cycle is coming through very nicely. And then on the install side, as these new projects that come into market, both in retrofit and in install, which are longer cycle, we're getting more than our fair share on that. So as they're coming to market and these projects start to be deployed, we're very well positioned to be able to start to pick up the install revenues. But I would tell you the shorter cycle piece is actually performing very well. And so even though the install revenues were down, it's mainly just a function of timing, of conversion, and we see the orders now picking up very nicely in the second half. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. And then maybe switching to a topic that's relevant across the company. There's a lot of interest, obviously, in the U.S. education stimulus money that could flow over the next three years. Maybe help us understand what the scale of JCI's exposure is to that education vertical as you're looking across the field and global products business? George Oliver : Yes, Julian, let me summarize it quickly here. The three large COVID relief packages, they totaled about $5 trillion in aid over the last 12 months, much needed relief for our customers. We were very active in participating in making sure as those bills were put together, that certainly was focused on healthy buildings and making sure that as we -- whether it's bringing students back to the school room or the like or buildings, we're very actively involved in making sure that the details of what was going to be needed to be able to address some of the new challenges were actually incorporated in the bills. And when you look at the funding directed to upgrading facilities in the vertical markets that we have the highest exposure and deep relationships, it is K-12, higher ed and then state and local government, which play to our strengths. And so when you look at your question on education, K-12, we have relationships across North America or the U.S. with about 6,000 school districts, and then at the higher ed level, about 1,900. They all -- this all plays right into our strengths. And so in K-12 alone, there's been about $195 billion allocated. And so what we've done is making sure that not only right from the frontend of building the build to now executing state-by-state with what we have as a program management office, we're making sure we're detailing all of the flow of that stimulus and that we're positioned to be able to address the challenges that they're going to deploy that stimulus to be able to address. And so we think the TAM for the U.S., you're in billions of dollars relative to the opportunity that we see as we're going after this. And the healthy -- and healthy buildings market itself, we said it was originally 10 to 15. That continues to be expanded with the stimulus' coming into the market. So we believe that we're in the early stages with the pipeline that we see, that it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars that we can be well positioned to execute on. Antonella Franzen : And Julian, I would just add that when you look at education, it is a big vertical for JCI overall. And particularly when you look at North America, it's about 20% of the revenue. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : George, if you wouldn't mind just kind of taking a step back, I know with the nature of the field business and kind of the mix of fire and security and HVAC in there sort of makes benchmarking tough. But if I look at what we've kind of seen so far through the first quarter, it seems like maybe from an orders perspective, commercial HVAC is running up kind of mid-teens at the market level. I think you mentioned low double digits in applied North America, but what's your sense on kind of the product side of commercial HVAC and where we should sort of see order rates here, whether it's this quarter or kind of here in the medium term? George Oliver : Josh, I think as you look at our mix, certainly, we're a longer cycle with the installs service part of our portfolio. But as you dig into the specific products in every category, we're gaining share. So if you look into, for instance, in the unitary business in the commercial side, new orders in North America for equipment for the rooftops is up mid-teens and with March up over 30%, our backlog is up 100%. Now those orders are in our product-based business. So you wouldn't see those orders. It's in the -- obviously inherent in the book and bill. And then when you look at our unitary share, we're up about 40 basis points year-over-year. And so as we look at the backlog being up 100% and the projected growth here in the third quarter, in North America unitary, we're projecting we're going to be up 30% plus in the quarter and third quarter. So that would be the commercial side. On the residential side, our orders were up again about 88%, record level of backlog there. Our sales were up about 35% with our units were up over 40%. We're seeing strong sell-through through that channel. We're going to see continued strength in Q3 and Q4. And so that's continuing. When you look at -- and the same holds true in our Hitachi business in Asia Pac. We got strong double digit revenue there, mainly driven by Japan, and that's been because of a gain share with our new product introductions. And then when you look at -- even in North America, when you look at even though our installs showed our orders were up about 5%, and underlying those orders in North America, we saw mid teens growth in applied equipment orders. So that is going to play out very nicely for us in the second half and ultimately set us up for increased service attach and service revenue going forward. So you got to look at the details to understand that in every category, whether it be through our distribution or as we now set up our install business that we're setting it up for the longer term that's going to be very attractive. And just building off one thing that Olivier said, when you look at our install business, we have significantly outperformed through this cycle. With the non-resi construction down as much as it is, we were able to actually fill most of that void with short-term retrofit upgrade orders, which in North America alone were up 20% in the quarter. Now we're seeing a fundamental that with the short-term demand, that's going to continue. It's going to continue around healthy buildings and sustainability projects. That's going to now combine with what we see happening in non-residential new demand coming through. This is the first that I've seen the two coming together, and it's going to play out very well in the second half for strong orders as well as beginning to convert to strong revenue in the second half. Olivier Leonetti : And Josh, and one statistic again, which gives \u2013 allows you to put all that together, global products in aggregate for next quarter we believe we're going to be able to grow revenue in the 20% plus range. So that gives you an idea about what is going on around all the elements of the portfolio, 20% plus revenue year-on-year growth expected. Joshua Pokrzywinski : That's super color. Maybe just one follow up on Scott's question on performance contracting. George, I think to your point, this is a business that you guys have been around in for decades now. I'm surprised that given how compelling that is for a customer that the industry isn't bigger or JCI's exposure to that isn't bigger. It almost seems kind of like a free upgrade providing you a bond support to get that work done. What's been kind of the bottleneck to that historically? George Oliver : It's a great question. So we're working with all of our customers. And historically, a big customer has been the government, both at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level with our 3P type contracts and performance contracts. And so we've been working with them and some of it is how they account for the projects and ultimately, how they look at it as an upfront cost and how they account versus an ongoing operational cost. And so we've been very active working with our customers to make sure that they're addressing some of their internal challenges that get in the way of doing a contract like this, which is very attractive in being able to get returns that pay for the cost of capital. And so we're working to really start to create that market above and beyond what it is today. And we believe that we're very well positioned to be able to then capitalize on that opportunity, Josh. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Perfect. Thanks, George. Good luck, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hi. Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Morning. Olivier, can you give us a little more color on how to think about the 550 basis points of total cost out and what it actually means for incrementals over the next few years? It looks like inclusive of the core margin improvement of 30 basis points that you're dialing in on average, do you think you can get something like 300 basis points of margin improvement over the three-year period with an average 100 basis points and core incrementals in the 40% plus range? But I just want to sort of confirm those numbers. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning, Andy. Your numbers are absolutely correct. If you remove Silent-Aire in the next fiscal and the one after that would be in the 40% incremental. After that, we believe we will have created the conditions to deliver on our 30% incremental. And we will unpack -- we gave you a lot of data already, Andy, and we'd give you even more on Investor Day in September. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then Olivier, maybe a follow up in terms of -- we know that JCI is obviously an inverted company. So we wouldn't expect a big impact from Biden's corporate tax win. But how are you thinking about the resiliency of your tax rate if there is some kind of global minimum tax agreement? And what kind of levers can you pull to maintain your relative low tax rate advantage? Olivier Leonetti : So the situation is fluid. All of us are reading the papers. All of us have insights on what could happen. So one, we are, of course, committed to the 13.5% tax rate for this fiscal. And going forward, we have ran various scenarios. We are highly confident that our tax rate will remain competitive relative to the industry. And we have various levers to achieve that. Some of it is, of course, where we are registered as a company and the complexity of our legal entity structure. We believe it's going to be and remain a competitive advantage. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Olivier. Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, Andy. Antonella Franzen : George, would you like to do some final comments? George Oliver : Yes. Let's wrap up the call this morning. As I mentioned earlier, we've had a very strong first half of the year and the momentum we are seeing across our portfolio coupled with our strategic focus and improved execution gives me high confidence in our ability to be able to outperform as we go forward. I hope you and your families continue to remain safe, and I look forward to speaking with many of you soon. So with that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the call. You may disconnect your lines, and thank you for your participation.",

This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'm now going to turn over the call to Antonella Franzen, Vice President, and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' third quarter of fiscal 2021 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentations can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site at johnsoncontrols.com. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let me kick things off with a brief update, spotlighting a few specific areas related to our strategic initiatives. And Olivier will provide a detailed review of Q3 results and update you on our forward outlook. We will leave as much time as possible to take your questions. Let's get started on slide three. Another quarter of solid results, with demand accelerating across most of our end markets as a robust recovery continues to expand. Q3 represents our easiest comparison of the year, but I am encouraged to see the underlying sequential improvement experienced in the first-half continue to accelerate in the third quarter, with many of our businesses back to operating at pre-pandemic volume levels. Non-residential construction markets continue to recover led by the ongoing strength in retrofit activity, tied to demand for healthy building solutions. New construction is also beginning to show signs of stabilization and the inflection in order trends for our longer-cycle project businesses sets us up well as we look to next year and beyond. Our service business has recovered, and we continue to transform this business through our digital service strategy to drive higher levels of recurring revenue and an improved growth profile. This recovery has not been without its challenges. We have managed through significant headwinds related to persistent supply chain disruptions, component shortages, labor constraints, and continued inflation. While these dynamics have created some revenue pressure which will continue near-term, the pace and composition of order growth in the quarter provides confidence that we will remain on track over the medium and long-term. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on slide eight, organic sales accelerated in Q3 of 15% of all in line with the guidance we provided last quarter as growth in global products and our field businesses accelerated. The strength in global products was across the board from continued high level of demands in residential end markets including both our Global HVAC equipment and security products due to the anticipated rebound in commercial HVAC and fire and security. Segment EBITA increased 21% versus the prior-year and segment EBITA margin expanded 30 basis points to 16.2%. Better leverage on higher volumes, the benefit of our SG&A actions and strong execution more than offset the significant headwind from the reversal of temporary cost reductions and a modest headwind from negative price costs. EPS of $0.83 increased 24%, benefiting from higher profitability as well as a lower share count. On cash, we had another strong quarter, free cash flow in the quarter was $735 million flat versus the prior-year despite the planned up tick in CapEx. I'll give you further details of our performance later in the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everybody. George Oliver : Morning, Joe. Antonella Franzen : Morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, maybe just starting off I just wanted to maybe just talk about the cost pressures, and talk about inflation and how that impacted the business this quarter. And also, just thinking about what's embedded for the temporary cost actions as we head into 4Q, how much does that step down from 3Q into 4Q, clearly recognizing that there was a pretty big headwind this year from the furloughs reversal? George Oliver : Yes, Joe, let me take that, and then I'll turn it over to Olivier to give you some additional color or a year-on-year basis. When you look at the year, the way that we set up the year and made sure that we were anticipating the inflationary pressures and ultimately making sure that we're driving the proper level of price, as well as continuing to drive productivity, we've built that into our model. And so every step through the year we've been staying ahead on pricing, and we've been ultimately driving additional productivity to offset some of these headwinds. And I would say from pricing standpoint, over the last couple of years we've built a lot of strong strategic capability across our businesses. And that has played out extremely well during this period of time. And so, with the inflationary environment, we knew that that was going to be a challenge in the second-half, and we anticipated that. And there's -- we probably have about two points of price flowing through the top line, which given the timing of that, that has created some headwind here in the third quarter. But with the work that we've done here, we're going to be set up still to be able to continue to deliver on the 80 or 90 basis points of margin expansion for the year. And so, I think the team has done an incredible job from where -- when we first set the year up, and then ultimately how we've executed; we've executed extremely well. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : No, absolutely. Good morning, Joe. So, at a high level, we mentioned this. So, 30 basis points of EBITA margin increase in the quarter. We had the impact of Silent-Aire for about 10, so it's a 40 basis point increase in Q3. Going through some of the elements, you asked specifically about productivity. The impact of our temporary actions from last year net of our ongoing productivity program is about 160 basis points in the quarter. If you look at price costs, the impact in Q3 is around 40 basis points. We believe we will be in price cost positive for the second-half. So, of course, Q4 would be positive. And last piece of your question, the headwind from temporary actions in OpEx net of our ongoing productivity actions. In Q4, the impact would be about 50 basis points negative. So we are positing improvement in margin rates despite two major headwinds which are temporary in nature. And we feel good about our ability to keep improving the profitability of Johnson Controls. Joe Ritchie : That's very helpful and clear, thank you. And then maybe just my follow-on question. I know that you probably don't want to preview too much exactly what we'll hear on September 8. But if you could give us any kind of color on how you're planning to organize the virtual Investor Day and the key topics that you'll be focused on? George Oliver : Yes, Joe, I mean we're setting that up very much in line with the strategy that we've communicated with all of our key growth vectors in how we're, not only reinvesting in products and technology, OpenBlue, but also making sure that with that we're positioned to be able to capitalize on big growth vectors as we build out our digital services, as we capitalize on the trends in decarbonization, as we capitalize on the significant market that's being developed with healthy buildings, and then making sure that that is coming together in supporting the core, because at the end of the day we have a unique position here with the combined portfolio to truly lead the future buildings, as we're thinking about healthy buildings, not only healthy people, healthy places, healthy planet. And so that'll be core to the strategy. And then supporting all of that will be all of the strategic priorities that we're executing on operationally that ultimately delivers on acceleration of growth and above market growth, while we're continuing to deliver best-in-class as far as margins and being able to close the gap that we've had there through our   programs. But we're extremely excited about the progress we made, and really looking forward to laying that out in detail, on September 8. Joe Ritchie : Great, thank you. Look forward to it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, Josh. Olivier Leonetti : Morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, Olivier, thanks for all the color there on some of the margin drivers in 4Q. I know price cost is always a bit of a moving target, and it seems like you're getting on top of that. So, I guess it leaves net productivity as maybe the biggest factor for getting all those actions to drop to the bottom line and the overall EBITA leverage. But when does that 50 basis points of net headwind kind of split more acutely, either based on the comparison for the temporary items or just the productivity deck ramping up? Olivier Leonetti : So, thank you for your question. The main impact of the headwinds is in Q3, by a wide margin. And that's true, by the way, for the full fiscal year. And our ongoing productivity actions have an equal weight in Q3 and in Q4. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then, George, a question for you just on kind of the overall cadence of demand or mix of drivers here, I think across the building space there is this pretty heavy cocktail with cyclical recovery and some of the secular drivers that you talk about, whether it's IQ or building efficiency infrastructure, all that. It does seem like there's some order momentum. But when do we see these tailwinds kind of stack up where you get the cyclical and secular at the same point? Like do you think that those can actually overlap or the secular stuff maybe takes a little bit longer? George Oliver : Hey, Josh, let me say that in all the time that I've been in these businesses, I've never seen as fast of a recovery to get back to where we were as I've seen with this cycle. And if you look at why that's true with our business, the general macro conditions continue to improve, although they're not linear across all the regions, as Olivier laid out. We're seeing continued momentum in construction-related indicators, and that's beginning to accelerate. So, we're actually seeing that come through. And that's supported by ABI continuing to be very strong. Dodge construction starts are improving sequentially. And what we're seeing is, we're very active in the earlier shorter-cycle projects, which is really outperforming right now. And for us, a lot of that is focused on healthy buildings. And that's been really critical to how we filled in our backlog through the course of the year. Retrofit right now in these smaller term projects continue to ramp. In North America, they were up year-on-year or up over 30%. And so that has been a big driver of our install business and when Olivier talked about our backlog, we were up, we've got a record backlog, we're up 7%, and so, as you play out fourth quarter, we don't see any slowdown. And so as we begin to set up '22, that is where we've had a lot of the pressure here in '21. And that's come back nicely. You can go through different verticals that are driving that healthcare, education, some of the datacenters, we're seeing good activity there, real estate is coming back, and so, I think overall, when you ask about the cycle, this not only the short cycle demand, as well as the longer cycle, and then with services with now these new demands and new outcomes that our customers are looking for, we have an incredible opportunity now, as we're digitizing our existing service business to now take the new technologies, and to be able to create new outcomes, which ultimately has given us a recurring revenue stream. And that is another dimension that we didn't have before, as we get into more of a change in the market and being positioned to be able to now capitalize on those changes. Olivier Leonetti : Let me give you, Josh, some additional statistics, we gave some of those in our prepared remarks. So what is the performance about the decarb market, right? It's a market we believe, which is good to be around $250 billion of hopefully, over the next 10 years. If you look at the best proxy for this at Johnson Controls, it's our performance infrastructure contract. This business is year-to-date growing at about 15%, last year this business was growing 2%, so it's really a business which is taking altitude, on the indoor air quality, if you pass in install or the growth between retrofit and new, in the retrofit which is a byproduct of indoor air quality, the older growth was in the quarter 29%, close to 30% on the two year stack, plus 10%. And we said that last quarter, we see this retrofit really accelerating it is and we said we are starting to see an inflection point in new build, we said that last quarter, it's happening this quarter, new build install up 16 in the quarter, then you speak about services, and George mentioned some of the statistics already, so we have clear indicators that were getting traction. Q \u2013 Josh Pokrzywinski : Thank you both for all the color. Really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Better saying about the virtual thing for September 8, I was actually looking forward to coming to Milwaukee. So that's understandable, I guess. Olivier Leonetti : We were also looking forward to it, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Then the Delta variants. So, this one is just to kind of putting down the APAC margins because it seems to me I understand the temporary cost kind of comments, but it does feel like there's a bit of a mix issue as well. I'm just wondering, is that China growth primarily, you did call out country mix there and thinking about the price costs, Olivier you mentioned price cost was, this is the toughest quarter from price cost perspective. Did that hit more in APAC than other regions just as curious there? Olivier Leonetti : So you're right, Nigel, two impacts for APAC. One country mix China particularly on the one and point number two also, the actions we took last year to reduce our OpEx base. It's difficult to read the quarter because of those phenomenons, you have data impacting APAC, you have data impacting also North America. Structurally, the margin profile of the business is improving across the portfolio. That includes also the regions Nigel, net of those one-off. George Oliver : Nigel, there is a little bit of mix there across the region where we've had continued pressures there with volumes, that's playing through there, but that's beginning to come back also, as we see kind of our Japan business and the business that we have in Hong Kong, and the like, so there's some mix there also. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, George. And then, on OpenBlue, the patent filings are very encouraging? How do we measure OpenBlue success momentum from an external perspective, is it really just the cadence on installations and services, are there other metrics that you can call out to give us a sense on how we're progressing here? George Oliver : Yes, let me frame it up for you, Nigel, OpenBlue now is being incorporated, we're leveraging OpenBlue with all of our services, we're getting all of our installations connected, being able to now extract all of the critical data, and then apply AI and analytics to that data to create new outcomes. And then if you advance forward, that not only doing it with the core business, but now as we're building out new capabilities across all of our digital platforms, and bringing them all together into one architecture. I talked about Vijay Sankaran coming on board, we've been able to bring Vijay in and he's got an incredible reputation, and the ability now to be able to take all of what we've done and really put that together. So, not only it enhances our core, but it accelerates the pipeline of digital content that is ultimately now being deployed in everything we do and so a good metric is when you look at our digital revenues, our digital revenues today, we don't segment that but if you were to look at all of our digital revenues, we're up strong double-digits across all of our, whether it be our platforms, indoor, through our digital services. And so another way to look at it is when you look at our pipeline, so as we were building pipeline across all three regions is a much more significant digital content that's being now built into solutions that we're deploying, because we're now differentiating the value that we're bringing to our customers with new offerings. And so, that pipeline is well over, I think we've talked about this in previous quarters is now a well over a $1 billion going forward. So those are the ways you kind of look at how it's being deployed, and the amount of impact that it's having, not only on decarb, but now as we look to really lead what I would call autonomous buildings of the future, which is a little bit more forward-looking, we'll have all of the pieces that come together to be able to now support these big outcomes, and Olivier said it, decarbonisation is going to be a $240 billion market, helping buildings is $10 billion to $15 billion and the digital content is what enables us to bring leadership solution to that. And so, as we invent smart buildings will be a little bit longer-term. But we showed some examples today, we're deploying OpenBlue not only takes all of our core, enhances our core, but then positions us to be able to get incremental revenue above that. Nigel Coe : Thanks, George. I'll leave at there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two from me, could we drill in a little bit on actually kind of what's going on in your resi and light commercial business and maybe some production or supply chain disruptions there you characterized resi as kind of in line with your expectation, but market look like it was stronger than that in the quarter. So give us a little bit of color on what's going on in that business. And do you have the ability to maybe uncork some more volume at your facilities there? George Oliver : Jeff, so when you look at our light commercial, it includes not only the light commercial unitary rooftops, it also includes VRFs and we said earlier, VRF we're continuing to perform extremely well. When you look at the unitary business, we've been launching new products. So we've got a product lineup now of three new product launches, we've been expanding the capacity with those launches. And now with this strong recovery, we've been working to keep up with the recovery of the market. Our orders, when you look at our orders in that space, we're up about 75%, so we didn't get the pull through here during the quarter, but we're continuing very strong with the new products that we've launched, and we've got a backlog that that now is up three times from what it was a year-ago. So, a lot of this is just the cycle time of conversion, and well, we're continuing to expand the capacity for the new products that we've launched. Jeff Sprague : Understood. And maybe you could give us a little update on Silent-Aire now that you own it, obviously you haven't owned it for long, but kind of initial customer response, how you will plan to pull the business around the globe? Any change in customer behavior or anything like that since you took the keys to the asset? George Oliver : Yes, Jeff, so, let me comment on that. I mean, I couldn't be more excited. As things have opened up, I've also had the opportunity to visit our Silent-Aire team and a couple of sites out in Phoenix here recently. And I couldn't be more excited about how this is going to fit in to our portfolio and aligned to our priorities. And so, when you look at this, it's bolt-on technology. It's filling out white space that we didn't have capability in. It also enables us to be able to build out and increase install base where we haven't had a significant level of service there, but there's tremendous opportunity to build service on top of those offerings. And then the whole digital content being able to take what they do so well working with all of the datacenter operators that really is innovative. It takes the technology. It configures the technology in a way that truly differentiates how they work with each of these datacenter operators. And now you throw digital into that. It really becomes a game-changer. And so, I believe that, as we look at datacenters and how we're going to be able to leverage this, not only with the Silent-Aire capability, but also with the core -- our core capabilities, I couldn't be more excited. Now with any integration and the like, there is a lot of work, but having been with the team and really taken a pulse on where we are, that's going to play out really nicely for us. Olivier Leonetti : One additional color on your first question on resi, in North America we have been at capacity from a manufacturing standpoint now for a few months, few quarters. And we are adding capacity at the start of our fiscal year so -- as very soon and we believe we're going to be able them to change that trajectory. We are adding a fair amount of capacity, actually. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you for that color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : I start up with a question with Olivier. The performance on trade working capital is pretty impressive in a quarter when many of your peers are needing to add lots of buffer inventory and you kind of see the trading capital moving against you. I did see inventory was up $7 million, but could you talk us through where it stands today, just overall trade working capital and how you're navigating through this period. Olivier Leonetti : Deane, thank you for your question. So, a remarkable performance and trade working capital, 11% of revenue in the quarter, we were at about 13.5% same quarter a year ago. All the leavers are actually playing in our favor. Let me speak now in term of days. So DSO up -- down nine days year-on-year is structural. We have now in place a strong mechanic to really do a good job on DSO. That's a structural improvement and we have not reached our best game here. If you look at DPO improvement year-on-year by about four days, again structural, we have various programs in place to make our DPO even better for Johnson Controls. And last one in term of inventory also good job. That's byproduct also of strong demand. So some of the inventory improvements, so, it's 15 days in total, is structural, some of it is temporary, but we feel good about the free cash flow generation of the company. We said before, Deane, that we were 100% free cash flow organization would be at 105 including restructuring. So really the run rate is in 115 and we feel strong about cash flow generation in our company, Deane. Deane Dray : Well, that's all great to hear and it's such a difference between where the company was a couple of years ago on working capital management, free cash flow and being comfortably above 100% is -- congrats to the team there. And then, just second question for George, just put this net zero building as a service that you're highlighting today, put it in context, it's encouraging to see a SaaS business being added to this, but where does it stand in the priority stack in terms of, let's say, indoor air quality. And are there any regulatory oversight that's going to come into the industry on how these calculations are being made because obviously this feeds into each of your customers' ESG rankings and so forth. There's a lot of focus on it. Just how does this all develop from here? George Oliver : So, Deane, let me start with healthy buildings indoor air quality because that's front and center as we sit here today because of the significant demand. And as I said, we've sized that market up to be $10 billion to $15 billion double-digit CAGR. We have secured well over $300 million to date and we have a pipeline that's well over $1 billion that we're working on. And that has been continuing to accelerate because of the reopening and return to work plans and the like. And a key space for us within healthy buildings is K-12. We've got an incredible position within schools, across 6,000 school districts, across the U.S. and as well as 1,900 higher ed. So, overall, it's been our ability to be able to not only from a pure equipment -- doing a pure equipment upgrade, it's really taken the combined capabilities that we have within a building that ultimately then creates the best outcome as you think about healthy buildings or indoor air quality. So, that is front and center today. When you think about decarbonization sustainability, we've been in that space for years with our performance contracting business. And really that business has been focused on reducing energy consumption, reducing the carbon footprint. Now with the commitments that have been made pretty broadly now to get to zero net carbon emissions, the capabilities that we can bring now without just a one narrow solution, we can bring a full solution to a building that enables us not only to optimize the equipment, but how the equipment operates within that building with the occupants that ultimately then creates the best outcome, which is ultimately reducing energy and achieving the decarbonization goals. We believe over the next decade, this will build into a $240 billion market, and that's above the $300 plus-billion market that we serve today. And I think when you look at our -- now -- not only the products and the building systems that now we have brought together, and now when you layer on OpenBlue and in the digital capabilities, it is what is required to get to the best outcome as you're looking to make a building most efficient and then with the remaining demand, how do you drive towards renewables as far as supply. So that is going to play out a little bit longer-term, Deane, but a very attractive space for us. Deane Dray : Terrific. I bet we'll hear more about that on September 8 too. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Hi. On the services revenue growth of 11%, I think it was -- what do you -- how do you kind of see that going forward? I know there's like -- it's kind of a confluence of events of comps being a little bit easier, but also some momentum and kind of your initiatives. How do we think about kind of that growth rate into the next 18 months, 18 to 24 months? George Oliver : Yes, we've talked a lot about this, Steve; we've made incredible progress here in taking our $6 billion business. And then as we look at how we can fundamentally differentiate that business and it's pretty simple. For us we believe that when we deploy our digital capability with our core capability and get everything connected, that in itself is going to be a big uplift and we're seeing that. We're now up to -- we made the 400 basis points of improvement on attach. And so everything we deploy, we attach and then we get a contract and then the ability to differentiate the type of services that we ultimately perform with the data that is extracted from the systems that we deploy to optimize the overall operation. So that with the increased installed base, the attach, the additional, and then now as we think about some of these new opportunities with healthy buildings, and decarbonization, all of those converge into our ability to be able to deliver, as we've committed 200 to 300 basis points above the market. And I think as some of these trends continue to accelerate, I think there's opportunity beyond that. And so, a lot of it is the connection, the additional services, utilizing data, the retention of customers, and creating outcomes that historically haven't been achieved, because they're more of a mechanical service versus a digital service. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then, just on your order, as you mentioned like commercial orders being up a lot. What were the applied orders up in the quarter for your applied equipment? George Oliver : Yes, so when you look at our commercial HVAC business Steve, I'm extremely pleased with the performance that we've seen. It's a combination of the new products that we've continue to launch. And we're gaining share when seeing that pretty much across the board. And then we're also what's enabling this connectivity is we're embedding technology within the product that enables us to easily connect preservers for the long-term service. How that plays out? The orders we're better than 20% globally. For the quarter broad base across all three regions, I think Oliver said that in North America applied equipment, as part of the overall 21% increase was up over 50%. So we feel really good about the backlog we've built and how that's going to play out. And then the continued pipeline that we're seeing build that we're positioning to be able to go after. So that has played out from a revenue standpoint was high single-digits, we're pretty much across the region seeing growth -- varying levels of growth across all three regions. But Steve, that is a strength for us, and I think as we look at our strategies not only within the equipment, but then the ability to be able to build a base for service with connectivity, we're really going to be positioned well. Steve Tusa : Right. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Just and most of my questions have been answered. But just to clarify a couple things. I mean, when you talk about being kind of on the right side of price versus cost in by 4Q. Is that material, labor and logistics or more just kind of material side of it? George Oliver : It's mainly material, which is the big headwinds we are looking at. So if you look at for example, copper and aluminum, the pricing had declining. Steel is still up, but with steel mills starting to catch up, the lead time has been reduced by 75%. And if you look at some of the analyst's report on this important commodity, analysts are predicting that the price of steel by December so it's not very soon should be about to go down significantly. So we believe that the worst is behind us in commodity. Scott Davis : Okay. And I know, I mean, your fire and security business is a little bit more labor intensive than the HVAC side and the install. Are there labor shortages that concern you? Do you feel like you've got the capacity to be able to handle ever rising orders here? Olivier Leonetti : Yes, Scott, we were anticipating that we're going to have challenges as the recovery started to heat up and recover. So we've had what we call PMOS pretty much requires all of our key markets that and solely focused on labor and making sure that we're getting more than our fair share, as far as labor and I would tell you at our manufacturing sites, at our in the field with the work that we've done. We talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks with the different programs that we've launched to be real attractive to technicians in the light coming to work for our company. So what I would say here today, although we've had as we've ramped up, it's been a significant ramp up. We've certainly had some pressures Scott, but I feel very good about the progress we made and where we are to be able to continue to support the recovery and ultimately the growth that we're projecting. George Oliver : And stating the obvious, our guide includes, obviously consider the current environment. Scott Davis : Yes, now understood. Thank you. Good luck, guys. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you. George Oliver : Thanks Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the margin point, so just wants to clarify, I think Olivier you've talked about a sort of 40% baseline incremental in the medium-term leaving aside portfolio changes. So just wanted to make sure sort of your confidence in that figure amidst the current cost environment, and also, when we look very short-term at the Q4 margin, by segment do we expect broadly similar trends to hold as you just saw in Q3? Olivier Leonetti : Julian, thank you for your question. So, we feel confident about our ability to meet our productivity goals, our programs now are well on track. SG&A, we start to deliver on those and we're slightly ahead. COGS will have mainly an impact next fiscal, we are very pleased with where we are, and what we said before is the $550 million of net drop of profit to the bottom line. We still are very bullish about this. And our ability to do achieve 40% incremental over the next two years, we feel bullish about this as well, based upon where we are. Again, we talk about some of the trends going on commodity and labor, we gave a lot of colors and commodity. We believe we will be able to achieve the goals. We have mentioned in productivity with those despite those trends in commodity and labor. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just when you're thinking about the sort of fire and security field business, realize that JCI's approach is to have a sort of a broad offering, the services pulling through the product. Clearly have seen peers sort of have a somewhat different view, most recently, demerging an F&S field business from products for example. Maybe help us understand George, how substantial or significant do you think those revenue synergies are from having a strong F&S field business sort of pulling through on the product side. And helping you perhaps, build up that that service activity as well? George Oliver : Sure, so let's look at fire and security in the quarter. Although it was a little bit lagging, the recovery has come back really strong not only in our products being up over 30%. But now converting with new installs in the field and building backlog and then recognize that with that backlog, with that installed base that we create. It does been on a very attractive service. And so when you look at your question, how do we compare to the others and ultimately, strategically how this contributes to our growth? When you look at our fire and security field business, it's about $7 billion in revenue, and it's one of our highest margin views in our portfolio. And then when you look at fire and security products, that's another roughly $2 billion. And then with this installed base is what ultimately spins out a very attractive, what I would say more traditional service business. And now as we think -- as we go forward it's going to ultimately then be much more digital and be contributing to not only the fire and security aspect, but also to the overall smart building aspect of the building. So it is going to be an important part of the overall ability to be able to now capitalize on these big trends. We talked about decarbonization, we talked about healthy buildings. And so when you look at ours compared to others, there are some similarities there. There are major differences. I think you need to look at the geographic mix, the product and solution mix, the customer mix. I would say that we have a significant advantage when it comes to scale, and overall portfolio maturity. And then, as I said, I really if you look at the future and the ability to be able to now take all of the multiple systems within a building and bring those together into one architecture with one data platform that enables, it ultimately longer-term enables an autonomous building. But as we step away from where we are today to where were we go, we should see incremental growth as that begins to transform. And so, I truly believe the work that we've done and how it's been integrated and how it's enabling not only services or service. Being able to deliver a service growth above market, as well as being able to really capitalize on what we see to be accelerating trends in our space, it does become a competitive advantage. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. George Oliver : All right, Operator, then we will close up the call. I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. And as I mentioned earlier, we've had a very strong third quarter, and the momentum that we are seeing across our portfolio in key verticals coupled with our strategic focus and improved execution gives me high confidence in our ability to keep outperforming. As we move forward, we look forward to speaking to many of you, and hope to see you virtually at our Investor Day that's coming up on September 8. So, on that, Operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' fourth quarter fiscal 2021 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted earnings per share, EBITA and EBIT exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics, together with organic sales and free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis. Now let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm going to start off with a quick look back at 2021 and update you on a few of our long-term strategic priorities. Olivier will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and provide you with our fiscal 2022 guidance. And as always, we will leave as much time as possible to take your questions. Let's get started on Slide 3. We rounded out fiscal '21 with another quarter of solid financial results, having met or exceeded all of our original commitments for the year, in what turned out to be a much more difficult environment than originally planned. The ability to deliver these results, while navigating through unprecedented levels of inflation and supply chain disruptions, is a testament to the operational discipline and agility demonstrated throughout the organization. And for that, I am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire Johnson Controls team. Despite the challenging external environment, our end market demand remains strong. Robust retrofit activity, coupled with a pickup in new nonresidential construction we are starting to see, creates a strong future demand trend. This is evidenced by the continued momentum we are seeing in our order books and the record backlog we have built. We also remain focused on the big picture, moving ahead with bold new commitments, doubling down with ambitious new ESG goals set earlier this year, embarking on a substantial new productivity program designed to drive a step-function change in profitability. And just recently, at our Investor Day in September, we committed to a new set of 3-year financial commitments. We made significant progress in advancing our growth strategy, scaling our OpenBlue digital platform, launching 8 new major offerings and greatly expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in the refresh of our product portfolio, focusing on accelerating our service growth and improving our attachment rate. And we are capitalizing on strong secular trends for healthy buildings, decarbonization and smart connected equipment and buildings. As end markets continue to recover and the adoption of these trends continue to expand globally, I am confident we are uniquely positioned from a competitive standpoint to continue to outperform. Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to the strong financial results and advancement on our strategic initiatives, we have also continued to lead in ESG, including continued progress toward both our 2025 sustainability goals and our new ESG commitments. This is not, by any means, an exhaustive list, but I am extremely pleased with what our teams have accomplished in the last year. We are committed to net zero, committed to reducing emissions within our own operations and that of our customers. Our science-based targets have been approved. Our leadership team is aligned from a governance perspective, and we are extending our leadership in sustainable financing as well. Tomorrow, I travel to COP26 in Glasgow. We made great progress in driving home the understanding that buildings represent approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and there is no tackling climate change without substantial investment in buildings. Governments are now acting on this and mobilizing billions to upgrade buildings. And Johnson Controls is perfectly positioned to deliver those solutions. At COP26, I will meet with government and business leaders to build momentum and ensure action. Turning to Slide 5. I wanted to take a few minutes to highlight several new strategic developments in the quarter. Most recently, we signed an MOU with 2 significant technology leaders, Accenture and Alibaba, to address sustainable infrastructure needs. This collaboration will focus on an estimated multibillion-dollar market for digital solutions serving data centers in China. We also signed a foundational technology agreement with Tempered Networks, building upon our recent cybersecurity partnerships with Pelion and DigiCert. Each of these partnerships embeds a critical layer of trust, security and operational capability into our OpenBlue platform and connected devices. These elements differentiate our products and services to help protect the integrity of our customers' operations and data. Tempered brings an industry-leading zero-trust secure network capability that helps us drive customer confidence and, in turn, accelerate the adoption of OpenBlue services. Our partnerships with UL, Safe Traces and with Phylagen are powerful examples of how we are innovating to extend our Healthy Buildings leadership, providing new indoor environmental quality solutions to address our customers' most pressing challenges. Our near-term focus is on the education vertical as there is a clear and compelling need to help those customers optimize their investments. With an estimated $195 billion in government stimulus earmarked for K-12 spending, this provides a significant opportunity. Additionally, we entered into an exclusive joint development agreement and investment with Phylagen, a leading biotech company working on the identification of indoor bacteria and viruses that are all around us in buildings. Our work with Phylagen is a commitment to developing the cutting-edge capabilities to deliver and maintain healthy buildings. Please turn to Slide 6. At our Investor Day, we shared with you our 3 pillars for delivering above-market growth over the next 3 years and beyond. One of those pillars related to gaining share through innovative product development centered around digital and sustainability. As planned, we launched over 150 new products in fiscal 2021, spanning nearly all business units, resulting in continued share gains in both Q4 and the full year. In 2022, we are well positioned to gain share with another 175 new products across 4 main categories : sustainability, smart buildings, digital and residential, with heat pumps central to our product development strategy. These are just a sample of what is expected to launch over the next 90 days, with a steady pipeline behind us. Turning to Slide 7. Service plays a central role in everything we do. Over the last 18 months, we have strengthened our market-leading capabilities to best position ourselves for the shifting industry demographics and evolving digital technologies that are enabling outcome-based solution models. At the start of last year, we began articulating our intentions to accelerate service growth to a couple of points above market levels, part of which would be the result of increasing our attachment rate by leveraging our large installed base and the digital transformation of our business. In fiscal 2021, we saw the early benefits of our efforts shine through. We exited the year with service revenues up 8% in the fourth quarter with high single-digit growth in all 3 regions in nearly all business domains. For the full year, service revenue grew 4%, which is up 2 to 3 points over 2019 levels, despite a slow start to the year as we manage through lingering site access restrictions and abnormal customer budget pressures. Looking ahead, we see service accelerating through fiscal 2022, in line with our goal to outpace the market. The order strength we've seen in the second half of the year bolsters that view. Service orders were up 7% in Q4 and, importantly, up low single digits organically versus 2019 levels. Additionally, we improved our attach rate to approximately 40%. Turning to Slide 8. The third pillar is our vectors of growth, which we believe, on a combined basis, represents an incremental market opportunity of $250 billion over the next decade. Our unique portfolio is a competitive advantage across all 3 areas. And from a financial performance perspective, we have significantly increased both revenue and orders in fiscal 2021. This positions us very well for continued strong performance as we move forward. Next, on Slide 9, I wanted to highlight a key customer win related to one of our key vectors of growth. In Q4, we were awarded a Buildings as a Service project by one of our long-standing customers, the University of North Dakota. This is the second long-term Performance Infrastructure contract we have been awarded with this university in the last 2 years. It leverages not only our expertise in Performance Contracting, but also the OpenBlue Enterprise Manager software. The total contract value was nearly $220 million over the life of the project, with a smaller portion of that booked during the quarter. On a related note, our OpenBlue Healthy Buildings platform enabled nearly 900 colleges and universities to safely and efficiently welcome students, staff and faculty back to their campuses this fall. Before I turn things over to Olivier, let me conclude with a few thoughts. I remain extremely encouraged by the demand patterns we are seeing across most of our end markets and the ability of our teams to capitalize on more than our fair share of that demand. We see this decade as being one of the most exciting for the smart building industry, which Johnson Controls is positioned to lead. Underlying momentum in our short-cycle businesses continues to improve despite pressure from ongoing supply chain and component availability constraints. Our longer-cycle install business, driven by the new buildings market, also continues to recover, although extended lead times and inflation are delaying some investment decisions, particularly on larger projects. Retrofit activity remains an important driver of our business, and we see plenty of opportunity to capitalize on this activity going forward. All of that said, we are very mindful of the macro backdrop and our outlook does not assume any significant near-term improvement in supply chain conditions or inflation over the next couple of quarters. On price/cost, given the progressive rise in inflation for almost all input costs throughout the year, we took decisive steps on pricing and cost to stay ahead of the curve. And I am confident we will continue to manage through these challenges. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, our focus turns to accelerating and demonstrating our growth capabilities. Our proven product technology leadership, combined now with OpenBlue, truly differentiates the solutions we can bring to our customers. In fact, we believe we are best positioned to lead the revolution of smart buildings, and we are fully committed to creating healthier, safer and more sustainable buildings. With that, let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details of the quarter. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief financial summary on Slide 10. Sales in the quarter were up 5% organically, led by Global Products, which is truly a reflection of the team's strong execution. Underlying momentum in this business continue to improve, as evidenced by mid-single digits growth on a 2-year stack basis. Our longer-cycle field business continue to recover, led by strong growth in services, up 8% in the quarter. Segment EBITA increased 10% versus the prior year, margin expanding 30 basis points to 15.9%. Better leverage on higher volumes, favorable mix and the incremental benefit of our SG&A actions more than offset the headwind from the reversal of temporary cost reductions and price/cost, including significant supply chain disruptions. EPS of $0.88 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 16% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $300 million, reflecting the reversal of timing benefits experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, as expected. On a full year basis, we achieved 105% free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 11. Orders for our field businesses increased 9%, led by low double-digit growth in install on strong double-digit growth in retrofit activity. We are also seeing continued strength in our service business, with orders up 7%, driven by strong growth in North America and EMEALA. Backlog grew 10% to more than $10 billion, with service backlog up 5% and install backlog up 11%. The sequential improvement was led by strong retrofit activity as new construction continues to recover from depressed level in fiscal '20, particularly in North America. Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 12. Let me touch on a few key items. Overall, operations contributed $0.09 versus the prior year, including a $0.04 benefit from our SG&A productivity program, achieving our targeted savings in fiscal '21. We are well on track to achieve our SG&A and COGS savings in fiscal '22 and beyond. Similar to last quarter, excluding the headwind from the prior year temporary actions, underlying incrementals in Q4 were approximately 30%. Corporate was a $0.03 headwind year-over-year and other items netted to a $0.06 tailwind, primarily related to lower share count, lower net financing charges and FX. Let's discuss our segment results in more details on Slide 13. My commentary will also refer to the segment end-market performance included on Slide 14. North America revenue grew 4% organically, led by strength in services, which was higher in all domain. Install revenue was up low single digits, primarily due to strong demand from shorter-cycle retrofit and upgrade projects, and positive growth in new construction. Both our internal and customer supply chain restrictions negatively impacted our North America install business. By domain, Commercial Applied HVAC revenue grew mid-single digits, while Fire & Security increased low single digits in the quarter. We had another strong quarter in Performance Infrastructure, which grew revenue low double digits, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, a good reflection on our customers' demand for decarbonization solution. Segment margin decreased 20 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, primarily due to the reversal of temporary cost from the mitigation actions in the prior year. Orders in North America were up 11% versus the prior year, with high single-digit growth in both Commercial HVAC and Fire & Security. Performance Infrastructure orders were up nearly 40%. Applied HVAC orders increased 10% overall, driven by strong retrofit activity, with another strong quarter of equipment orders up over 20% in Q4. Backlog of $6.5 billion increased 10% year-over-year. Revenue in EMEALA increased 3% organically, led by continued strength in our service business, particularly in our Applied HVAC and Industrial Refrigeration businesses. Fire & Security, which account for nearly 60% of segment revenues, grew at mid-single digits rate in Q4, with strength across our enterprise accounts and residential security businesses, including a rebound in our retail platform. Industrial Refrigeration also grew mid-single digits, while Commercial HVAC & Controls declined low single digits. By geography, revenue growth was broad-based, with strength in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by low double-digit decline in the Middle East. Segment EBITA margins declined 30 basis points, driven by a prior year gain on sales. Underlying margin performance improved as favorable mix, positive price/cost and the benefit of SG&A savings this year more than offset the temporary mitigation actions taken in the prior year. Order in EMEALA continued to accelerate, increasing 7% in the quarter, with strong mid-teens growth in Commercial HVAC and high single-digit growth in Fire & Security. APAC revenue increased 7% organically, led by low double digits growth in Commercial HVAC & Controls. EBITA margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 15.5%, driven by a favorable reserve adjustment. APAC underlying margin declined year-over-year as volume leverage and net productivity was offset by unfavorable mix and negative price/cost. APAC orders grew 4%, driven by continued strength in Commercial HVAC. Global Products revenue grew 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, with broad-based strength across the portfolio. Our Global Residential HVAC business was up 5% in the quarter. North America Resi HVAC grew 4% in the quarter, benefiting from both higher volume and pricing. Outside of North America, our Residential HVAC business grew mid-single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe and driven in part by the launch of our new Hitachi air-to-water residential heat pump, which was well received by the market. In APAC, Residential HVAC declined low single digits as a result of softer industry demand in Japan, given the COVID-related state of emergency in place for much of the quarter. We continue to gain shares in Japan, up more than 100 basis points in the quarter, as we continue to launch new premium products with indoor air quality technologies. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, our Hisense JV revenue grew over 40% year-over-year in Q4, expanding our leading position in China. Commercial HVAC product sales were up low double digits overall, led by mid-teens growth in our indirect Applied business, including strong chiller demand within the data center end market. Light Commercial grew high single digits overall, with North America unitary equipment down 2% and VRF up high single digits. Our Light Commercial business in Asia was up low double digits, including a significant win in Taiwan to supply high-efficiency ductless unit with indoor air quality technology to all schools across the country. Fire & Security products grew high single digits in aggregate, led by our access and control and video solutions business and return to pre-pandemic levels for parts of our fire suppression business. EBITA margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 18.7% as volume leverage, higher equity income and the benefit of SG&A actions more than offset the temporary cost action in the prior year and price/cost, including the significant supply chain disruptions. Turning to Slide 15. Corporate expense increased significantly year-over-year off an abnormal low level to $83 million. For modeling purposes, we have included an outlook for some of our below-the-line items in financial year '22. I will point out that amortization expense reflects the full year run rate impact of Silent-Aire as well as additional software R&D. Net financing charges returned to a more normal level as fiscal '21 benefited from significant FX gain. Noncontrolling interest reflects continued growth in our Hitachi JV. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 16. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the year with $1.3 billion in available cash and net debt at 1.8x, still below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. On cash, we generated a little over $300 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly $2 billion year-to-date and achieving our target of 105% conversion for the year. As you will recall from our guidance last quarter, we expected a reversal in some of the timing benefits we experienced earlier in the year. I am extremely pleased with our cash performance and remain confident that we will sustain 100% conversion over the next several years. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a little over 4 million shares for approximately $300 million, which for the full year, brings us to around 23 million shares or $1.3 billion. Let's turn to Slide 17 for a look at our historical Q1 seasonality. As you can see, Q1 typically represents less than 15% of our full year EPS given our normal seasonality. For Q1 of fiscal '22, we expect to be above that level, with Q1 guidance representing about 16% of our full year at the midpoint. Additionally, we expect an improving first half, second half versus historical seasonality. As we look at fiscal '22 overall, on Slide 18, we are entering the year with record backlog, and underlying markets are continuing to improve. With that said, we do expect supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment to continue, at least over the next couple of quarters. On a full year basis, we expect high single-digit organic revenue growth, with 70 to 80 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion. Although we expect to remain price/cost positive on an EPS basis,  the inflated level of pricing will result in margin headwinds of approximately 40 basis points for the year. Underlying margins are expanding to 110 to 120 basis points. Additionally, we expect another year of strong earnings growth, with adjusted EPS in the range of $3.22 to $3.32, which represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%. Turning to Slide 19. We can see that our expectations for fiscal '22 are very much in line with the growth expectations we provided at our recent Investor Day, and we are accelerating growth in each area. Last, on Slide 20, I want to reiterate that we are well on our way to our '24 targets. With that, operator, we can open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So yes, it seems -- thanks to the details on the business performance. It seems that you're outperforming in a few key areas, North America Residential would be one. It seems like the Applied performance was also better than some of the peers we've seen so far. And Performance Contracting kind of stands out as 5 quarters of now double-digit growth. So I'm just wondering if you can maybe touch on those 3 areas in a bit more depth. And the resi, I think you're still more skewed towards independent distribution. So I'd be curious if you could just maybe break out the sell-in, the sell-out performance there? George Oliver : Nigel, just for clarification. What was the first comment you made? Nigel Coe : Really, it's about -- I mean, if you could just maybe comment on North American Residential performance versus the industry, Applied, high single-digit growth and then Performance Contracting. It feels like you're outperforming your competitors. I'm just wondering if you could maybe just comment on how you feel your market shares are performing. And then just on residential,  if you could just comment on sell-in versus sell-outs in that channel. George Oliver : Sure. So if you look at North America, and let's focus on the commercial HVAC market, certainly, this is a very attractive end market. It has long secular drivers that align very well with our core. And as you know, Nigel, we've been investing nicely, reinvesting into our product, and we're -- I think, overall, we're taking share. For the year, we're going to be up about almost 200 basis points. Big focus on energy efficiency and sustainability. And that's supported with not only our industry-leading chillers, but also now with the new rooftops that we're bringing into the market, with low-GWP refrigeration that's driving increased efficiency and driving service. And then we're investing more heavily now in the next-gen air cool technologies, electrification with heat pumps and heat transfer units as well as advanced VRF technology. So as you said, we have had strong performance not only in North America, but across the globe -- across the board. That's also enabling us to be able to create a very nice installed base and get that connected, which drives to longer-term services. And all of this is being enhanced with our digital capabilities with OpenBlue. So specifically in Applied, when you look at the demand for retrofit opportunities driven by healthy buildings and return to work and school, particularly in North America, that was very strong with our controls airside and filtration. A lot of that has been driven by K-12. We also see a strong demand globally for air-cooled chillers in data centers and rental markets as well as industrial heat pumps -- and both chiller -- in our IR portfolios. And so when you look at our orders globally in Applied, it's up 11% globally. North America, when you look at purely equipment, it's up kind of mid-20s, which was very strong, and that's sequentially to a very strong quarter that we had in the third quarter. So overall, we're gaining nice share, as I said, for the year, up almost 200 basis points. Now as it relates to -- on the residential, when we talk about the residential space, we continue to perform very well. When you look at our residential business in ducted, we have a nice, nice backlog. We're up significantly in backlog, and we're continuing to perform well. We've been investing in new products here and ultimately gaining share, and we feel good about that. Now globally, when you look at the overall position that we have globally in residential, we had decent performance in our JCH business, which was up about 4%. And I think, and as we look at that business, we've been gaining share and continuing to perform with the new products that we've been able to bring to market. We -- although Japan was down 11%, we outperformed in that market. You know that, that's a big end market for us. We had strong growth in Europe, which was up about 35%. And as Olivier said, that the China, the Hisense business, the HAPQ is up over 40%. So overall, we feel good about our overall performance in residential. Olivier Leonetti : Let me comment also on Performance Infrastructure, Nigel. This is a proxy for what is happening in the market for sustainability. As we put in our opening remarks, orders for this business for the year was growing at 42%. And we are very pleased about how this business is behaving across the globe. We have created a practice now at Johnson Controls fully dedicated to sustainability. And we are very excited by what we can do for our customers on this front, Nigel. Operator : The next question will come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Would love to hear your thoughts on service attach rates sort of this year and what you think the ultimate entitlement is. 40% goes to 50%, does it go to 60%? And if you could just talk through the economics, how that bolsters the margins and the like. So what -- it looks like you're above your plan, so I'm just wondering if we have a new target out there. George Oliver : Yes. Let me start. Service has become core to everything we do. We've got an incredible base of service, over $6 billion. We've got about 55% of that recurring, and we're making a lot of progress. Certainly, not only expanding our market coverage, we've been enhancing our technology and now deploying a lot more digital content within the solutions that we provide to our customers. And we've been going after the underserved installed base. With an incredible installed base, we have a material opportunity and, we believe, a competitive advantage now with the technology that we're bringing to really create a lot of value. And it's got a very attractive margin profile, as you know, 2x the company EBITDA margin. And so that all being said, with the investments we've been making, we've been certainly -- not only as we bring new projects to the field, we're getting a lot more connectivity and getting attached PSAs while we've been going after the installed base, which, historically, we had not served. And so this year, with the work that we did, we got that attach rate up to now 40%. We're continuing to make a lot of progress with that installed base. We're committing another 300 to 400 basis point improvement in '22. And that's all tied to -- when you look at the new services that we're bringing to the market, we're bringing 20 new service products and offerings in '22 across our domains, leveraging technology and data insights. And that will enable our customers to not only reach their clean air, fire and security as well as sustainability goals. And that's going to be a big focus for us. We believe, as we laid out the guidance, that we are on track in being able to outperform the market and be able to outperform by roughly 200 to 300 basis points on a go-forward basis. Gautam Khanna : Do you have a sense for the upper limit, though, in terms of what that attach rate could get to? 40% goes to 50% goes to 60%, what do you think the upper limit is? George Oliver : Yes, we believe -- when you look at our technology and our capabilities to truly now differentiate how all of the equipment that's been installed really differentiating the performance, we have the opportunity to go after all of it. Now that all being said, there's customers that do some of their own self-maintain and the like, but we believe there's going to be an element of service that we can provide to that entire installed base. So we're going to be driving to -- we're attaching on new projects, we're getting a very high attachment. And now going back after the installed base with these service offerings, which are huge value creators, that we have an ability to be able to go after all of that, and we expect it to get to 70%, 80% here over the next few years. Olivier Leonetti : The attach rate on new products is indeed very high and very much representative of the quote that George has mentioned, 70%, 80% attached. Operator : The next question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So first question on supply chain. George, any revenue or orders, for that matter, that got pushed out as a function of what's going on in the market? And then on the kind of bottlenecks that you guys see, does field labor become an issue as we go through '22? George Oliver : Yes. Let me start with the first question there. When you look at what we've done here in the last year, given all of the volatility, I would say that our team is operating at top quartile, that we have been able to navigate and be able to stay ahead of the disruption. We've been working closely with our suppliers. We're working closely with our customers. And ultimately, we've been able to deliver on our commitments. And so we're going to stay proactive. We're going to continue to work it. With that all being said, we do believe that, in the quarter, that there was probably an impact of about 1% to 2% on top line as a result of the shortages that hindered our ability to be able to convert all that we could have. But the team, overall, has done a great job working with our suppliers to be able to mitigate the impact and ultimately secure the critical materials. Now as it relates to labor, because of our growth rates and the like, we have had a program management team globally to make sure that we're positioning ourselves to get all of the critical talent that's going to be required to support the growth strategies that we laid out during the Investor Day, which we feel very good about. And so we have been able to stay ahead of the curve in being able to bring on, whether it be the skilled technicians, the technical capability that we need to support OpenBlue, all of the different capabilities to be able to produce. Now with some of the demand, we have been -- we talked a little bit about the accelerated demand in unitary residential and as well as rooftops, we've had -- we've been stretched with capacity. That being said, we have been bringing on new capacity. We just brought on some additional capacity here in the last month, which will help improve our abilities there. But overall, I feel very good, given the volatility and our ability to be able to attract and retain the talent we need, and ultimately work with our suppliers and work with our customers and try to mitigate the impact that we're seeing, both in orders as well as our ability to fulfill because of shortages. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Appreciate that, George. Just a quick follow-up for Olivier. Can you spike out what price and costs are individually in '22? Olivier Leonetti : So in '22, the inflation we are planning to have is about 3% to 4%. So for '21, it was about 2%.  The exit rate in '21 was a bit higher, 2% to 3%, but for the full year of '22, 3% to 4%. To answer to your question on price/cost equation, we have now -- we have a great pricing practice at Johnson Controls. I can go into the details if you have another question on this. But we have been, in Q4, price/cost positive, including excess logistics cost in the equation. We have been price/cost positive in the second half, and we are planning to be price/cost positive in '22 as well, including in Q1, Josh. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : George, do you mind talking a little bit about this Accenture and Alibaba deal. What exactly are you doing for them? What's the scope? And can it widen out beyond China? Is this some sort of kind of experimental kind of test and if it goes well, you move on? Or I'll just leave it at that and let you address it. George Oliver : Yes, Scott. So we talked a lot about this at our Investor Day. When you look at what we're doing with OpenBlue and the technology and the domain and expertise that we bring to buildings and infrastructure, how do we build out our ecosystem. So now when you look at a holistic solution, we have the right technology partners and we have the right go-to-market partners. And so as we've been doing that, we've been working closely with Accenture relative to their capabilities and how we go to market and ultimately driving a full holistic solution around sustainability, and then working locally with Alibaba and working with Daniel Zhang relative to getting the technology required to be fully successful within the China market and being able to serve those customers with our full holistic solutions. So we believe the market opportunity, Scott, is multibillions with what we're going after. It ties to our -- it really ties to our ability to drive decarbonization. And obviously, with that, more healthy buildings and ultimately connected buildings that drive different outcomes within the infrastructure that we built. And so we're very excited with the partnership and, I think, as we deploy our holistic solutions, critical partners in being able to execute. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. The labor availability issue, has that been much of an issue for you on the install side, George? Is that a risk in '22 increasing? Or is it decreasing risk? George Oliver : And so like I said in one of the previous questions, I think we've done really well, Scott, and our ability, I think, with the continued performance of the company, with the exciting strategy that we have in going after these growth vectors and then our ability to be able to really attract the talent that we think is critical to being able to be able to be successful. And so we've had typical challenges here or there. But overall, I've been very impressed with the ability to be able to attract. And we also use, in the install business, to your question on install, we do use contractors or subcontract labor. And we made sure that every step of the way, as contingency, we've got the right labor in place, whether it be our direct labor or through our contracted labor. And so I would tell you that, obviously, this was a, let's say, a risk factor that we saw early, and we've been managing it really well and positioning to be able to continue to deliver on the commitments we've made. Olivier Leonetti : An additional point, Scott, our productivity program now, which is ramping and which would impact COGS this year, is also based upon increasing the productivity of our field operation, including the productivity of our engineers. So that program is coming also handy at this point in time and is helping us also to manage those labor availability challenges you have mentioned. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Two from me, if I might. First, just back to service. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about the, I guess, the phrase I use is calorie count. Not only is the attachment going up, right, but a clear focus here is to add additional services and the like. I just wondered, to what degree that is showing up and what you're putting in your backlog? And what that might portend as we look forward another year or 2? George Oliver : Yes. So when you look at -- like I said, this has become a central focus for the entire organization, recognizing that all of the investments we make in products as well as now with OpenBlue, the translation of that, Jeff, is into a solution, into a recurring revenue that ultimately creates more value for our customers and, certainly, we get the return to our service margin rates. And so when you look -- the traditional service business, obviously, that's come back nicely post pandemic. Well, the accelerator now is what we're doing with digital, the new OpenBlue offerings. That all is helping us increase attach rates, and then not only attach rates, but now additional services, taking the intelligence, applying AI and ultimately now delivering these new service offerings. As I said, through 2021, we delivered 15 new service offerings. A lot of those were tied to healthy buildings, sustainability, all of our key growth vectors, and we've been able to build a tremendous pipeline of opportunity that we're now beginning to convert. When you look at service orders, we're up 7% above the 2019 levels, and we see that continuing with that momentum. Because not only is it -- we're getting the core business is coming back, and we're going to continue to maintain that with the traditional service business that we perform. More important now is the conversion of all of the new services on top of that, that has become the accelerator. And so we believe that we're positioned here well to continue to build backlog, to get more of it recurring and, ultimately, with the value that we create, continued very strong margins on that service going forward. Jeffrey Sprague : And then I'll take Olivier upon his offer to just elaborate a little bit more on price. It does look like, on a price/cost basis, you are doing a bit better than some of your peers. I just wonder if you could unpack a little bit kind of equipment price versus service price, how you got ahead of the curve. And is one side or the other of that house service versus equipment really driving the equation? And I'll leave it there. Olivier Leonetti : Jeff, I'm going to answer to both because, really, the model we have today cover both. So you mentioned that we have executed very well in terms of price/cost. And price/cost is actually one of the, of course, foundation of our operating model. Let me mention a few levers we are using today. One, we have priced projects through last year, anticipating some level of inflations. That's point number one. Point number two, we had modified about 2 years ago our contract agreement to allow us to adjust pricing. For number three, we have identified now, because of our business intelligence, part of the market which are less sensitive to price. Point number four, and George mentioned that today, our offering now provide great value to our customers : decarb, sustainability, indoor air quality. And we offer great ROI for our customers and then price to value. Our backlog is now also shorter, so we can adjust pricing faster. On materials, for a large part of our whole materials today, we have ESG program covering costs for about 6 months. And last but not least, across the enterprise at Johnson Controls, our workforce is incentivized to drive pricing, pricing rate. So as a result to all of this, you end up with the results we have been posting, Jeff. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Patrick Baumann : This is Pat on for us, Steve. A quick question just on the organic growth path for the year, starting off at mid-single digits in the first quarter and then accelerating to 7% to 9% for the year. Can you talk about the levers there? Just trying to understand the visibility of that. Is it supply chain relief? Is it a ramp in pricing or something else? Just want some color on that, that would be helpful. Olivier Leonetti : Right. So in the growth, we have mentioned high single-digit organic growth, pricing is about 3% to 4% in that number. If I decompose the growth by vectors, services is expected to grow 6% to 7%. We mentioned why that is, at length, to some of the questions we had earlier. In terms of install -- install, it's a very strong business, particularly at the back of retrofit. This is a business we expect to see growing at about 6% to 8%. And Global Products, we expect this business to grow in the low teens. It's a strong vector growth for Johnson Controls. Our team is doing great work launching new products. The new products we're going to launch next year is accelerating. We mentioned more than 175. We launched about 150 this year. And the large proportion of those products, a large proportion use heat pump as a key technology. So we believe, today, we have many vectors to grow the enterprise, leveraging also the secular trends impacting this industry : decarbonization, indoor air quality, digitalization of the building space. And we are very excited about what we have in front of us and also what we're building at Johnson Controls, Steve (sic) [ Pat ]. Patrick Baumann : I think -- I appreciate the color. What -- I guess what I was really asking is, so first quarter, you're guiding up mid-single digits. The year, you're guiding up 7% to 9%. What drives the ramp from mid-single digits in the first quarter, specifically, to kind of that high single for the year? So you expect growth to ramp through the year? Olivier Leonetti : Yes, we do. The vector of growth are going to deliver more sustainability, would drive more of the growth. Service will drive more of the growth. So you see the acceleration of the various work vectors being at play across the year. George Oliver : And I'm sure there's still -- and I would say, there's still a little bit of pressure that we -- similar to what we saw in fourth quarter relative to our ability to convert, but again, it's minimal. Patrick Baumann : Understood. And then my follow-up is on the -- there's been a lot going on in the portfolio over the last couple of years. So hard to get a read on normal seasonality, but you mentioned it in the slide. So you said first quarter is typically 15%. What do you consider to be normal seasonality for second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter? If we'd get some color on that, that would be helpful in modeling. And I guess, we should assume second quarter is above normal, just like first quarter is, given your first half, second half comments. Olivier Leonetti : So it's a very precise question. Typically, the first half as Johnson Controls has represented about 30% of the total year. We believe we'll be in the mid-30s in the first half, considering, by the way, the supply chain constraints we are seeing today or it's factored in that statistic. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to touch on incremental margins and sort of operating leverage. So it looks like you're dialing in maybe a mid-20s rate for the year, closer to 20% incrementals for the first quarter. Is the key headwind sort of, for the year, just all about price/cost? Anything else to call out? And maybe help us understand how you see that 40 bps price/cost margin headwind sort of phasing through the year. Olivier Leonetti : So you're right, the incremental in the P&L are in the range of mid-20s, so 25%. Adjusted for price/cost, it would be in the 35% range, meaning we are aligned to what we had communicated to you. Our productivity program is intact. We expect to save about -- have a net saving of about $230 million this year, which will flow to the bottom line. And in addition to that, we'll have a 30 basis points improvement in margin. If you look at the phasing, the 40 basis point impact in margin for the year is going to be a bit higher in Q1, slightly higher. And I want to emphasize again, this is important, price/cost, positive in dollar, negative in rate, including also extra freight cost, for example, Julian. Julian Mitchell : And then just secondly, maybe switching to the revenue line. Maybe just fill out in a bit more detail the assumptions for organic growth this year. What's underpinning the sort of Fire & Security assumptions versus, say, Commercial HVAC in terms of applied and unitary? That would be helpful, just what you're dialing into that 7% to 9% for those main pieces. Olivier Leonetti : So the Commercial HVAC will grow slightly faster than Fire & Security. Fire & Security is going to grow well as well, that's what I anticipate. The reason for this is that Fire & Security, this portfolio is totally part of our digital offering in the context of a smart building solution. So those 2 businesses are going to grow. And you know that as well, Julian, Fire & Security has a very attractive margin profile. And more and more of those devices are actually sensors in the building, allowing us to develop digital twins and the like. George Oliver : And Julian, I think it's important to note that on the short-cycle Fire & Security business, it's coming back very nicely. We saw our products business up 9%. We've got great backlogs there. So that's continuing. The field-based business has been a little bit slower on the recovery because they don't -- we don't have the focus on clean air and all of the work we did with our HVAC and a lot of the focus on short term on sustainability. But we see some nice trends here. So through the course of the year, we'll continue to accelerate, but it will be short of where we -- what we see Commercial HVAC to be for the year. Operator : The next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I just like to follow up on Julian's first question and just make sure I understood Olivier's answer. So on the -- the question is the clarification on underlying margins, EBITDA being 70% to 80% up in fiscal 2022. The cost takeout program, that net of $230 million, that should contribute 90 basis points, if I got the math right. So does that imply the underlying margins are worse? Or is this just an element of conservativeness at the beginning of the year? Olivier Leonetti : So you're right. If you factor the impact of the COGS and productivity program is close to 1 point. You will have to factor also Silent-Aire in the equation, which is dilutive in rate. But we see today, net of the price/cost, I've mentioned the 40 basis points, if you do the math, you end up with a margin expansion higher than 100 basis points, 110 to 120. And as I indicated, our margin profile is improving because of the value of our offering, and our productivity program is well on track. Deane Dray : All right. That's really helpful. I'm glad you pointed that out. And then second question, George, can you talk about the outcome or performance-based contract growth assumption for 2022? We've seen this ramp pretty impressively from -- I think it was 2% in 2020, 15% at one point in '21. What's the assumption for '22? George Oliver : Yes. So as we look at this business, we have a lot of conversion coming from what would have been a conventional business to now incorporating that business into solutions, differentiated solutions. And so as we look at, for instance, the partnership we have with Apollo, and this is a focus on decarbonization and sustainability. We've got a pipeline that we're working that's over $1 billion in how we're going to convert. And now some of this depends on the timing of conversion of orders. But we're making tremendous progress right now working a number of these and working to convert a number of these. So it's hard to say exactly what's going to ultimately come through Performance Contracting and then what we would still gain -- if it were not to be the full solution, what we would gain in our traditional HVAC businesses. But Deane, this is going to be -- when you look at our vectors of growth, decarbonization and sustainability, healthy buildings and then, ultimately, smart buildings, a lot of our go-to-market would be -- we actually deliver an outcome solution. A lot of that will be done long term with -- under Performance Contracting. So we've got a leadership position today with our Performance Contracting business that ultimately has been focused on energy savings. We've expanded that. And now with our go-to-market, we have, I believe, tremendous potential here over the next few years to make this much more significant within the portfolio. But I feel really good about it, and it's going to continue to grow. Olivier Leonetti : The pipeline statistic -- Deane, the pipeline statistic we mentioned, this part of the pipeline at Johnson Controls is the one growing the fastest by margin. Operator : The next question is from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Just a capital allocation question. Obviously, you provided a lot of color on the framework at Investor Day. But for 2022, can you first comment on the M&A pipeline strength, whether you're seeing some HVAC consolidation opportunities or other growth opportunities that are interesting? And then excluding any potential M&A, is sort of the default assumption in guidance that substantially all free cash flow is returned to shareholders? Olivier Leonetti : So we -- if you look at the free cash flow, so we said that in our prepared remarks, we are very convinced that we are 100%-plus free cash flow conversion company. We had a great performance in '21. Because of this strong free cash flow, we're going to do 2 things : one, grow dividend aligned with earnings; and two, deploy $1.4 billion of buyback in '22, more or less equally distributed among the 4 quarters. On top of that, we believe, as we have said during Investor Day, we will add 1 to 2 points of revenue growth through M&A while staying into our leverage guide of 2% to 2.5%, M&A being focused on services, digital decarbonization mainly. And the pipeline is growing nicely. We have a new team today leading this particular part at Johnson Controls, and we are very pleased with the progress we are making in growing the pipeline. Noah Kaye : Perfect, Olivier. And then just as a follow-up on that. With the Silent-Aire acquisition, clearly, you signaled you're able to do more [ sort ] of that size. Can you just comment on whether or not that pipeline is accelerating in terms of flow of inbound inquiries? Should that 1 to 2 points that you expect this year, do you view that as sustainable over a multiyear period? George Oliver : Yes. So let me take that. Certainly, this was directly aligned, this acquisition, with our overall capital allocation, M&A strategies, right down the middle, a nice bolt-on. And overall, we're extremely pleased with the progress we're making. This is just a phenomenal opportunity here going forward. The data center market is a $16 billion market. We have 5% share, and we have the opportunity to now leverage our entire footprint now to take advantage in a much bigger way of the global market. And so we see that growth to be very strong going forward. We're continuing to build the pipeline. We're expanding the customer base that we're beginning engagements with and how we innovate and serve their data center needs going forward. And so on a go-forward basis, it's going to be one of the significant growth contributors to the company. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to George Oliver for closing remarks. George Oliver : Yes. Let me wrap up the call here today. I want to thank everyone, again, for joining our call this morning. As we discussed here this morning, we had a very strong finish to the fiscal year. And certainly, the underlying momentum that we're seeing in our businesses is extremely encouraging. As we enter fiscal 2022, I think it's important to note that the growth accelerators are ramping and are well on our way to achieving our fiscal year '24 targets that we laid out back in September. And we all look forward to continuing our discussion, speaking with many of you soon during the conferences. So on that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer. Antonella Franzen : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls\u2019 first quarter fiscal 2022 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver and our Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we have included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted earnings per share, EBITA and EBIT exclude restructuring as well as other special items. These metrics, together with organic sales and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis. Now, let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Antonella and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u2019s get started on Slide 3. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2022 with solid Q1 results as our teams across the world continue to demonstrate best-in-class execution, delivering both strong financial performance for the enterprise and smart innovative solutions our customers demand to ensure safe, healthy and sustainable spaces. Our service activity in the quarter accelerated from both an orders and revenue perspective and we are making great strides across all of our vectors of growth, decarbonization, healthy buildings and smart buildings. I am incredibly proud of how the team is operating in what still remains an incredibly challenging environment as we continue to face headwinds from supply chain and labor constraints in various dislocations caused by the latest variant of COVID-19. As the recovery in our end markets expands, I have been continuously encouraged by the underlying demand trends we are witnessing as evidenced by high single-digit order and revenue growth this quarter. In the $10.5 billion backlog we have built, which increased 10% on a year-over-year basis. What has been equally as encouraging is the drivers of this demand have been the retrofit replacement of equipment and service offerings required to achieve higher indoor air quality, cost reduction and energy efficiency goals, which perfectly aligns with our portfolio of end-to-end digital solutions and services. We continued to advance our initiatives to accelerate growth and transform our service business. Q1 was another quarter of solid revenue and order growth and we continue to drive our attachment rate higher with a multifaceted approach, including a number of digitally-enabled solutions. Additionally, there are significant actions underway across the organization to optimize the efficiency of our cost structure and we remain on track to deliver $230 million in productivity savings this year. We had another quarter of strong free cash flow performance. As Olivier will share with you later, this has allowed us to continue to fund organic reinvestment in our business as well as share repurchase in M&A activity, all three of which remain top priorities. Over the next several slides, I will update you on some of the strategic growth vectors we continue to highlight and all of these are supported by the global mega trends that will drive demand within the building sector for the next decade plus. As we have said in the past, we truly believe we are among the best-in-class when it comes to the ability to deliver fully integrated solutions designed to address the challenges associated with these trends. Based on our performance in Q1 and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance for the year. Please turn to Slide 4. During the quarter, we were honored to be recognized for our leadership in sustainability and ESG as well as our innovations in smart building platforms. We received our eighth consecutive ranking in the Corporate Knights Global 100 most sustainable corporations in the world. We were recognized by Sustainalytics for managing material ESG issues and we are 1 of 45 companies globally to receive his Royal Highness The Prince of Wales inaugural Terra Carta Seal. In terms of smart buildings, I was humbled to receive on behalf of the company, the IoT Company\u2019s CEO of the Year Award from IoT Breakthrough. This award is a reflection of the work of our entire digital and OpenBlue teams, engineering, development, sales, service and marketing. Lastly, we were also recognized by Verdantix for having the most prominent IoT platform for smart buildings in 2022, having achieved market-leading scores in several key categories. Please turn to Slide 5. Our service business continues to perform well. We are seeing good traction on our initiatives to accelerate growth and increased recurring revenues. We are also seeing encouraging trends in the adoption of our OpenBlue digital service offerings. Overall, service revenues in the quarter were up 5%, with broad-based growth across all regions. Orders were up 7%, led by low double-digit growth in North America, with strength across our applied commercial HVAC and Fire & Security platforms. We expect a 400 to 500 basis point improvement in our attach rate for the full year and ended Q1 at approximately 41%. Turning to Slide 6, it goes without saying that sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. There are tremendous efforts underway in all parts of the world to decarbonize and it has become very clear that buildings play a pivotal role in these efforts. We were pleased to see the recent announcement from the Biden administration forming a new National Building Performance Standards Coalition consisting of more than 30 state and local governments across the U.S., incentivizing the development of healthier, lower carbon emitting buildings. Building performance standards are among the core policy initiatives we have flagged as primary demand drivers for decarbonization and achieving net zero. This major announcement by the White House is the latest in a number of regulatory actions taken by the local and national governments globally in support of decarbonizing economies and more specifically in support of accelerating progress towards net zero buildings. These standards will mandate stringent carbon reduction requirements for new and existing buildings in the U.S., including financial penalties for non-compliance. The official adoption of these standards would represent an important step towards the formation of the $240 billion decarbonization industry we expect through 2035. Moving to Slide 7, we recently launched our latest offering under the OpenBlue Healthy Buildings portfolio, indoor air quality as-a-service. This is the industry\u2019s first dedicated as-a-service model for delivering indoor air quality. This offering allows us to combine our traditional holistic approach to delivering healthy indoor environments with innovative financing models that eliminate the need for our customers to commit capital upfront, lowering the risk and time to implement.

We view edge intelligence as a critical technology for the future of smart autonomous buildings and for Johnson Controls. FogHorn gives us and our OpenBlue platform an immediate competitive advantage in edge AI with a software platform that is widely recognized as best-in-class. It avoids the time and cost to build out these capabilities organically. Please turn to Slide 9. Among the notable wins for these themes in Q1, we have a few examples across regions all centered around sustainability. In North America, we are partnering with the University of Windsor on their 2030 carbon reduction plan as well as their 2050 carbon neutrality objectives. We will be installing a uniquely configured chiller on our AI-enabled OpenBlue connected chiller platform, which will ensure optimal chiller performance and enable digital service. We are excited to be partnering with Aldar Properties, a prominent developer in the UAE as they begin a digital transformation to achieve their sustainability commitments. We were awarded an energy performance contract to improve the energy efficiency across Aldar\u2019s network of schools in Abu Dhabi. In addition to replacing the HVAC equipment, in other energy-consuming assets, we will also be deploying our OpenBlue Net Zero Buildings portfolio of digital solutions. In China, we were selected to upgrade an existing customers Metasys building automation system and control system and integrate OpenBlue on-prem to leverage key AI capabilities that will optimize the chiller performance to reduce energy consumption. This includes a long-term service agreement leveraging our digital capabilities. These are great examples of the power and breadth of our portfolio, where we deliver tailored, sustainable outcomes for our customers while expanding our installed base and driving attractive recurring service growth. To wrap up my prepared remarks, I remain extremely excited about the continued advancements we have made relative to our key growth vectors and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the way our teams are executing in such a difficult environment. We remain laser-focused on our strategic commitments into delivering the outcomes our customers need on the path to a healthy and more sustainable future. With that, I am going to turn the call over to Olivier to walk you through the financial details in the quarter and update you on our outlook for Q2 and for the full year. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George and good morning everyone. Let me start with the summary on Slide 10. Sales in the quarter were up 8% organically above our original guidance for mid single-digit growth and led by strong outperformance across the global product portfolio. Our longer cycle field businesses also performed well, up 6% with solid growth in both service and install. Price contributed to about 4.5 points of our total organic growth, about 1 point above our expectation. Segment EBITDA increased 13% versus the prior year, with margins expanding 30 basis points to 12.3%, including a 100 basis point margin headwinds from price/cost and significant operational inefficiencies related to ongoing supply chain disruptions and worsening labor constraints. This was more than offset by strong leverage on higher volumes and the incremental benefit of our COGS and SG&A actions. Just to comment on the impact of the operational efficiencies. As I mentioned, we were able to yield 4.5 points of price. Beyond raw materials, inflation on most other items, freight, logistics, labor and components increased further and absorbed the benefit of the increased pricing. Additionally, ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages impacted our field operations, where we were dealing with not only our own disruptions, but those of our customers as well. Versus our guidance for Q1, this was an incremental headwind of 40 basis points. Overall, our underlying margin performance in the quarter was very strong. EPS of $0.54 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 26% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. Free cash flow in the quarter was over $250 million, primarily the result of a continued focus on working capital management. Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 11. Overall operations contributed $0.10 versus the prior year, including a $0.06 benefit from our COGS and SG&A productivity programs. Underlying segment earnings were a net $0.04 tailwind year-over-year, which we view as a significant achievement in the current environment. Excluding the headwinds from price cost, underlying incremental in Q1 were approximately 40%. Please turn to Slide 12. Orders for our field businesses increased 8% in aggregate, with fairly balanced growth between service and installed activity. Growth in service orders is being led by a double-digit increase in our short-term transactional business, but also a mid single-digit increase in our contractual recurring revenue base. Installed demand continues to rebound primarily driven by a low double-digit increase in retrofit activity globally, including mid-teens growth in North America. Backlog grew 10% to nearly $10.5 billion, with service backlog up 4% and installed backlog up 11%. The year-over-year increase was led by higher retrofit activity in North America and EMEA and new construction activity in APAC. Let\u2019s discuss our segment results in more detail on Slide 13. My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 14. Sales in North America were up 5% organically, led by 7% growth in service. Installed sales increased 4%. Similar to last quarter, supply chain disruptions and material availability negatively impacted revenue conversion in our North America business. Commercial applied HVAC revenue grew low double-digits, including low double-digit growth both in equipment and service. Fire & Security increased mid single-digits in the quarter. Performance Infrastructure declined high single-digits given the tough prior year comparison of plus 20%. Looking at the 2-year stack for Performance Infrastructure we are up double-digits with an exciting pipeline of opportunities ahead. Segment margin decreased 90 basis points year-over-year to 11.6%, including an 80 basis point impact from lower absorption given the operational inefficiencies related to material and labor availability. We are also intentionally maintaining a higher level of sales investments given our order activity is up more than double our revenue growth in the quarter. The combination of these factors will remain a headwind in the second quarter and significantly improved from there. Orders in North America were up 11% versus the prior year, with high-teens growth in commercial applied, including a significant increase in HVAC equipment orders driven by very strong demand in the datacenter and healthcare verticals. Fire & Security orders were up low-teens, with strength in both install and service. Backlog of $6.5 billion increased 12% year-over-year. EMEALA revenue increased 3%, led by continued strength in the Fire & Security business, which grew at mid single-digits rate in Q1. This was primarily driven by a sharp rebound in our retail platform and modest growth in our core offerings due to the material availability constraints. Industry Refrigeration grew low single digits, while commercial HVAC and Controls was relatively flat. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points underlying margin performance improved as positive price/cost and the benefit of SG&A, COGS savings more than offset the modest mix headwind. Orders in EMEALA were up 3% in the quarter with high single-digit growth in Fire & Security and low single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC. Backlog ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, up 12%. Sales in Asia-Pacific increased 12% organically led by mid-teens growth in Commercial HVAC and Controls. China continued to outperform with revenue up nearly 30%. EBITDA margin declined 260 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%, driven by headwinds from price costs as well as unfavorable business and geographic mix. We do believe Q1 represents peak margin pressure for APAC, and we would expect margins to significantly improve as we \u2013 as the year progresses. APAC orders were up 5% with continued strength in commercial HVAC driven by a strong rebound within the industrial vertical in China as well as the benefit of a large infrastructure development project currently underway in Japan, which will include a significant deployment of OpenBlue and digitally-enabled services. Backlog of $1.8 billion was up 2% year-over-year. Global product sales increased 14% organically in the quarter, with broad-based strength across the portfolio led by mid-teens growth across our HVAC equipment platforms. Global residential HVAC sales were up 11% overall in Q1. North America HVAC grew 17% in the quarter benefiting from both high growth in our product business and strong price realization. We have been very successful in ramping production of our new facility in Mexico. So far we had about 30% capacity and still on track for full run rate later in the year. In Rest of the World, resi HVAC grew high single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe as the adoption of our new Hitachi air-to-water residential heat pump launched last quarter, continues to improve. In APAC, resi HVAC was relatively flat as a result of softer industry domain in Japan, related to more mild weather, offset by strong growth in Taiwan and India. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, sales in our Hisense JV were up low teens year-over-year in Q1 as we continue to expand our distribution footprint in China. Commercial HVAC product sales were up high teens in aggregate with similar levels of growth in both applied and light commercial. Strength in Applied was driven by increased demand within the data center end markets for our air cool chillers and evaporative cooling solutions as well as our industrial refrigeration platforms. Strength in Light commercial was driven by strong performance at Hitachi which was up over 50% as well as mid-teens growth in North America unitary equipment and high single-digit growth in VRF. Fire & Security products grew low double-digit in aggregate, led by a continued recovery in our commercial science suppression business and mid-teens growth in access control and video solutions. EBITA margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year to 14.5% as volume leverage, higher equity income and the benefit of productivity actions more than offset headwinds from price/cost. Turning to Slide 15, corporate expense was up slightly year-over-year year to $70 million. For modeling purposes, we have included some of our below-the-line items for FY \u201822. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 16, our balance sheet remains in great shape with no major changes to highlight in the quarter. We ended up Q1 with $1.2 billion in available cash and net debt at 1.9x, one tick higher versus year-end but still below our target range of 2x to 2.5x. On cash, we generated a little over $250 million in free cash flow in the quarter down year-over-year due to the absence of prior year tax credits and other COVID-related benefits as well as nearly a 50% increase in CapEx spend year-over-year. We had another quarter of strong trade working capital management, down 140 basis points as a percentage of sales. With a continued focus on working capital, we remain confident that we will sustain 100% conversion over the next several years. From a capital allocation standpoint, we are executing our game plan. We repurchased approximately 7 million shares for just over $500 million, deploying roughly $100 million towards bolt-on acquisitions and increased our quarterly cash dividend payment by 26%. Before we get into guidance, I want to comment on two reporting changes that occurred in the first quarter. First, effective at the start of the fiscal year, our Marine business, which was previously split across Asia Pacific and Global Products EMEALA is now managed and reported under our EMEALA segment. Historical segment results have been recast for comparability. Second, as part of the ongoing transformation of our service business, beginning with first quarter results, we are aligning the way we report revenue associated with certain types of retrofit activity we performed in EMEALA and APAC field businesses as they have evolved to be more aligned with similar offering in North America. From a management perspective, this provides better visibility to our initiatives aimed at accelerating our higher-margin recurring revenue base. The changes are being made on a prospective basis. To help with comparisons going forward, we have included recasted segment results and a table with pro forma service revenue for FY \u201821 in the appendix. Now let me get into guidance on Slide 17. As George mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.22 to $3.32, which represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%. Given the continued inflationary environment, we are increasing our organic revenue growth assumptions to a range of 8% to 10%, mainly driven by our increased price expectation. An additional point of price on the top line we create an incremental margin headwind of approximately 20 basis points. We continue to expect price/cost will remain positive on an EPS basis. However, the inflated level of pricing will bring our full year price cost margin headwind to approximately 60 basis points. Therefore, we now expect 50 to 60 basis points of segment EBITDA margin expansion for the year. There was no change to underlying margin expansion of 110 to 120 basis points. Let me specifically point out that there was no change to our expectation for segment EBITDA dollars. Additionally, the strengthening U.S. dollar has created an EPS headwind in of $0.03 since we first provided guidance back in November, and we are absorbing this incremental headwind with our reaffirmed adjusted EPS guidance range. Turning to the second quarter, we expect continued strong performance with high single-digit organic revenue growth, improved segment EBITDA margin expansion and adjusted EPS of $0.62 to $0.64, which represents a year-over-year increase of 19% to 23%. Let me give back the call to George for some additional comments. George Oliver : Before we move on to the Q&A portion of the call, I wanted to announce a quick update to my leadership team. This will be Antonella\u2019s final earnings call, and she will be pursuing a new role outside of Johnson Controls. Antonella has been one of my constants, really, since I first joined back Tyco back in 2006. She has been an invaluable resource to me personally, and I\u2019m sure she has been to many of you for more than a decade. She has been a fantastic leader, a trusted adviser and a friend. And so now, I can\u2019t thank you enough for all that you have done for me for the Johnson Controls team and for the company. I couldn\u2019t be more happy for you. I know I speak for all of us when I say we wish you all the best and we look forward to hearing more about your success in your new role. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Antonella, good luck and sorry to see you go. So it looks like there seems to be more supply chain-related pressure in the field, particularly in North America versus your Global Products business, which is performing well. So could you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the field? And then it seems like you\u2019re assuming incremental margin actually get slightly better in fiscal Q2 versus Q1. Is that a reflection that field conditions are at least not getting worse in Q2 and maybe getting a little better? Olivier Leonetti : Andy, thank you for your question. So you\u2019re right, the environment is still challenging. We \u2013 and this challenge is impacting availability of parts, availability of labor. And obviously, we are facing a high level of inflation. And the impact on our field business is in two aspects. One, first of all, our operation is impacted, but also the one of our customers. And as a result, we mentioned that in our prepared remarks, we had price/cost negative about $15 million in Q1 and a headwind also due to the disruption of our field business of about 18 million. So the sum of the two is a margin headwind of about 100 basis points. Now something I want to say is that despite this environment, we have been able to deliver the profit dollar we had committed to you. And actually, from an EPS standpoint, we are at the top end of our range. A few reasons for that : one, pricing, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have included 4.5 points of price in Q1; second, we are facing strong demand and the value proposition of Johnson Control is really resonating with our customers; third, we have also been very disciplined regarding the management of our P&L from a COGS and SG&A standpoint. As a result, you saw the bottom line we have mentioned. So we believe that the headwinds are going to start to be better as we go through the year. We\u2019re going to have a headwind in Q2 about 80 basis points. And for the rest of the year, as we revenue orders which were booked at a much higher margin and we have strong visibility of this in the second half we will expect to have a tailwind regarding the margin performance of our business. Andy Kaplowitz : Olivier, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, George, I think you raised your attachment rate expectations slightly to 400 to 500 basis points. I think you were talking about 300 to 400. It isn\u2019t a huge change, but is the change in reflection of JCI continue to penetrate the market faster through OpenBlue in your digital offerings? And then does the higher rate of penetration mean you might be able to outperform your markets but more than that 200 to 300 basis points that you\u2019ve talked about? George Oliver : Yes, Andy, what I\u2019d say is service is a significant area of focus in our key growth accelerator. In addition to the traditional service business, digital now, the new OpenBlue offerings that has really helped us to increase our attach rates. And then not only would that attachment, be able to now launch a lot of new digital offerings that then enables us to be able to get more revenue per customer and ultimately deliver different outcomes. And so as a result, you saw our service orders were up 7% in the first quarter. That was led by double-digit growth in North America, although we did see growth across all regions and domains. And we\u2019re also seeing our L&M business come back with more access to our customers. And so when we look on a go-forward basis relative to your question on attach, we do expect our service orders to continue to grow. And so when you look at the attach rate, it is built on the digitization of our services. We\u2019re planning to launch 20 new service products and offerings in \u201822, and this is where we\u2019re taking our OpenBlue capabilities and actually delivering an indoor air quality level or clean air delivery rate or sustainability solutions, the energy reduction solutions, all of the above on top of what our attach and our core business would be. And so we\u2019re very excited about the progress we\u2019ve made and more important now with the pipeline that we have on these new service offerings that gives us the opportunity to not only attach more. But with that, would connect more, attach more and then ultimately deliver additional services on top of that connectivity. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys. George Oliver : Thank you, Andy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Antonella, congrats. I look forward to hearing what it\u2019s all about very soon. I appreciate all the help over the years. Two questions from me. First, just picking up on the last one, George, can you give us any indication yet of how revenue per user is changing. I mean we\u2019re kind of early days on this OpenBlue journey, but I wonder if there is kind of a measurable and quantifiable change in revenue per user that you could share with us? And then secondly, kind of tied to the service question, when you look at the strength now of these installed orders and the growth of the installed backlog, do you, in fact, see kind of higher-than-normal attachment and service tail on that installed work than you did previously? Maybe a little bit of color there would be interesting? Appreciate it. Thanks. George Oliver : Yes. So let me start by just giving you the framework for service and the work that we\u2019ve been doing over the last 18 months and more important, how that\u2019s playing out this year. We\u2019ve got about a $6 billion service business, about 60% of is recurring today and obviously, very proud of the progress we\u2019ve made. And it is the focus of our growth vectors. And so when you look at the installed base that we have, historically, it\u2019s been underserved and much of that was served with mechanical services, Jeff. And so what we\u2019ve been doing is over the last really 18 months is getting everything really going after that installed base to get it connected so that we can then attach so we can take existing mechanical PSA and/or new PSAs and attach with that connectivity. And then with that connectivity, be able to now begin to deploy some of the new services, whether it be connected chiller services and focusing on uptime of the chiller or a reduced energy of the chiller or indoor air quality solutions. We\u2019ve got an array of solutions that we\u2019ve now launched that with OpenBlue gives us the opportunity to tail into our air quality solutions for the verticals that we support. So, all of that has been going on. When you look at the current, our projection is that we will grow our service business 200 or 300 basis points above the market. And to your \u2013 specifically to your point, it\u2019s all been about operationalizing service. So we\u2019ve got a huge installed base, get it connected. And then attach when we\u2019re going after either renewing our existing PSAs and/or generating new PSAs we then get an attached connected PSA and then it\u2019s ultimately selling more. And we\u2019ve already launched 12 digital offerings. We\u2019ve got a pipeline of \u2013 it\u2019s probably $300 million or $400 million of opportunity that we have to go back into that installed base and be able to bring these services to them. And so when you ask about what is the connectivity, we\u2019re at a very low level today based on \u2013 we have our security business, which 100% is attached. But when you look at the other businesses, we have a much lower percentage. When I say connected and with an attached PSA \u2013 and so we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re working through that to forecast what that\u2019s going to mean not only through the year, but throughout years and what we can achieve purely with what\u2019s connected that then has a PSA attached to it. But that\u2019s fundamental, Jeff, to our ability to be able to improve our \u2013 the way that we\u2019re measuring today the 400 to 500 basis points of improvement and then our ability to be able to then generate more revenue per customer because of the new solutions that are being now offered to where we have a connected PSA. Jeff Sprague : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, George and Olivier. George Oliver : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : And congrats, Antonella, also, the years of health and support. Antonella Franzen : Thank you. Scott Davis : Anyway, I\u2019m going to jump on the bandwagon here because I\u2019m kind of fascinated with this FogHorn thing, but I don\u2019t understand it. What does it give you, George that you didn\u2019t have before? And it feels like it\u2019s fairly high level. I mean does the customer want something as advanced? George Oliver : Yes. So let me frame this up for you, Scott. Number one, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the capabilities that FogHorn, the software that they have brings to our OpenBlue platform. So you need to think about this as the edge AI is going to become a critical technology to own when it comes to the future of smart autonomous buildings and in many cases, across other industries. And there is more value to being created at the edge because it can be real time, it can be more dependable analytics. It reduces the data being sent to the cloud, which is obviously lower cost, more secure, and it also improves the system resiliency. So it can operate, whether it be offline or without connectivity. And so we see \u2013 let me give you a number here. We see edge AI penetration increasing six-fold through 2025. So when you think about an autonomous building, there will be more sensors, more AI deployed, more analytics. And by pushing that to the edge, ultimately with the capabilities that I said earlier is what ultimately makes it really attractive. And so for us, this was a buy versus build decision. We would have caused almost as much and probably would have had lengthened our development cycle another 2 years to establish the same level of the commercial success that FogHorn has today. And so you need to think of this as supplementing our product development for a product that we would have actually accelerated on our own spend. And then it catalyzes the creation, what we would call our JCI AI Hub in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s where FogHorn is based. And it\u2019s allowing us to maintain the key engineering talent and now take what we were doing previously within JCI and put that together within the COE. And if you look at their capabilities compared to what we have seen elsewhere across the industry, it is widely considered best-in-class, and I would say has the most advanced portfolio among their peers. So, this \u2013 think of this, Scott, is this an accelerator of our ability to deploy our AI solutions with OpenBlue, specifically to the verticals that we support that ultimately creates incredible value for our customers. Olivier Leonetti : An additional point, Scott, if I may we had worked with the team for about a year and we are very pleased with the technology and also very pleased with the culture of FogHorn. So, we believe it\u2019s a great fit. Scott Davis : Is FogHorn \u2013 do they have a broad customer base already, George? Are you buying the technology, or they have an existing customer base that you can lever as well? George Oliver : They have an existing customer base where they were developing and developing vertical solutions. And so we have been working with them, as Olivier said, over the last year, and so as they were advancing with their capabilities with our channel and the work that we are doing with OpenBlue just totally opened up the opportunity now to expand the market that they are serving. Scott Davis : It sounds real good, love to see demo some day. I will pass it on. Thank you, guys. Good luck. George Oliver : Thanks Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. And I will echo the thanks Franzen and wish you all the best. Maybe just starting with the top line outlook, just wanted to understand on Fire & Security. You had mid-single digit growth, I think sort of all-in consolidated in the quarter organically. Maybe help us understand sort of within that, how much less than the firm-wide average was the pricing tailwind? And also, as you think about the balance of the year, do you see that mid-single digit Fire & Security growth rate accelerating? Olivier Leonetti : So, let me speak about the guide in aggregate. If you look at \u2013 I am going to talk about Q2 quickly and then talk about the full year. For Q2, we expect revenue to be high-single digits. If I give it to you by the key operations at Johnson Control, we expect services to grow mid to high-single digits. Install, we expect installed to grow at mid to high-single digits. And we expect also our global product franchise to grow low digits, so continued strong performance. And we expect those trends to keep going for the full year. Fire & Security is doing very well, but you see that the full portfolio is doing very well as well. We are very pleased with the commercial HVAC also applied shares we have had, our new product portfolio driving sustainability for our customers is resonating. So, Fire & Security is doing well, but the full portfolio is doing well as well, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then maybe just following up on the margin outlook, so Global Products had very good operating leverage in the first quarter, I think 30% or so year-on-year. even with inflation and supply chain issues. So, I guess looking at the balance of the year, wondered how you see that operating leverage playing out, because you might get less of a mix tailwind from resi HVAC slowing down, but maybe a help as inflation shrinks as a headwind as well. So, how are you thinking about sort of global products operating leverage for the year as a whole? Olivier Leonetti : So, in aggregate, as you can see from our guide and what we said earlier, Julian, you see that price cost is going to become more and more of a tailwind for the company. The reason for that is we are now recording revenue for orders, which were priced at a much higher margin. And we see that playing also for global product, but also the entirety of the portfolio. So, let me repeat some of the numbers, headwind Q1 100 basis points, headwind in Q2 80 basis points. And for the second half, a tailwind due to price cost of about $40 million and the net for the year of about 60 basis point headwind. And an important mention is that the underlying margin is very strong, and for the year, will be at about 110 basis points to 120 basis point increase. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And there is no big mix headwind expected in Global Products as resi slows down? Olivier Leonetti : Not really. I mean if anything, we see mix starting to be more positive as we sell more services, more digital offering, as George mentioned earlier. Antonella Franzen : And Julian, I would just add that if you are talking about Global Products specifically, I mean, the leverage in that business for the year is going to be around 30%. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. George Oliver : Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and Antonella, congratulations. Good luck and we will miss you. Thanks for all the help. Antonella Franzen : Thank you. Nigel Coe : Just on the last point, maybe Olivier, just clarify. I am assuming that strong JV income would be helping with the product leverage. So, that\u2019s probably a factor as well. But just curious on the North American retrofit comments, I think you called out mid-teens order growth there and it sounds like that\u2019s strong. Would you clarify that as maybe just deferred retrofit activity or do you think there is something a bit more secular happening here. Olivier Leonetti : No, we are very pleased with our North America business. As we have mentioned in our prepared remarks, the North America business has been highly impacted by disruptions for its operation, but also the operations of our customers. But if you look at the underlying demand for North America, we have been growing orders in the quarter twice the revenue rate. Clearly, the value proposition of Johnson Controls in North America is resonating. As we mentioned also, we are investing in sales force to satisfy the demand. Now we are not able to realize it yet, but we will in the second part of the year. So, we see the North America revenue to keep growing, and we see also the margin rate to keep improving as we go through the year. George Oliver : Yes. Just a comment on that, Nigel, when you look at the backlog, the backlog is up 12% year-on-year. When you look at HVAC controls, we are up about almost 20%. And so you would attribute it to all of the strategies, not only in the new product developments that are \u2013 the new product that\u2019s coming to market, the focus on decarbonization on energy savings and now a significant lift on indoor air quality. And when you look at indoor air quality, we are up nicely year-on-year after delivering $400 million in total. This would be across the globe last year. When we look at our orders here in Q2, we project those to be up about 45%. And so it\u2019s a combination of not only good core growth, but now seeing the opportunity the way that we are executing on the growth vectors. And now when you look at even services being up nicely in North America, that is an output of the work that we have been doing strategically. Nigel Coe : Great. Thank you. And then just a quick one on labor, we are hearing a lot of companies complaining about resignations and the inability to hire. I am just wondering if in your service business, if you have seen any kind of maybe flags or any red flags there? And any kind of capacity concerns that might gate service growth due to labor constraints? George Oliver : So, when I look at the supply chain disruptions overall, and it is weighted towards North America. It is driven by labor, a broad base. Now, what I would say inside our four walls, so within our manufacturing facilities and within our install and service business, we have been very effective in getting the ramp-up of labor that ultimately is required to continue to accelerate our growth. And so when you look at \u2013 I mean the disruption that Olivier was talking about is really driven by our supply chain chips and coils and other components that ultimately we have been adjusting to and making sure we are working around to mitigate the impact. And so we have been very proactive, not only on the labor front ourselves, but we have been also engaged with our suppliers. And so we have been very actively engaged with their labor situation to make sure that we are utilizing our labor services to ultimately get the labor they need to be able to keep our manufacturing facilities operating and the like. And so what I would say, it certainly is what I would say, the underlying challenge within the supply chain. But I would tell you, based on what I see, we track this on a weekly basis, we are making good progress and then we are working with our suppliers to do the same. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great to hear. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi guys. Good morning. Antonella Franzen : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning Steve. Steve Tusa : Congrats, Antonella, and best of luck in whatever the new gig is. Thanks for all the help over years. Antonella Franzen : Thank you. Steve Tusa : What do you guys think the market is growing in kind of global applied equipment? And how are you guys performing against that? George Oliver : Yes. I mean when we look at our applied business, Steve, and the work that we have done, making sure that we have got a full lineup and we have been reinvesting in new product and the like. So, I think we are seeing some upside from that. I think overall, we have seen a nice recovery, and we have capitalized on that with some of the new products. I would say the focus for us has been on low-GWP refrigerant technologies, next-gen air cool technologies, a lot of electrification with heat pumps and heat transfer units and then in our JCH business, the VRF technology. So, I think a lot of these are aligned to where we see the market going and ultimately now capitalizing on those trends around sustainability and energy efficiency. And so, that\u2019s the underlying what we see to be the \u2013 driving the underlying demand. When you look at our performance in applied, both sales and orders were up low-double digits in Q1. And now a lot of this was \u2013 there is a few verticals driving this. We see strong demand in data centers and healthcare and that\u2019s globally, and that\u2019s driving a lot of demand for our air cooled chillers specifically in North America. And then the other, I think what\u2019s helping this demand also is this the retrofit projects that are focused on sustainability, decarbonization, healthy buildings, which ultimately brings together our combined capabilities beyond just the equipment. And so I think that what\u2019s driving it to your question of how does that play out over the rest of the year. We believe, as Olivier said, not only with the underlying demand and now with the strong pricing activity that we are \u2013 overall, I think it\u2019s following the demand for the overall company, which is high-single digits. And we see our backlog, not only our order pipeline, but then our backlog that we are developing continues to grow. And we have backlog today that now is up over 10%. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 a lot of these demand streams converging that is ultimately playing out for us as we had planned with our strategy. Steve Tusa : And then just on OpenBlue, any tangible KPIs that you could provide to kind of give us an idea of what the trajectory of that is? I mean, I know you have talked about a few wins here and there, but anything tangible early on, I don\u2019t know, installations accounts that you can give us to kind of track the progress there? George Oliver : Yes, so let me just frame up OpenBlue, because I think this is a very important fundamental. So, it\u2019s really at the center of everything we are doing. So, as we talked about today, not only how we are pushing intelligence to the edge at our products and driving that now with FogHorn in our digital capabilities. But through all of this, whether it would be OpenBlue Bridge, OpenBlue Twin, active responder, Performance Advisor, cloud, location, all of these capabilities then play out not only enhancing our ability to get more installed base, but then differentiating that base with services. So, we have launched these eight major offerings. We have now incorporated those into our digital services. And when you look at our digital products and service revenue, we are up high-single digits. So, that is tracking with the investments we made. And now it\u2019s really now embedded in selling it as a solution. So, whether it be a project where we deliver energy savings or decarbonization or indoor air quality as a solution that\u2019s embedded in the solution. And then within that solution, we get higher margin and then we get a connection that gives us the ability to now add additional digital services. And so the benefit for the customer is improved uptime like by 66%, higher efficiency, smart buildings impact, we can impact energy by 50%. And so all of our solutions are based on creating these outcomes that ultimately generate a return for our customers and we see this over time, as we have said before, up to 10x the value creation with how it differentiates our equipment, the solutions that we install and then the base we build to allow us to be able to deliver additional services on top of that connection. That is the framework of OpenBlue. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Good morning all and best of luck to Antonella. You will be missed. Antonella Franzen : Thanks. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, a lot of questions trying to tease out the outgrowth here from a few different angles, I guess I want to approach it a little different as well. So, field orders up 8%, probably a few points of price in there. If I take off kind of the 2 points of outgrowth that you guys talked about at the Analyst Day, were at kind of low-single digits, which sort of feels low to call that the market since we are still comping negative and have things like stimulus helping and education. Like what \u2013 is that the right way to look at it? Where is the leak? And I guess when do you expect to see more separation, I guess on the field orders front? Olivier Leonetti : So, if you look at the field orders today, they are growing at 8%. We mentioned that if you look at the 3-year stack, the increase is steady. We believe that from a volume standpoint, the growth is really attractive. And as we deploy more of our capabilities around OpenBlue, around digital services, around indoor quality and the like, we believe that the growth in the field would keep growing. So, so far, it\u2019s performing largely as per our expectation, Josh, and more to come. George Oliver : And Josh, just to add, when we look at our \u2013 these new solutions that we have launched around net zero buildings and now the indoor air quality as a service. We have got a significant pipeline that we are now in the early stages of developing and beginning to convert. And that does begin to change not only the solutions and the installed base that is created with those solutions, but that gives us the installed base to ultimately get connected and then ultimately build \u2013 continue to build out the services. So, I believe when you look at the full cycle, we are seeing that with the projects that are in our pipeline and how we are beginning to convert. And that\u2019s why as Olivier said, we have been increasing our sales force because we believe that with all of the pluses and minuses that we are positioned for a nice steady stream of growth here that we are positioned to be able to deliver on. Antonella Franzen : And the only thing I would add is we are clearly seeing share gains, which clearly shows that we are outperforming the market. And that has been, I would say, pretty steady across the board. We gained some significant share in Applied, particularly in chillers in North America over the last 12 months. And we are also seeing gains in share in the Fire & Security portfolio as well. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on Nigel\u2019s question about labor, obviously, you guys aren\u2019t the only folks at the job site, especially in kind of these big retrofits or new construction. How much of what you are doing could be held up by other folks having insufficient access to labor or kind of site delays? Like is that something that\u2019s happening now, or is that something that could flare up as a risk or can you guys kind of control your own destiny if you are able to attract and retain people inside of JCI? George Oliver : Yes. So, if you look at our \u2013 when we talk about labor at our facilities, at our manufacturing facilities, we have been managing around shortages, and we are getting some disruption there because you have to run smaller lots through the manufacturing process and you have to do more changeovers per shift and the like. And that\u2019s why we saw some disruption there. Why the field is greater is because when you look at North America, for instance, we have 18,000 people in the field every day on jobs. And so it\u2019s really based on schedules and making sure that we are deploying that labor efficiently that they are going to be able to perform their work when they go on site. And so you can imagine in this environment, with all of the changes that are happening daily, we are operating at an incredible level to maintain not only the full employment, but ultimately supporting our customers during this period of time. And so I think the value proposition, as we have been able to \u2013 I just looked at our January numbers as far as our hiring and we are spot on what we need to hire to ultimately support the growth the rest of the year. And as we work with our recruiters and the way that we are presenting ourselves in the market, there is a very attractive value proposition with the work we are doing with ultimately the growth that we are positioned to achieve and then ultimately, the problems that now we are positioned to solve for our customers. So, when you put all that together, those are some of the drivers, what\u2019s driving our success. But to your point, it is \u2013 anyone that\u2019s within the supply chain today, there is a level of frustration because you \u2013 every day, you get a curveball and you have to work around because of the shortage or the like. And to your point about our customers, we certainly are governed by the projects that we are supporting and ultimately their schedules on site. And we are trying to work that proactively so we don\u2019t get many surprises. But you can imagine when things don\u2019t show up, then you have got to pivot and redeploy. And that\u2019s \u2013 we have been doing that extremely well while we have been navigating through this period of time. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. I appreciate the detail. Best of luck. George Oliver : So, let me wrap up, and I will thank everyone again for joining our call this morning. As we have discussed here, we have had a very strong start to the fiscal year and the underlying momentum we are seeing in our business and the recovery within our verticals is very encouraging. And although the environment will continue to be challenging, as you have seen here, our teams across the board are executing extremely well, ultimately delivering for our customers and for our shareholders. So, I would just like to end the call and thank Antonella again for just an incredible run and for your leadership, your friendship and the impact that you have had on all of us and on the company has been phenomenal. So again, thank you for that. And I do look forward to speaking with many of you soon. There is a lot of conferences coming up and we are looking forward to further engagement. So, on that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. All participants, you may disconnect at this time.",

I will now turn the call over to Ryan Edelman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ryan Edelman : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' second quarter fiscal 2022 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. As a reminder before we begin, during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted earnings per share, EBITDA, and EBIT exclude restructuring as well as other special items. These metrics, together with organic sales and free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis. Now let me turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Ryan. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'm going to get started with a brief overview on Slide 3. Our results in the second quarter reflect solid top line execution as we delivered strong sales orders and backlog growth in line with our expectations and at the high end of the guidance we provided demand for digitally enabled equipment and services that solve for sustainability and energy efficiency, remains robust and our sales teams are doing an outstanding job capitalizing on that demand. The reinvestments we have made to develop industry leading products and solutions are delivering results. Digitization is at the center of our strategic vision for the company, and we continue to advance those strategies every day. OpenBlue is accelerating the digital enablement of our solutions, allowing us to deliver increasingly differentiated offerings and capitalize on emerging secular trends. We're also seeing the benefit of the discipline we've instilled in our pricing capabilities over the last two plus years, price realization continues to accelerate, contributing nearly six points to overall organic revenue in the quarter. You see that most clearly in our shorter cycle global products business, but it's also accelerating in our longer cycle of field businesses. We also continue to gain traction on our key vectors of growth. Global efforts to decarbonize economy and ensure the health of indoor environments are accelerating; both supported by the adoption of new policies by governments and industry associations. At the same time, we continue to accelerate actions to optimize the efficiency of our cost structure. And we remain on track to deliver $230 million in productivity savings this year. We have deployed over $1.5 billion in capital year-to-date, including over $1 billion in share repurchase and more than $400 million in cash dividends. Our M&A pipeline continues to build with a number of active opportunities that would allow us to support our vectors of growth. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we have made towards achieving our strategic objectives year-to-date. As we have said in the past, we truly believe we are among the best-in-class when it comes to the ability to deliver fully integrated solutions designed to address the challenges associated with the global secular trends, developing across our industry. We are operating in a very dynamic environment with heightened supply chain disruptions. Second quarter profit under reformed, relative to our expectations. And while the anticipated supply chain improvement is happening, it is happening at a slower pace. Let's turn to Slide 4 for more detail on what we're seeing in the North America segment. Demand remains strong with orders up 13%. Our backlog grew 14% to a record $6.9 billion. Just as in other parts of the organization, we are advancing our strategic priorities to accelerate growth by addressing the sustainability and healthy building needs of our customers. Going into the quarter, we anticipated continued challenges related to supply chain disruptions and material availability. More specifically, inadequate supply of semiconductor chips and components, but controls products. The margin under performance relative to our expectations can largely be explained by the pace and mix of backlog conversion resulting in lower absorption on our cost base. As we described to you on our last call in any given quarter we are typically executing on about 40,000 projects across install and service. Each of these projects requires a significant amount of coordination. In the current environment, managing through our own material shortages, in addition to our suppliers and customer supply chain and labor constraints magnifies any slippage. Additionally, given the pace of orders, we have seen and the backlog we have been building, we have maintained our investment in sales headcount, and service technicians. With revenue conversion and mix below our plan, we were not able to fully cover the higher cost of reinvestment in the quarter. The last point I would make on this is on timing. Our initial forecast in late January assumed a modest recovery in supply chain conditions as we progress through Q2. Although there were some improvements in the quarter, the recovery was slower to materialize, which coincided with the seasonal ramp into our peak season during the month of March. Net-net, these two issues accounted for a $40 million profit impact in North America. We expect a slower pace of improvement to continue throughout the second half, which is the primary contributor to our lower outlook for the year. Despite these challenges, we are confident the backlog is turning, driving higher revenue growth with more accretive margins as we think ahead to 2023. Please turn to Slide 5. OpenBlue remains the core of our strategy to digitize our portfolio to enable differentiated outcome-based solutions. During the quarter, we commercialized several exciting new offerings, including the OpenBlue Gateway, a cost-effective, easy-to-install device that will serve as a key enabler to accelerate the connection of our installed base. OpenBlue Net Zero Advisor will be launching within the next several weeks and will help customers manage Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in their journey to achieve net zero. Lastly, OpenBlue Connected Controls will be the first full integration of OpenBlue into our legacy Metasys systems, which we believe will be a disruptive offering that will fundamentally change how building automation systems operate, increasing the intelligence of building controls by infusing AI. Importantly, this offering will allow us to extend our reach further into the mid-market with a compelling plug-and-play solution. Let's turn to Slide 6. We continue to make progress in the digital transformation of our service business, leveraging OpenBlue to further differentiate our capabilities. We're on a path to drive higher attach rates on our installed base, increase the level of connectivity of those assets, and then, as a result of differentiated service offerings, drive higher revenue per customer and lower our attrition rates. This service growth flywheel is a clear algorithm that helps us achieve above-market levels of growth expected to generate over $2 billion in sales through 2024. Although we are still in the early stages of this process, our core service business, augmented by early results from digital services, performed well in the quarter. Sales were up 8% overall, with orders up 10%. Our attach rate improved another 130 basis points in the quarter, bringing us to over 200 basis points year-to-date, well on track to achieve our 400 basis points to 500 basis point target for the full year. Digital Services increased 7% in the quarter. Turning now to Slide 7. The global commitment to decarbonize economies continues to gain momentum, both in the public and private sectors. There was also increased recognition that economies cannot truly decarbonize without decarbonizing buildings, which contribute 40% of the planet's greenhouse gas emissions. Rising energy prices and the potential risk of supply shocks are forcing many governments to reconsider sources and uses of fuel. The combination of higher energy prices and security risks are making paybacks much more attractive. We continue to see policy moves and commitments from corporations that support the carbon reduction of buildings. Our deep understanding of the building ecosystem uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends. During the quarter, we completed the full commercialization of our net zero capabilities. Our Performance Infrastructure business has evolved into a global organization we now refer to as Sustainability Infrastructure, backed by decades of experience delivering guaranteed savings and an extensive network of subject matter experts. The breadth of our installed base, the depths of our field presence, supported by an industry-leading portfolio of digital products and solutions, delivers a holistic solution for customers to achieve net zero. We continue to make progress. Year-to-date, our Sustainability Infrastructure business has booked over $450 million in orders, and our unfactored pipeline now exceeds $7 billion. Continuing with our vectors of growth on Slide 8, healthy buildings. We were encouraged by the recent initiative launched by the White House and the EPA. Both customers and government agencies increasingly see the long-term value of investing in improvements in building health and resiliency. And it is not just focused on K-12, nor is it only related to COVID response. We are strategically well positioned to capitalize on the adoption of healthy building trends. We continue to develop and deploy new offerings with a focus on shifting the value proposition to longer term, more strategic asset management. During the quarter, our healthy buildings orders were up more than 30% to $150 million, and our pipelines continue to build. Finally, on Slide 9. We continue to demonstrate our leadership in sustainability and ESG. We are perhaps most proud of our own Chief Sustainability Officer, Katie McGinty, recently being named as the Top Woman in Sustainability in the corporate world. To close out my prepared remarks I remain extremely excited about the continued advancements we have made relative to our key growth vectors. And I couldn't be more pleased with the way our teams are executing in such a difficult environment. We remain laser focused on our strategic commitments into delivering the outcomes our customers need on the path to a healthy and more sustainable future. Although we are navigating through a more challenging environment with increased uncertainty regarding the macro backdrop, I am confident in our path forward. Momentum within our short cycle products business is solid. Our backlog is strong and the margin profile is inflecting as we  year order intake. All of which sets us up well for 2023 and beyond. With that I am going to turn the call over to Olivier to walk you through the financial details in the quarter and update you on our outlook. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : Thanks George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the summary on Slide 10. Sales in the quarter were up 9% organically at the end of our original guidance for high-single digit growth with price contributing nearly 6 points above what we originally anticipated. We saw strong performance across our shorter cycle global products portfolio up 14%. Our longer-cycle field business also performed well, up 7% with solid growth in both service and install. Segment EBITA increased 8% with margin down 10 basis points to 12.6%. So within the line volume leverage and the benefit of our ongoing SG&A and COGS programs were offset by higher inflation and supply chain related challenges as George discussed earlier. Despite achieving over $300 million in price on the top line, price cost was slightly negative in the quarter and together with supply chain descriptions resulted in a 160 basis points margin headwind. EPS of $0.63 increased 21% year-over-year benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. Free cash flow was down as the prior benefited from lower working needs and COVID related benefits. Turning to our EPS Bridge on Slide 11. Overall operations contributed $0.10 versus the prior year, including a $0.08 benefit from our COGS and SG&A productivity programs, and the line segment earnings where a net $0.02 tailwind year-over-year. Excluding the extra headwinds from price cost and supply chain descriptions, underlying incremental in Q2 where approximately 36%. Please turn to Slide 12. Orders for our field businesses increased 11% in aggregate with continued momentum on a two-year stack basis. Service orders were led by high-teens growth in our short-term transactional business. Install orders continue to rebound primarily driven by demand for applied HVAC and controls systems. Backlog grew 12% to $10.9 billion, a $1.2 billion increase versus the prior year and up $500 million sequentially. Secured margin backlog is up 80 basis points in a quarter reflecting our pricing discipline and the improving margin trend we expect as these backlog converts later this year and into 2023. Let's discuss our segment results in more detail on Slide 13 and 14. Sales in North America were up 6% organically with broad-based growth across the portfolio led primarily by strength in our apply business, up low-double digits. Client security grew low-single digits, although were up 13% with low-teens growth in applied, driven by continued equipment demand in the data center, K-12 and healthcare verticals. Sustainability Infrastructure orders were up mid-teens despite a strong double-digit compare as we booked another large energy services project with the U.S. Public School System. Fire & security orders were up low-double digit and backlog ended the quarter at $6.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Segment margin decreased 210 basis points to 10.6% as volume leverage and cost savings were more than offset by 250 basis points headwind from the pace and mix of backlog conversion and lower absorption as George described earlier. EMEALA we saw continued strength in the core fire & security business, which grew at a high-single digit rate in Q2. Industrial Refrigeration grew high-single digits driven by the conversion of several large industrial heat pump projects. Orders were up 8% led by low-double-digit growth in our core Fire & Security platform. Backlog was up 9% to $2.2 billion. Underlying margin performance was driven by volume leverage, positive price/cost and the benefit of cost savings, offset by supply chain disruptions and lower equity income. Sales in Asia Pacific were led by low double-digit growth in applied HVAC. China continued to outperform with revenue up nearly 20%, led by strong double-digit growth in Industrial Refrigeration and mid-teens growth in Applied. Orders increased 8% with continued strength in Applied, driven primarily by continued momentum with the industrial vertical in China with a continued pipeline of infrastructure investment across key verticals like Petrochem, semiconductor and data center as well as healthcare. Backlog of $1.8 billion was up 5% year-over-year. The decline in margin was primarily the result of headwinds from price/cost and unfavorable project and geographic mix. Global Products continued to perform well, up 14% in Q2, with broad-based strength across the portfolio, led by mid-teens growth across our HVAC equipment platforms. Global residential HVAC sales were up 15% in aggregate. North America resi HVAC was up 27%, benefiting from both higher growth in our equipment and parts business and strong price realization. Production in our new facility in Mexico continues to ramp and contributed meaningfully to volume growth in the quarter. Outside of North America, our resi HVAC business grew low double digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe, driven by strong demand for our Hitachi residential heat pumps. APAC, resi HVAC sales grew high single digits, led by strong growth in India and Taiwan. Commercial HVAC product sales were up high teens in aggregate, with strength in light commercial, driven by strong performance at Hitachi as well as 20% growth in North America and more than 20% growth in VRF. Fire & Security products grew low double digits in aggregate with strong demand across the entire portfolio. Although not recorded in our official field order backlog, Global Products orders were up mid-teens organically, and our third-party backlog exceeded $2 billion. EBITA margins expanded 170 basis points to 16.1% as volume leverage, higher equity income and the benefit of productivity actions more than offset headwinds from price/cost. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 15. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended Q2 with $1.8 billion in available cash and net debt at 2.1 times, still at the lower end of our target range of 2 times to 2.5 times. Free cash flow was an outflow of $200 million in the quarter, driven primarily by higher year-over-year working capital requirements, higher CapEx and the absence of prior period tax credits and other COVID-related benefits. Trade working capital as a percentage of sales declined 50 basis points to 8.6%. For the first half, we are fairly neutral on free cash flow, which brings us back in line with our normal first half, second half seasonality. We repurchased another 7 million shares for just over $500 million in the second quarter, bringing us to just over $1 billion for the year. Now let's discuss our revised guidance on Slide 16. Underlying demand trends across most of our businesses continue to improve, and I'm encouraged by the pace of order growth we have seen year-to-date. As George highlighted in his remarks, the ongoing supply chain challenges impacting the pace and mix of our backlog conversion in North America is driving a reduction in our outlook for the rest of the year. As a result, we are revising our full year adjusted EPS range to $2.95 to $3.05, which represents 11% to 15% growth year-over-year. On the top line, we still expect to grow 8% to 10% organically. Price is now expected to contribute six to seven points, up an additional one to two points relative to our prior expectation, fully offsetting additional inflation. For the full year, we still expect to be slightly positive on price/cost. Segment margin is now expected to come in flat to down 30 basis points, reflecting pressure related to additional price on the top line with minimal margin contribution and the mix impact associated with the supply chain disruptions in North America. Combined, these two factors results in an 80 basis points margin headwind relative to our prior guide and now account for nearly a 150 basis points headwind versus the prior year. As it relates to the ongoing lockdowns in China and the conflict in Ukraine, we are monitoring the developments daily. From a planning standpoint, although it is difficult to moderate precisely, we have embedded some incremental contingency to account for the additional uncertainty surrounding the supply chain for the balance of the year. This is reflected in our updated segment margin guidance for the year. Full year free cash flow conversion is now expected to be about 90% as the inventory buildup in the first half, combined with slower backlog conversion, creates nearly a $200 million headwind to our prior guidance. Turning to Q3. We expect the headwinds related to supply chain to skew slightly more towards the third quarter, with EPS expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.87, which assumes organic revenue growth of high single digits and a segment margin decline of 80 to 100 basis points. Although our expected backlog conversion rates are challenged near term due to supply chain issues, I'm confident in our long-term outlook. We have strategically positioned the company to accelerate growth, aligned with competing secular trends impacting buildings for the next decade. We continue to make good progress on our cost productivity program. And as backlog conversion normalize in 2023, margins are expected to recover, keeping us on track for the fiscal 2024 targets we provided at our Investor Day last September. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is open sir. Nigel Coe : Thanks good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just talk about \u2013 did you get the commitments from suppliers that caused some of this pressure in North America? And when did this start to really manifest? Was this more of a March issue? Or was it something that developed through the quarter? George Oliver : Yes. What I would say, Nigel, is as we indicated on our prepared remarks, I'd start with the value proposition of our field-based businesses, particularly in North America, is resonating very well with our customers. You saw our orders up 13% year-on-year. We're up 18% with a two year stack, strong demand for the vectors of growth from services and sustainability, indoor, environmental quality, and that's in North America. But across the board, we're seeing a significant pickup in our digital capabilities. And so I think as you look at the quarter, a combination of things that created the shortfall. We had recovery plans. We've been working with our chip manufacturers and semiconductor material suppliers for the last year. And we've been working at the most senior levels, myself personally involved with CEOs, in understanding what their long-term plans are and how does that align to supporting our growth. And we've made a lot of progress, and that includes also having to redesign chips and ultimately making sure that we're going to be positioned where the supply will occur and have much more resiliency in our plan going forward. And so when we look at short term, it certainly was the plans that we had, had have moved to the right. They continue to improve but, Nigel, at the same time that we're ramping up with our seasonal build. And so typically, we're up usually 10% to 15% into March, as we plan for our third quarter and ultimately fourth quarter. And so that is ultimately what happened. And so we weren't able to convert the backlog, and a lot of this is our high margin mix as it relates to controls. And the good news is when we look at our digital or orders, the orders in our controls-based businesses were up over 30%. And so our backlogs are significantly up in spite of the supply chain improving. And so it did have a disproportionate impact on our revenue conversion in the field because of this high margin. And when you think about products, products multiply in the field. So not only once we deliver the product, we get multiples of revenue for how we not only support a project, but more important how we complete the service. And so it's about 40% of our revenue does convert as we ramp, especially going into our peak season in the last month, and that resulted in about an impact of $40 million in the quarter. Now as we have \u2013 certainly, we've been working this for the last year. We've gone back and making sure, that as we understand now what is the commitment, not only in additional capacity, but how we are positioned relative to that capacity, I feel really good because our suppliers are totally committed and aligned with our growth strategy. And so this will play out with a recovery in the second half. And I think as I think about not only completing 2022, but the setup we have for 2023, with the margin that we put into backlog, and we're seeing that in our Global Products with the book and bill business, we've seen tremendous agility relative to pricing, and we've done the same in our field-based businesses, although there's a little bit of a lag, that we're going to be set up for not only strong high-digit \u2013 a high single-digit pricing. But now with the revenue conversion, as we get into recovery in the fourth, fourth quarter setting up for the first quarter, you can assess that we have $1 billion - $1 billion to $2 billion of additional capacity to take on the recovery. When you look at our backlogs, we think we'd start to accelerate recovery as we get through fourth quarter and then ultimately set up the first half in 2023. So that's what we've been experiencing. It's been a full contacts Board, everyone totally aligned working with our suppliers and making sure every step of the way, we're positioned to deliver the growth and ultimately get to the volume growth and the returns that we've committed, which I believe we're going to be in good shape to do over our long-term plan. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks George. And just maybe just clarify, did you say high single-digit pricing in the backlog? I just want to clarify that point. But maybe turn to Olivier. So basically, the $0.27 revision to the midpoints guide, $0.16 is kind of like coming out versus consensus 3Q and $0.11 in 4Q. I'm curious, how much do you have baked into 3Q or maybe 4Q for the China lockdowns and the weak growth in China real estate? Obviously, FX is a little bit of an impact. But I'm more curious on the North American impact, how that's impacting 3Q and 4Q. And do we have any spill forwards into 2023? Olivier Leonetti : So if you look at today, the guide we are proposing for the second half of the year, we are planning a minimum amount of improvement. We are ramping in the second half relative to the first half in volume. If you disaggregate what is going on in the second half in our guide, we expect to be price/cost positive by about $50 million, but we expect disruptions to still impact our business. We have factored about $100 million due to disruption. Again, it's \u2013 we are doing that in the abundance of caution. Obviously, we're not \u2013 we're watching what's happening in Europe. We're also watching what is happening in China. But as we said earlier, we have build year-on-year in Q2, $1.2 billion worth of backlog. And we believe that we will have the manufacturing capacity and also supplies capacity in \u2013 at the start of next year to flow the backlog at a very enhanced margin. And as George indicated as well, Nigel, we couldn't be more pleased with how our value proposition is resonating with our customers. If you look at orders, if you look at services, sustainability, empty building, all the indicators are very positive. So today, it's a temporary conversion question that we have to face. Nigel Coe : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. George Oliver : Yes, morning Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : I want to follow up on that last point that, I think, Olivier, you made on the margins when the stuff exits the backlog and ultimately supply chains improve, that those should be healthy. I guess if some of the issue is that the field force is sort of underutilized when you can't get this product. I mean isn\u2019t there sort of kind of bandwidth on how much they are able to do on the other side. I\u2019m just trying to think through like should we expect above normal incremental margins on the way out, or is just sort as simple as you can only install stuff so fast and the field force can only be kind of self-productive with a number of hours in the day? Olivier Leonetti : Yes. So if you look at \u2013 you are absolutely, right. So, we expect largely that the backlog issues will normalize in the first half of the year. If you look at today, the margin at which we price orders today, we're pricing in anticipating of inflation and we're pricing today, high single digits. So we believe we are going to have a very healthy set of revenue based upon the orders we book now. And those will flow at the start of the year. We have the capacity and we believe we're going to be well positioned from a margin standpoint.  In addition, and I know we spend a lot of time on our business for good reasons. Our global product division is really outperforming, strong revenue growth and strong profit rate improvement. So again, very pleased with the value proposition of our company, Josh, and we believe second half \u2013 first half of next year, we will see a significant margin improvement going on. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. George Oliver : Josh just to add there because, I think, it's important to understand the pricing dynamic, as Olivier has said. With the book-and-bill business, we've been very agile, as I said, with the pricing and we're getting on the 14% growth, about 10% pricing, that's embedded in that. As the inflation began to accelerate last year, we began to then as on a forward-looking basis within our field-based business, to be able to forward look much higher levels of inflation. So we've been putting into backlog over the last number of quarters, much higher anticipated inflation. So what you're seeing in converting now were projects that prior to last year or early last year, that are still converting. But with what we've been putting into the backlog is priced much differently and that becomes to be a higher mix as we get through the second half. And then more important, as we look at our turn in the backlog going into 2023, that's where I said that we have \u2013 we're positioned for high single digit conversion relative to the price that's in backlog. So that is the work that we've been doing over the last \u2013 it's really been the last two years with the work that we've done around pricing. But we're very confident that with the fundamentals we have in place, and it's demonstrated in our product businesses, that we're getting great traction with the initiatives have in place. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on digital services, I saw the 7% growth. Is there something I'm missing in kind of the base that that's off of? I would've thought things like OpenBlue and some of the newer kind of digital offerings would have been growing a bit faster. Is there some legacy stuff that is maybe a bit slower or being kind of made obsolete by OpenBlue that kind of altering that base? George Oliver : No, I mean when you \u2013 Josh when you think about our OpenBlue, it's really digitalizing all that we do, it's strengthening our products and it's fundamentally becoming embedded in all of our services. So when you look at OpenBlue, it's the connectivity. So it's the ability to be able to connect. And then with that connectivity we're increasing our attach rate of contracts, long-term contracts. It allows us then to, with these new service offerings, leveraging the data and the AI that we're applying to the data that fundamentally differentiates the service offering. So that's incremental revenue per customer. And then with the connectivity, it allows us to be able to significantly reduce attrition. And that's when you factor in all that the digital does it contributes to that high single digit service growth that we're committed to achieve. And we're making great progress. Like when you look at the new services that we've launched here in just the last quarter, whether it be the connected, our new gateway that is going to be fundamental to all of the assets that we have in the install base and how we get them connected. And then now we're launching our advisory services, energy advisory services and associated services. So there's a lot of \u2013 it's now IAQ as part of our healthy buildings service, it's the enabler now of those additional services with that connectivity that ultimately drives the revenue per customer. And the revenue per customer price as well as additional service is significantly growing. Josh Pokrzywinski : Appreciate the color there. Thanks, George. Olivier Leonetti : Yes, maybe an additional comment Josh, this is important. Most of those capabilities and those we believe are unique in the market when you speak about OpenBlue getaway which is easy way to connect all devices in the building. If you speak about also OpenBlue connected with a BMS, which allows you to control a building remotely, that's unique in the market. And our edge capability now implementation to our ecosystem FogHorn. Those are unique capabilities. We believe game-changing for the building business those are also new. So, we will start to see more of an inflection point forward as well Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : I appreciate that. That's helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open, sir. Steve Tusa : Hi guys. Good morning. George Oliver : Hey, good morning, Steve. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Olivia maybe just a couple things on the numbers. First of all, on the quarter, can you just maybe give a little more context around maybe a couple of examples that had amongst the larger impacts on the margin in the quarter, just from a fundamental on the ground perspective, just to give us a better picture of, what's actually going on and what the headwinds are? And I assume you are viewing these as kind of like discreet headwinds, you're not covering your fixed costs. So they should kind of reverse next year. And then number two, you mentioned that you do have some contingency built in to the second half of the year. Maybe could you give us some more precise financials around what normally would have happened and then what you're assuming? Most companies are assuming some improvement in supply, in the second half. You are kind of saying that you're not assuming much at all. Maybe just clarify with some financial detail to help us understand how the comps work into next year. Olivier Leonetti : Absolutely, Steve, nice to talk to you. Let me give you an example of North America. If you look at our North America, which is our most sophisticated business, the value proposition of what we do is resonating in the market and that's important. I will answer to your question precisely. But if you look at the underlying trends, order growth, 13%, 18% on a two-year stack, backdrop growth, 40% services growth 7%, sustainability infrastructure two-year stack, 60%, SE Building orders growth 85%. We have tremendous demand for our North America business. The challenge today is a short term conversion. Let me give you an example. In North America, we need to orchestrate our own supply chain, the one of our partners\u2019 and the one of our customers\u2019. And the issues we are all facing in industrial world are being amplified in this sophisticated business. So that's what is happening. And as George has indicated, it's mainly due to controls. And for a  of revenue with controls, you have a tremendous impact on the total revenue for North America. To your question, will that reverse next year? The answer is yes. We expect today if you look at in aggregate for the company, the sum of the headwinds are going to be about 160 basis points for our company for the full year. If you look at the underlying margin, they are increasing by more than 100 basis points, Steve. And we expect that to be flowing through next year. So that's the first part of your question. On the second part of your question, we are being prudent, we are September year-end company, so we have less time to see what's happening, for example, in Europe or in China, which is largely today in some parts of the operation in lockdown. We are planning, as I indicated, more descriptions in the second half as said about 100 million of description, that's prudent. We believe we have factored the risk in the appropriate manner, and we see some positive price cost. So prudent approach to supply chain and we expect first half of next year to be a very positive staff for us as we convert backlog at a very high margin. Steve Tusa : Right. So, when you guys guide next year, you will assume that for lack of a better term, the comp is very easy, so that you'll be guiding to above average or above what you would have expected, incremental margins, and the earnings kind of flow through next year, as opposed to this year. So when you guide that would be the case, all out people, correct? Olivier Leonetti : That's absolutely the case. Steve Tusa : Okay. Olivier Leonetti : If you look at all the indicators today Steve, regarding the health of our business, it's actually very strong. And the margin rate should increase significantly next year above averages. No question. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. George Oliver : Steve, it's important to note that when you look at our backlogs, both in our book-to-bill we're up significantly year-on-year still, and that's continuing to build. And then our field-based businesses were up significantly. And so we\u2019re working this such that with the recovery as we see going through the peak in the third quarter and then we begin to recover. we have one to two, we believe in the beginning in the fourth quarter, first half of next year, with the commitments we\u2019re getting on supply right now that, that\u2019s the capacity that we have to really begin to accelerate the recovery with the backlog we\u2019ve built. And the demand continues to be very strong, especially as it relates to our digital components, and that\u2019s a reflection of the work we\u2019re doing with OpenBlue and across our digital platform. So, I think we have confidence at this stage that we going into the year, we should have real good tailwinds with the margin in backlog and then the ability to be able to convert with an improved supply chain. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Your line is open sir. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thank you guys. Olivier, just to clarify your answer to Steve\u2019s question just now. I want to ask, is the \u2013 if you were to take the sum of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, before we walked into today, do you still think the sum of the two is going to be equal? I mean, in other words, these are \u2013 the full catch-up in 2023 \u2013 2023 numbers should actually go up from where we were as there\u2019s a catch-up in the first half? I just want to be clear. Should we take down kind of the forward curve in entirety ? Olivier Leonetti : Absolutely, the math is correct. If you take the sum of the two years, we would be able to recover the margin rate. And again, if you look at the top line today and the indicators we have in terms of orders and now that we convert, we feel very positive about top line and margin improvement when you take those two years together, correct. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And just given... George Oliver : I think, Gautam, just a point on that is with the supply chain, because a lot of this is really impacting our digital mix and the recovery of \u2013 we\u2019ve got commitments now on the recovery of the microchips and semiconductors. They are weighted to the first half of 2023, but some continue through. So it\u2019s tied to both the supply with the ability to be able to get the leverage with the mix and the completion of the projects and services we\u2019re completing. But that would be, as you model, as we begin to think about 2023, that\u2019s ultimately what our goal is. Gautam Khanna : Okay. I appreciate that. And maybe related to that, do these delays have any dampening impact on incoming orders? I\u2019m curious like as there\u2019s customers are saying, \"Hey, if you can get to me and with conviction in nine months, we place the order now. But if you can\u2019t, we\u2019re going to hold off.\" I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any dampening impact on orders given the spreadsheet  times. George Oliver : Well, what I would say is it\u2019s the opposite. Right now, our demand \u2013 and of course, we\u2019re not overcommitting based on what we\u2019re learning relative to our ability to convert. But I would tell you that with the strategies that we\u2019ve been executing services, digital, this trend on decarbonization, healthy buildings, ultimately automated buildings. We\u2019re operating at a much higher level within our customers, because these are now problems that the C-suite or the CEO is focused on. And so even in the environment we\u2019re in and with the economic environment that the demand is still coming in strong. And so we feel that the way that we\u2019re committing and the way that we\u2019re booking the business is ultimately in line with what we can achieve and what our customers are demanding. So at this stage, we have seen very little or none, relatively low cancellations. And when you look at our \u2013 so you look at our short-cycle business, as I said, our short-cycle business, our backlog is significantly up year-on-year. And that\u2019s after a quarter of delivering 14% growth. In the quarter, we had actually revenue \u2013 orders that exceeded that in the quarter. And then when you look at our field-based businesses, these are longer-cycled projects that are typically financed. And we\u2019re working upfront with owners and developers, especially now with OpenBlue, where this becomes fundamental to their infrastructure, the digital infrastructure within the building. So as we sit here today and I think even if we were to get into a slowdown, given the importance of what we do and how we\u2019re deploying our capabilities, it\u2019s still going to be high demand. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Appreciated guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open sir. Scott Davis : Good morning. Thank you. Good morning everybody. George Oliver : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : The $500 million that was released by the White House, what \u2013 does that have to be spent? Are there any terms around that? Does it have to get spent in the next year? Does it have to get spent on filtration versus \u2013 just \u2013 versus can it be just basically upgrading chores? I mean how \u2013 any color on that would be helpful, George. George Oliver : So the color on that, Scott, is that we\u2019ve been actively involved in all of these bills that have been tied to our industry with Katie McGinty, myself. We\u2019ve been very actively involved; not only in the U.S. but across the globe, but with each of the governments and helping to define how they deploy these resources to get the biggest \u2013 to get the biggest impact. And so we have been very active, like, for instance, with heat pumps and the opportunity to get a 3 :1 benefit by deploying heat pumps and replacing some of the boilers and an older equipment and upgrading with heat pumps, you get significant reduction of energy required ultimately with that capability and then you get a good payback just purely with the economics. And so there\u2019s a high mix of that that is tied to all that we do. It\u2019s not only HVAC, but it\u2019s with the digital capabilities that enable us to be able to significantly enhance energy reduction, upgrade the indoor air quality, all of that together, Scott. So it\u2019s not broken down into any one domain. It\u2019s more in line with what is the output that they\u2019re trying to achieve. And the two outputs are getting to a higher standard of indoor air quality while, at the same time, we\u2019re reducing energy, not only here in the U.S., but actually, as we work with the European governments, how do they quickly deploy heat pumps to ultimately put into district heating and cooling and other applications that can significantly reduce demand. But a lot of that is because we\u2019ve been actively involved in defining how those resources should be applied. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then Net Zero Advisor, what does that actually do? Are you just \u2013 are you basically cataloging energy consumption and carbon? Or are you actually advising on how to improve it? Or \u2013 which I think was part of the original OpenBlue also perhaps, but maybe you can clarify a little bit, that would be helpful. Thanks. George Oliver : Yes. The whole idea of OpenBlue Advisor is really making a building autonomous. And you can take all of the data in a building. And then with AI and other applications, you can then understand what is the best way to optimize the building. And so not only taking what the energy \u2013 what the current energy being consumed, but then how do you then advise based on what entitlement is to how you get to the most optimized energy usage within the building. And it takes into account all the factors of a building. So not only the HVAC equipment, but presence and a lot of the other factors that ultimately really help contribute to how you get to that best outcome. And so it\u2019s really \u2013 think about it, Scott, is taking all of the intelligence of a building, being able to put it into one platform, apply AI and then being able to work with our customers to define what the best solution is to be able to achieve their net zero commitments that have been made. And this ties well with our net zero building offerings. When we go in, we can do a full offering where we upgrade equipment. We deploy digital. We can take an as-built building. And when you look out towards 2050 and with all these commitments to get to net zero, 70% of the building stock today will still be in operations. And so we\u2019re seeing high demand to go in and ultimately upgrade, deploy digital, consume the data, apply AI and then ultimately advise what the best solution is to get to the energy commitments that they\u2019ve made. So that\u2019s, in essence, Scott, what we\u2019re doing. Scott Davis : Very cool. Best of luck, George. I thank you for this. I\u2019ll pass it on. George Oliver : All right. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to circle back on that point around contingency in that second half margin guide. Because it looks as if, I think, you need a sort of 40%-plus sequential operating leverage in the sort of second half operating profit versus first half. And that\u2019s not \u2013 on the face of it, it doesn\u2019t look that different from what JCI did historically post the power exit. So, I just wanted to check, is that math is roughly right? And is it right that you\u2019re assuming operating leverage not that different from previous years in the second half? Olivier Leonetti : That\u2019s correct, Julian. What we had anticipated originally was to be able to beat those seasonal trends. And we had expected that we would have the ability to flow some of the increased backlog we had. For the reasons we have been presenting today, this increased conversion of backlog will be delayed by two quarters. Julian Mitchell : I see. But you think a normal seasonal trend is still possible or probable even with all of the supply chain constraints? Olivier Leonetti : Absolutely. Correct. The increase in the normal flow is not happening, but we believe today that we will be able to meet these recourses in our trend. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then maybe following up on North America field specifically, that's a business that of the four segments, it has the highest margin ramp dialed into the medium-term plan. So it's clearly crucial for it. Just in terms of that rate of change, but also the scale of the business today. I think the margins there have been down year-on-year kind of four quarters in a row now before it was temporary costs those were the issue, now it's inflation and supply chain. So I guess maybe give us an update on the confidence in the state of that business in aggregate on the margin plan? And then what should we expect there for that second half margin improvement in North America field specifically? So sort of a second half question on North America field, and then also just taking a step back, giving the margins are down four quarters straight. What's the conviction on that plan? George Oliver : So if you look at today, the North America business this is the one which is the most sophisticated in the portfolio. And if you look at today at demand signals, and we have \u2013 we put together a slide on this in our slide deck all indicators are actually resonating well with our customers; service, sustainability, healthy building due to the complexity of the North America supply chain we are having more headwinds that we have elsewhere in the portfolio. Net of those, the underlying margin in North America is actually improving and we feel confident that this business will add a margin to the bottom line of our company. All of those issues today amplified and temporary Julian. Julian Mitchell : And is the operating leverage in North America field in the back half is that sort of 40% as well half on half? George Oliver : The bad debt amount. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Thank you. Ryan Edelman : Brad we will take one more question. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your final question will come from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : I appreciate you guys squeezing me in. So I guess maybe just starting with a little bit more explicit detail around what's going on in China. Could you guys just describe what you're seeing and maybe you can give us a sense of comfort in what's embedded from here like what you're looking for in the back half in the Asia Pacific business? George Oliver : Yes. What we're seeing \u2013 well let's what I would say is order trends. When you look at all of Asia-Pac because that's how we report the order trends continue to stabilize and they've been pressured over the last year outside of China, but those economies are coming back as they exit COVID and are actually doing very well. You see order momentum in Northeast and Southeast Asia are very solid mostly in Japan and India. India's doing very well. We're up almost 30%. There's lots of infrastructure investment and when you look at \u2013 you asked specifically on China we're seeing good demand in China HVAC, it's led by strong industrial vertical work with our industrial refrigeration, supporting petrochem and downstream. And then when you look at orders in the quarter we're up 6%, but that was to a 39% prior year compare. And so when you look \u2013 when you look at the environment that's now from a commercial standpoint we're actually doing very well. Now, when you look at your question relative to the current environment, we have begun to see impacts in March both in China and Hong Kong. Our headquarters in Shanghai and two of our plants and I'll talk about those two, have been into some amount of shutdown, lockdown but we are back in operating today in both plants. So we have a Wuxi plant, which is chillers and that's our not only supporting China, but also other parts of the world. And we have Woohoo, which is our JCH Factory and interesting during the shutdown we had many of our employees actually stay in the plant, live in the plant and ultimately continue to create output, but that was to a much lower volume. Both now have been reopened and are operational, but not quite to where we need to be. So that's some of the pressure that Olivier talked about. Now, when you ask about out the China supply chain, since the pandemic we've been doing really good work. Our sourcing team and looking at all components that come out of that supply chain supporting the rest of the world, and so as we look at the lockdowns impacting other parts of our business it's minimal at this stage, although we're watching this closely, the Shanghai port is, I think operating like a 40% capacity and making sure that with what is left that we're \u2013 we've got contingency with other supply, but I feel really good about that. And so I think the concern Nicole short-term is, is are going to be additional lockdowns with any additional spread of the virus? And then continuing to make sure that we're getting the proper supply for anything that's left within the supply chain supporting the rest of our businesses, but overall I think we factored that into the framework we provided. Nicole DeBlase : Got it. Thanks, George. And then, I don't think we've talked about really HVAC today. I know it's a smaller business for you guys versus some of your competitor, but could you talk a little bit about the order activity in that business? I mean, my understanding is that we've seen orders turn negative year-on-year on tough comps. I'm just curious if you've seen that trend as well? George Oliver : Yes. So it's \u2013 for us it maybe a little bit different. Our North America, so when we look at resi globally, it's both inducted in the U.S. and our inducted business with Hitachi and so we're up about 15% globally. Now, when you look at North America, so we had sales up 27%, but our backlog continues to grow and we're at a point Nicole that because we're at our capacity, we're bringing on new capacity as we speak in our Mexico facility. We're governed right now by being able to take orders to our capacity expansion in Mexico. And so at this stage, it's hard to look at our orders because its book-and-bill and we're ultimately not taking orders that we can't support here, reasonably within the timeframe that they're looking for delivery. So that's a little bit of a factor for us as far as on the order side, but we still believe that on a run rate basis, that the demand that we see coming in is still very strong to be able support the distribution that that ultimately we supply to. And because of the investments that we've made in new products and now with the expansion of our capacity and distribution, we still feel really good about the prospects for that business. Now in the non \u2013 in the resi and the non-inducted that's performing very well. We're up 13% year-on-year, and this has been driven by, we've been strong in Asia-Pac up high-single digits. That's been driven by Taiwan and India and then Europe, it actually and this should be a big strength of ours going forward because of the heat pumps and the mix of heat pumps in our portfolio there that we were up 23% and our VRF is up 53%. And so incredible success there with the adoption of VRF and some of our new air-to-water heat pump technology. And so I think overall this is an important segment for us. We're making the investments, and I think we're seeing the success with the investments we're making. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, George. George Oliver : Thanks Nicole. George Oliver : So on that operator let me add a few comments here to close the call. I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. I think overall executing extremely well in our strategic initiatives, ultimately that will position us to accelerate profitable growth. We position the company to capital on some tremendous trends here that are facing our industry for the next decade plus. And although we've had short-term supply chain disruptions and they remain a challenge, I can tell you that our teams are executing well and personally involved on a regular basis and making sure every step of the way we're taking the actions require to ultimately recover. And I think with the strength of our orders and backlog provides us added confidence on our growth outlook going forward. And of course we always remain focused on, although we've had some impact short-term we are very much committed to deliver results for our customers and ultimately the long-term plan that we've committed to our shareholders. So I look forward to speaking with many of you soon, and over the next few days, and operator that would conclude our call today. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time all parties may disconnect.",

This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Michael Gates, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Michael Gates : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls third quarter fiscal 2022 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. As a reminder, before we begin, during the course of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references are made to adjusted earnings per share, EBITDA and EBIT, excluding restructuring as well as other special items. These metrics together with organic sales and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis. With that, I will turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begin with Slide 3. As we closed out the third quarter, we continued our pace of delivering solid top line growth, supported by a resilient backlog and strong order pipeline. Reported sales for the quarter increased 4% to $6.6 billion compared to the prior year and grew 8% organically, in line with our expectations for the quarter. The overall demand backdrop remains robust with total field orders up 11% organically year-over-year and 29% on a two-year stack as our record backlog continues to grow, increasing 13% organically year-over-year. The third quarter was an inflection point, and our teams have done an excellent job of executing both from a sales perspective and operationally, despite the challenging macro environment we have faced throughout the fiscal year. While supply chain disruptions have reduced the speed at which we can convert our substantial backlog, primarily in our longer cycle North America Solutions business, our enhanced focus on supply chain management is beginning to produce results. Our teams have done a great job working with suppliers to mitigate the impact of supply chain headwinds by securing critical materials and managing sites to improve production and facility utilization. I remain confident in the fundamentals we are building for fiscal 2023 and beyond. Given our prudent approach to managing operations and advancements across key growth vectors, I believe we are positioned to withstand these fluctuating headwinds and simultaneously deliver on our long-term targets. Our focus on strong business fundamentals and meeting customer demand for smart, healthy and connected buildings across the most mission-critical vertical markets remain our top priorities. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also taken great strides to deliver on our strategic initiatives over the quarter and remain on track to achieve our goal of reaching $230 million in productivity savings, realizing $170 million in cost savings year-to-date. We are also utilizing additional levers through functionalization, simplification in our ERP rollout to further drive our productivity efforts. In addition to the margin benefits from our cost optimization efforts, we are seeing improvements in price/cost, which inflected positive for the first time this year. We expect additional cost absorption to be realized in our field project backlog, which consists of higher book margin to be converted in the quarters to come. As we accelerate our growth strategy, we are confident in our ability to achieve our strategic vision of becoming the smart building solutions leader. Through our digital transformation efforts, we reached significant milestones during the quarter and year-to-date, further advancing our OpenBlue platform, executing on our commitment of investing in best-in-class technologies in fostering technology partnerships. Our efforts further strengthen our ability to capitalize on the vast and emerging secular trends across our installed base as we look to lead the way in fostering clean energy usage and healthy indoor air environments for our customers and transform our service value proposition. M&A remains another key strategic priority to further our growth objectives with several actionable opportunities in the pipeline that will allow us to support technological advancements and synergies across our portfolio. From a capital allocation standpoint, we have deployed over $2 billion in capital year-to-date, including over $1.4 billion in share repurchases and nearly $700 million in cash dividends. Our execution this quarter defines our meaningful approach to reaching our strategic objectives of commercial excellence through enhanced digital capabilities and supply chain management, all while continuously improving the diversity of our organization. We are committed to strengthening our leadership across our organization with recent appointments of Rodney Clark as VP and Chief Commercial Officer; Anu Rathninde as VP and President of Asia-Pacific; and Susan Huppertz, who assumed the role of Chief Supply Chain Officer. We pride ourselves on fostering a high-performance culture and having the teams in place to drive continued innovation to address today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenges while leading the way for the future of our industry. While there is still a long way to go until supply chain disruptions normalize, we have seen encouraging signs of operational improvement, helping to stabilize supply chain-related challenges as we realize the benefits of our management and contingency programs implemented throughout the year. Now turning to Slide 4. We continue to lead the industry in connectivity with OpenBlue and have built upon significant milestones to solve the dynamic needs of our customers. Through our fully integrated digital platform, providing the latest cybersecurity, AI enablement and digital twin capabilities, OpenBlue remains a step ahead of the competition. Last quarter, we launched the OpenBlue Gateway, which was a critical step in accelerating the connectivity of our equipment and a key enabler of our ability to deliver enhanced digital service offerings. To date, we have over 8,400 connected chillers through OpenBlue, representing an 86% increase year-over-year. The launch of our connected control platform, which represents the first integration of OpenBlue with our legacy medicines platform is also off to a great start. As mentioned last quarter, we view this as a significantly disruptive solution that will allow us to intelligently automate buildings to get to the next level of optimization for our customers into our air quality, energy efficiency and carbon reduction need as well as transform our service value proposition. In addition, we look forward to providing customers with added flexibility of data integration with OpenBlue multi-cloud capabilities. This technology gives customers the ability to seamlessly integrate hosted data from various outlets while ensuring a high availability of data and insights for our customers. Lastly, on the M&A front, we announced another exciting technology acquisition with Tempered Networks, similar to the FogHorn acquisition announced in Q1. This transaction leverages best-in-class technology to further enhance the OpenBlue technology stack. Tempered\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industry-leading edge security focused and proprietary air wall technology will be seamlessly embedded into OpenBlue Bridge to create a zero trust security pipeline that enhances the trust and connectivity of our growing network. This purpose-built system greatly simplifies the implementation of zero trust cybersecure networks, including connected equipment, which are already resonating strongly with our customers. This is critical as we think about our strategy for AI-enabled edge devices and the importance of data security for our customers, and we are excited to welcome the Tempered team to Johnson Controls. Next, moving to Slide 5. Our differentiated best-in-class digital services, while still in the early stages are maturing and delivering results as we start to capitalize on the flexibility and solutions offered to our direct channel customers. Core services benefited during the quarter with orders and revenues up over 7% and 8% year-over-year and 20% and 19%, respectively, on a two-year stack. Our overall service attach rate increased another 70 basis points in the quarter, bringing us closer to our target on a run rate basis. Moving along to Slide 6. Turning to our growth vectors. With climate change continuing to pose an imminent risk, decarbonization is an increasingly significant goal nationally and globally, both in the public and private sectors. At Johnson Controls, we drive our business forward by recognizing there is a role for us to play in global decarbonization and have taken great strides in growing our best-in-class partnership ecosystem to address our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commitment towards net zero. Through our collaboration with Forrester, we have commissioned our proprietary sustainability maturity assessment tool, helping customers deliver on their net zero goals. We have strengthened our partnership with Accenture, which together will deliver two new Johnson Controls OpenBlue innovation centers, helping further the development of AI-enabled building control system, products and services to accelerate our development and deployment of a full portfolio of digital solutions. Year-to-date, our sustainability infrastructure business has booked over $595 million in orders, and we remain on track to deliver over $1 billion of orders from fiscal year 2022, representing a 15% increase year-over-year. In addition, our $7.2 billion pipeline remains healthy with over 200 active opportunities consisting of large multi-national customers spanning across numerous end markets from hospitality, health care, beverage and industrial. Turning to Slide 7, shifting to a Healthy Buildings. The market opportunity remains strong with global government support for indoor air quality investments on the rise. We remain uniquely positioned to capture this trend and help customers manage challenges through our OpenBlue indoor air quality as a service. This turnkey offering has continued to gain traction, providing customers with a long-term proactive approach to meet the ever-changing health and safety compliance standards while leveraging our advanced OpenBlue technology stack to optimize costs and increase productivity. Notably, during the quarter, we delivered strong results. Year-to-date, Healthy Buildings orders have increased 27% year-over-year. Our Healthy Buildings pipeline represents over $1.3 billion and has grown 33% year-over-year. And finally, on Slide 8, we continue to demonstrate our leadership and sustainability, data privacy and diversity, and we are honored to be recognized for our efforts. Most notably, we would like to recognize our own Human Resources Officer, Marlon Sullivan, who was recently named as one of 2022\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most influential black executives in the corporate world. To close out my prepared remarks, I am confident about what the future holds and how our team is positioned to lead the way towards a more sustainable future for our customers and communities. We have made great progress across our key growth sectors and have managed to navigate a difficult macro environment while executing our strategic initiatives. Despite the temporary headwinds, our path forward remains bright, and we are in a perfect position to execute on our resilient backlog demand through 2023 and beyond. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to turn the call over to Olivier to walk you through the financial details in the quarter and update you on our outlook. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the summary on Slide 9. Sales in the quarter were up 8% organically at the midpoint of our original guidance for high single-digit growth with price contributing nearly 8 points, in line with what we originally anticipated. We saw strong performance across our shorter-cycle global product portfolio up 9%. Our longer-cycle field businesses also performed well, up 7%, with further growth in both service and in store. Segment EBITDA declined 3% with margins down 110 basis points to 15.1%. Favorable price cost and the benefit of our ongoing SG&A and COGS programs were offset by 104 basis points margin headwind from lower volumes and supply chain-related challenges. EPS of $0.85 increased 3% year-over-year, benefiting from positive price/cost as well as lower share count and absorbed a $0.03 FX headwind versus our guide assumptions. Free cash flow was down in the quarter as we continue to manage supply chain disruptions in order to meet customer demands. Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 10. Overall, operations contributed $0.02 versus the prior year, including a $0.07 benefit from our COGS and SG&A productivity programs, which helped to offset lower volumes and supply chain challenges. Underlying segment earnings were net $0.05 headwind year-over-year. Please turn to Slide 11. Orders for our field businesses increased 11% in aggregate with continued momentum on a two-year stack basis. Service orders were led by high teens growth in our shorter-term transactional business. Install orders increased low double digits in the quarter, primarily driven by demand for applied HVAC and controls systems. Field backlog grew 13% to $11.1 billion, a $1.3 billion increase versus the prior year and up $174 million sequentially. In our project-based field business, we continue to below backlog with higher-margin work. Our supply chain disruptions subside, and our mix becomes more favorable, we expect margin accretion in the quarter to come. Lastly, our Global Products backlog grew by more than 50% to $2.2 billion and continues to show strength. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discuss our segment results in more detail on Slide 12 and 13. Sales in North America were up 10% organically with broad-based growth across the portfolio, led primarily by strength in our applied business, up low double digits. Fire & Security grew high single digits. Our Sustainability Infrastructure business grew low double digits with strong growth of about 25% on a two-year stack basis. Orders were up 15% with high teens growth in applied, driven by continued equipment demand in the data center and health care verticals. Fire & Security orders were up mid-single digits and backlog ended the quarter at $7.2 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Segment margin decreased 400 basis points to 10.7%, a direct result of headwinds from projects booked prior to acceleration of cost 12 to 18 months ago as well as the pace and mix of backlog conversion and lower absorption due to supply chain constraints. Overall, supply chain was a $45 million headwind in the quarter, and we expect this to improve as we head into Q4. In EMEALA, we saw continued strength in the Fire & Security business, which grew at a high single-digit rate in Q3. Industrial Refrigeration declined mid-single digits driven by supply chain delays and customer site readiness, but was offset by high single-digit growth in our HVAC business, specifically in the UK region. Orders were up 8%, led by mid-teens growth in our Fire & Security platform. Backlog was up 10% to $2.2 billion. Underlying margin performance driven by positive price/cost and the benefit of cost savings, offset by lower volumes. Sales in Asia Pacific declined 1%, a direct result of multiple lockdowns in China. Overall, China declined 7%, and the rest of Asia increased 6% with growth primarily in Industrial Refrigeration. Orders increased 2% with continued strength in applied, driven primarily by continued momentum within the industrial vertical in China with a continued pipeline of infrastructure investment across key verticals like data centers, semiconductor, petrochemical and health care. Backlog of $1.7 billion was up 1% year-over-year. The 90 basis point increase in margin was primarily the result of positive price/cost and the benefit of cost savings, which more than offset lower volumes from the COVID lockdowns. Sales in our shorter-cycle global products increased 9% in Q3, benefiting from strong price realization of 11%. Volumes declined by 2% due to supply chain headwinds and COVID lockdowns in China. Commercial HVAC product sales were up high single digits in aggregate with strength in light commercial driven by more than 15% growth in North America and low double-digit growth in VRF. Applied HVAC sales were up 8%, driven by strong growth in Europe and APAC. Global Residential HVAC sales were up 9% in aggregate. North America resi HVAC was up 22%, benefiting from both higher growth in our equipment and part business and strong price realization. Outside of North America, our resi HVAC business grew mid-single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe, driven by strong demand for our Hitachi residential heat pumps. APAC Resi HVAC sales grew low single digits led by strong growth in India. Fire & Security products grew high single digits in aggregate, led by our specialty products in Europe and North America, up 27% and 18%, respectively. Although not recorded in our official field order backlog, Global Products orders were up mid-single digits organically and our third-party backlog exceeded $2 billion. EBITDA margins expanded 110 basis points to 22.2% as the benefit of productivity actions and favorable mix more than offset headwinds from supply chain disruptions. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 14. We ended Q3 with $1.5 billion in available cash and net debt at 2.2 times, still at the low end of our target range of 2 to 2.5 times. As I previously mentioned, free cash flow was impacted by supply chain disruptions. To meet our customer demand, we are carrying higher inventory levels and our supply chain normalizes, we expect gradual recovery of trade working capital. We repurchased another 7 million shares for approximately $400 million in the third quarter, bringing us to $1.4 billion for the year. Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discuss our refined guidance on Slide 15. Underlying demand trends across most of our businesses continue to grow, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m encouraged by the pace of all the growth we have seen year-to-date. We are on pace to meet our commitments despite continued pressure from FX. We are refining our full year adjusted EPS range to $2.98 to $3.02, absorbing $0.06 of FX headwinds. EPS growth of 12% to 14% is expected year-over-year. On the top line, we expect to grow 8% to 9% organically. Price is expected to contribute 7 points in line with our prior expectations, fully offsetting additional inflation. For the full year, we still expect to be slightly positive on price/cost. Segment margin is now expected to come minus 10 to minus 20 basis points, reflecting pressure related to additional price on the top line with minimum margin contribution and the mix impact associated with the supply chain disruptions in North America. These factors account for nearly 150 basis points headwind versus the prior year. Full year free cash flow conversion is now expected to be 80% as the inventory bid in the first half combined with slower backlog conversion create nearly a $200 million headwind to our prior guidance. Due to the actions taken to mitigate the supply chain impacts, we are not anticipating the typical seasonal inventory drawdown. Turning to Q4. EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.96 to $1, which assumes organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and a segment margin improvement of 40 to 60 basis points, offsetting $0.03 FX headwind. While near-term supply chain disruptions still empower backlog conversion rates, we continue to meet our commitments in a challenging environment. We have seen positive improvements in our run rate cost optimization efforts and price/cost headwinds. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to convert our backlog in 2023 and realize sequential margin recovery as we move towards long-term targets. With that, operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question today comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna : Yes. I have two questions. First, if you could talk about the NCI variance that you described in the guidance? And secondly, if you could just opine on fiscal 2023. Last quarter, you mentioned you might catch up that, which was lost this year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 next year. Do you still feel confident of that? Because when we look at street numbers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for 20% plus earnings growth. I just wanted to get your view on that. Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : Gautam, good morning. I hope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well. Thank you for your questions. I will take the first one and George will take the second one. In terms of NCI, if you look at particularly the segment EBITDA margin in the quarter where we had a slight miss, this is mainly due to the underperformance of our joint venture with Hitachi. And this is particularly due to the slowdown we have experienced in Japan residential, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re catching up this miss in NCI, and we are largely planning that to be the case in Q4 as well. George Oliver : Gautam, as it relates to 2023, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say, we are continuing to look at the potential headwinds and signs of a recessionary environment. What is really positive is, our order velocity doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t indicate this, and our order book margin profile continues to strengthen and materialize as we planned for 2023. If you look at our backlog, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a strong, resilient backlog of $13 billion. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made up of over $11 billion in the field and over $2 billion in Global Products. And as Olivier talked about, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking projects over the last year, obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken into account a much higher level of inflation that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s booked into those projects as well as have accreted the margins that we booked. And so on a go-forward basis, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve inflected here in third quarter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a very attractive margin rate that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to play out as we go forward. And so then the other opportunity that we have, as we talked about last quarter, is that we ramped up in the third quarter. So we have a seasonal pickup from second to third, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very pleased with the progress we made in supporting that volume increase in third quarter. Now we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a lot of recovery, because we were in a step up because of the seasonality. Now going forward, with all the work that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done with our suppliers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got line of sight to materials that will sustain this level of output in fourth quarter and continue as we look at Q1 and Q2. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be important that we continue to improve the turn times in our project-based business, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on doing as well as then the higher-margin projects ultimately playing out through the course of the year. And then in addition, I would say what we feel really good about is the progress of our services with the digital services that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re offering and how that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resonating with our customers and now being able to take our installed base and layer on a whole new level of services with OpenBlue. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really starting to take hold. And then I think if we do get into a recessionary period, with the secular trends that we see in our space are very attractive, especially now with some of the regulations and legislation coming through requiring reduction in energy demand and requiring heat pumps and the like. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fully aware of the risk. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been building a pipeline, a very strong pipeline that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be playing through here very well in 2023, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a playbook \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make sure that our playbook is ready so as we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if we were to go into a downturn, we would be able to navigate it similar to what we did during the pandemic. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on what we can control. Certainly, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited about how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re executing our strategy, and certainly, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you more update as we go through Q4 and layout 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Sorry, I hoped on late. I missed some of the intro, but have you guys addressed what \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from a cash and an earnings perspective, what maybe could be considered pushed into next year. Is there any change in the messaging that what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re missing this year is not necessarily lost that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of pushed forward? Olivier Leonetti : Steve, we have not covered that. Good morning. From a free cash flow standpoint, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experiencing today is an increased level of inventory resulting from the actions we have taken to manage our supply chain disruptions and meet our customer demands. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely an industry trend. Steve, if you look at the KPI for cash conversion cycle, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re improving DSO or days better year-on-year, improving DPO seven days favorable year-on-year. And the drive we have in free cash flow at the moment is due to inventory seven days up in DIO year-on-year. We expect, as a result, the free cash flow conversion for the year to be about 80%, we had a guide of about 90%, if you remember, Steve, and to your point, no change in the fundamentals. This inventory will go down, mainly based upon what George just said, and we are totally convinced that we will be able to go back to the 100% free cash flow target we have committed to you and our investors. Steve Tusa : Yes. And I guess, just following up on the earnings front on that side. You had mentioned last quarter, I think, that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually, you go down seasonally 4Q to 1Q, but you should see kind of an above seasonal performance given this is supply constraint related, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about having visibility to a consistent level of supply. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether you mean that in a seasonal sense or not. But like is the run rate heading into next year still expected to be better than seasonal as these revenues and earnings and cash push forward? I guess, more on a revenue and earnings perspective. You kind of answered the cash question, I guess. George Oliver : Steve, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just address that with Gautam as it relates to 2023. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working on is, we had a challenge going into the third quarter to ramp up our supply chain to be able to achieve from a full log standpoint, the typical step up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very pleased with the progress we made in being able to do that, supporting the third quarter. Now as we go forward, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working on a forward-looking basis to maintain the component supply so that we can remain at this elevated level of output through Q4 as well as as we position for the first half of next year. Typically, we go down. We typically go down in the first and second quarter because of the seasonality and then begin to pick up again. And so as we said last time and it still holds true today that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to sustain this elevated level of output, begin to accelerate the turn of the projects that we have in backlog and be able to have in the first half be significant relative to a growth standpoint because of the price that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the backlog that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to turn and then the ability to be able to turn our projects faster to be able to get through that backlog. Steve Tusa : Right. So above seasonal in the first half? I guess, is a simple question. Do you expect it to be above seasonal in the first half? George Oliver : We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from historical, we will be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 historically, we will be above that rate in the first half. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : Steve, yes, if you look at the backlog today, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a record high for the two businesses we have in our field business. Backlog is at about $11 billion, up 13% year-on-year. And in our Global Products shorter cycle, the backlog is up 50% at more than $2 billion. So as George indicated, our supply chain gets better. That should flow through in the first half of the year. Steve Tusa : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you, good morning. Just back on supply chain, but maybe just a kind of a different wrinkle. Also been a fair amount of issues just on job sites, right, construction crews, that sort of thing. So even though your confidence level is going up on kind of inbound materials, it sounds like into your factories. Just wonder if you could kind of address that other side of the equation. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outside of your control and the confidence to kind of step up to this higher revenue rate in the fourth quarter as a function of that? George Oliver : Yes. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great question, Jeff. When you look at where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the biggest impact is in our North America business, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the convergence of three supply chains. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only what our customers are doing, what we supply to our North America business, especially around building management controls, and then ultimately, what we buy from other OEs that contribute to the project-based business we built. And so all three have been challenged. What I \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the third quarter, we have significantly improved our turn of our building management systems and the digital content that we provide to our North America business. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to work with the other OEs and seeing improvements in their deliveries as well as the line of sight to sustain those deliveries going forward. And then I think as labor begins to subside, the labor pressures that everyone has had to deal with during this cycle, I think, are beginning to subside. So that what I think would impact the broader customer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the ability for the customer not to execute more on plan relative to the projects that are being completed. So I think those are the three elements that drive our success. We see a net result in the quarter was about $45 million in lower absorption in North America. That will continue to improve as we go through Q4, that will be reduced. And then on a go-forward basis, as I said, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get back. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got projects on average. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re turning \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really about two months. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken two months longer that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to start to see that turn reduced and getting back to where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been historically. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to say precisely what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be, Jeff, but I have confidence working across all of those factors that things are improving, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to turn faster. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to get additional volumes through here, especially as we look at the first half of 2023, and that should play out pretty well for us. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, a lot of that is embedded into the margin question. I guess, the other key part of the margin question is this dynamic of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working through the backlog, right, and kind of price catching up given the natural lag in some of your businesses. We obviously see our margin forecast here for the quarter. In aggregate, I just wonder if you could give us a little sense of how we think about the regions, in particular North America in Q4 from a margin rate basis. Olivier Leonetti : So Jeff, if you look at our margin today, we believe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we see Q3 as being an inflection point. We were positive in price/cost for the first time in the year by $20 million. We expect to be $30 million positive in price/cost in Q4 and positive in price/cost for the year. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t communicated that in our prepared remarks, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re observing today that our booked margin for orders are 4 points of our bill margin in Q3, and that is going to flow to the P&L as we realize our backlog. And as we have just said, as George indicated, the turn end of the backlog is improving by about two months, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s starting to be the expectation. So you have higher backlog at higher margin turning faster. So we believe that margin going forward is going to be a tailwind for our business. Going back quickly to our North America, which has been most impacted by those supply chain challenges, you see, again, Q3 was an inflection point. We are anticipating an increase of margin in North America Q3 over Q4 to be about close to 4.5 points and the business margin in North America clearly turning around, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to kind of circle back to the fourth quarter sort of margin construct. So in Q3, you had 8% organic growth and the margin down 110 bps. Q4, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying sort of 9%, 10% organic growth, the margin up 50 bps. So just trying to ask you to unpack perhaps that swing in a little bit more detail. I think one element is, there was no volume growth in Q3 and maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re assuming 2 or 3 points of volume growth in Q4. Price/cost, I think, was supply chain and labor was a 60 bps headwind in Q3. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if that is a tailwind in Q4. Maybe just help us understand some of those moving pieces that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving the margin there to turn around. Olivier Leonetti : So you have a mix going on now in the margin equation. If you go back to our field business, we price jobs at the start of the inflationary period. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anticipate in the job we priced, obviously, this inflation and we correctly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we quickly adjusted this. Now you start to see this higher margin backlog in the field business to go through the P&L. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mainly why we expect to be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we were price/cost positive in Q3, and that will accelerate in Q4 and going forward. The best example we said, Julian, is the statistics are quoted for North America where you see a significant increase in margin sequentially, so about 4.5 points Q4 over Q3 in segment EBITDA margin. And you see it also in the delta between booked margin and also bill margin as well. So one being higher than the other by 4 points. George Oliver : Let me just add, Julian, too. The other is the mix. As we got behind on our building management system, the electronic systems that go into our solution set, certainly, that has a big impact because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a multiple there as it gets installed and then serviced within our business. And so we saw our accelerating recovery during the third quarter. We just had a very strong July with our electronic building management systems, and that drives significant revenue as well as from a mix standpoint getting back to where we were historically with that content. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another contributor. In addition to what Olivier said about the pricing. Just to understand this pricing dynamic in our field-based business, up until it was over a year ago when we were going to be in a inflationary period, but not the hyperinflation that we experienced, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working to claw back on those contracts. Obviously, the additional cost, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to get it fully recovered. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been booking the last year at a much higher level of cost with a much higher level of anticipated inflation and then above and beyond that booking very attractive margins in this environment because of the demand. And so what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see and what Olivier said is seeing the mix now of those projects beginning to come through with the higher mix of content that is helping the margin rate. Olivier Leonetti : Julian, one statistic. Pricing in the field business in aggregate in the P&L, 3 points in Q1. In Q4, we expect it to be about 7 points just to complement the analytics we have been talking about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : George, wonder if we could start off on EMEA Fire & Security. It looks like, EMEA orders have held in pretty well quarterly, some of that price you just noted that the price uptick has been pretty good. But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to really match maybe some of the like energy retrofit or energy scarcity themes that might be holding up demand elsewhere in Europe? What are you guys seeing on that? And there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have there been any whispers of the market of a slowdown? George Oliver : Yes. So when we look at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you really have to look at Fire & Security more broadly and not necessarily by domain. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been incorporating this into more of our building systems offering, so not just Fire & Security, but other offerings. Certainly, the domain itself is very attractive because of the service that we spin out. And then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going back after the installed base as part of our services to be able to upgrade and then with connectivity be able to perform more services. So what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is that playing out. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re creating demand with the installed base. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re upgrading. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re connecting, and then ultimately, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re capitalizing on what there is for new projects that are coming through the market. And so I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing an output of that, and I think the team is executing very well. The other thing, Josh, is that we have been constrained in the semiconductor with the semiconductor materials. And our teams have done a really nice job working with all of our semiconductor manufacturers with line of sight now to run rates that are much higher than what we were achieving. And so our ability to be able to then sell and convert, especially on some of the shorter cycle projects has been a real advantage for us. And so I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a combination of those elements. And we saw our Fire & Security in total actually very attractive across the board with the work that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing not only in the product level, but also the solution set. And then more importantly, the way that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re executing on the installed base with service. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful. And then just on pricing, we covered a lot of ground in terms of catching up on inflation, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sort of wondering what it looks like on the other end. So the field business, more like bidded jobs rather than list pricing, I guess. Is there a point at which it becomes harder to hold up price with some of the inputs maybe being distant inflationary or deflationary like some of the raw math. Like how do you guys go about maintaining the price on some of those bidded jobs down the line? George Oliver : Yes. So the core to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is creating increased value. And so when you look at the solutions that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re providing, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leveraging OpenBlue, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really differentiating the type of solutions that we serve to the most attractive verticals. And as a result of that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been getting high demand and putting high-quality backlog into \u00e2\u0080\u0093 high-quality projects into our backlog. And so when you look historically, our backlog is pretty sticky because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all typically funded and ultimately, started in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and no matter if we get into a recessionary period, that price holds up relative to how we execute on the projects. And so I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this focus on our strategy and the value proposition, on the returns that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting with the additional content that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting into the solution set and then ultimately, building an installed base that enables us to go back and not only have that installed base connected, but then build a suite of solutions, our services \u00e2\u0080\u0093 digital services that we apply to that installed base on a go-forward basis, which makes it really sticky. So those are the fundamentals of how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re booking. And I would tell you, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been extremely disciplined. When this all accelerated, it was over a year ago last summer when the view that inflation wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be transitory, and there was really going to be a significant ramp up. I can assure you that on a go-forward basis, we were booking that into the baseline. Now obviously, what you saw in third quarter was the inflection point of the older projects prior to that coming through in the third quarter. But as you go forward, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a higher mix of these newer projects that ultimately are fully costed and then they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tied to a higher value proposition that ultimately is a key element of the overall pricing. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Appreciate all the details. George Oliver : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Yes. So maybe I do want to start on the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just to make sure I understand the supply chain and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embedded in the guidance for 4Q. I mean is there still an impact from supply chain embedded in your guidance? And then also just on the EMEALA margins, I may have missed this, very helpful commentary on North America. But what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the expected EMEALA margin in 4Q? George Oliver : I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take the first on the supply chain, and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ask Olivier to comment on the EMEALA margins. What I said was, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a noticeable improvement in our supply chain. And we knew from second quarter to third quarter, there was going to be a big sequential ramp because of our normal seasonality, and we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be able to recover significantly in that quarter. But on a go-forward basis, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building resiliency in working with our suppliers for the supplier materials to be able to sustain that level of production on a go-forward basis. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say, overall, we made good progress. And then what I would say is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting much better visibility on a go-forward basis. So when we look at run rates any one of our domains or any one of our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HVAC domains or Fire & Security, we have a pretty good line of sight now to the critical materials on a run rate basis that sustains our volumes. If you look at our volumes, at least in Global Products, both the internal and external volume that we have, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at an elevated level. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue at the level we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at or maybe a little bit better sequentially into Q4. And our goal is to continue to sustain the supply chain as we set up for the first half of next year. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the plan. And some of that now Olivier can talk about the margin structure and how that ultimately comes through, especially I think the question was around EMEALA. Olivier Leonetti : Yes. So two comments. One, on the supply chain, just to give you a number, Joe, we still have planning for some disruption. About half of what we had in Q3, if you want to give a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to use a number, the disruption is expected to be a headwind of about $35 million in Q4 due to supply chain. In terms of EMEALA, largely what played out in EMEALA in Q3 is what we have discussed for North America. If you were to look at Q4, we expect EMEALA margin to be flat year-on-year, a very similar trend to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting for North America where the margin should be directionally flat year-on-year as well. Joe Ritchie : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s super helpful. Thank you, both. George Oliver : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, everybody. Can you hear me okay? George Oliver : Hey Scott, yes. Scott Davis : George, can you talk about the Healthy Buildings orders? Are these competitively bid out? Are they \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just a little bit of color on kind of the profitability and what you expect out of these? George Oliver : Yes. So what I would say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called this is really playing out to our strengths, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been really attractive. I think from the start, we sized it to be $10 billion or $15 billion with a double-digit CAGR. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing out over the last two years at or maybe even above that. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been buoyed by the U.S. relief and stimulus funding. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other global government programs that are focused on IAQ. And a lot of this is actually converging with the focus on sustainability. So when you look at our year-to-date orders, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up over $400 million in 2022, up 27%, and that was over a strong year last year, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing. We see the budgeting that our customers have relative to doing these upgrades. And so the pipeline right now is about $1.3 billion on a go forward basis. And I think what differentiates us, Scott, to your question is, the OpenBlue indoor air quality as a service, where it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just one domain, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our ability to be able to take the combination of what we do with our equipment, with the digital aspect of the building that ultimately delivers the outcome at the highest level relative to what we deliver. And therefore, you get obviously the returns for very attractive returns. And I think what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing here is patenting the optimization solutions that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re developing and enabling our customers, which takes into account not just the Healthy Buildings aspect, but also balancing that with the energy cost that are incurred to be able to elevate the indoor air quality and actually not just use additional energy, actually consume \u00e2\u0080\u0093 conserve energy while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re delivering a higher outcome for the customer. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to advance our portfolio. I think over the last two years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had 25 products \u00e2\u0080\u0093 new products, new solutions launched supporting this effort. I think we feel very good about the continued growth rate and the margin profile that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting on these solutions that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re serving our customers with. Scott Davis : Yes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really helpful, George. And then separately, if I look at Slide 4, you talked about total chiller connections, 8,400, and then growth in chiller connection is 86%. And then revenue from connected devices up 8%. How are those connected? Meaning, would we expect a rising revenue growth rate going forward as those short connections start to generate revenues for you? Or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to kind of reconcile how those numbers match up. George Oliver : Yes. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what I would say, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very pleased with the progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making with services in general, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the services flywheel, where we went back and have assessed our entire installed base. We looked at what we were doing today with more of our mechanical services. And then what we did over the last \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really been the last year, going back to mine that installed base and getting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 going back and getting that older equipment connected, ultimately providing offerings for \u00e2\u0080\u0093 once you get the connection, the use of the data and ultimately developing additional data services that optimizes the use of the chiller. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been not only with the existing contracts, getting them all connected as part of our existing contract and then being able to take the new services and add on to that. So you get more revenue per customer, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also been mining the installed base to be able to pick up some of that installed base that whatever reason we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been serving. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the enabler of that, Scott is OpenBlue. So we launched a very efficient gateway with OpenBlue that allows us to have very \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is very efficient in how we can go back and connect it and get the immediate use of the data. And that, as a result, has accelerated our ability to connect. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up to over 8,400, up 86% year-on-year, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only going to accelerate on a go-forward basis. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helping our attach rate. And so when you go in and whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new piece of equipment or an existing PSA, you go in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with that attachment, our renewals are much higher as well as when you put out a new piece of equipment, it enables us to be able to manage that equipment through warranty much more efficiently. And it makes it more sticky to that go forward, getting the service on a go-forward basis. Those two combined and then with some added services we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve launched, OpenBlue Chiller, Vibrational Analysis, Energy Advisory, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of other added capabilities that once you get that connection, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more value that can be created in how you serve that installed base. So those are the elements that come together, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very encouraged with the progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made to date. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really helpful to hear that. Thank you, George. Good luck to you guys. George Oliver : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A couple of ground here. Just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 George Oliver : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to go back to these 4Q margins, and Olivier, I think you pointed to 11% margins in EMEALA and 15% plus in North America. When we look at that sequential improvement, you talked about the 4 points better book backlog versus what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being built today, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also talked about supply chain improvements. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering, when we go from 3Q to 4Q in those two segments, how much of it is getting that better price backlog out versus supply chain improvements. And then maybe just on this 4 points of improved margin, what is the cost assumption you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making there? Are we using current costs? Are we assuming some inflation metric on future costs? Olivier Leonetti : So many questions here, Nigel. In the improvement in the margin in Q4, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mainly due to now us realizing our billing orders which were booked about 9, 12 months ago at our lower level of inflation, and the improvement you see now in the P&L is largely due to the realization of those orders at high margin, less to the improvement in the turn rate of the backlog. The turn-in of the backlog is starting, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be mainly pronounced next year. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the assumption. In terms of cost, we are assuming today in our cost future inflation, so future inflation in high-single digits. And the orders we have been realizing and you saw that the order flow for our business was very strong. The order flow is actually based upon business won with this high-single digit inflation, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Okay. Now since I asked about five questions there, you actually answered it very efficiently. So thanks for that. And then maybe talk about the international residential business. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously a bit of a black box for many of us. Maybe just address kind of how you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe, George, how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re viewing some of the major territories as we go into 2023, China, Japan? And then maybe just address the European heat pump opportunity and how well-positioned Hitachi is for that? George Oliver : Yes. So if you look at our JCH business, obviously, we have a strong presence in Japan and Taiwan. Taiwan has been performing very well. Japan has been a little bit softer as it relates to the residential offering. But the rest of the world, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been expanding our footprint and working to gain share, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually been doing very well. India has come back from where they were pretty much \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pretty soft during the whole COVID cycle, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming back. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing nice growth in Europe because of the offering and the strong heat pump portfolio that we have within the JCH portfolio. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing nice pickup in Europe, and we continue to work to expand our presence here in North America. But overall, I mean, even though we have high growth, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to a small base. So overall, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from a reinvestment standpoint, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had high reinvestment. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a lot of new products, new heat pumps that are coming into the market, and we feel very good about it on a go-forward basis. Olivier Leonetti : Let me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and what was the second part, Nigel? Nigel Coe : It is about the European heat pump opportunity. I think you addressed that. So within that... George Oliver : Well, what I would say on that because I think it is important there. When you look at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in Europe, the decarbonizing trend is underpinned by the solid strategy with the green deal, which is to get to net zero by 2050. And then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underpinned by EU-level legislation, which is climate law, energy efficiency directive as well as energy performance of Buildings. And so then you see what happened with this repower EU directive, which is to create independence from Russian fossil fuels by \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by 2027, this is going to require new public buildings must be zero emission by 2027. The worst-performing buildings 15% of the stock have to be upgraded, and then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be an obligation to get an energy performance certificate. So when you play that out, Nigel, given our offering across our entire HVAC portfolio, it does play to our strengths with what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing to get to low GWP, at the same time, reducing the energy consumed for the applications that we bring into that market. And so we feel very good about that. Olivier Leonetti : And an additional statistic, Nigel, in terms of heat pump revenue through the portfolio, not only in resi in Q3, it was close to $1 billion for the quarter only. Nigel Coe : And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s across the whole portfolio? Olivier Leonetti : It is indeed. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, Olivier. George Oliver : Thanks, Nigel. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Just start off with a clarification on sizing the impact of the supply chain disruptions. You said $45 million this quarter, improving to a $35 million impact in the fourth quarter. Just want to make sure I understand what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re including in that. When you initially said, it sounded like it was from lower absorption in the factory, but are you including all the other related inefficiencies, freight expediting, component shortages, where you got project insulation gets delayed, change orders, all that field service disruption. Is that included in this $45 million improving to $35 million? Olivier Leonetti : So let me clarify. $65 million is the level of disruption in Q3. We expect it to be half of that in Q4. So give or take, $35 million. And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, this is an all inclusive number. Absorption and other disruptions to our business indeed. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an all-in number. Deane Dray : All right. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really helpful. And then just last one, and maybe this is from prior  and every time I hear about ERP rollout, that makes me really nervous. So Olivier, just what modules are you on? Typically, the P&L receivable modules are the ones that had the biggest installation risk, but where does that rollout stand? Olivier Leonetti : So we are two years in two or five years project. So we can speak with confidence about where we are now. Usually, when you have an issue, this is at the start. And so far, we have been really meeting our milestones. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to launch for our field business, one only ERP on Oracle Cloud. And for our global business, mainly having manufacturing part of it, we will use SAP. And we are very pleased with the way our teams have executed and with the benefit that we will have across the organization from a productivity but also top line impact. No question about this, Deane. Deane Dray : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to hear. Thank you. George Oliver : Thanks, Deane. And why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I take a minute here to wrap up. I want to thank everyone for joining our call today. While 2022 was a headwind and the fundamentals of our business have never been better as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working through this, we continue to see strong order momentum, continued service performance and a record backlog with much higher book margins. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made significant progress with our operational initiatives and the cost reduction measures and are in an optimal position going forward to now capitalize on the strong demand that we continue to see while leveraging our disruptive digital platform. I can say, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very confident in our outlook, and as we close out the fiscal year and look to drive significant value for our shareholders, customers and communities heading into 2023, and I do look forward to speaking with many of you soon over the next few days. So operator, that concludes our call today. Operator : That concludes today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

These metrics together with organic sales, free cash flow and other measures specified in the slide presentation are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis. With that, I will turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I will start off with a quote to look back of fiscal year 2022 and update you on our progress across our strategic priorities. Olivier will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2023 guidance. As always, we will leave the remainder of the call to take your questions.  Let\u2019s begin with Slide 3, as we rounded out fiscal year 2022, we deliver another quarter of solid results that had us meeting or exceeding our updated outlook for the full year. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment that\u2019s our unprecedented inflation levels, foreign exchange headwinds and continued supply chain disruptions, we achieved robust top-line growth and maintain margin strength as we closed out the fiscal year.  Compared to the prior year, reported sales for the year increased approximately 7% to $25 billion and grew 9% organically, in line with the high end of our guide. The strong demand is also shown in total field orders, up approximately 10% organically year-over-year and our record backlog which grew significantly up 13% year-over-year. This strong demand backdrop further highlights our unique value proposition for mission-critical products and services supported by secular trends that continue to drive the industry. We\u2019ve made significant progress over the year working closely with our suppliers to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. We\u2019ve also continued to execute our productivity savings plan exceeding our $230 million cost savings target throughout the fiscal year.  Lastly, our disciplined approach to pricing has helped drive sequential margin improvement offsetting material foreign exchange impacts as we continued to cycle through our higher margin backlog during the second half of fiscal year.  With our focus on fundamentals and execution, our teams work this year positions Johnson Controls to capitalize on our strong momentum heading into fiscal year 2023. Overall, 2022 was a significant year in improving our operations and increasing our competitive edge as we continue to deliver on enhancing our digital capabilities, leading the way for smart and connected building solutions  Across the organization, we have continued to invest in key technologies and foster partnerships allowing us to capitalize in the vectors of growth we serve. We have also continued to gain market share across our global products and services driven by commercial HVAC, industrial refrigeration and fire detection. We are in a great position to realize the benefits of our transformative service offerings through our differentiated digital platform. And as the trends for a healthy and sustainable buildings continue to expand, I am confident in the strength of our capabilities, which continues to serve the needs of our customers.  Lastly, while the market is faced with macro uncertainties, we are seeing tailwinds within our business. Favorable government incentives across the world, global heat pump demand and continued backlog strength will provide us with additional momentum heading into fiscal year 2023. Now turning to Slide 4. OpenBlue suite of connected solutions continues to play a vital role in meeting our customers\u2019 needs laying the blueprint for the future of smart buildings. In fiscal year 2022, we have significantly expanded our suite of digital services and offerings spanning across a breadth of devices from connected chillers, industrial refrigeration equipment to connected controls and BAS systems.  Today we have enhanced the existing connectivity of almost 11,000 chillers through OpenBlue representing a 106% year-over-year. This provides customers with added levels of connectivity to monitor and improve performance with actionable insights. We\u2019ve also made significant progress in advancing the latest addition of our OpenBlue Bridge.  With this solution we can seamlessly reduce the complexity of the integrating devices and expand the range of building solutions and devices that interface with the OpenBlue stack. This provides our customers with the added benefits of AI at the edge. It gives them the peace of mind that comes with zero trust cybersecurity exclusively tailored for operational equipment. Our enterprise Software-as-a-solution offerings continue to expand standing from comprehensive enterprise management to specific customer use cases covering decarbonization, occupant health and safety. Along with these added capabilities, our footprint is also expanding. During the fourth quarter, we are proud to announce our recently launched OpenBlue Enterprise Management Solution for AliCloud supporting our expansion of smart building solutions into China. The future lies with OpenBlue and we are excited to continue disrupting the building environment as we look ahead to the upcoming year.  Moving on to Slide 5. While our digital growth strategies continue to mature, we have accelerated our core service growth through field business and the strength of our OpenBlue service offerings. In fiscal year 2022, core service orders increased during the fourth quarter with orders and revenues up over 7% and 8% year-over-year. By 2024, we anticipate additional service revenue opportunities of more than $2 billion.  On to Slide 6, turning to our growth vectors we are successfully growing our sustainability initiatives. Johnson Controls is uniquely positioned to take full advantage of recent favorable market tailwinds including credits for renewable offerings from the Inflation Reduction Act to an actionable shift towards heat pump usage as Europe continues to push for energy independence and low emission alternatives. Heat pump demand continues to be a momentum driver and we have gained market share realizing $800 million in the quarter representing 48% of total HVAC sales. Our partnership with Microsoft is driving results in their Beijing\u2019s West Campus helping reduce emissions and improve uptime.  In addition, our work with Colorado State University has helped transform the campus. It reached net zero electricity throughout our 20 year relationship. We help customers design, digitize and deploy solutions to achieve net zero. We are continuously expanding our OpenBlue net zero buildings offerings. Decarbonization is a priority among our customers and as climate change poses an impending risk, we continue to build out energy efficient and secure solutions.  During Q4, we had our largest historical quarter of about $420 million in orders, which led to secured orders of over $1 billion for the full year growing 12% year-over-year.  Turning to Slide 7, the healthy buildings market opportunity remains strong as our customers invest in unlocking employee health, wellness and productivity benefits associated with well managed indoor environments. We are positioned to capture this trend and help customers manage challenges through our OpenBlue indoor air quality as a service with some exciting wins coming in Q4. Additionally, we are leading the way in advancing new solutions and research into the linkage between healthy buildings and decarbonization helping our customers achieve both outcomes simultaneously. Notably, during the quarter, we delivered promising results. In fiscal year 2022, orders increased 45% year-over-year. Our healthy buildings pipeline represents over $1.3 billion in revenue and we expect continued order growth as more customers leverage the value of improved indoor environmental quality.  Now we turn to Slide 8. We consistently demonstrate our commitment to sustainability. During the quarter, Fortune\u2019s 2022 Change The World List recognized Johnson Controls for our service offerings of OpenBlue Solutions and OpenBlue net zero buildings. I am also very proud that we have been named One of Forbes World\u2019s Best Employers in 2022. I am now going to turn the call over to Olivier to go through the financial details of the quarter. Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the summary on Slide 9. Sales in the quarter were up 10% organically at the high end of our guidance of 9% to 10% growth with price contributing nearly 9 points, in line with what we originally anticipated. We saw strong performance across our shorter-cycle global product portfolio up 11%. Our longer-cycle field businesses also performed well, up 10%, with further growth in both service and in store. Segment EBITDA increased 9% with margins expanding 55 basis points to 16.5%. Better leverage on higher volumes, favorable mix and the incremental benefits of our ongoing SG&A and COGS programs, more than offset continued supply chain constraints and will achieving but improving price cost.  EPS of $0.99 was at the midpoint of our guidance and increased 13% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. During the quarter, we absorbed an additional $0.03 of FX headwinds versus the prior guide. Full year free cash flow conversion was 67% as a result of the disruptions of the supply chain over the last two years, we have build up our inventory to meet customer demands.  Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 10. Overall, operations contributed $0.16 versus the prior year, including a $0.07 benefit from our COGS and SG&A productivity program, helping to exceed our targeted savings for the year. In the quarter, FX was a $0.05 headwind. In addition, higher net financing charges and non-controlling interest impacts were offset by a lower share count.  Please turn to Slide 11. Orders for our field businesses increased 9% in aggregate, install orders increased low double-digits in the quarter with continued demand for applied HVAC and controls systems. We are also seeing continued strength in our service business with orders up 7% driven by double-digit growth in both EMEA/LA and APAC.  Field backlog remains at record levels, growing 13% to $11.1 billion, a $1.2 billion increase versus the prior year while remaining flat quarter-over-quarter. Lastly, our Global Products backlog grew by more than 25% to $2.3 billion and continues to show strength. Let\u2019s discuss our segment results in more detail on Slides 12 and 13. Sales in North America were up 9% organically with broad-based growth across the portfolio. Our install business grew low-double-digits with increased retrofit and upgrade projects and new construction growth. Overall, HVAC and controls grew low-double-digits and Fire & Security increased high-single-digits. Orders were up 13% with strong growth of more than 50% in our Sustainability Infrastructure business as our decarbonization solutions continue to resonate with our customers. Applied HVAC orders grew nearly 20% which had another solid quarter for equipment orders up over 30%.  Fire & Security orders declined low-single-digits. Total backlog ended the quarter at $7.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Segment margins in the quarter were 14.7%, a sequential improvement of 400 basis points driven by increased volume leverage and the execution of projects with an improved book-to-margin profile, a direct result of the pricing discipline implemented earlier in the year. In the quarter, North America continued to be impacted by supply chain disruptions. Overall, supply chain was a $50 million headwind contributing to a 50 basis points decrease in the quarter year-over-year. Sales in EMEALA were up 9% organically with continued strength in Fire & Security business, which grew after low-double-digit rates in Q4 while Industrial Refrigeration, HVAC and Controls grew high single-digits and mid-single-digits respectively. By geography, revenue growth was broad based with strength in Europe partially offset by low-single-digit decline in both Latin America and the Middle East. Orders were up 3% led by high-single-digits growth in our Fire & Security platform. Backlog was up 7% to $2 billion. Segment EBITDA margin declined 160 basis points to 9.4% as a result of unfavorable region and project mix, along with continued FX headwinds which offset favorable volume leverage and the benefit of cost savings during the quarter.  Sales in Asia Pacific increased 12% driven by high-teens growth in our HVAC and Controls platform. Service platforms in the quarter growing low-double-digits in aggregate benefiting from our shorter term transactional business in China. Overall, China grew 16%.  Orders increased 3% driven by low-double-digit growth in services, install orders remained flat year-over-year, backlog of $1.6 billion declined 2% year-over-year. Segment EBITDA margins declined 140 basis points to 14% driven by FX headwinds, lower volumes and unfavorable mix due to high HVAC shipments, offsetting positive price cost and the benefit of cost savings.  Sales in our shorter cycle global products business increased 11% in Q4, benefiting from strong price realization of 12%. Commercial HVAC product sales were up mid-teens in aggregate with strength in light commercial driven by 25% growth in North America and EMELA respectively. Applied HVAC sales were up 9% with continued demand within our data center end-markets.  Outside of North America, our global residential HVAC sales were up 8% in aggregate. North America Resi HVAC was up mid-single-digits benefiting from both high growth in our equipment and parts business and strong price realization. Our HVAC business grew low-double-digits led by strong double-digits growth in Europe, driven by continued demand for our Hitachi residential heat pumps. APAC Resi HVAC sales grew high-single-digits led by strong growth in Japan. Fire & Security products grew low-double-digits in aggregate led by our Access Control and Video Solutions business and strong demand in North America and EMELA for our Fire Detection products.  EBITDA margin expanded at 300 basis points to 21.9% driven by the benefit of our productivity actions, higher volume leverage and favorable mix.  Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 14, we ended Q4 with $2 billion in available cash and net debt at 1.9 times which is lower than our target range of 2 times to 2.5 times. As previously mentioned, free cash flow was impacted by temporarily building up inventory to meet customer demand. In Q4, CapEx spend declined 29%, however for the year it increased 7% as we continue to make selective investments to improve efficiency and expand capabilities.  Before we get into next year\u2019s guidance, I wanted to provide some commentary on the special items recorded in the quarter. We recorded a $255 million charge to increase our environmental remediation and related reserves, primarily related to our facility in Marinette, Wisconsin, where contamination exist for the use of fire fighting foam containing PFAS compounds.  Over the last three years, our team has made significant progress in our investigation and remediation activities including completing construction of a groundwater extraction and treatment system. As a result of that work, we were able to perform a refresh analysis based on currently available information known to us to-date. This resulted in a reasonable estimate of the cost associated with the long-term remediation actions we expect to perform over an estimated period of up to 20 years.  Now let\u2019s discuss our fiscal year 2023 guidance on Slide 15. Currently we are seeing continued strength in demand heading into the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our backlog, which is at historical levels continue to build along with our continued momentum across end-markets.  Orders remain strong ending into Q1 with low-double digit organic growth expected as our value proposition continues to resonate with our customers. We anticipate low-double-digit organic revenue growth with price contributing 10%.  Segment EBITDA margin is expected to expand 120 to 130 basis points and adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $0.65 to $0.67, which represents year-over-year growth of 20% to 24%. On a full year basis, we are taking a prudent approach and providing a wide range to reflect the macroeconomic uncertainty that could potentially impact the balance of the fiscal year.  Our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.20 to $3.60 represent a 7% to 20% growth rate respectively. The top quartile of our range signifies our base case scenario. This accounts for normalized GDP growth, continued growth, vector acceleration and conversion of our existing backlog. The low end of this range $3.20 provide a book end reflecting a potential downside scenario.  This scenario accounts for potential degradation of global GDP, which we believe will be offset by our resident services and commercial market presence, along with additional cost mitigation actions. On the top-line, we anticipate high-single-digits to low-double-digits organic growth with price representing about 10% as our offering continue to resonate with our customers.  We anticipate segment EBITDA margin expansion of 80 to 120 basis points as we continue to execute our higher book margin backlog throughout the fiscal year. Full year cash flow is expected to be between 80% and 90%. Operationally, we continue to improve our working capital management and expect further improvements from the gradual reduction of inventories our supply chain normalizes.  As we close our fiscal year, we look forward to accelerating our strategic initiatives. We have aligned our business to minimize potential headwinds through enhanced operational improvements, improved cost structure and productivity enhancements. We are optimistic given the strong fundamentals across our businesses. The resiliency of our products and services continue to resonate with our customers, as our order velocity and backlog remains strong.  Heading into fiscal year 2023, we look to continue our growth momentum and invest in advancing our digital service offering while capitalizing on secular trends.  With that operator please open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andrew Obin : Hi guys. Good morning. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Michael Gates : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yeah, so, just a question in terms of very nice pricing outlook into next year. I was just wondering if you could give us some color as to what the backlog looks in terms of pricing and what gives you confidence that this kind of pricing will be achievable next year? Olivier Leonetti : So, if you look at next year indeed, we are modeling in our guide 10% of price and about 1% of volume growth. In Q1, the volume will be much higher about 3% with the pricing about 10%. If you look at today, our order velocity today, which includes discounted pricing is still growing as we said in our prepared remarks, Q1 order is actually being very healthy and actually it\u2019s accelerating in Q1 relative to Q4. So we believe that the value proposition of our offerings are resonating. The backlog is strong and we believe we can command this kind of pricing, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And the next question we\u2019ve actually got a couple of questions from investors just regarding your guide for next year, top-line pretty good margin, pretty good. I think the low end of the guide just if you sort of try to look to versus consensus, just wanting to see if there are any below the line items that are sort of impacting the EPS guide as I said, because the top-line and margins looks very much in line better than the street, but sort of the midpoint ends up being below. Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : So, what we indicated in our prepared remarks, is that the wider range add two scenarios from a macro standpoint, a base scenario which is what we believe is to be the most likely case which will be the top quartile of the guide. That would equate to an EPS range of $3.60 to $3.50. Why do we believe it\u2019s the base scenario?  Few reasons for that. One, at the macro level, the economy we are facing is still growing. If you take the U.S. 51% ABI is still strong. PMI at about 50%. So no indication today that we have a slow down. That\u2019s for number one and number two, our order velocity is still very strong and we mentioned what those numbers were for Q1.  We have various incentive programs around the world in the U.S., Europe. We have a strong backlog. We have a very resilient service business and a strong commercial exposure. So we believe that the base case is a top quartile guide.  Now, we are also listening to what is happening out there and you have some economies, some CEO mentioning that we could have a slowdown next year. We believe that the worst case scenario from a slow down standpoint would translate into a GDP based economies estimates of zero to 1% in terms of growth and we wanted to give you a book of how we perform in the case we would have a major slowdown of GDP. But today, that\u2019s not what we are facing, Andrew, hence the top-quartile reference. Andrew Obin : Thanks. Perfect. Thanks so much for the great explanation. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning, guys. How are you? George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just give a little more color on the guidance by the various segments? And then, anything on the bridge that stands out, I guess, just from a residual cost savings or recovery of inefficiencies from this year and anything that you guys can detail on the EPS bridge? Thanks. Olivier Leonetti : Of course. So, if you look at the elements of the guide, today we see the business for services to be strong. We expect the service business to grow indeed 11% give or take and so our business to be low-double-digits and global products to be in the mid-teens.  Price cost would be positive of course, it was already, Steve, in the year. The price cost equation is still going to be dilutive though next year as we are not fully realizing covering the inflation we have been facing. That will be the main points regarding the guide, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just one more on the guide, and it doesn't look like you're including much, if any, capital deployment in the guide. What are your thoughts around that? And is there an active M&A pipeline? Olivier Leonetti : So you're right, we are going to have a modest increase in capex that was embedded in our free cash flow guide regarding M&A. We have a very active pipeline. We are looking at tuck-in M&A. We're going to be careful about how we deploy cash, particularly in the current climate and we will invest mainly in our digital and IP acquisitions for our global products, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Great. And just on PFAS, always fun to talk about, right, but topical today. Just pivoting more to the MDL and the like. I just wonder if you could give us a update on what your strategy is, if this recent ruling kind of against the idea of the government contract or defense in any way kind of changes your posture or how you kind of approach trying to work through a settlement here. Olivier Leonetti : No change. The reserve does not include litigation recovery. The litigation is ongoing, and we believe we have a strong defense, including our government contractor defense, Jeff. We also have, as you know, insurance coverage. And at this point, we believe that any financial impact on our company is not probable and/or estimable. So we have not reserved for this particular item. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Hi, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : I just want to ask a three-part question kind of clarifying a few items in the guidance. Number one, is there any supply chain constraints embedded in the outlook versus the $50 million you realized in 4Q? Number two, SG&A cost savings. You guys mentioned that you over executed in fiscal '22.  Just curious how much you're getting in fiscal '23? And number three, does the guidance \u2013 could you just confirm that it does not include any buybacks? Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : On the supply chain, we expect the supply chain to normalize half through fiscal year '23. It's still improving sequentially but we believe we are now going to be back to our normal state until midyear. That's point number one. Point number two, on SG&A, and that is embedded in our guide. We actually expect to deliver more productivity savings, and that is included in the guide we gave you, Nicole. And in terms of buyback, as we have said now for a number of quarters, we want to deploy 100% of free cash flow to dividend and buyback. We expect dividend to grow with earnings and the balance to be in buyback, that would be about $1 billion in buyback, Nicole, embedded in our guide. Nicole DeBlase : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning. George Oliver : Hi, John. John Walsh : I wanted to ask you, I guess, this is a little bit about the recent capex increase. But obviously, you've took up your capability in U.S. residential. Just curious if you're done expanding production there and kind of how the reception has been in the market with the new product. George Oliver : Yeah, I'll take that, John. As it relates to the DOE 2023 and the cutover, we are going \u2013 everything is going well and on plan. And when you look at more than half of our residential portfolio is meeting the DOE 2023 requirements, which have been launched and we're on target to launch the remaining pieces of the portfolio before the required conversion dates. What we've seen is customers can order \u2013 place orders for the products that are already launched. And we're providing customers the opportunity to prebuy products before they're actually formally launched. Now we've been working through the existing backlog and inventory to ensure a seamless transition. We are about 100% done. Cutover is complete in the South, and we're working on the cutover in the north by year-end. Commercial products are on schedule and set to launch through the balance of the calendar year. And so overall, we're on track. And I think a lot of the investment that was required to be able to meet those requirements has been put into place, and we feel very good about the way that we're executing on that. I think as this transitions, that will provide a tailwind for us. As you know, we've had a large backlog in residential this year. We've been converting that backlog. We've been timing this transition appropriately with the launch of the new products. And we feel, as we go forward, not only do we get higher price on the new products. But as we now get our run rates better, improve now with the launch, we see significant pickup in our ability to be able to not only reduce the backlog, but be able to then take on new orders with our capacity expansion in residential. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just looking at the forward guidance, can you provide any color on how much of the current backlog will ship next year or just how we should think about the backlog conversion into next year? Olivier Leonetti : So our backlog is about $13 billion. We believe that a large proportion of that should convert next year. And again, going back to the conversation we have had about the guide. That's why also our best case would be a top quartile in terms of EPS range. The backlog will give us a nice coverage. An additional comment on the backlog. This backlog is very resilient. It's associated with very bespoke projects, which are capital tied for our customers. So they want that to be delivered to them. George Oliver : John, let me add some color on that. When you look at our global product businesses and how that played out through the year, certainly, we had a low first half and then we had a pretty significant step up here with our seasonality in Q3. And we've continued to improve our supply chain to maintain that pace as we get into the first half of 2023. And so we've seen a nice recovery in our units. As far as our supply chain recovery, it has been across our applied in building management system products. We've had a little bit of a constraint within our residential, but as I said earlier, that is being addressed with our capacity expansion and through the conversion now to the DOE 2023.  We've got all of our suppliers now on a recovery rate that supports a run rate through the first half that gets us positioned to recover a lot of the backlog in the first half as we ramp up for the seasonality in 2023 in third quarter. So we've made a lot of progress. Our supply chain teams have done a heck of a job working through this, and feel confident that we'll get back to normal lead times and normal backlogs by the end of 2023. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. I'll pass along. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to circle back to the guidance. I think you'd said that you're assuming only 1% volume growth in fiscal '23. But I just wondered if you've got this big backlog and supply chain is easing, why wouldn't the volume growth be several points higher? And maybe tied to that, your guide embeds faster margin expansion early in the year than the balance even though price cost and supply chain get easier as the year goes on. So, just trying to understand that. Is there something assumed in the volume guide for the back half or something on mix, which is kind of pulling down the margin and offsetting the supply chain and price cost tailwind? Olivier Leonetti : You're right. This is a prudent assumption. If you look at Q1, where we have more visibility, volume is actually three points of the growth, which would be back to historical average. We are planning for the year, a lower level of volume based upon us being prudent. And that prudence is also reflected in the guide in the second half as well in the best case. George Oliver : Julian, let me comment on that also. In the first half, we're trying to take the backlog here in the first and second quarter. Typically, we do go down seasonally. And then we're \u2013 given the progress we've made in the third and fourth quarter, we're trying to pick up some of that backlog in the first part of the year. Certainly, we get the leverage on that. We're \u2013 on a year-on-year compare, we get much better leverage on that. And so, I think \u2013 and then it turns, in our field-based business, we're working to get back to our normal turn rate in our projects where with this supply chain disruption over the last 18 months, we've \u2013 anywhere from a month to two in our ability to turn projects. So we see that improving during the course of the year. So you'll see some acceleration of that in the first half as well as our units with our recovery of our product-based businesses. And so I think that's \u2013 some of those \u2013 those are some of the fundamentals that are playing out in the numbers. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe a more sort of fiddly financial question. And going back to a question earlier about below the line items. I think one thing that maybe people underestimated was the financing charges in '23. So you're guiding those at about $300 million. Q4 was about $60 million. So is that step up more just kind of variable interest rates flowing through? Is anything assumed around the gross debt? And just wondered if there's any kind of pension impact in the P&L in 2023 year on year? Olivier Leonetti : You are right about all of those. So in terms of interest, that's the by-product of the interest rate rising. We are not factoring any significant increase in the level of debt and pension income is indeed going to decline. That's the assumption. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you very much, Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So order momentum, clearly pretty strong through the fiscal fourth quarter. What's the outlook here on orders into 2023? At what point should we expect this to moderate, just given the backlog and stabilizing, I think even potentially shortening lead times? George Oliver : Well, I'd say \u2013 I'll take that. I'd say the pipelines that we're currently working on, both in direct and indirect continue to be strong. We continue to convert at the rates that we've been here in the second half of this year. We're actually projecting a very strong Q1 with orders. And so we're watching this closely. The one area that we'll watch is in the residential space, given that we think we're at the peak of the market now and what is going to play out there. Now for us, it's because we've been constrained with our capacity. And with the supply chain disruptions, we have not been able to convert at the rate that we could if we had the capacity. And so now on a go-forward basis with our recovery, we'll be able to take on more orders there with the new product that we're launching. And so net-net, obviously, we're watching it closely. But I think we see \u2013 we still see good momentum across the businesses. Chris Snyder : Thank you for that. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on service. And just if there's anything you could provide around pricing on the service side just so we can kind of get a feel for what type of market share benefits we're seeing from the digital initiatives. Thank you. George Oliver : Yeah, we have been very disciplined with pricing on services and not only with the traditional more of the mechanical services. But as you know, we've been enhancing our services with OpenBlue and with connectivity and new software applications.  And so that's where you start to get a higher mix of service as we add on those capabilities. Overall, we've been able to more than offset the cost as we have across now all of the segments. And so I think on a go-forward basis, as we get a higher mix of connectivity, higher mix of software services, we'll start to see a real accretion on service margin rate. But we've \u2013 obviously, while we've been expanding, we've been very disciplined on the pricing that we're getting for the value proposition that we're providing to our customers. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Appreciate that. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Scott Davis : Hey. Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : A couple of small nits here. Is the margin structure on heat pumps at scale kind of comparable to the average of the other product lines or is it a tad better? George Oliver : Yeah. So when you look \u2013 you got to look at the mix of heat pumps, Scott. We're about \u2013 of our HVAC portfolio, we're about 50% heat pumps and that spans pretty much all of the platforms. Now as we're creating these new value propositions around decarbonization and electrification of these units, certainly, there's a pickup in margin because there's a higher demand as we're launching these new products. And so that mix will continue to improve with the new products that are being launched. We've seen good strength in our industrial refrigeration business. Even our Hitachi business has a high mix of heat pumps, and we're putting those heat pumps. We're seeing good growth in Europe as well as across the globe, actually, but a big pickup in Europe. And so as we're making the investments and the demand signals are increasing because of decarbonization, sustainability and the value proposition that these bring where we're getting incremental margins as a result. Scott Davis : OK. Helpful. And then just a follow-up on the prior question on price because you weren't explicit and perhaps that's on purpose. But if the average \u2013 company average is 9% price or the guide is 10%, will service \u2013 will the service and install side be close to that average you think in 2023? George Oliver : No. When you look at our pricing across the segments, we've been \u2013 obviously, our book-and-build business and global products, we've been very aggressive, Scott, in making sure that we're recovering. With shorter cycles, we've recovered all of the costs through price and we're going to get back to the margins where we were previous to the ramp-up of inflation.  On the field-based businesses within install and services, we have \u2013 with the project-based business, as you know, we \u2013 when we \u2013 you go back two years ago when we were projecting cost, we were under costing projects because we didn't factor in the level of inflation that was experienced. Now that all was fixed a year ago. And that's been \u2013 as you see now, the mix coming through the field project-based business, is very strong, right, with the pricing that was put in place as a result of now taking into account the \u2013 all of the costs and even some of the disruption costs that we're experiencing.  So the project-based businesses are very high, recovering the margin that previously we were short on. On the service-based business, it's lower because we maintain the value proposition, and we haven't seen the amount of inflation that comes through the mix of our services that we provide. And so \u2013 but again, we're offsetting cost. And then with the value proposition that we bring with OpenBlue with the digital offerings, we then accrete margin in addition to that with those value propositions, Scott. So it's lower than the 9% of just pure price cost. But now we're going to get a higher mix because of the additive services. Scott Davis : Yeah, that color is super helpful. Thank you, guys. Best of luck in '23. I'll pass it on. George Oliver : Thank you, Scott. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So I'd like to start on supply chain. Once again, I think, Olivier, you mentioned that supply chain destructions were roughly $50 million this quarter. I think they were roughly $65 million last quarter. So on the margin, it got a little bit better. But I'm just curious, are you seeing this \u2013 Is this still a labor issue? Is this a component issue? Like where \u2013 what have you seen get better? And where are you still seeing constraints? George Oliver : Yeah, Joe, I'll take that. We've done incredible work over the last 18 months when this all got turned upside down because of lead times and all of the critical components being extended and more than double the lead times is really what started the disruption. And as a result of that, we've done a lot of good work around how do we commonize all of our components and ultimately then get aligned with our strategic suppliers and getting the volumes that we need not only short term, but supporting the growth going forward. And we've done that pretty much across all of our commodities. And obviously, the one that initially impacted us was the microchips and semiconductor materials, and we're fully lined out on that now in a good recovery position as we go forward. And so we are seeing, on a run rate basis, good improvement as we're heading into Q1. And so as we've been, we've been very proactive. We've been \u2013 I would say now, as we look at our run rates of being able to reduce our backlog, we're now getting suppliers aligned and getting firm commitments that we can meet these run rates to ultimately bring this backlog down and achieve the growth that we're positioned to achieve in 2023. Our supply chain team has done a great job. Our manufacturing sites have been keeping production going while we're continuing this recovery of materials. And we went from $65 million in the third quarter to $50 million in the fourth. We expect that to be reduced again in the first quarter. But we do \u2013 this is \u2013 we've got everyone lined out to a recovery rate here for second quarter, so that as we position for third and fourth, which is our seasonal high quarters, we're going to be well positioned not only to have recovered our backlog, but now to be positioned with lead times that are very competitive in our ability to be able to take on additional volume in the second half of the year.  And that's what we're positioned to do. So even though we have a little bit of headwind still with disruption, we've been pricing that disruption in our go-forward pricing. And then with the offsetting some of the headwinds is the additional COGS and SG&A work that we're doing to lean out the company and offset any additional headwinds that we might achieve. But overall, I would tell you from where we are from six months ago to where we are today, we're in a much different spot. Joe Ritchie : Got it, George. That's super helpful. And then I guess maybe just one other question on the margin \u2013 or maybe not the margin, but the 2023 bridge. And so as you kind of think through it, I think we were originally expecting $260 million in costout. It sounds like price cost from a dollar perspective should be positive. Are there any other key items to really think through as we're thinking through like that's what the incrementals should look like in 2023 versus 2022.  I recognize that you guys have a low volume expectation. But are those the kind of key items or is there anything else that you would like to call out as we try to look at just like the adjusted EBITA segment? Olivier Leonetti : No, you're right. If you look at the impact of the disruption on next year, we are modeling about 40 basis points 4, 0 and if you look at the incremental before \u2013 including the disruptions, the incrementals, I expect that next year to be at about 33% net of disruptions. Excluding them, in other words, we should be at over 40%, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay, helpful. Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just want to follow up on that supply chain. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Good morning. Just on the kind of supply chain easing and backlog conversion. During the seasonally slower period, George, like you mentioned, first quarter, second quarter, how much do you think you were able to sort of pull in as a function of, hey, maybe demand normally in these quarters wouldn't be this high, but we have extra backlog and they'll take it whenever they can get it.  There is some sort of buffer in first quarter, especially that we should be aware of that's maybe kind of backlog-driven or supply chain normalization driven? George Oliver : Yeah. So when we look at backlog and we look at our run rate, we're pretty well positioned here through the first quarter because of our backlog and the run rates that we're achieving across each one of these product businesses, we're actually trying to \u2013 on these markets that are unconstrained, meaning that there's even more growth that we can go after if we can commit cycle times that are lower. We're actually doing that to fill in additional volume later in the year. And so what we're doing is, in the first quarter, you do have less days but we're targeting to try to maintain our run rates across all of our sites at the same level that we had in the fourth quarter. And so to your point, does that give us an ability to be able to not only achieve the \u2013 it gives us good ability to achieve the forecast we've made. And then as we track that in Q2, we believe that, that will continue. So at this stage, we feel good about where we are and we do see continued improvement as we get through the first half of the year. Josh Pokrzywinski : Okay. Got it. And then on the price in revenue versus price in orders, I know that was sort of a big talking point last quarter, Olivier. Just getting that sequential price or higher uptick. What was that phenomenon like this quarter, i.e., are you still getting more price in the order book than that is coming out of the backlog and shipping and revenue today? Olivier Leonetti : In the order book, the level of pricing has increased in Q4 relative to Q3 for our field business. The level of orders and price into it is about 1.5 points higher than it was in Q3. So we're in more than the mid-teens pricing in orders. So strong pricing based upon the strength of our value proposition, I would say, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Best of luck. Olivier Leonetti : Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is now open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Deane Dray : I was hoping to get some more context on the free cash flow guide for '23, the 80% to 90%. Are you assuming any drawdown on working capital as the supply chain normalizes? Or is that a potential upside to the free cash flow target? Olivier Leonetti : So our guide is 80% to 90%. There are two elements into this. One, to your point, we are growing \u2013 we are going to grow at a steady pace. That is going to be using working capital. If you look at the number of days, we will improve all the elements of the cash conversion cycle to improve. DSO will keep improving. That has been a theme now for a number of quarters, DPO, the same. DIO will improve, but will not go back to the '21 level yet. We believe it's going to be our item in financial fiscal year '24, Deane. Deane Dray : Okay. That's helpful. And then just any color on Europe? Look like that was fairly strong, but any change at the margin, the frontlog conversion of orders, anything that you would highlight? Olivier Leonetti : So orders is still strong in Europe. Actually, in Q4, we see the order growth improving. And if you look at the margin profile of Europe, it's not where we want it to be, but we see it improving as well. It has improved sequentially in Q4 versus Q3, and we expect that to be the case still as we go forward. So far in Europe, so good, I would say, Deane. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is now open. Jack Ayers : Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Jack Ayers on for Gautam today. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning. Jack Ayers : Good morning. I know the '23 guide has obviously been covered here. But kind of just wanted to ask about the long-term targets provided at the investor day last fall. Just any color there. I know we've had some headwinds with supply chain, but it seems like things are getting incrementally better. Just how do we think about the 250 to 300-basis-point margin expansion? And I guess, what has to happen there in regards to supply chain to really meet those targets? Olivier Leonetti : I mean, clearly, and I'm going to state the obvious here, Jack. When we put our guide, the environment was very different. Inflation, COVID, supply chain, war in Europe, FX, all those were variable, which were not part of our guide. If we are \u2013 if we do not have a slowdown as and a GP of zero to one next year, which is not the expectation. If we meet our base case, the guide for 2024 is still within reach. It's going to be more difficult. But if you were to do a squeeze, the revenue you need the margin expansion you need and the EPS expansion you need to reach our target is going to be harder, but still within reach. A lot will depend, Jack, on what happened this year from a macro standpoint. George Oliver : What I would say, Jack \u2013 Jack, I'd add that when you look at the secular trends that are underway, some of these are entire recessional relative to the decarbonization and the demand that we see there with a lot of the incentives that are being provided.  And so that's going to help and we see that now playing out with heat pumps and there's a lot of different parts of the business that's benefiting from that. Services. I think even during this period of time, services are going to be more attractive because of the value proposition that we're providing not only operationally to help our customers, but also aligned to being able to achieve their net zero goals. And so there is a lot of fundamentals when you look at the space we're in and the strategy we outlined that we're confident that we're going to get to those fundamentals. It's just a matter of what is the timing because of some of these environmental events here that's having an impact on us.  But we're completely confident that we have the right product technologies, combined with now OpenBlue in the way that, that now is accelerating, our ability to be able to build services and recurring revenue and really attack what we see to be very attractive growth vectors, which is decarbonization, sustainability, healthy buildings and more around this whole \u2013 how do we create autonomous buildings that is an incredible value proposition that we can bring to our customers. So that hasn't changed one bit. It's just a matter of timing with some of these environmental factors that we're weighing in. Jack Ayers : That's great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the color. George Oliver : So with that, operator, why don't we close the Q&A. As we continue to execute, I'd say I'm very encouraged by our progress. We're in a very strong position to carry out our strategic initiatives, continue to showcase our leadership and support of our customers' mission-critical needs, and we see that every day expanding.  I'd like to thank our Johnson Controls colleagues worldwide for your continued efforts. Our customers for their ongoing support and all of you, as we enter the next fiscal year and continuing to build a better, healthier, and safer future in 2023. So thank you all for joining. I look forward to speaking with many of you soon. Operator, that concludes our call. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will turn the call over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Jim Lucas : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls first quarter fiscal 2023 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Johnson Controls. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors and cautionary statements in our most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today\u2019s release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to this presentation both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls website. I will now turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u2019s begin with Slide 3. Fiscal 2023 is off to a strong start with solid Q1 results. Our teams across the globe have executed well delivering strong financial performance for our shareholders, while pushing the pace of innovation to provide our customers with the next phase of digital solutions across our vectors of growth. During the quarter, we accelerated growth across to our service-based businesses, drove higher margins and delivered profitability at the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range. Overall, organic revenue grew at a healthy pace and our $11.3 billion backlog remains resilient, growing 11% year-over-year. Our service strength was resilient and remains a key competitive differentiator. While order timing, supply chain realization and China policies have impacted our global products in field install order flow during the quarter, we are seeing incremental improvements in order momentum heading into Q2. As we mentioned over the last few quarters, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business in improving our operational execution. Our teams have done a great job advancing our initiatives to accelerate growth and optimize the efficiency of our cost structure. During the quarter, we delivered $90 million in productivity cost savings, and are on track to reach our $340 million savings target over the course of this fiscal year. We are also committed to our prudent approach to capital allocation, reinvesting in new products and technology to drive long-term shareholder value while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We recently announced our plans to enhance our growing industrial heat pump portfolio with the acquisition of Hybrid Energy. Acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy and by investing in Hybrid\u2019s patented high temperature heat pump technology, we are continuing to strengthen our leading global product portfolio and provide our customers with the most efficient sustainable building solutions. We are well-positioned to capitalize on large growth opportunities across our dynamic product portfolio and field business. Through our integrated domain expertise, global coverage and scale, we are leading the way towards smart, healthy, and sustainable buildings for our customers. While the global macroeconomic environment remains uncertain based on our strong start to Q1 and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising the lower bookend of our adjusted EPS guidance range for the year. Now turning to Slide 4. During the quarter, our OpenBlue platform continued to expand as we enhanced our capabilities leveraging the power of AI and providing customers with unique insights. A good example is the deployment of OpenBlue enterprise manager at a leading tech manufacturer to help them meet their energy and sustainability goals. In addition, we have recently installed OpenBlue companion at their facility to enhance employee productivity and space utilization. From advancing predictive analytics to integrations at the edge, our full suite of solutions empowers our customers to meet their carbon emission goals and create a healthier, more productive workspace for their people. To date, we have enhanced the existing connectivity of over 11,000 chillers through OpenBlue, representing a 79% increase year-over-year. Moving on to Slide 5. Our digital service journey has accelerated since we launched our innovative OpenBlue platform in fiscal 2021. At that time, we entered the first phase of our digital transformation with a focus on enhancing data mining capabilities. Over fiscal 2022, we launched the OpenBlue gateway enabling data access at scale and increased connectivity across our growing installed base. We are now positioned for the next phase of our journey as we standardize our field operations globally. Linking the benefits of real time monitoring of connected devices to our extensive service network. We can provide our customers with faster response times while optimizing the deployment of our global field service presence. We are beginning to see the results of our digital offerings enabling service growth. During the first quarter, service orders and revenue grew 10% year-over-year, with continued growth, we are in a great position to reach the goal we set out at our Investor Day in fiscal 2021 to capture $2 billion in additional service revenue by 2024. On to Slide 6, with nearly 40% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions coming from commercial and industrial buildings, the goal of achieving net zero starts at the building level. Through our vast sustainable infrastructure partnership ecosystem, we play in an integral role in helping our customers achieve these targets no matter where they are in their decarbonization journey. Starting with our established advisory services and goal setting partnerships with KPMG and Accenture, we help customers take the first step to accelerate and solve their decarbonization and efficiency goals. We are also able to help fast track our customers\u2019 net zero targets through carbon reduction services, collaborating with leading renewable energy supply and distributed energy providers. With our comprehensive customer solutions and strategic partnerships, we are positioned to take full advantage of favorable regulatory tailwinds and continued momentum. During Q1, we realized over $200 million in organic revenue, growing over 20% year-over-year with orders over the last 12 months, growing at 6%. Turning to Slide 7. The Healthy Buildings opportunity remains attractive as our customers invest in indoor environmental quality improvements post-COVID. Solving for the indoor air quality and energy consumption challenges of hybrid work models is driving a compelling intersection of our Healthy Buildings and sustainability strategic growth vectors. We are in a leadership position, thanks to OpenBlue indoor air quality as a service, which continued to gain momentum in Q1 as well as our leading IAQ and space management capabilities in OpenBlue Enterprise Manager. In our Healthy Buildings business, trailing 12-month orders increased 11% year-over-year, and our pipeline of $1.2 billion remains strong. Looking forward, we expect continued growth momentum as the value of indoor environmental quality improvements delivers benefits for our customers. On to Slide 8. We are honored to be continually recognized for our dedicated sustainability efforts. Among other honorable recognitions, two of Johnson Controls leaders were awarded for their efforts. Chief Sustainability Officer, Katie McGinty, was named one of 2022\u2019s most influential women executives for sustainability leadership by Women Inc. magazine. Anu Rathninde, President of Asia-Pacific, received the ESG Exploration Character Award of the Year from the 2022 ESG Pioneer 60 awards by Jiemian. I am proud of our team for leading by example and executing on our values. I will now turn the call over to Olivier to go through the financial details of the quarter. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the summary on Slide 9. Total sales grew 4% with organic sales increasing 9%, comprised of 10% price and a modest volume decline. FX was a 6% headwind during the quarter. We saw strong performance across our longer cycle field businesses, which grew 10% in the quarter. Our shorter-cycle Global Products business grew sales 7%, impacted by a slowdown in residential demand. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 15% with margins expanding 140 basis points to 13.7%. Positive price costs and improved productivity more than offset unfavorable business mix. Adjusted EPS of $0.67 was at the high end of our guidance and increased 24% year-over-year. During the quarter, we absorbed an additional $0.01 of FX headwinds versus the prior guide. Free cash flow returned to the normal seasonal pattern with the usage to start the year. In addition, inventory levels were impacted by softness in residential as well as continued supply chain disruptions, which while improving impacted our ability to satisfy green demand in commercial. Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 10. Overall, operations contributed $0.19 versus the prior year, including an $0.11 cent benefit from our productivity programs for which we are on track to meet our targeted savings for the year. In the quarter, FX was a $0.04 headwind below the line higher net financing charges and corporate expense were offset by a lower share count and favorable non-controlling interest. Please turn to Slide 11. Total orders for our field businesses increased 5%. As George stated earlier, orders in the quarter were affected by timing and COVID related impacts in China. Order timing are the largest impact within our in-store business, which grew 1% in the quarter. We were encouraged by 10% order growth in our service business driven by double digit growth in both EMEA/LA and APAC. Field backlog remains at record levels, growing 11% to $11.3 billion, $800 million increase versus the prior year while growing $250 million sequentially. Our global products third-party backlog grew more than 30% over the prior year to $2.8 billion. Let\u2019s now discussed our segment results in more details on Slides 12 and 13. Sales in North America were up 10% organically with broad-based growth across the portfolio. Our install business grew 12% with low-double-digit growth in both retrofit and new construction. Overall, HVAC and controls continues to gain momentum, growing mid-teens year-over-year, while Fire & Security increased high single digits. Order timing mainly impacted North America as orders increased 6% with solid growth of 7% in our service business. New construction orders grew over 50%, primarily in HVAC in aggregate Fire & Security orders grew low single digits. Total backlog ended the quarter at $7.5 billion up 16% year-over-year. Segment margins decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 11.3% as positive price cost and ongoing productivity benefits were offset by unfavorable project mix. Sales in EMEA/LA grew 12% organically with strong performance in applied commercial HVAC and Fire & Security. Our service based business was strong in a quarter growing mid-teens year-over-year with recurring revenue contributing low-double-digit growth. Orders were up 5% led by over 20% growth across our Fire & Security platforms, which was partially offset by declines in HVAC and industrial refrigeration. Backlog was up 5% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. Segment EBITDA margins declined 310 basis points to 7.7% as a result of unfavorable mix and dilutive price cost, which offset favorable volume leverage and the benefits of cost savings during the quarter. Sales in Asia Pacific increased 7% driven by mid-single-digit growth in our commercial HVAC & Controls platform. Service performed well in the quarter growing low double digits, benefiting from our shorter cycle transactional business, primarily in HVAC & Controls. China grew 1% in the quarter impacted by COVID induced lockdowns. As China continues to reopen, we are encouraged with the momentum building within that region. Orders decline 1% as low-double-digit growth in service was offset by a decline in HVAC & Controls installation. Overall, install orders declined 5% organically. Backlog of $1.6 billion declined 1% year-over-year. Segment EBITDA margins increased 40 basis points to 10.5% driven by positive price cost and productivity savings, which offset lower volumes and FX headwinds over the quarter. Sales in our shorter cycle products business increased 7% in the quarter, benefiting from strong price realization of 11%. Commercial HVAC product sales were up low double digits with strength in light commercial driven by over 20% growth in North America and EMEA/LA respectively. Applied HVAC sales were up low double digits with continued demand in chiller within our data center and market. Outside of North America, our global residential HVAC sales were up low single digits. North America Resi HVAC declined 20% as the overhaul market softened and we were challenged by unfavorable product mix in the channel. Our HVAC business grew mid-single-digits led by more than 25 growth in applied within EMEA/LA, as well as strong demand from our Hitachi commercial heat pump in EMEA. Fire & Security products grew high single digits in aggregate led by continued demand in North America and in the Middle East for our Fire Detection products. EBITDA margins expanded 580 basis points to 20.3% driven by positive price cost and the benefit of productivity savings. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 14. We ended Q1 with $1.5 billion in available cash and net debt at 2.2 times, which is within our target range of 2 to 2.5 times. Now let\u2019s discuss our fiscal 2023 guidance on Slide 15. We were pleased with our start of the year and are encouraged by the continued strength and resilience in our order and backlog. Our backlog grew double digits and remains at record level. We are providing Q2 organic sales guidance of approximately 10% growth with price being the principal contributor. Segment EBITDA margin is expected to expand 100 to 110 basis points and adjusted EPS is an expected range of $0.72 to $0.74, which represents year-over-year growth of 15% to 18%. On a full year basis, we\u2019re raising the low end of the wide range we introduced to beginning the year. While we are encouraged with our strong start to the year and our current second quarter outlook, we continue to take a cautious outlook for the full year given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Our full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.30 to $3.60 represent growth of 10% to 20%. The top third of our EPS range signifies our base case scenario. This account for normalized GDP growth, continued growth, vectors acceleration and conversion of our existing backlog. The low end of this range provides a bookend reflecting a potential macro downside scenario, which accounts for a potential degradation of global GDP that we believe will be offset by our resilient services and commercial market presence, along with additional cost mitigation actions. On the top line, we anticipate high-single-digit to low-double-digit organic growth with price representing about 10%. We anticipate segment EBITDA margin expansion of 90 to 120 basis points as we continue to execute our higher booked margin backlog throughout the fiscal year. Full year free cash flow conversion is expected to be between 80% to 90%. Operationally, we continue to improve our working capital management and expect further improvements from the gradual reduction of inventories as the supply chain normalizes. As George mentioned, we are pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year. Whilst supply chain disruptions continue to impact our global products business, we see positive momentum in our field based services. Across our vectors of growth, our pipeline remains robust and we are well positioned to capture secular tailwinds while continuing to improve our operational execution as we navigate through the first half of the fiscal year. With that operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So \u2013 hi guys. So, yes, you mentioned field \u2013 timing for field orders coming up plus 1%. So maybe just continue just like double click on what\u2019s causing some of the delays that perhaps you didn\u2019t expect? China, I think I understand, but outside of China. George Oliver : Yes, when you look at our field orders, what is encouraging? Although, the install was up 1%, services was up over 10%, and we\u2019re very encouraged with the progress we\u2019re making there, Nigel. On the install side, it\u2019s mainly a couple of factors here that impacted us here in the quarter. It was \u2013 the China \u2013 the COVID lockdowns, we have incredible pipeline, but because of the disruption and ultimately the delay in getting those closed impacted us in the quarter, and that\u2019s 1% to 2%. And then in our project-based business as we now drive our vectors of growth around sustainability and healthy building. There\u2019s larger projects and a lot of these, it\u2019s hard to predict that timing conversion and so that amounted to another roughly 1% to 2%. Those are the key drivers, as far as the orders \u2013 field orders. Nigel, the backlog is up over 11%. The pipeline continues to be strong double digits in our conversion. And so as we\u2019re now executing on the strategy, we are encouraged that our conversion is going to continue very strong here in Q2 and beyond for the year. And then now the way that we\u2019ve been set up here with the backlog being up for the year really does give us a lot of confidence in our ability to be able to deliver on the guide that we provided for the full year. Nigel Coe : Great, thanks George. And then my follow-up questions on the margin expansion for the full year. You\u2019ve raised the bottom end by 10 basis points. So I\u2019m curious how the mix between the segment change. and I\u2019m referring here to obviously the strengths we saw in global products, the weakness we saw in EMEA/LA. So just wondering if the mix of that margin expansion has changed at all. George Oliver : We\u2019re making tremendous progress on our margins and it\u2019s not only \u2013 this has been over the last couple years instilling a discipline around price costs and more important about the value propositions that we\u2019re bringing to the market with our vectors of growth. And so we\u2019ve got \u2013 you see that not only in our shorter cycle business with our global products and the strength that we\u2019re having in margins that\u2019s combined not only the value proposition, but now also the additional productivity that\u2019s playing through and the leverage that we\u2019re getting on that. And so as we project the current year, we\u2019re going to continue, going to see momentum in margins, because the longer cycle business, we\u2019ve got strong margins and backlog. As we increase the velocity on the turn of these projects, you\u2019re going to start to see much stronger margins come through on the rest of the year. So Olivier, maybe you can comment on the segments. Olivier Leonetti : Absolutely. So one clarifying point on the orders. We expect as an impact on orders due to the move of the orders from Q1 to Q2 orders in the field to be high single digits in Q2. Regarding the margin, we expect global product margin to remain strong for the rest of the year and we expect the field margin to turn positive in Q2, probably about 51 to 100 basis points at the segment EBITDA level and increase day after significantly with a strong increase as we end the year, Nigel, in the field business. Nigel Coe : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Olivier, I want to pick up off that last point on field margins improving. And so you guys called out unfavorable mix both in North America and EMEA/LA, I want to understand that a little bit better. And then specifically on North America, I know that you guys saw this sequential improvement last quarter, but the margins now have been down year-over-year for the last seven quarters. So just help us understand what\u2019s driving the confidence in those margins getting better from here and what was the issue with unfavorable mix that was coming through the field business this quarter? Olivier Leonetti : So it would be from a project to \u2013 project mix or larger projects flowing through in the quarter. If you look at a high level and we have discussed that job before, we have booked orders at a higher level of margin all through last year. And those orders are now starting to flow through the field business. So as indicated to Nigel earlier, we expect the field margin to improve at a segment EBITDA level in Q2 by 50 to 100 basis points and keep increasing thereafter. That would include also our North America business. The expectation for the margin increase in segment EBITDA level for North America into two is expected the increase to be over a full points. So as we keep converting the backlog as we \u2013 which is at a higher margin, as we keep delivering our productivity initiatives, as we keep increasing the mix of our service business in our companies, which was very strong in Q1, we expect this momentum to continue in Q2, you will see the field margin business to increase, I would say, materially between Q1 and Q4, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. And I don\u2019t usually ask questions on the North America resi business, because it\u2019s a small portion of the overall portfolio, but it was pretty interesting to see that business down 20%. I think you guys called out product mix in the channel. So maybe provide a little bit more color, what\u2019s happening there? That seems to be a little bit lower than what we\u2019ve seen reported so far from some of your peers. George Oliver : Yes. When you look at our North America resi deducted business, when you look at the overall market, it\u2019s down in units in the teens, now we were down more than that. And it\u2019s really two big factors here. This is where we\u2019ve had coming into the year, we still had continued supply chain disruptions. We also had the launch of our new product, the 2023 product. We worked through that, we worked through the supply chain. So although, we were down further in units, we had strong pricing coming through. We worked with our distributors and there\u2019s another key point to make on our field direct channel, which is a small portion of our distribution, we were actually up 13%. And so that\u2019s similar to what others have seen. On the distribution side, we\u2019ve worked with our distributors in making sure that now as we have continued to improve our supply chain through the quarter that we\u2019re going to be positioned to be able to deliver on their expectations from a demand standpoint as we now go through the rest of the year. And so when you look at the rest of the year, we are projecting that the market will be down high single digits in units. There\u2019ll be continued strong pricing coming through and we\u2019ll be in line with the industry. And we believe that now with our recovery of the supply chain, we actually start to pick up some of the share that we had lost over the last year due to the supply chain. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. George Oliver : Thank you, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Good morning. If I look at roughly kind of the 350 or so where consensus is, it implies we\u2019re using the midpoint of your guidance about $2, $2.10 or so of earnings in the second half. That\u2019s about $1 per quarter by my math. Do you \u2013 is that kind of the right type of seasonality? Would you expect fourth quarter to be above third quarter and how materially above? Maybe just give us a little bit of a little more color on how the third and the fourth quarters break out EPS-wise? George Oliver : Yes. At the high level, Steve, when we look at our build for the year, we were in a very different place this year than we were last as we\u2019re now continuing to accelerate our capacity expansion across our product-based businesses. And we\u2019ve seen a nice ramp, for instance, in our applied businesses. In some cases, we\u2019re expanding capacity 2 or 3 times, and we tried to see that volume come through. And then we have worked with our supply chain. So we\u2019re very much aligned now going into our seasonal ramp as well as the recovery of our backlog to be able to begin to accelerate here in Q2, and that will continue through the seasonality that we see in Q3 and Q4. And so we\u2019re in a very different place than we were a year ago and being able to execute on that ramp. And I\u2019m very encouraged with the work that we\u2019ve done, especially across our applied business where, from a core strength, that is our strength, and we\u2019re beginning to see that pick up across the board. So Olivier, I don\u2019t know if you got any additional. Olivier Leonetti : No, not much more to add. The backlog conversion now is going to have its full impact. It will be very strong from Q2 onwards. The productivity initiatives are still well on track. We are identifying new productivity initiatives all through the year. The backlog is very resilient. Our service mix is very strong, accelerating significantly across the portfolio. So we see margin expansion clearly in the second half, Steve. Steve Tusa : So like is $1 around the right number for 3Q and then it kind of steps up a bit from there? Or is it more fourth quarter weighted, maybe just a little more precision to get people in line? Olivier Leonetti : Roughly, you\u2019re in the ballpark, Steve, indeed. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one \u2013 just one last one on non-res activity. You said that things are \u2013 you expect things to pick up here. What are you seeing in January on that front? I assume you\u2019re seeing some positive things? And what\u2019s the latest outlook on how things trend in the back half of the calendar year? George Oliver : Yes. When we look at our pipeline and we track our pipeline very closely, especially as it relates to all of the \u2013 our growth vectors and then the overall general market, when you look at the Dodge number and when you look at that growth, we are lagging that. So we\u2019re seeing significant opportunity there as that plays through. We are watching the ABI, which is longer term from projects that are coming to market. It did soften in November. It did come back and stabilize in December. And so for us, it\u2019s \u2013 and then when you look at our mix of our businesses, with the demand for our core applied business, when we look at our chillers, when you look at industrial refrigeration, you look at our data center offerings, across our supply \u2013 across that portfolio, we\u2019re seeing incredible demand. And we\u2019re working to make sure that we\u2019re executing on the capacity expansions that we made \u2013 that we started over a year ago to be positioned to be able to support that demand, and we\u2019re making good progress, Steve. So from a non-res, as far as our mix and where we see our strength to be, we see continued very strong activity building in the pipeline. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. George Oliver : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian, your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to\u2026 George Oliver : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. I just wanted to start off perhaps with the inventory and the cash flow because I think the inventory was up about $400 million sequentially, and it seems like it\u2019s a mix of kind of too much supply and too little demand in things like resi and then too much demand and too little supply in some other areas like commercial HVAC. So maybe just help us understand kind of what\u2019s going on in that inventory balance. And then what does that mean for the pace at which free cash flow improves over the balance of the year? Do you think free cash flow can be up year-on-year in the current second quarter or it\u2019s more of a sort of second half recovery on cash? Olivier Leonetti : So if you look at, first of all, the full guide, it\u2019s unchanged, 80% to 90% free cash flow for the full year. If you look at the seasonality of your question, we believe we\u2019re going to go back to historical free cash flow generation seasonality. That means that we should be year-to-date at the end of Q2, close to breakeven from a free cash flow standpoint. You can infer from that, that we would be positive in Q4 \u2013 in Q2, I\u2019m sorry. So breakeven year-to-date at the end of Q2, positive in Q2. You\u2019re right. Inventory was the key variable explaining what happened in free cash flow in Q1. Largely, George covered that. Resi and some mismatch of inventory is what is explaining this trend. We believe that this is going to keep improving all through the year. We have detailed action in place. And we believe that breaking even after the first half is an achievable goal from a free cash flow standpoint. George Oliver : So Julian, just to add to that, as you look at our commercial applied business, in many product lines, we\u2019re doubling; in some cases, tripling. And we\u2019re in the process of building up and being able to achieve that output through the course of the year. So we\u2019re in a build and we\u2019re making good progress on the applied business. When you look at our total applied business with what we do externally as well as internally, it\u2019s up very strong here in the first quarter. And then the second is what Olivier said, as we work through the residential disruption, it\u2019s really comes down to one plant on supporting our residential business with the disruption that we had really coming into the quarter. We\u2019ve worked through that, and we\u2019re positioned to adjust. Given the mismatch we had, we\u2019ve lined out with our distributors relative to what they expect. And we have confidence that, that\u2019s going to normalize here over the next quarter or 2. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then I just wanted to circle back to the North America Field business again, because you\u2019ve had, I think, seven quarters now of down margins year-on-year. The Q1 margin was 200 points lower than it was two years ago. And I think you\u2019d mentioned mix as a headwind specifically in the first quarter, but clearly, there have been issues predating that, pulling down the margin. And it seems like it\u2019s taken longer than you\u2019d expected to get that North America field margin to turn the corner. So I think clearly, the guide embeds an improvement there getting to that $1 of EPS, for example, in Q3. But maybe give us a bit more color on what you\u2019re doing kind of inside that organization to get the margins to turn around. And how much of the improvement in margin is that internal self-help versus getting some sort of macro or supplier benefits? George Oliver : And so let me touch on that, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Olivier. When you look at the turn, so what we\u2019ve booked over the last \u2013 it\u2019s really been the last year, 15 months, what\u2019s been turning some of the longer cycle projects that are turning now and you look at what\u2019s going to turn second, third and fourth quarter, a much higher mix, Julian, relative to the margin that we booked into the backlog. And that margin is tied to much greater value propositions. And then ultimately, in installed base, it\u2019s going to spin off service. And so we\u2019re going through the last of the tail that was prior to this inflationary period of projects that are still coming through. But I have confidence that when we look at what we\u2019ve been \u2013 how we\u2019ve been building these projects costing and then ultimately executing, you\u2019re going to start to see a nice pickup in margins. And I think \u2013 and then the other factor is that the velocity of our turn, because of the improvement in the supply chain, you\u2019ll start to see much higher productivity because the velocity of being able to turn these projects more consistently as we work through the year. Those are the two big factors. Olivier, maybe you could comment on the margin rate. Olivier Leonetti : Absolutely. So as a byproduct of the speed of the backlog conversion, we would see, as I indicated earlier, Julian, margin expansion, I can go a bit more into the details of the numbers here. So probably in Q2, we will expect segment EBITDA margin to increase close to a full points. And today, for Q3, we are planning actually close to a 4 points margin improvement in this business, not assuming a significant change in churn rates of the backlog. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott, your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, George and Olivier, and welcome Jim to the call in our world again here. But guys, I think that the story really this cycle has been about pricing power. And I\u2019m kind of curious to see as demand kind of flattens out here and maybe some of the big COVID drivers kind of anniversary. How \u2013 what\u2019s your confidence that price is something that you can continue to capture? And I don\u2019t really mean in your backlog. What\u2019s in the backlog is in the backlog, I suppose, but in forward contracts, you start to think about back half of 2023 and into 2024. George Oliver : Scott, as we look at what we\u2019ve done as we\u2019ve been executing on the strategy that we outlined a couple of years back and where we are in that journey, it\u2019s really now capitalizing on a much bigger value proposition as we focused on our vectors of growth. And that\u2019s not only in how we pulled together our combined capabilities within our products. But now with OpenBlue and ultimately are creating solutions that deliver on an outcome for our customers. And the outcome is typically focused on energy reduction, obviously heightened indoor environmental quality and then ultimately leading to an autonomous building. And as we focused on our core and then when you look at the contribution that our HVAC business has to being able to achieve those outcomes, it is significant. And so the value proposition comes with being able to create a solution that\u2019s very different than what historically has been provided leveraging our technology and then being able to really leverage the core in how we ultimately deliver on that with the technology that we have in our products. And so we\u2019re confident that when you look at how we\u2019re pricing today, the value proposition we bring and the new products that we\u2019re bringing to market, our new product investment is up about 25%, 28% year-on-year. We\u2019ve got the leading portfolio in heat pumps. Heat pumps now today are going to be a big part of the solution and being able to reduce energy while we\u2019re continuing to enhance the indoor air quality. And we have new heat pumps pretty much across the board where that technology is being applied across our entire portfolio from the most complex industrial applications with our chillers and industrial refrigeration across all of our commercial products rooftops as well as our applied air-cooled chillers going into data centers and then across our residential portfolio. So I\u2019m confident that with the technology, the value proposition and then our ability to fundamentally change how we serve our customers with solutions that focus on outputs delivering for them, we\u2019re seeing significant momentum on that. Scott Davis : That\u2019s helpful, George. And when you break \u2013 I mean, it certainly makes a ton of sense in HVAC. When you think about Fire & Security, how has that sales pitch kind of changed over the last few years? I mean, I certainly understand the connected building, but how specifically has that value proposition, I guess, which is so tangible in HVAC, but perhaps less so in Fire & Security. Maybe you can update us there. Thanks. George Oliver : Yes. The way that we\u2019ve leveraged our Fire & Security portfolio today, it\u2019s still very attractive. It\u2019s still 40% of our revenues. It\u2019s quarter building systems. On the digital side, they are critical systems that do integrate with an overall smart building. And because of the sensors that these systems bring into the building, very important for the data that we collect within OpenBlue and how we ultimately create a smart building. So it starts there. Now you would argue that there\u2019s more around the security systems. So whether it be access control, intrusion or video, those are very important sensors and systems that historically have been separate and apart but then ultimately converge with our building controls and the other digital systems within the building that with now \u2013 with OpenBlue, we can bridge all of those systems into one solution, into one data set. So it starts there. And then from a fire standpoint that when we install a fire system, that the value proposition that we bring through service is significant in our ability to be able to connect and monitor and ultimately be very proactive in how we support our customers through service. So those are the two \u2013 when you think about Fire & Security, the value proposition that it has into the solution set that we\u2019re building and ultimately differentiating the outputs that we can create for the customers that we serve, Scott. Scott Davis : Okay. Make sense. Best of luck, guys for 2023. I\u2019ll pass it on. George Oliver : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Noah, your line is open. Noah Kaye : Good morning. Thanks. Circling back to supply chain health. Can you give us a little bit of a better sense of what you saw across the business lines during the quarter, particularly in Global Products. Maybe quantify any impact on how much revenue was pushed and then just your line of sight on the supply chain helping that improving pace of backlog conversion. George Oliver : Yes. Looking at our Global Products, when you look at the impact that we had, and I think the other point to make here on our Global Products volume, we had a fire in a warehouse within our fire suppression business. It impacted the finished goods that we had stored. And although we work to try to recover that in the quarter, that impacted our growth rate at the product level about 2% or 3%. So that is a big factor. We\u2019re going to recover that volume here in the second quarter and most of it in the second quarter, but maybe into the third quarter. So it\u2019s worthy to mention that. The resi demand hit us for another roughly 1% to 2%. And then when we look at China and then the ability to be able to \u2013 we\u2019re significantly ramping up our applied businesses. So when you look at our applied mix, we\u2019re up double-digit across the board. And so we\u2019re confident that with the capacity expansion, with the work that we\u2019ve done with our supply base and making sure we have visibility to the volumes as we ramp, like I said earlier, in some cases, we\u2019re doubling or tripling our volumes in our applied space. So I\u2019m confident that although \u2013 and then when you look at our total product units, we\u2019re relatively flat because some of the units do go into our direct channel solutions. So we\u2019re going to be ramping here. We\u2019re going to deliver unit growth here as we position for Q2. That will continue to expand as we go through Q3 and Q4. Those are the key factors, Noah, that have been impacting our ability to be able to turn. Noah Kaye : Okay. Very helpful. And then just wanted to circle back to orders timing. Maybe we can focus particularly on sustainability. We look at the pipeline growing, was it 26%, versus the orders growth in the quarter. We\u2019ve obviously had a lot of significant relevant legislation and policy. How much of this is that playing into the actual timing as clients figure out the implications? And are we waiting for things like treasury guidance before more folks sign? Is there any kind of an expected air pocket here? Or do you expect that conversion to significantly increase in the next quarter or two? George Oliver : We\u2019re expecting that this is going to continue to significantly increase. When you look at the IRA, there\u2019s $369 billion in incentives over the next 10 years. We believe \u2013 and it\u2019s all focused on electrification, which we deliver through heat pumps. It\u2019s focused on impact on grid capacity and generation, which we do incorporate renewable supply into our solutions and then just overall energy efficiency. This is right in our sweet spot. And so we think the $369 billion actually multiplied by 5 to 10 times given the amount of resource that will be put to work in being able to deliver on our customers\u2019 sustainability goals. And so when you look at the pipeline that we\u2019re working to convert, it\u2019s well over $7 billion. We had \u2013 last year, that had ramped up to about $1 billion, last year, we see that accelerating over the course of the year. These are larger projects, so it\u2019s hard to predict the timing of conversion. But our teams, we\u2019ve got the team on the field that with the depth and expertise, I think that fundamentally changes how we can go about serving our customers with the type of solutions that we\u2019re developing. And all of that is delivered \u2013 when you think about the optimal solution, it\u2019s not just the equipment because we have leadership equipment. We\u2019re developing a leadership portfolio of heat pumps, but its how the equipment comes together with our digital platform that ultimately delivers on our customers\u2019 expectations. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to, I think differentiate us as we build not only build the pipeline, but begin to convert and capitalize on the opportunity ahead. And just one last note in Europe. It\u2019s similar in Europe. I mean we talked about the IRA. But we\u2019ve been working very closely with the EU with a number of their strategies, the green deal, net zero by 2050. They\u2019ve got the EU level legislation around. They got climate law. They got an energy performance of buildings initiative. And then more recently, it was the REPowerEU focusing on the independent firm Russian fossil fuels. All of these activities, we\u2019ve been aligned working and making sure we\u2019re aligned so that we\u2019re going to be positioned to ultimately achieve the goals that they\u2019re setting out to achieve. Noah Kaye : That\u2019s very helpful color, and I\u2019ll correct myself, that Healthy Buildings pipeline was out 26% and sustainability up 20%. So thank you for the color. George Oliver : Thank you, Noah. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Hey, Jeff. Olivier Leonetti : Hey. Jeff Sprague : I just wanted to actually come back to, I guess, a couple of topics that have already been addressed, but just to really kind of clarify. First, just on the notion of margins improving on kind of acceleration of execution out of the backlog, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s what you\u2019re guiding. I don\u2019t know if you updated the volume forecast for the year. But I guess your guide sort of assumes kind of little or no volume growth. So I guess the first question is, is it that you expect acceleration to happen, but you\u2019re not quite willing to guide that way yet. Or is there some governing factor, supply chain, labor on the job sites, that sort of thing that you\u2019re looking to get past first? Olivier Leonetti : So if you look at the margin acceleration, which is a byproduct of the backlog conversion, as you said, Jeff, that is not really a variable associated with unit volumes. If you look at the field business, which is about $16 billion of revenue for the enterprise, this is more and more a business which is solution based, where you need less and less a relevant measure solution because we sell services, we sell sustainability, we sell indoor air quality. So the margin acceleration is a byproduct of just the conversion, and we are planning to your point, for volume to be growing low-single digits, about 2% for the back half of the year. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then\u2026 George Oliver : A comment on that, Jeff, as we have instituted over the last two years, the significant improvement in our ability to strategically price and then make sure that we\u2019re within that pricing, we\u2019re incorporating future inflation. So as we\u2019re costing in these longer-cycle projects, making sure we have the right cost and the right terms and conditions and the like, that has significantly improved. And so when we look at what\u2019s going to turn in the next three quarters, a high percentage of the projects that are going to turn are in backlog. And the margin is as we have been working through the older backlog that was priced prior to the inflationary period, that is becoming less and less. And so we\u2019re confident that what\u2019s in the margin in backlog is a significant step-up. Now it\u2019s just our ability to be able to minimize disruption, get more precise relative to the material flows that support these projects. And by doing so, we accelerate the velocity of the turn. And what that does, it gives us higher productivity and then also, from an inventory standpoint, our ability to be able to recognize revenue with the execution on a shorter cycle. So that\u2019s a big element. And so I think we\u2019re cautious relative to the continued improvement that we\u2019re seeing in those factors, but we\u2019re confident that the margins that have been booked are going to in turn and be significantly improved over the course of the year. Jeff Sprague : And thanks for that and that partially addresses my second question. But I did want to come back to kind of projects and mix. So you pointed to kind of large projects being mix negative in the quarter. And I think a lot of the kind of OpenBlue healthy buildings, indoor air would inherently often be larger projects. Is it an issue that the stuff that\u2019s coming through the backlog is also as you say, maybe wasn\u2019t priced appropriately for the inflation that was coming but also just inherently had less of the newer stuff embedded in it? Really want to kind of understand if we\u2019re waiting on big projects to come through that. In fact, when we convert them, they\u2019re margin-accretive to the equation. George Oliver : I mean it\u2019s actually the opposite, Jeff. We \u2013 when you look at our core, we have focused our field-based business on our strategy to really differentiate and capitalize on the growth vectors, which is ultimately the energy reduction, the healthy environment and then overall automation of building. Making sure that everything we do is deploying our core capability, core technology, getting it connected and then ultimately converting it to a service. So by doing so, it has refocused the business so that we\u2019re \u2013 the value proposition is greater with what we do. And taking out a lot of the historical contracting that we might have done that ultimately was low margin and didn\u2019t convert to services, there\u2019s a much higher focus on leveraging our core, obviously, leveraging digital and then ultimately delivering on outcomes that historically hadn\u2019t been achieved. And so I think from that standpoint, when you look at our applied product business, we\u2019re up \u2013 it\u2019s up double-digit with the applied products flowing into our channel, which ultimately is helping us create a bigger installed base. It\u2019s also getting the connectivity to that base, which then drives us to be able to create new value propositions with the data that ultimately we use from that installed base. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. George Oliver : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole, your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Nicole DeBlase : I just kind of wanted to pick off where Jeff just left off because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m totally getting it. So I mean, if we think about \u2013 it seems like unfavorable mix was the big cause of the weaker margins in the field business this quarter, but it seems like you do have confidence that then unfavorable mix will not be a factor throughout the rest of the year. So I guess, what is the risk that larger projects come through, again, greater than you expected in the second quarter to the fourth quarter driving then unfavorable mix again? That\u2019s the piece that I\u2019m just not getting. Thank you. George Oliver : Yes, a simple fundamental is we track how we book and what was booked from a cost standpoint and how does that tie to the value proposition and then how it turns. And so Nicole, when we talk about mix, on a forward-looking basis, you have a much \u2013 every quarter, you have less of the older projects that maybe didn\u2019t incorporate the higher inflationary rates that we now have experienced over the last 18 months or so. And so when we talk about mix, it\u2019s part of that as well as our ability to be able to then \u2013 everything we\u2019ve been booking from a strategy standpoint is more aligned to how we create an installed base and ultimately get a recurring revenue from that installed base with service. And that is \u2013 when we talk about on a go-forward basis, that continues to improve, recognizing that we still have projects that will be turning that didn\u2019t necessarily have that factored in. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Thanks, George. That\u2019s really helpful clarification. And then the second thing I just wanted to hit on is the gross \u2013 sorry, the Global Products margins have been really impressive and I think a big driver of upside or offset to field weakness for several quarters now. I guess like what\u2019s the confidence that you can continue to improve Global Products margins from here. At some point, do you kind of see somewhat of a margin ceiling? Thanks. Olivier Leonetti : Yes. If you look at today, so we believe we\u2019re going to be able to maintain the margin in Global Products and keep improving the margin in the field. I know Nicole, just to go back to your prior question on mix, the backlog conversion is the big variable for mix improvement more than anything else. And we have a high confidence in that now happening with no improvement in lead time. Going back to your global margin question, you go back to what George has indicated, we are mainly exposed to the commercial market today in Global Products. Resi is a small proportion of our portfolio. And in Global Products, we are investing heavily in pump. If you look at the new product introductions today, 90% of them are very strong heat pump capabilities. We bought a small asset also in the quarter with [indiscernible] heat pump. So we believe that the channel, the strength of the portfolio is going to keep allowing us to maintain a strong margin in Global Products. And there was no \u2013 if you look at the macro, Nicole, today from a commercial standpoint, it\u2019s still strong for commercial. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Olivier. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Josh, your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Yes. Good morning. So just a follow-up on the IRA. Wondering if that is something that you guys expect to start booking this year and if we really don\u2019t expect to see any sort of shipments until 2024. Is that sort of the way you guys are thinking about the timing booking start this year and maybe start to see the revenue benefit next year? George Oliver : Yes. I mean we\u2019re \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re already working with customers and working through what this means and how they go about it and recognizing that we\u2019re obviously part of that as this bill was formed. And so we\u2019re definitely going to start to see some momentum here on the order side. And then depending on the timing, how that flows through the year and into next, we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated. But that \u2013 this is ultimately helping to build the pipeline that we have and the confidence that we have in being able to turn \u2013 but not only book but then turn sustainable solutions in. It\u2019s across all of our portfolio, right, from residential incentives right up through some of the more complex offerings that we have. Olivier Leonetti : And Josh, this is where the field presence is very important. We have today a field presence, allowing us to advise our customers about how to best leverage the benefits of the IRA. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just on maybe a little deeper trip into the weeds on the IRA. I think there\u2019s like $5 a square foot in commercial energy retrofit incentives. My understanding is some of the stuff like OpenBlue is significantly below that per square foot. Like I guess like it seems sort of like a layup for customers. What would hold them back, if anything? Or is it just the industry, yourselves included, can only install products so fast? George Oliver : Yes. I mean it\u2019s just purely \u2013 there\u2019s an educational element that we\u2019re working through and understanding what it is and then what we can do and how we can go about solving the problem and being able to capitalize on the incentives. And like to your point, the value proposition that we bring with the output that we can create, again, it becomes very attractive for the customer. So it isn\u2019t a matter of \u2013 that I think that they\u2019re going to ultimately proceed. It\u2019s more just the timing of going through that initial upfront process in getting it defined and then ultimately being able to execute. But we\u2019re confident, Josh, with the solution set that we\u2019ve built that we\u2019re going to be well-positioned to be able to capitalize on the dollars that come into the market as a result of that. And some of it is, when you look at customers, it\u2019s also changing how they\u2019re thinking about whether it be capital or OpEx and how these business models are configured and then how they match that to the benefits that they see. So we\u2019re working through that. We\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s working directly with our customer base in sorting that out, but we\u2019re going to start to see momentum that on that both in the orders and then our ability to be able to convert. Josh Pokrzywinski : All right. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there. George Oliver : Thank you, Josh. Operator : Our last question we have Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Gautam, your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Hey, good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if you could talk about any differences you\u2019re seeing in this forward pipeline, order pipeline between Fire & Security and the applied HVAC market. I remember back when you had your Investor Day, you thought those markets would grow at a similar rate. And is that consistent with what you\u2019re seeing today? George Oliver : Yes. So on the Fire & Security, we are seeing strength in the \u2013 with the Dodge construction and the activity coming through, and we\u2019re positioned well on that on the \u2013 more on the retrofit side, we thrive and from a service standpoint and how we upgrade and ultimately reconfigure indoor space and the like. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of that given the hybrid work and how people are coming back to work. And so that is \u2013 those are the factors that drive Fire & Security. We were up both orders and revenue up close to double-digit in both typically a little bit lower growth rate than what we see in HVAC. And then HVAC is really being driven by what we\u2019ve discussed here frequently here during today\u2019s call around the value proposition not only with the efficiency that we bring within the new equipment but the deployment of heat pumps, for instance. We are in a situation where we\u2019ve improved our technology with the temperatures that we can generate. When you take a chiller and convert to a heat pump and then be able to replace a boiler, significantly reduces the carbon footprint for our customers. At the same time, you\u2019re getting 3 to 5 times the efficiency out of the unit. And so you get a tremendous payback. And so it\u2019s through these models, Gautam, that as we begin to unleash what we believe to be a very attractive market and does play to our strengths, that is going to be a different demand cycle than what historically we\u2019ve seen in HVAC. Olivier Leonetti : One statistic, Gautam, to complement what George has indicated, our adjusted pipeline growth today is in the mid-teens, just reflecting what George has indicated. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And then could you comment on your updated expectations for commodity inflation or deflation, I should say, this year? And then if you could just also comment on lead times that you guys are quoting in the applied commercial HVAC space. Thank you. George Oliver : Yes. So on the inflation as it relates to commodities, we\u2019re watching that closely. Certainly, some of that has moderated. But as they\u2019ve moderated, other costs have continued to increase. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re watching closely. And certainly, I want to make sure that we stay disciplined with the impact that, that might have. I think what\u2019s important to us now is that the business proposition here is that we\u2019re creating value not necessarily tied to purely price cost as what historically we would have done. So I think that\u2019s one factor. And then the second on the \u2013 the second was on the applied \u2013 what was\u2026 Gautam Khanna : The lead times. George Oliver : The lead times as a result of the strong demand, you\u2019ve got to realize, Gautam, that as we\u2019ve gone through the last year, we\u2019ve had significant pickup in our backlog around applied. And so on a go-forward basis, it\u2019s important that we get \u2013 we\u2019ve been building our capacity. We were expanding a number of our plants, whether it be water cooled chillers or air cooled chillers or industrial refrigeration. Our data center solutions, we\u2019re significantly increasing our capacity as we\u2019ve been ramping up, and we\u2019ve been doing this in line with the supply chain recovery that we\u2019ve been executing on. And so once \u2013 with this backlog, we\u2019re trying to address the backlog so that we can open up capacity with shorter lead times to now be able to capitalize on what we see to be very strong demand going forward. So the lead times are being reduced. They\u2019re not to where we like them to be. But with the additional capacity we\u2019re putting online as we go through the year, we\u2019re going to be positioned very competitively from a lead time to be able to respond ultimately and support the customer demand that we see. Gautam Khanna : Can you give us what the lead times are today? What is it in like 9 months to 12 months? What do you think of it? George Oliver : They vary. So it\u2019s hard to state any one, depending on the right from the residential to the large commercial, but we\u2019ve been reducing them significantly here over the last six months. We are now with the additional capacity coming on board, I would tell you, our volumes in our applied business on a run rate basis with our chillers and then our water cooled chillers and our air cooled chillers, we\u2019re looking at volumes on a run rate basis that are going to be 2 or 3 times. And so as we\u2019re putting those that capacity in place, it does give us an opportunity on a forward-looking basis to reduce the lead times that we\u2019re quoting to our customers. Gautam Khanna : Thanks, guys. George Oliver : Thanks, Gautam. Operator : That was our final question for today. I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for final comments. George Oliver : Yes. And I\u2019d like to thank everyone once again for joining us on today\u2019s call. As we have discussed, we have a very strong start to the fiscal year. I\u2019m very confident in our ability to execute and continue the momentum in the coming quarters as we step \u2013 really step up into the next phase of our digital transformation journey. And with that, I look forward to seeing many of you over the conferences over the next couple of \u2013 next month or so. And with that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : That concludes the call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Lucas : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls\u2019 second quarter fiscal 2023 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Johnson Controls. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors and cautionary statements in our most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today\u2019s release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls\u2019 website. I will now turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Jim and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u2019s begin with Slide 3. We are proud of our second quarter performance, which saw sales, segment EBITA and adjusted EPS all exceeding the high-end of our guidance. During the quarter, sales grew 13% organically as we realized strong pricing and improved volumes across both our shorter cycle global products and longer cycle business solutions. The overall demand backdrop remains robust with orders growing 8% for Business Solutions and continued momentum with service orders growing 14% in the quarter as the adoption of our digitally-enhanced solutions continues to materialize and provide value for our customers. Our resilient backlog grew 9% to a record $11.7 billion and our service backlog increased by 15%. We made great progress executing on our higher margin backlog build and continue to convert at a faster pace, resulting in improved gross margin performance and strong incrementals. In addition, we realized $75 million in productivity savings and are on track to meet our targets of delivering $340 million in savings for the full year. As a result, adjusted segment EBITA margins expanded 120 basis points. As we move into the second half of the fiscal year, our strategy remains sound as we continue to execute our resilient backlog, deliver on our productivity initiatives and advance our digital transformation. Our pipeline remains healthy and we expect momentum to stay positive. While global macro conditions remain uncertain, we are confident in the fundamentals we have built across our business. Our visibility into the second half of the year provides confidence in raising the lower end of our full year adjusted EPS guide, which Olivier will provide more details on later in the call. We continue to anticipate strong top line growth and backlog conversion in the second half, which should lead to continued margin expansion. Now turning to Slide 4, we continue to demonstrate our unique value proposition and accelerated our leading position through our pillars of growth. We have a significant market opportunity ahead of us connecting smart, healthy and sustainable buildings. As the call for climate action intensifies, we are seeing strong tailwinds for our sustainability, infrastructure and decarbonization offerings. As we have stated in the past, nearly 40% of global energy emissions come from buildings. At Johnson Controls, we play a vital role in helping our customers bridge the gap towards a net zero future. Our systematic approach to digitization is creating a new class of smart buildings, helping reduce energy emissions, improve efficiency and optimize cost. We are well positioned to capture secular trends to help build towards a more sustainable future. OpenBlue is a key differentiator as we advance our leadership position across our vectors of growth. Last quarter, we highlighted the significant progress through our digital transformation journey. And today, we continue to see increased adoption of our OpenBlue platform across multiple use cases. By combining our dynamic product portfolio and services, we are making significant progress in expanding our global footprint of smart building solutions, helping better serve our direct channels through real-time monitoring of connected devices. Our integrated domain expertise and unique capabilities set us apart and we look to continue this momentum as we help our customers deliver their objectives. While we continue to scale and capitalize on these emerging opportunities, we remain committed to building on our strong operational foundation in further expanding our margin profile. We have made great strides in successfully navigating inflationary headwinds and supply chain constraints over the year. As these have eased, our ability to execute is important. We see the results through our progress with our suppliers, disciplined pricing approach and delivering on our productivity savings plan. Lastly, we look to maintain our prudent approach to capital allocation and drive long-term shareholder value through our attractive dividend growing in line with net income as well as consistent share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned over $700 million in capital, including roughly $250 million in share repurchases and nearly $500 million in cash dividends. Moving on to Slide 5, there has been a lot of focus in the past couple of months around commercial construction, particularly with regards to the commercial office sector. While Johnson Controls does have exposure to this sector, it represents a small portion of our overall business. In addition, we have a large installed base, and there continues to be demand for retrofit projects. This slide highlights the overall diversity of the Johnson Controls portfolio. Within Commercial, we are diversified with exposure from retail, lodging and hospitality, sports and entertainment to warehouses. Beyond Commercial, we have a broader exposure to Institutional, Industrial, Data Centers and Government sectors. Funding both for new construction and especially retrofit comes from many different avenues. There remains a lot of pent-up stimulus funds in both the U.S. and Europe that have not yet been released. We have a strong backlog today, and we continue to see a long runway for growth as we leverage our broad portfolio of products and solutions. In addition to our diversification of the verticals we serve, a key differentiator of our portfolio is the ability to leverage our large global installed base of equipment. As we further digitize our offerings to create smart connections, we can create more predictive outcomes for our customers as we help them use the power of data to make net zero a reality. On to Slide 6, service is a key area of focus for us as we leverage our large installed base. We once again saw a strong double-digit growth in sales and orders. We are making tremendous progress in taking what has historically been a mechanical break and fix business in building a solutions-based business that creates a higher margin recurring revenue stream from our large installed base. As we create more predictive outcomes, it not only helps our customers achieve better results, but it also allows us to better leverage our global field operations more effectively. We are creating more standardization across our field operations and capturing better data from our connected solutions. As a result, our higher-margin Parts business grew over 20% in the quarter, and we see this as a growth contributor to our overall service strategy. Decarbonization is an area of focus across the entire Johnson Controls portfolio which includes our sustainable infrastructure or SI business that the KPIs on this slide represent. In addition to SI, decarbonization touches many products and solutions. Nearly 55% of our products and solutions drive sustainability. This includes heat pumps, energy-efficient refrigerants and digital solutions, to name just a few. As an example, when we upgrade an asset or a solution in the field, it drives efficiency at the building level such as software for controls or upgrading a chiller. Within SI specifically, we continue to see strong orders, revenue growth in a very healthy pipeline. The healthy buildings market opportunity remains strong as evidenced by our almost $2 billion pipeline. We are seeing increased traction among both federal and international regulators as productivity benefits associated with well-managed indoor environments come to the forefront. Recently, the European Parliament voted to include a promising enhancement to the energy performance of buildings directive, which would require indoor environmental quality monitoring of buildings. Johnson Controls is encouraged by the latest developments as the IEQ language has the potential to drive increased adoption of digital building systems and deliver improved health and wellness all while accelerating the decarbonization of buildings. Turning to Slide 7, we are honored to be continually recognized for our dedicated sustainability efforts. During the quarter, we received several recognitions, including being named as one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies for the 16th time by Ethisphere. We were especially honored to be named to the Clean200 for the eighth consecutive year. Every year, 200 out of more than 6,000 companies are selected for the high proportion of their revenue earned through a sustainable business. We are proud of the recognition and we\u2019ll continue to further our strategy to help tackle building emissions globally. I will now turn the call over to Olivier to go through the financial details of the quarter. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the summary on Slide 8. Total sales grew 10%, while organic sales increased 13% with strong double-digit growth across each of the segments. Price contributed 10% during the quarter and volumes were up 3%, which was offset by a 3% FX headwind. Adjusted segment EBITA increased 20% with margin expanding 120 basis points to 13.8%. Price/cost was positive and we delivered strong productivity. Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 9, adjusted EPS of $0.75 was favorable to the high end of our guidance by $0.01 and increased 19% year-over-year. Operations contributed $0.12 of the growth in the quarter as price costs continue to gain momentum, and we saw a good drop through on our improved volume. Our SG&A and COGS initiatives delivered $0.09 of growth. Below the line, we did see headwinds from nonrecurring corporate items, FX and net financing costs. Overall, we were pleased with the strong adjusted EPS performance in the second quarter. Let\u2019s now discuss our segment results in more detail on Slide 10 through 13. Beginning on Slide 10, organic sales in our shorter cycle Global Products business increased 12% in the quarter, benefiting from strong price realization of 9% and 3% volume growth. We saw strong growth across most of the portfolio, led by greater than 20% growth in commercial HVAC. This growth occurred in both applied and light commercial, where demand remained strong. Global Residential declined low single-digits as modest growth in the rest of the world partially offset high teens decline in North America. This was a continuation of channel inventory being reset which we will expect to continue for another quarter or two. Fire & Security grew low double digits with continued momentum within our 5 detection products. Industrial refrigeration also experienced double-digit growth in the quarter, driven by solid growth in both North America and EMEALA. Adjusted segment EBITA margins expanded 250 basis points to 18.6% as price costs continue to improve and productivity was positive. Moving to Slide 12 to discuss our Building Solutions performance. Orders increased 8% organically as China rebounded from COVID-related impacts during the first quarter. We saw healthy growth in install orders of 5%, and we\u2019re especially pleased with service orders growing 14%. Our focus and investment around increasing our service offering continues to gain momentum. Total sales grew 11%, with organic sales increasing 13%, made up 10% price and 3% volume growth. Service revenue grew 11% and installed revenue increased 15%. Adjusted segment EBITA increased 16%, with margins expanding 50 basis points, led by positive price costs and improved productivity. Building Solutions backlog remain at record levels, growing 9% to $11.7 billion. Service backlog grew 15%, while installed backlog increased 8%. Let\u2019s discuss the Building Solutions performance by region on Slide 13. Orders in North America increased 8% with strong growth in our government and manufacturing sectors. Service orders grew 14%, with double-digit growth in both recurring and nonrecurring contracts. Overall, demand continues for HVAC and controls, which grew high single digits within the quarter. In aggregate, fire and security orders grew mid-single digits. Sales in North America were up 14% organically with broad-based growth across the portfolio. Our installed business grew 17% with strong growth in both retrofit and new construction, which grew 15% and 20%, respectively. Service continues to perform well, up 9% year-over-year with high-teen growth in our shorter-cycle transactional business. HVAC and controls remain a strong part of the portfolio growing high-teens year-over-year, while fire and security increased low double-digits. Segment margins expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 12.5%, driven by ongoing productivity benefits and the execution of higher margin backlog resulting in positive price/cost. Total backlog ended the quarter at $7.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year. EMEALA, orders were up 7%, led by mid-teens growth in industrial refrigeration and mid-single-digit and low single-digit growth across our fire and security and HVAC and controls platforms, respectively. Overall, service orders grew 13% and led by double-digit growth in our recurring plant service agreements, primarily in security. By region, we saw strong double-digit growth in both Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Sales in EMEALA grew 12% organically with strong low double-digit growth in both service and in store. Our shorter-cycle transactional business was the main contributor to the overall service growth with our recurring plant service agreements reporting solid growth of low double-digits. Overall, momentum continues to build within applied commercial HVAC and fire and security where each contributed to mid-teens growth within the quarter. Segment EBITA margins declined 270 basis points to 6.7% in as headwinds from nonrecurring items offset operational improvements year-over-year. Backlog was up 5% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. In Asia-Pacific, order grew 9% with 20% growth in service, led by strong growth in our shorter cycle transactional business. Overall, install orders grew 6% organically. By region, China recovered from COVID-related lockdowns in Q1 with strong growth of greater than 30% in the second quarter. Sales in Asia Pacific increased 15% with strong mid-teens growth in both service and install. Overall, commercial HVAC and controls grew high teens, while fire and security declined low single digits. China gained momentum as the country continued to reopen during the quarter with strong sales growth of 16%, which included double-digit growth in both service and install. We expect continued recovery with a solid second half performance in China. Segment EBITA margins declined 10 basis points to 11.8% as positive price cost was offset by FX headwinds over the quarter. Backlog of $1.7 billion declined 3% year-over-year. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 14, we ended the second quarter with $2 billion in available cash and net debt remained at 2.2x, which is within our long-term target range of 2x to 2.5x. Free cash flow did turn positive in the quarter as anticipated. Inventory improved sequentially and free cash flow remains a major focus with inventory being a driver to further improvement in the second half. Now let\u2019s discuss our fiscal year \u201823 guidance on Slide 15. We\u2019re introducing third quarter organic sales guidance of approximately 10% as price continues to be a strong contributor. For the third quarter, we expect segment EBITA margin to expand 120 to 130 basis points and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.03 which represents a year-over-year growth of 18% to 21%. On the full year, we are once again raising the lower end of the wide range introduced at the beginning of the year. Our new adjusted EPS range reflects what has been at the top of the range we had discussed as a base case the last two quarters. Our full year adjusted EPS guidance range is now $3.50 to $3.60, representing growth of 17% to 20%. On the top line, we anticipate organic sales to grow approximately 10% for the full year. We now expect segment EBITA margins to expand 100 to 120 basis points as we continue to execute on fulfilling our higher margin backlog. We expect full year free cash flow conversion to be 80% to 90%, recognizing that second half free cash flow will be driven by inventory reduction. We are pleased with our first half performance and see solid momentum entering the back half of the year. Our pipeline remains robust across all our vector of growth and our productive initiatives remain on track. With that, operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Thanks for the questions. So you guys are the last one. So good to finish on a pretty good high here. So on the price cost, we appreciate the extra disclosure around this, 170 for the quarter, roughly half of that in Global Products. Any sense or any kind of color on how that price cost tailwind looks in 3Q and 4Q? Olivier Leonetti : Thank you for you question. Price cost will remain positive, of course, in the line rate for the second half of the year as we keep materializing the strong margin backlog we have in the P&L. George Oliver : In addition, when you look at our base business, what you see happening is all the work that we did through the course of last year, building a very strong backlog with very strong margins. As you see, as we begin to turn that, we\u2019re seeing a nice pickup in the margin rate, which is exactly what we expected. Nigel Coe : Okay. But no hard disclosure around price cost, okay? And then on the pie chart of the exposure, I thought that was really helpful. So roughly 20% Commercial. Obviously, that includes service renovation and new builds. So who is \u2013 to distill is down to just the commercial office new builds, what the message here is it\u2019s like low single-digit exposure to commercial office new build. And so if you can just maybe just comment on that. And then thinking about the exposure to regional bank lending, when you look around that pie chart, where do you see the exposures over and above commercial office? George Oliver : Hey, Nigel, let me touch upon the commercial exposure. I think it\u2019s important to understand the secular trends that are underway and well underway within our sector around sustainability, healthy buildings and digital. And I think the value proposition that we\u2019re bringing to ultimately address these issues do play out across all of the verticals that we support. Now when you look at the commercial sector, we typically are 50% new build and 50% retrofit. And so we\u2019re still seeing very strong not only the conversion of the new build that has been started, but we\u2019re seeing a pickup of opportunities as we\u2019re retrofitting that space now with digital, with upgrading equipment as well as then now focusing on outcomes that we can create now leveraging the connectivity that we have in the building, the data, the way you extract and then using that data to reduce energy consumed and just overall efficiency of the building. So I think right now, even though that\u2019s been a concern, as far as the overall pipeline that we\u2019re developing around is still very strong. And we stay focused on how we differentiate and ultimately then deliver on the challenges that our customers are facing. Relative to the banks, maybe Olivier, you can share your thoughts. Olivier Leonetti : So as we put in George\u2019s preparing remarks, we have a low exposure to the office business. Your number is in the ballpark, Nigel. Our customers also have many funding sources. So we don\u2019t see today an exposure to what is happening in the U.S. in the banking industry. Another data point, as George indicated, the backlog is strong and very resilient, which is another indicator about the strength of the financing sources. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks a lot guys. George Oliver : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hi, good morning. These service orders look order line fantastic, actually. I\u2019m wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the composition. Obviously, you introduced the call with highlighting some of the secular things that you put in place. But when we think about, for example, North America service orders up 14%, should we think of that as driven by existing customers who are taking more of your upsell? Is that the primary driver or is this a recapture of installed base that maybe you weren\u2019t serving before. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lot of different things, but I just wonder if you could kind of characterize maybe the key drivers there. George Oliver : So let me just \u2013 Jeff, let me lay out the fundamentals of our service business. Historically, it has been a mechanical break fix business. And as we\u2019ve been transforming the company with digital, going back and making sure that all of our installed base is connected, we ultimately then use the data to not only enhance the traditional services that we perform, but then add on additional value propositions with energy and space utilization. There is a lot of things that we can do with now the capabilities of OpenBlue. And then ultimately, with that, we get better value propositions and better delivery. Our attrition comes down. And then ultimately, we believe we can sustain double-digit growth with that model. When you look at the quarter, we were up 11% revenue growth, like we said, 14% orders. But the underlying to your question, when you look at connected chillers, we\u2019re up 100% year-on-year. We\u2019re up almost 14,000 chillers that are connected. They are real time, we\u2019re collecting data. We\u2019re performing service and then we\u2019re ultimately creating new opportunities on top of that with additional revenue. And then when you have these agreements in place, you get significant pickup on additional service beyond just the contract that we have. So our PSAs when we talk about performance service contracts, we\u2019re up double digit. And that\u2019s increasing our recurring revenue base on a forward-looking basis that we\u2019re going to be able to achieve, being able to support those customers. And so when you look at the service business \u2013 and then the last thing we highlighted is when you do that with the insights that we\u2019re creating, we can create events \u2013 predictive events, which ultimately drive upgrades predictably versus reactively that ultimately generates business. And so our Parts business is up well over 20% year-on-year as a result of the work we\u2019re doing. So it really takes everything we\u2019ve been talking about as far as mining the installed base, our connectivity to the installed base, we\u2019re up over 600 basis points since Investor Day and in the quarter, 146 basis points year-on-year. And so that is creating the base that we ultimately then go create new value propositions, supporting our customers, especially along the lines of these secular trends. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for that. And then just on Europe and corporate, it sounds like you took a couple of hits that you just digested and moved on. Can you give us some sense of what these were, how large they were and if they are kind of truly non-recurring in nature? Olivier Leonetti : Absolutely. So for EMEALA, the fundamental of the business is the same as for the field business, meaning we have accumulated rich margin orders in the backlog and those rich margin orders are today being realized in the P&L. We don\u2019t see them yet in EMEALA because we had some non-recurring items. Two things, we had last year some tax credits, which are not being reproduced \u2013 the tax items, which are above the line. And we have this year also some UK pension one-off cost which are impacting the EMEALA performance. We expect the EMEALA performance to increase sequentially in Q3 by a sizable amount, and we expect EMEALA performance in Q3 year-on-year to be about flat. So that\u2019s for EMEALA.  For corporate, no structural increase to our cost in corporate, again some one-off, which were good last year for about $20 million, some one-off this year, which are impacting negatively our P&L. It\u2019s a range of items, but no recurring increase in corporate costs. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks, I will leave it there. George Oliver : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. George Oliver : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Just on the answer to Nigel\u2019s question, just to be clear, that commercial, that\u2019s your total revenue. So that\u2019s not \u2013 there is also global exposure outside of the U.S. And you mentioned 50-50 split between retrofit and new, that obviously does not include services as well, you were talking about the equipment split there? George Oliver : See, when we look at our revenues, that takes into everything we do within those verticals for the company, including our Global Products business and then the field business, both install and service. Through cycles, the new construction goes down, the service and retrofit goes up. But as we\u2019ve been now capitalizing on the opportunities with the new service offerings that we have, we are seeing a natural pickup of additional retrofit because of that along the lines of these secular trends. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just lastly on the EMEALA margins, can you maybe talk about the timing of price cost coming through there? Is there any \u2013 regionally, is there any kind of like a lag or lead relative to the inflection you\u2019re now seeing in North America? Olivier Leonetti : We should see the margin to pick up, Steve, in Q3 sequentially by more than 2 points sequentially. And as I indicated, we should be about flat year-on-year. The underlying performance of EMEALA is very strong, as I indicated, and the backlog margin is now being realized at an elevated rate. Steve Tusa : And are you still for the third quarter kind of reaffirming the \u2013 what you had said last quarter with the \u2013 I assume with the guidance being as strong as it is for the third quarter on margins that you\u2019re still comfortable with the profile of the strong year-over-year at North America field? Olivier Leonetti : Correct. The numbers we discussed, Steve, are still intact for Q3 across the plat [ph] including for North America. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. George Oliver : Thank you, Steve. Operator : And our next question today comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. So you\u2019ve got the acceleration in orders sequentially this quarter on a tougher comp. Maybe comment on orders expectations for the back half and pockets of strength that you see? George Oliver : Yes. When we look at what\u2019s happening commercially, you got to look at right from the pipeline we\u2019re developing to how they are converting and what our backlogs are and how they are going to turn. I\u2019ll start with the backlog. The backlog is up 9% in the field year-on-year. When you look at the \u2013 what\u2019s within that backlog, where we\u2019ve \u2013 it\u2019s very resilient and in line with our core strengths. When we look at North America applied \u2013 applied chillers were up, our backlog is up over 30%. And our revenue turn was roughly about 40%. When you look at all in relative to our revenue. And that\u2019s continuing. We\u2019re seeing capitalization of the trends that are underway. We have a very competitive product lineup and we\u2019re actually gaining share. When you look at light commercial globally where backlog is up 30% and revenues returning about 30% so extremely strong performance within the commercial sector. When you look at North America commercial, which rooftops in addition to the applied, we\u2019re on a run rate now with backlog significantly up, and we\u2019re turning now better than 60% growth. And so our focus has been how do we continue to strengthen the pipeline, the conversion and then with the capacity expansion we\u2019ve had and the resolution of some of these constraints from a supply chain standpoint, has really helped us not only reduce lead times, so we can ultimately continue the growth, but now being able to execute on the revenue growth. And so as we look at the secular trends, in the pipeline development around sustainability, healthy buildings, digital now with the digital deployments that we have, we see still a very strong pipeline. And so our focus is how do we make sure within that pipeline, we differentiate with our products. We differentiate with our solutions, leveraging digital, and that is what ultimately gives us confidence that we can continue to convert in a very positive way here through the second half. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thanks, George. And then maybe you can characterize the inventory build in terms of composition and how you see that working down. Certainly, it\u2019s normal to see some seasonal build in parts of the business, but that sort of longer cycle, higher components portion of it, but just being interested in your characterization. Thanks. George Oliver : Yes. Let me address that, and then Olivier can talk about the financial impact. As you look at what\u2019s happened over the last couple of years, we had significant disruption. And as a result of that, we built up inventory. All of that peaked from a day standpoint in the first quarter. We\u2019ve had the entire team now, now that we\u2019ve been really leaning out and getting our capacity in place and working with our key suppliers, we\u2019ve got the supply chain working pretty well. And so as a result of that, we\u2019re not only making sure that we\u2019re protecting the significant ramp in the second half on the commercial backlog that I discussed, but then making sure that we can rebalance all of our input to output relative to the material required. And so we\u2019ve got line of sight to a pretty significant step down in Q3 and in Q4, which gets us back to where we need to be from an overall inventory perspective. Olivier Leonetti : Not much more to add. If you look at the inventory turns in Q2, we improved sequentially by 6 days. We didn\u2019t want to reduce the inventory by much more than that due to the strong demand we will have to satisfy in Q3. For the full year, we expect inventory to be back at the level it was at the end of \u201822. And as we have discussed before, we want to keep improving the inventory turns as we get into \u201824. Noah Kaye : That\u2019s very clear. Thanks for the color. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : George, the parts numbers that you gave, kind of echo Sprague\u2019s comment on service and parts, pretty amazing. What \u2013 I mean, I understand digital is a big role here but is there any way to think about kind of your capture rates and how they have improved over time with digital? Is it \u2013 I\u2019m trying to picture for the most part, if something breaks, people want to replace like-for-like, but maybe around the world, it\u2019s not always that case? But how much has digital, I guess, improved your take rates or capture rates on those spare parts, I guess, is my question. George Oliver : Okay. So I think you\u2019d start with the installed base that we\u2019re serving, and we\u2019re up pretty significantly another 150 basis points. So we have \u2013 and with \u2013 what\u2019s driving that, Scott, is the connectivity. So we go back, we make sure that it\u2019s connected, we have the utilization of the data. We then manage what we traditionally have managed. We get productivity from that. We improve our value delivery and then we have with the insights after 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, we\u2019re comparing that performance to the fleet. And that gives us and we know what vintage the equipment is and then historically, we know predictably where issues are going to ultimately arise. And so what we do is we then go back and do upgrades with parts and continue and this is to avoid any catastrophic failure or just to improve overall efficiency. And so when you look at our connected chillers now, our connected equipment, we\u2019re reducing attrition about \u2013 it\u2019s about half of what the traditional service customer attrition was. And so you get higher penetration of the installed base. You\u2019ve got more ability now to use data to create value propositions on energy, on efficiency, overall utilization. And then when you look at some of these bigger secular trends around sustainability, healthy buildings and then ultimately smart buildings, it becomes the platform that we can then utilize all of our OpenBlue applications to build on top of. So it\u2019s a combination of all of that. And then if you look at historically what has happened when we do have a contract, we\u2019re seeing significant pickup when we say L&M is because it\u2019s coming out of the utilization of data and then how we\u2019re presenting additional opportunities to the customer to then be able to capitalize on. Does that help, Scott? Scott Davis : Yes. No, it does. And I think maybe just as a natural follow-on, when you use the term vintage, I think is appropriate. I think there is always been a view that these \u2013 the big chillers just last forever. And in fact, they seem to last a very long time. But given decarb or other drivers, are you seeing the actual kind of useful life or vintage come down because there is a greater interest in people pulling 35-year old or 30-year-old units out of service because it just doesn\u2019t make any sense, where maybe in the past, it did make sense to keep them alive? George Oliver : So what I would say is we\u2019ve actually seen both. We have assets that we can go in and on a run rate basis, significantly reduce energy consumed to benefit the customer and ultimately address some of the sustainability challenges that they are facing. Then in other cases, we can put a value proposition together to upgrade the equipment, to deploy digital and then to get a payback based on how those \u2013 that equipment is actually operating. So that\u2019s what we do through our sustainable infrastructure business, which today, we have a significant pipeline that we\u2019re working to convert. It\u2019s about $7 billion. And so Scott, it really depends on what the current operations out, what the current age of the equipment is, how it\u2019s operating. And then what we do is try to provide our value proposition that is the best in their case that ultimately achieves what they are trying to set out to do. Scott Davis : Very interesting. Thank you. Best of luck, guys. Appreciate it. George Oliver : Thanks, Scott. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So volumes in the quarter really stood out with a nice improvement to up 3% versus, I believe, down 1% last quarter. Does this pickup just reflect the catch-up in volumes pushed out of last quarter or more so supply chain improvement or company capacity additions. And with that, we look at like around 9% organic in the back half, how much volume is expected on that? George Oliver : Well, let me start by saying, operationally, we have seen significant improvement across our portfolio. So when you look at our velocity in the field-based business, you\u2019re definitely seeing recovery in the backlog because that had built as we \u2013 as you recall, last year, we had extended our project cycle times because of supply chain and other challenges. That now is getting back in line. So that\u2019s some of the reduction and then the \u2013 or the increased revenue. And then in the products business, the same holds true. We have really done some significant work in how we\u2019ve expanded our capacity to now capitalize on these trends to be able to be competitive with lower or shorter lead times in the market, to continue the growth in the backlog, which is what we\u2019ve done. And so it\u2019s a little bit of both where we\u2019re covering the backlog and then because of our ability to be able to better serve customers, that is ultimately helping us to be able to drive growth. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I appreciate that. And then I also wanted to follow-up on service orders, but specifically the relationship between service and equipment orders. Service obviously has some pretty good secular tailwinds with OpenBlue and the market share opportunity that brings. But there are also is a connection between service and equipment when we look at attaching, right? So I guess my question is, if we do hit a period of cyclical pressure and equipment orders are down on that, what is the ability or the opportunity to kind of grow service orders through the cycle? Thank you. George Oliver : Let\u2019s start with the overall model. So it starts with the installed base. And even though we\u2019ve made significant progress, we still are currently performing service on short of about half \u2013 about 50% of the base that we put out into the field over the last couple of decades. And so the opportunity for us is to continue to penetrate that installed base, doing upgrades, deploying digital and then ultimately providing these outcomes that I think with the combined portfolio that we have, which is the leadership HVAC, equipment portfolio and a leadership building solutions, the two combined to be extremely differentiating relative to the outputs that we can create. And so we believe that the continued expansion of the attach rate to that installed base, the ability to be able to connect, use data, there is significant value that we generate to our customers. And in any downturn, the single biggest reduction is energy savings. And so when we deploy a full solution, we can reduce energy 20%, 30%, 40% and then couple that with the improved overall operation of the building beyond just the chiller, there is significant benefits to be able to be achieved for the customers. So I believe that the differentiation with the value, the ability to be able to go get more of our installed base, to build on that, real differentiated solutions, utilizing the data in AI is going to be \u2013 is going to continue to allow us to be able to expand services no matter what the cycle is that we ultimately experience. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. There has been a lot of questions on the Building Solutions side, so maybe looking at Global Products for a second. You have had very, very good operating leverage first half of this year and the last 2 years. You are running up against some tough comps in the back half. So, I just wondered how you are thinking about the degree of margin expansion year-on-year in Global Products. And then looking out beyond the very short-term \u2013 when we look at some of your peers, Honeywell\u2019s margins are quite a bit higher, your HVAC peers are somewhat lower. So, how should we think about kind of normal operating leverage or incremental margins in Global Products beyond 2023? George Oliver : Yes. So, let me just give you the overall strategy and Olivier can touch upon the financials. When you look at what we are doing within the Global Products business, it starts with making sure we have leadership product. And we have invested over the last 5 years or 6 years. And I think we are positioned pretty much across the portfolio to lead and differentiate. And the differentiation obviously drives value with how we serve our customers. So, it starts there. The second is making sure that we are operationally local for local and making sure we have a robust and resilient supply chain, and we have made a lot of progress there. So, from a cost standpoint, we ultimately can maintain low cost and how we ultimately serve the key markets that we serve. And so \u2013 and then from an overall SG&A, what we have been focusing on is really getting leverage out of the SG&A structure, and there is still significant opportunity ahead of us to simplify that, Julian. And so I think the \u2013 as we look at our product business, where we have been and where we are, there is still significant room for improvement. Obviously, it\u2019s going to be driven by the continued leadership product, the digital content, the connectivity that\u2019s going to ultimately be valued. And then ultimately, that translates into the solutions that we provide in the field. And so we are in a position to continue. We are getting good, continued strong price cost because of the product and because of the value proposition, that\u2019s going to continue, Julian. Olivier, do you want to\u2026? Olivier Leonetti : Yes, absolutely. If you look at the second half for GP, as you said, Julian, the strength in the year-on-year margin trend will start to normalize because of the tough comp. And what will take over in terms of margin profile for the second half is our solution business, where you see the trend, which happened in Q2 is going to accelerate in the second half of the year. So, that\u2019s your first question. Regarding your second question beyond \u201823, we believe we can deliver 30% incremental. George mentioned a few of the points supporting this. We believe in a Global Product, we have strong product offering, heat pump is going to be part of this. And then we also are very bullish about what our Building Solutions margin could be at the back of solution services enabled by digital. On top of that, we have strong operating leverage capability in the P&L. As we keep growing, we have invested over the last 2 years. We believe that this investment will start to slow down, and we should be able also to increase leverage next year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just my second one more on the portfolio, you have seen some moves at one of your peers recently. So, I just wondered, given it\u2019s been 7 years or so since the large, very major portfolio move at JCI, how are you thinking kind of, George and Olivier about P&L, the elements of pruning here? Do you start to maybe get back on to M&A now that you are quite far through the current 3-year plan in terms of savings extracted from the base business. And then put a finer point on it, what is the appeal to you of that European residential heat pumps market? George Oliver : Yes. Let\u2019s reflect on what we have been. We did the merger with the divestiture of the seating business back in 2016 with the merger with Tyco and Johnson Controls. And then we said from the strategy that we laid out was to really step back and understand what the future buildings would be and what was going to be required to ultimately win with the trends that were underway. We said, at the end of the day, the value proposition with a leading HVAC business, combined with having a leading building management platform that the two combined is ultimately what\u2019s going to be required to be able to deliver smart, sustainable, healthy, most productive, most efficient buildings. And that has been our strategy. So, as we have been looking at our portfolio, continuing to strengthen HVAC, not only with our organic investments, but also looking at potential bolt-ons or gaps that we might have. And heat pumps has been a huge focus of ours, I mean our \u2013 when you look at our heat pump portfolio, about half of our HVAC portfolio is made up of heat pumps. We have had significant reinvestment into heat pumps, and that\u2019s going to be a continued focus of ours as you stated, from an M&A standpoint. And then on the digital side, what\u2019s happening, the combination of what we have done in our building management system platforms coming together, now with a leading data platform with OpenBlue, it really does position us to now differentiate the solutions that we can ultimately serve our customers with, Julian, with the combination. And so with that, from a capital deployment, we have been certainly providing \u2013 returning a lot of capital back to our shareholders through dividends and in share repurchases, and that\u2019s continuing to be strong, and we are going to continue to focus on from an inorganic standpoint where we can leverage the strength of the strategy that we are executing organically and how do we complement that with M&A. Olivier Leonetti : No, nothing more to add. [Indiscernible] is going to be the name of the game, services, digital, IP and products and in terms of pruning George answer to that is going to be really at the margin, but nothing significant we want to do. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start \u2013 I think George, you said about 50-50 mix in office on the sort of new versus retrofit side. Just wanted to confirm that it would be something simpler or something similar for non-res exposure? And then could you talk about sort of retrofit and how much of that activity is dependent on third-party financing or most of that just internally sourced from customers as well as the push versus pull dynamic. How much of these sales do you think you are sort of generating on the sort of push side and going out there and selling the advantages versus customers coming to you and asking for this? George Oliver : Yes. When you look at our vertical markets we serve in line with commercial, we talked a little bit about commercial, but it\u2019s similar percentages, plus or minus relative to installed to service. A big focus of our company now is not only to get the equipment installed, but then to be able to, from a solution set standpoint, leveraging our data, to really being capitalized on that installed base with the recurring revenue over the life cycle. So, there is a big focus on continuing to expand our services across all of the key verticals that we support. But it is historically, if you asked the question, it\u2019s similar type percentages, installed to service, it varies a little bit by vertical. As it relates to non-res in general, when we look at the overall non-res, the indices that we look at, what we are seeing the benefit of is the construction starts are up and a lot of that was the projects that put into the pipeline over the last couple of years, and that\u2019s benefiting us. The good news is that ABI has come back a bit and stabilized and somewhat positive here in the month of March. So, when we look at the indices, it\u2019s still very strong. Our pipeline around non-res across the board is very strong. And our task is that to then within that pipeline, to really differentiate. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, especially as we focus on these secular trends, as we talked about today around sustainability, healthy buildings and then ultimately delivering smart building. So, we don\u2019t see significant differentiation across the verticals. I would tell you that right now, healthcare is strong and data centers are strong. And there is a lot of verticals that play to our strengths that we are capitalizing on. But I would tell you right now, it\u2019s pretty much across the board. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. And then Olivier, just thinking about the back half of the year, I mean it seems like from a sort of top line growth perspective, looks like the third quarter would be in a pretty tight band across the segment, something like high-single digit, low-double digit growth and then Q4, maybe more mid-single digit, high-single digit across the segments. The question is, when you look at it, where do you see the greatest upside risk? Is this primarily a function of ongoing supply chain constraints? And if those were to ease, and where could you see things come in a little bit better? Olivier Leonetti : So, if you look at today and you sense it from the call and from also our print in Q2, I mean, of course, you have always some risk in a large business like ours, but we are very confident about the market we are facing. The value proposition of our company is resonating. If you look at the macro indicator level, the commercial markets across the world actually strengthening. You see the backlog is strong. The backlog is growing. So, today, we feel that this is a balanced set of expectations for the second half. And again, we said that all along, we have accumulated a sizable backlog at very rich margin, and that is going to give us also a lot of momentum going forward. George Oliver : I think a key statistic is when we look at our Global Products business, which kind of spans all of our markets, when you \u2013 with the exception of the softness we see in resi ducted, our backlog in our Global Products business, when you look at both direct and indirect, is up over 20%. And so you realize that, that ultimately plays to our strength with the work we are doing around the commercial sectors. Joe O\u2019Dea: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Olivier Leonetti : Hi Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just starting on the orders, really strong in the quarter, accelerated versus 1Q. Any thoughts on how orders are trending into April? Has that strength continued? And also, any thoughts on how you guys are seeing orders in the third quarter just because the comp \u2013 the 2-year stock comp does get a little bit tougher from here. Thank you. George Oliver : Yes. I think when we look at our commercial operating system that we are really driving is \u2013 in really understanding market and the pipeline development, how we are converting by vertical, by region, looking at not only global products, but also solutions, we are tracking as we have been. Now, you understand through the quarter, typically, a lot of the project business gets weighted to the second half. So, based on what we are seeing with activity with the pipeline that we are building and how we are converting, it\u2019s in line with what you would expect, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then I know it\u2019s a small part of your business, but just wanted to discuss the North America resi market. I was just a little bit surprised to see it down high teens for you guys, just a little bit worse than peers. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you are seeing with respect to price versus volumes and the inventory dynamics in the channel? Thank you. George Oliver : Yes. So, when we look at resi, we look at it globally. Total resi was down about 4%. Obviously, with JCH being up single digits with our North America business down in the teens. Now, when we look at that, obviously we are going through \u2013 we are seeing sequential improvement, not only through our operations, but now with the rebalance of inventory with our distributors and that\u2019s playing out as we planned. And then when we look at where the growth is going to come from, while deductive business is under maybe a little bit of pressure in North America. Our ability to be able to now capitalize on BRF and our rack and pack and our unducted, our ductless business is very strong. And so when you look at our business there globally, it\u2019s starting to accelerate based on what we see. And so I think that\u2019s a position that we believe we are going to be able to capitalize on, given the strength of our unducted portfolio and continue to be able to gain share there with the deployment of that product. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks. I will pass it on. George Oliver : Thanks Nicole. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hello Joe, your line is open or is it perhaps muted. I apologize we will go on to the next question, and that comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Good morning everyone. George Oliver : Hi Deane. Deane Dray : And there was a reference early in the prepared remarks about pent-up stimulus still waiting to be released. Could you just take us through the key buckets there, the line of sight and then where and how would you benefit? George Oliver : Yes. When we look at all of the programs that have been playing through with the COVID programs, the Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act. And then in Europe, the 55, the building standards, we are tracking that pretty much across the board, and we participated in ultimately developing those bills. And so as we are tracking this, we have seen \u2013 if you look at the problems now, our customers are trying to solve, whether it would be education or healthcare or any of these type of problems. We are seeing \u2013 we started to see a pickup last year, and that\u2019s continuing this year and being able to now add funding, getting to our customers and ultimately converting. That\u2019s going to take \u2013 when we look at the deployment of all of that, Deane, over the next 10 years, it peaks roughly about 5 years out. So, it\u2019s not going to come into play immediately, but we are beginning to see those moneys flow to the customers that ultimately can put it to work in solving some of these problems that they are solving around sustainability and healthy buildings and the like. So, we do see that as a \u2013 we size the market on a run rate basis about $250 billion when we did our Investor Day. We believe that the funding that\u2019s coming into play more than supports the ability to be able to capitalize on that market opportunity. And then with our not only leadership product, but the solution set that we are building with digital, then positions us to really get more than our fair share. Deane Dray : Got it. I appreciate that. And then a follow-up question for Olivier on free cash flow. Just given the comments and expectations on the inventory step down in the second half, the cash conversion from that. Is that included in your reaffirmed cash flow conversion guidance 80% to 90%, or would that be potential upside? Thanks. Olivier Leonetti : It is included in our guide. And again, we discussed about this. We have clear line of sight of what needs to be done. We have reduced inventory sequentially by about six days. And we have \u2013 we could have done more and indicated why we did not. We need to satisfy the strong demand we have in Q3, but we have clear line of sight of this inventory reduction, and that\u2019s indeed embedded in our guide. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Hi. Good morning guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I had a question that I was hoping you could help us with, which is on orders related to install. So, I wanted to get a sense for how much is equipment price up year-over-year in the orders? And then how much does equipment price represent as a percentage of a total job you will book? I am trying to understand like are you booking an install higher volumes as well as higher prices. If you could give us some color on that. George Oliver : Yes. So, when we look at our installed business, it\u2019s really focused on the core as we have continued to make sure that we are increasing our installed base. And then ultimately, we are capitalizing on the recurring revenue we get through service on the life cycle. So, when you \u2013 on that business, we are increasing both price as well as volume on the core. Where we defocused is some of the other contracting that goes in line with some of those projects that we have deemphasized. But when you look at the core business that ultimately is driving our product sales and in creating an installed base to be able to generate services, that\u2019s continuing to grow both price as well as volume. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And can you say how much price is up on equipment maybe year-over-year within the installed business? George Oliver : It would be, Gautam, it would be in line with the overall price that we are yielding as a company, were a high-single digits price. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And then could you maybe refresh us on your targeted \u2013 maybe over the next 12 months where you think service attach rates, how much of that could grow? Previously, you guys were talking about 40%, where are you targeting over the next 12 months? George Oliver : Well, what we are targeting is continued acceleration. We are \u2013 like I have said earlier, we are up about 100% year-on-year with our connected chillers. That ultimately gives us the opportunity to get additional revenues and reduce attrition and improve the overall performance. And so what we committed is we are going to see just continued sequential as well as year-on-year progress in our ability to be able to now connect and mine that installed base. Olivier Leonetti : We think that this low-double digit growth in services is going to be \u2013 is potentially subject to an acceleration. As we keep digitizing services offering, this service business will increase. Attach rate is one dimension, that\u2019s not the only one. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hey. Good morning all. Just wanted to come back to Slide 5 and specifically the decarbon, the healthy pipeline, about $10 billion. Can you just remind us what the hit rate or the conversion rate typically looks like there? And then is there anything unique or elongated about some of the timing on those projects? George Oliver : Yes. So, on the \u2013 let\u2019s start with the sustainable infrastructure. We did have a nice pickup in orders which was 29%, which was a pickup from Q1. The revenue turned strong at roughly about 16%, and that\u2019s going to continue. The pipeline is about $7 billion that we have been working to convert and this is where we put together a solution with our products, with our digital and then ultimately create an outcome, continued strong pipeline execution, conversion on that. On the healthy buildings, on a year-on-year, we are only up 2% order, but recognizing that was to a tough compare. We do believe our pipeline right now is up about 69% as it relates to these projects. So, there is still significant demand. So, that hasn\u2019t changed since COVID and we are positioned now with the, I think differentiation, not only with the product, but also now the digital solutions that really differentiate how we can actually serve the customer with those capabilities. So, both are continuing to be very strong. In addition, a lot of that also converts to service. When we go and sell our healthy building solutions, there is a tail that comes through with the services that we built. Brett Linzey : Great. George Oliver : So, I think that was the last question. Just I would like to thank everyone once again for joining our call this morning. We delivered a very strong first half and well positioned to build on that momentum in the second half of the year. Certainly, the digitization of our offerings continues to accelerate as we lead the way towards a smart, healthier and more sustainable future for our stakeholders. I look forward to engaging many of you over the coming weeks. And with that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Lucas : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls\u2019 third quarter fiscal 2023 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.johnsoncontrols.com.  Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today we will make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Johnson Controls.  These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors and cautionary statements in our most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today\u2019s release.  We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls\u2019 website. I will now turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u2019s begin with slide three. Johnson Controls delivered strong quarter that met the high end of our guidance. We delivered 9% organic sales growth, adjusted segment EBITDA margin expansion of 130 basis points and 21% adjusted EPS growth.  Our longer cycle building solutions business continued to show strength globally, and service momentum accelerated, driven by our enhanced solutions and increase adoption of our digital offerings.  Orders grew 8% overall with service orders leading the way with 12% growth. Our backlog ended the quarter up 8% to $12 billion across both install and service. We remain confident in the resiliency of our backlog and order momentum as our performance during the quarter solidifies our investments in building a world-class service organization. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities and the outlook for orders in our longer cycle businesses remains robust. In our shorter cycle Global Products business are applied in rooftop businesses delivered another quarter of very strong double digit growth and demand remained strong.  We also continued to see strength in our commercial ducted and fire detection businesses. Consistent with trends in the industry, our ducted North American residential business remain soft. Overall, we are encouraged by the continued strength and good visibility across our building solution segments. As we look ahead for the remainder of the year with one quarter to go, we are narrowing our full year adjusted EPS guide to approximately $3.55, which represents the midpoint of the previous range. At Johnson Controls, we continue to expand on the solid foundation that we have built with strong order momentum and a record backlog driving consistent top line growth. We have made good progress in enhancing profitability across our portfolio throughout the fiscal year and we have significant actions underway that we believe will result in further margin expansion.  Now turning to slide four, we have spent the past few years investing more strategically in our service business and we are seeing strong returns from those investments. During the third quarter service orders in sales, both grew 12%. Our service business has transformed from a traditional break and fix business to helping customers proactively and more efficiently optimize management of all assets in the building. Digital is becoming an important enabler to driving more service opportunities and growth. We also accelerated sales of our higher margin parts business, which once again grew at a strong double digit pace in the quarter.  Decarbonization is an area of focus across the entire Johnson Controls portfolio. This includes our sustainable infrastructure or SI business, as well as many products and solutions in our portfolio such as heat pumps, energy-efficient refrigerants and digital solutions. In fact nearly 55% of revenue comes from sustainable products and solutions.  We continue to see strong demand in our SI business with orders growing 20% in the quarter. Heat pump sales were up mid-single digits globally, with very strong double digit growth in our applied and industrial refrigeration businesses.  During the quarter we acquired M&M Carnot, a leading provider of natural refrigerant solutions, with ultra-low global warming potential or GWP. M&M designs equipment and controls that use carbon dioxide, which has a GWP of 1. By contrast, traditional refrigerants can have GWPs in thousands, magnifying rather than solving global warming.  We've spent the past few years defining our multi-phased digital strategy to transform environments to more effectively use data to drive outcomes for our customers and we continue to gain momentum.  In the quarter we grew our connected revenue at a high single digit rate and we surpassed 16,000 connected chillers. We're now expanding OpenBlue into connecting controls and security to better optimize customer assets and improve outcomes in buildings, further differentiating our offering.  Historically, building required standalone system to manage each asset within the building. Today connected buildings are creating a single digital dashboard optimized for energy, but still require multiple systems to manage the assets. We are making great progress in creating the digital threat throughout the building life cycle and connecting controls is the next step in the evolution of this journey.  Moving on to slide five, we recently announced the acquisition of FM :Systems, which is an important next step in adding critical capabilities to OpenBlue. FM:Systems is a leader in the growing Integrated Workplace Management System or IWMS sector. IWMS furthers our OpenBlue capabilities, allowing Johnson Controls to offer a one-stop solution that helps customers accelerate their digital transformation journey, improve building efficiency, and reduce operational costs. FM:Systems advances OpenBlue\u2019s capabilities and brings a significant amount of data including service, space utilization, and real estate portfolio management. The addition of FM's capabilities into OpenBlue enhances Johnson Controls relationship with customers by providing a full suite of integrated outcome based solutions. Turning to slide six. Extreme temperatures are increasingly straining buildings, putting at a risk the ability to deliver comfortable and healthy indoor environments. Our OpenBlue Digital Solutions help optimize indoor air quality, comfort and energy consumption, while monitoring outdoor air conditions, ensuring our customers can meet their operating objectives, even in the most extreme conditions. When paired with our OpenBlue Digital Services, we are uniquely positioned to help our customers deliver a healthy, indoor environments, while optimizing costs, reducing emissions, and ensuring HVAC equipment is operating at peak performance, ready for any condition.  We spoke earlier to the progress we are making expanding margins and we are not done. Supply chains are improving, which have normalized lead times, allowing us to create better operating leverage in our manufacturing facilities. We continue to make progress in improving our SG&A structure and have additional actions underway to further optimize our performance.  On capital allocation, we have established a track record of being prudent and disciplined. In fiscal 2023, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, in addition to investing in several strategic acquisitions.  Climate change is a defining theme of this century. With nearly 40% of emissions coming from buildings, we have the technology and the people to turn buildings from one of the greatest challenges into one of the biggest and best solutions.  I will now turn the call over to Olivier to go through the financial details of the quarter. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : Thanks George and good morning everyone. Let me start with the summary on slide seven. Total sales grew 8%, while organic sales increased 9% with strong double-digit growth in our service business. FX was a 2% headwind in the quarter. Adjusted segment EBITA increased 17% with margin expanding 130 basis points to 16.4%. Price cost was positive and we delivered strong productivity savings. Turning to our EPS bridge on slide eight, adjusted EPS of $1.03 was at the high end of our guidance and increased 21% year-over-year. Operations contributed $0.23 of the growth in the quarter, benefiting from positive price costs and our ongoing SG&A and COGS actions. Below the line, we saw headwinds from net financing costs, FX and non-controlling interest. Overall, we were pleased with the strong adjusted EPS performance in the third quarter. Let\u2019s now discuss our segment reserves in more detail on slides nine through 12. Beginning on slide nine, organic sales in our shorter cycle Global Products business increased 6% in the quarter, with 8% of price, offsetting a slight volume decline. Global Products continues to see strength in the applied business, where our rooftop business in North America has nearly doubled this year.  Fire & Security grew low single digits with continued momentum within our Fire Detection Products. Industrial refrigeration had another strong quarter growing over 20% driven by North America.  Our Global Products third party backlog increased 8% from the prior year to $2.5 billion. Adjusted segment EBITA margins declined 10 basis points against a tough comparison to 22.1%, as continued weakness in the residential North America market offset positive price cost and productivity savings. Moving to slide 11 to discuss our Building Solutions performance. Orders increased 8% organically as demand remains strong and we continue to convert our healthy pipeline. For the third consecutive quarter, service orders grew low double digits with 12% growth in the quarter as our focus strategy on transforming services into a more predictable consistent business is paying dividends.  We saw installed orders increase 6% against a tougher comparison led by double digit orders in North America in the prior year. Total sales grew 10% with organic sales increasing 11%. We saw strong double digit growth in both service and installed growing 12% and 10% respectively.  Adjusted segment EBITA increased 35% with margins expanding 240 basis points as we continue to execute higher margin backlog and recognize savings from our productivity initiatives. Building Solutions backlog remains at record levels growing 8% to $12 billion. Both service and installed backlog increased 8% year-over-year. Let's discuss the Building Solutions performance by region on slide 12. Orders in North America increased 5% with continuous strength across our HVAC & Control platforms, up high single digits year-over-year. Overall there was robust demand in our office data center, government, manufacturing and education sectors.  Service continues to perform well, increasing 8% year-over-year, driven by our shorter turn transactional business. Sales in North America were up 10% organically with broad-based growth across the portfolio. Our installed business grew 11% with over 20% growth in new construction. Our service business maintained its strong momentum with 9% growth.  Sales across our HVAC & Controls platform grew low teens year-over-year, while Fire & Security increased high single digits. Segment margins expanded an impressive 270 basis points year-over-year to 14.4%, driven by ongoing productivity benefits and the continued execution of higher margin backlog. This resulted in a strong price cut performance. Total backlog ended the quarter at $8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. In EMEA/LA orders were up 10%, driven by healthy growth in service up 19% year-over-year. Industrial refrigeration and HVAC & Controls had solid reserves in the quarter with each growing over 25%, driven by the decarbonization efforts in the United Kingdom and Northern Europe. By region, we saw double digit growth in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. We saw strong demand in both our government and industrial sectors. Sales in EMEA/LA grew 9% organically, led by mid-teens growth in service as our shorter cycle transactional business continues to have good momentum. Applied commercial HVAC grew high single digits, driven by healthy performance in Latin America.  Fire & Security grew high single digits within the quarter. Segment EBITDA margins declined 10 basis points to 8.6%, but increased 190 basis points sequentially, driven by further improvement of higher margin backlog conversion. Backlog was up 6% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. In Asia Pacific, orders grew 14% driven by double digit growth in both service and installed. By region, China grew 14% year-over-year with continued strength in data centers and manufacturing sectors. North East Asia had growth of high teens driven by Controls. Sales in Asia Pacific increased 16% with 19% growth in service and 14% growth in install. Overall commercial HVAC and Controls grew approximately 20%, driven by the installed business within China, while Fire & Security declined low single digits. China continued its momentum from Q2 reporting 25% growth in the quarter, which included double digit growth in both service and install.  Segment EBITDA margins expanded 110 basis points to 13.9%, driven by ongoing productivity savings and the execution of higher margin backlog, resulting in positive price costs. Back log of $1.7 billion increased 2% year-over-year.  Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on slide 13. We ended the third quarter with $1.1 billion in available cash, and net debt declined 2.1x, which remains within our longer-term target of 2x to 2.5x. Inventory turns improved sequentially and free cash flow remains a major focus, with inventory being a key driver to further improvement in the fourth quarter.  Now let's discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year \u201823 guidance on slide 14. We are introducing fourth quarter sales guidance of approximately 4%. We expect Building Solutions momentum to continue, while Global Products faces a tough year-over-year comparison driven by inventory reduction in residential HVAC and certain Fire and Security and direct channels as lead time have materially improved.  For the fourth quarter, we expect segment EBITDA margin to expand approximately 60 basis points and adjusted EPS to approximate $1.10, which represents 11% year-over-year growth. For the full year, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance to approximate $3.55, which represents the midpoint of the prior range. This represents 18% year-over-year growth. We expect organic sales to grow high single digits and segment EBITDA margins to expand approximately 110 basis points. We expect free cash flow conversion to be roughly 70% as we make good progress on inventory reduction, while not at the level we were expecting, given some inventory reduction occurring in our indirect channels.  We see good momentum continuing to build for fiscal \u201824. Our longer cycle Building Solutions segments continue to experience strong orders and backlog remains at record levels. Global Product is benefiting from strength in the larger commercial HVAC space, while residential HVAC comps should ease entering the new fiscal year. We have made good progress on expanding margins this year and we are not done.  With that operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Maybe we could just unpack a little bit more the fourth quarter sales growth, especially within Global Products. So it sounds like you're still seeing, I don't know, high single-digit growth in the solutions businesses and it looks like products down mid-single digits or so. Is that correct? And maybe just talk about some of the headwinds. I mean, I think resi HVAC we understand, but maybe just talk about the First & Security Products headwinds. Maybe unpack between geographies and end markets. George Oliver : Yes, good morning, Nigel. Let me start by saying our overall commercial business, both products and services, remains incredibly strong. And what I would say is across the board, hitting on all cylinders, we do continue to see strong bookings in our applied, in our rooftop \u2013 commercial rooftop businesses across the board.  When you look at our Building Solutions, you know we made great progress during the course of the year, improving the margins and the service momentum now is expected to continue. And when I look at our Building Solutions business, we've got a very strong backlog. And more important is, within that backlog, the mix of services that are coming through with the momentum that we've been building and now adding FM :Systems is going to be a big add to that. Now, referencing the orders in Q4, in revenue in Q4, when you look at our residential and Fire & Security businesses, we have been experiencing some short-term pressure in our shorter cycle book-to-bill business and it's in those two areas. The inventories in the channel are resetting as we've been able to improve lead times and so therefore there are some short-term adjustments in the book-to-bill revenues.  But what I would say is with those adjustments, we're continuing to execute with the deployment of our new products and we're seeing good traction there and as we project going forward, we still see that coming back and being very strong as we set up for 2024.  So on the resi I think it's in line with what you're seeing across the industry and on Fire & Security is mainly in our products business, which ultimately is a book-to-bill business and therefore we're seeing that adjustment. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's clear. We\u2019ll follow-up offline. George you mentioned \u201824 and obviously we turn the calendar into FY\u201924 very soon. So, maybe just talk about how you're thinking about the setup for \u201924, I don't know, based on the backlog conversion or customer conversations, how should we think about the top line environment for FY\u201924. George Oliver : No, Nigel what I'd say is that, you know we're still building the \u201824 plan, but I\u2019d touch upon some key items here that I think really set us up well for \u201824.  When you look at the commercial markets and as I talked a little bit earlier, we see that are incredibly healthy, and are playing to our strengths, especially with the secular trends that are underway within the commercial space. And so that, we see with our orders up 8%, with our backlog up and our Building Solutions business that $12 billion and even in our Global Product business, despite some of the inventory adjustments, we are up about 8% in our Global Product business also.  And so when you look at that, that momentum is going to continue. Now if you add the stimulus spending that we don't believe has really been materialized yet, is in the background. And I believe with these secular trends and the combination of what we're doing in HVAC with our digital platform and our services are going to benefit really nicely from the investments that ultimately are going to be needed to drive sustainability.  Then if you look at our backlog, we look at this very closely. It's very resilient and very strong with the idea that we believe that even through the next quarter we've got an incredible pipeline that we're converting. We're working to develop the backlog, so that when we plan and ultimately enter into next year, we're going to have a nice backlog to work from.  Then the last is really the acceleration of the transformation of our Building Solutions business to services. You know that proposition is playing out. I would call it our flywheel, which has been accelerating, which is about creating installed base, getting that base connected with higher attach rates, with higher revenue per customer. That leads to lower attrition and then all of that spins out additional business like with our spare parts and upgrades and the like, so.  You know I feel that the current trends that we see and how we're being set up, we're going to set up for a nice 2024. But again, we can't predict the environment, but the trends that are underway, do play our strengths. Olivier Leonetti : An additional comment on the margin, Nigel. First of all in gross margin we see expansion gross margin, George mentioned it. Services is growing faster than install now. We are using install as a vehicle to drive service. So we should see gross margin expansion and also we're working on further SG&A leverage as we standardize and leverage also functional excellence across the organization. So top line and margin, we believe we are well positioned for \u201824. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's good detail. Thanks guys. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, Nigel. Operator : Next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just walk through a little bit the fourth quarter and this sales deceleration, as well as maybe some color on what you would expect for the margins by segment? The growth seems to be slowing pretty significantly here. Just wanted to see if that's concentrated in any particular business. Maybe just some segment color for the fourth quarter. Olivier Leonetti : So if you look at the top line today, in the Building Solution Business, the top line is very strong. The order moment is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. We have good visibility today based upon where we are today in the quarter.  You have in the top line some inventory adjustments happening in the channel that is impacting our shorter cycle business, resi and Fire & Security. George mentioned that that would be an impact on Global Products, but we see that as being temporary.  If you look at the margin, we believe that the fill business, our business solution, business margin will keep improving. In the Global Product business, we see the margin being slightly flat. What is happening in the global business, you have that in Q3, it's happening in Q4. So it's some absorption as we are ramping applied volumes to drive market share and lead time. We have had some absorption impact and also we are normalizing inventory. Inventory in finished goods went down by about 20 days in about two quarters, that is impacting also absorption. So that's the story in terms of margin, Steve and revenue. Steve Tusa : Yes, I guess for global products, what do you expect for revenue, maybe either organic year-over-year or sequentially, however you think about it, because I think that's kind of where the hole is on revenue here, it seems like. A - Olivier Leonetti : The revenue in global product would be growing low single digits to flat, and the margin would be expanding to flat for global products, because of the two phenomenons I've mentioned Steve. Steve Tusa : Yes, okay. Then sorry, one last quick one. How much price did you get in the field business in the quarter? A - Olivier Leonetti : We don't talk about price anymore for the building solution business, because we sell a solution. It's difficult to differentiate price from volume anymore, and we have discussed about this. But you know overall, pricing and value proposition is resonating with our customers. George Oliver : So Steve\u2026 [Cross Talk] Steve Tusa : So then \u2013 sorry, so I guess how do you calculate \u2013 if you don't calculate price, how do you calculate price cost then in your slides, on slide 12 for the solutions business? A - Olivier Leonetti : It's mainly going to impact our global business and to an extent also the field. George Oliver : And Steve, just a comment on that. As we've discussed, we've been building models, robust models from a COGS to value proposition standpoint, and it's calculated on, based on the inflation that we've built into our long cycle businesses and then how that plays out, to then the value proposition that we bring to our customers with the differentiated install, then ultimately which then leads to our service growth, and that's what's in the overall equation there as far as price. Steve Tusa : Great. Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A - George Oliver : Morning. Olivier Leonetti : Morning Joe. Joe Ritchie : Maybe just going back to the de-stocking comments in global products, I'm sure you guys have had conversations with your channel partners. It might be \u2013 you know there might be a little bit of uncertainty. But you did mention Olivier, I guess that you expect this to be temporary. What kind of sense do you get in terms of the timing of de-stocking and how elevated their inventories are today? I'm just trying to get a sense for how quickly we should get back to normal demand patterns in that business. A - George Oliver : Well, let me take that, Joe. On the resi side, I think in line with what everyone's seeing in the industry, we've seen a significant adjustment and we've taken that in the first half and now through the third quarter, a pretty significant adjustment. We're now \u2013 we believe we're now in line with the industry relative to our volumes and the like.  Now, when you look at, we do believe there's some additional de-stocking in Q4. But I think through that we'll set up here in the first quarter. First, second quarter of next year I think will be pretty normalized. The other, on the Fire and Security, when you look at those businesses, it is mainly a product of when we saw a significant ramp when lead times were extended, we developed significant backlog and we've been working down that backlog.  The good news I see now is on the input side. As we're now moving forward, we're starting to see a pickup now of some of that backlog. And so our ability to be able to then take on the orders, create the backlog and then be positioned from a supply chain to respond, we're in a much better position.  And so we'll see some of that play out here in the fourth quarter as it relates to Fire and Security. But we do believe it's short term and we do believe it's totally aligned with the lead times, the lead time adjustments that have been made, and I would tell you that when we look at some of the core products and new products that we're bringing into that segment, we're seeing some nice pickup on market share with some of the new products. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. That's good to hear, George. I guess maybe my second question, just going back to 2024, and just thinking about the service growth that you've seen over the last three quarters, obviously that is going to be mix accretive to the business. How do you kind of think about the margin impact that's in the backlog right now and that we should see come through in 2024 in the building solutions business. George Oliver : Well, as it relates to the overall growth, I mean I think this is the first that we've seen where now our service growth on a sustained basis is outpacing our install. And so when you go back to the strategy of the company with our building solutions business, was to make sure we use install very strategically and how we build our install base with our assets, with our equipment, and then with the digital assets and enable us to be able to extract, you know over the life cycle the services.  And now with the digital content that we have, we're not only enhancing what historically we've done, but it's now given us the opportunity to add additional services with the customers that we're serving. And so we feel very good about continuing to sustain that growth rate of services. That will be a natural mix, you know with the revenues that turn within our building solutions business globally. And we\u2019re seeing it; the traction is in every one of the regions. I mean, this is not isolated into one vertical or one region; it's pretty much across the board. And so with that, that combines what Olivier said around margins. We continue to drive strong productivity, both in COGS as well as SG&A. So that combined with the mix of services is going to continue to accrete margins within our building solutions business. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thank you. George Oliver : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. You may now go ahead. Noah Kaye : Good morning, thanks to taking the questions. First, it looks like guide is now for higher amortization of intangible, and that's driving about a $0.05 EPS headwind versus the prior guide. Can you (a) can firm that math; and then (b) talk about the timing expectation for accretion on some of the acquisitions you've made. I assume those acquisitions are what's driving the higher amortization for the year. Olivier Leonetti : No, you\u2019re right. I'm confirming the number. What we do probably at some stage, we need to think about how we treat amortization of intangible Noah. Relative to what appears today, we are not guiding EPS in the same way we look at this. And we expect the accretion to start in at the start of next fiscal year. Noah Kaye : All right, that's helpful. And then, you know just to better understand the free cash flow conversion dynamics, it sounds like you do expect some inventory reduction you know here in 4Q. But as we think about what needs to happen for you to kind of get back to close to that 100% free cash flow conversions we set for \u201924, what are you going to be focused on? A - Olivier Leonetti : The inventory Noah, you mentioned it. We had a good progress in inventory reduction in Q3. We have good momentum as I indicated. We have reduced our finish goods, level of entries in days by about 20 days, so that's where the focus is. As lead time is improving, we have seen some inventory adjustments in the channel and that is impacting on the short term, our ability to dispose of the inventory at the speed we had anticipated. But we believe it's a short term phenomenal and we believe that we are absolutely going to return to a 100% free cash flow conversion next fiscal. Noah Kaye : I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Next question, welcome from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. You may now go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just want to come back to service margins and kind of \u2013 George and you addressed this to some degree in a prior question. But certainly the key KPI in my view in this quarter was the significant lift in North America margins in the quarter and you delivered on that. Is service mix playing a really significant role in that performance in the quarter or are we actually just seeing more kind of COGS and SG&A programs and other things you're trying to do on productivity and maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on how you would expect that North American margin to progress into the fourth quarter. A - George Oliver : Yes, let me reflect here Jeff. If you go back to North America and what played out last year, you might recall that a lot of the backlog that was built up during \u201921, prior to the significant ramp up of inflation and the backlog that turned is really what caused the margin pressure last year. And so that and then the work that we've done since then with our cost models and value proposition and pricing as a result on a go forward basis. We've been building very strong margin and backlog across the board, not just North America, but across our Building Solutions business over the last 18 months. And so a significant piece of that is the margin, we've been put in the backlog after that ramp up of pricing and the accumulation of the inflationary costs that we took into consideration into our models. That being said, North America is starting to turn relative to service as a percent of revenue and you're going to start to see that accretion on a go forward basis contributing.  Now you\u2019re also on a margin rate. We have been with the value proposition that we've had with service, we've been able to throughout the inflationary cycle, we've been able to maintain very attractive margins and so it has been through that cycle very strong and now with the mix going forward, it's going to be \u2013 continue to be accelerating the accretion and the benefit that we're going to get in the margin rate on a go forward basis. Olivier Leonetti : I would add Jeff, they go together. We are now driving in-store to drive services. It wasn't the case before. So you will see margin expansion also, because we are very selective on install and to your point on the SG&A, the much more is to come in terms of SG&A leverage as we standardize our operations further and we're in the middle of this and leverage functional excellence.  And we have said that and our level of conviction is actually increasing. We believe we can deliver over the next year and forward, 30% incremental for the company because of those two phenomena, margin and SG&A. Jeff Sprague : Right and sounds like you're noodling on maybe moving to an ex-amortization EPS construct. I wonder if you'd opine a little further on that. And just the amortization that we see, how much of that is directly kind of deal related amortization versus maybe amortization of software or other things that are running through the system? Olivier Leonetti : It's quite exclusively relating to deals, and if you look at our peers today, we are the only one to have not adjusted for deal amortization in our EPS. So we are looking at that as a potential for next year Jeff, but all deal related. And the Tyco-Johnson Controls merger would be the lion's share of this amortization. Jeff Sprague : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may now go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Maybe just wanting to start off with how you're thinking about that sort of slide seven and the profit drivers from price cost and productivity benefits. So you're running very strong on productivity benefits in 2023. Maybe just remind us, what's the incremental saving into 2024 that's left under the cost out program. And then how quickly should we expect that big price cost tailwind to narrow towards parity next year? Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : So on productivity, we are far from being done. Our program that we announced about two years ago is going to end, we're well on track. We'll deliver about $340 million for FY\u201923 through SG&A and COGS, but much more is to come in terms of productivity, both impacting sales and G&A against standardization and driving functional excellence are going to be the drivers for this. Price cost, George mentioned it. We are very bullish about the value proposition of offering, either through solution and including services, but also through the product portfolio where we have a strong in commercial sustainability offering. So all of that should drive a margin expansion through G&A, scaling gross margin and price cost. George Oliver : And Julian, relative to just pure price when we're planning for \u201824, we see continued pricing now certainly at a reduced level. But given the continued inflation and how we're booking that inflation into our backlog, we still see pricing playing out as we plan for \u201824. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess my second question on the top line. So looking at slide 12, you have the 4% install orders growth in North America and EMEA/LA in the third quarter. Just wondered, given the sort of the macro data out there, dodge [ph] start square footage and so on, and interest rates, you think those install order numbers decelerate from that 4% in the two regions or they can sort of hold the line when you look out? George Oliver : So, when you look at our go to market, and we look at this very closely on a weekly, monthly basis. When you look at our pipeline, our pipeline is continuing to grow. And so as we look at whether it be domain-by-domain, or as we look at our Building Solutions now addressing these secular trends, we're building a very strong pipeline. And on a run rate basis, as we project Q4, we still see very strong order growth in Q4.  And so it is hard to dissect exactly from a vertical standpoint, because we see pretty broad strength across whether it be industrial, data centers, we talk about government, there's a lot of strength that we see here. And we're making sure that from a go-to-market standpoint, we're going to be positioned to be able to capitalize on where the growth will occur. And then the value propositions that we have as it relates to these secular trends, it really does tie to be able to create the most amount of value. And then our solutions business really builds an attractive service business from that.  And so as I set up for \u201824, it's going to be critical here as we pace through the fourth quarter with the order rates to really set up a backlog, because our Building Solutions business, at least from an install standpoint is pretty predictable over the next 12 months. And that backlog continues to build, and our pipeline and conversion right now in Q4 suggests that that's going to continue at a very strong rate. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Thanks very much. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, Julian. Operator : Next question will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. You may now go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning, Nicole. George Oliver : Hey Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : Maybe just starting with the price cost dynamics in EMEA/LA specifically. So I know that segment is kind of lagging a bit with respect to execution of higher price backlog. Is the expectation that price cost turns positive? You know, could that happen in the fourth quarter? Is that more of like a 2024 event? Olivier Leonetti : So Nicole, if you look at EMEA/LA, there was nothing fundamentally different with this business, which would prevent us to reach a strong level of segment every day margin. What you have happening in EMEA/LA this quarter, and that's about 150 basis points of headwind in margin, its two things : One, pension costs, and also FX in our business in Argentina. We have a strong business in Argentina in our subscriber business.  So if you were to remove those, the margin in EMEA/LA would have increased by about 140 basis points in the quarter. You will have some of those impacts again in Q4 impacting EMEA/LA. But again, nothing structural in EMEA/LA. George Oliver : Nicole, when we look at all the work we've done on the price cost over the last couple of years, especially in this inflationary environment, when you look at the margins and backlog in our EMEA/LA business are very strong going forward, and so it's a matter of just the timing of the conversion. Nicole DeBlase : Got it, that's clear. Thanks, guys. And then just thinking about the overhang that you're seeing with gross products margin \u2013 oh sorry, Global Products margins and very tough prior year comps, I guess how do you think about fiscal \u201824 from that perspective? Like, do you see the potential to start expanding margins in this business again? Olivier Leonetti : The answer is absolutely yes. If you go back to the quarter, we had because \u2013 we are ramping the manufacturing of applied, we want that to be very competitive in lead time. We have a very competitive set of products. So as we are ramping manufacturing of lead time, we had an impact in conversion costs. Again, as we have normalized for inventory, we have produced less that is impacting conversion cost as well. The combined impact of those two elements is a bit more than a point in the quarter, Nicole. And we believe that we will have some of that happening in Q4, but we see absolutely margin expansion happening in our global products business. Nicole DeBlase : Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Olivier Leonetti : Thank you, Nicole. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may now go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the destock headwinds on the indirect side for resi, Fire & Safety. Can you just maybe quantify what that headwind means for fiscal Q4 organic growth in the guided? Like where would that 4% be if it wasn't for these headwinds? Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : I would say that on the year, this impact is about 1 to 1.5 and then you could do the math for also Q4. It's in the ballpark of 1 to 1.5 of full impact on the year. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I appreciate that and it sounds like from some of the prior commentary that you guys would expect this headwind to alleviate in the early part of fiscal \u201824. So obviously that's a tailwind to the 4% organic guide for the fiscal fourth quarter. Are there any sort of negative offsets there? Is there anything kind of getting worse from here as we try to build the organic bridge into next year? Thank you. George Oliver : So when you look at those businesses and the applied Fire & Security products we put through our Building Solutions business and we're starting to see that that's very strong and picking up and it's critical to our Building Solutions business as far as how we create value and ultimately create service, so that is coming back nicely.  And then on the indirect channel where we see the pressure, the same has happened there relative to the timing of orders based on the reduced lead times. And so our assessment based on \u2013 with the understanding that we have with our distributors and the pulse that we have across the globe that that's going to come back. That we're starting to see sequential improvement and then getting baseline here that for \u201924, you know assuming the economic conditions are somewhat stable. We have been outperforming with our products and our new product launches and the like. So we are confident that we're going to \u2013 that's going to come back and we're going to be positioned to be able to pick that growth up as it adjust. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. You may now go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Thanks. Good morning guys. Olivier Leonetti : Morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : I'm wondering if you could comment on supply chain and your own lead times, manufacturing lead times and whether you anticipate that will have any impact on orders, just as lead times shrink. Is there a risk of kind of an order \u2013 less urgency to place orders that could show up in any given quarter and if so, when would you expect that to be a potential factor if at all? George Oliver : Well Gautam, we've seen that, it's already been playing out here over the last, really the last couple of quarters as it relates to our global products business. Because everyone, as supply chain began to improve and lead times reduced, it allows our customers to be able to back off what they have to carry and still be able to deliver on their commitments. So that has been playing out.  We think that there's still a little bit left here with resi going forward. So a little bit more in the indirect Fire & Security, but we've already seen a lot of that impact on our book-to-bill business in over the last couple of quarters. So we're positioned here to get through that over the next quarter or two and that'll be positioned to be able to build backlog and have conversion, strong growth in \u201824. Gautam Khanna : Has there been any spillover effect of the direct channel, that lead times have come in? George Oliver : No, on the direct channel actually because we ultimately \u2013 you know from end-to-end we are responsible for delivering to the customer. So whether it be even in our Resi direct stores, we saw a nice growth in our resi direct stores because we ultimately own the channel and we saw a nice pickup there.  On our Building Solutions business, you know as far as the predictability of our projects and how we're converting, we're very tight relative to what is going to be consumed and how we're going to deploy it to the field. Olivier Leonetti : And George said that earlier, Gautam, the order rate for the Building Solution business is very strong in Q4. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thank you very much guys. George Oliver : Thank you. Operator : The last question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. You may now go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Can you guys hear me? George Oliver : Yes, we can Andrew. Andrew Obin : Yes, so as we think about these, semi-fabs and EV plans, I think Ethan was kind enough to give us sort of range for average content per plant. Could you guys just sort of do something similar? You know, how big a unit goes on average into one of these, so we can just sort of size the opportunity.  And then the part two, when do you guys actually book these projects in your backlog formally? Right, at what stage. Is it a year into construction, just trying to sort of follow up on your commentary. How you should start booking more equipment eventually, but just trying to size the timing and scope of this into \u201824. Thank you. George Oliver : Let me talk about the, on the front end of demand. And so what you've seen over the last couple of years, we have been very aggressive not only with the development of our product portfolio, but also our capacity to be able to serve the market. And if you look at our orders in applied, we have been getting more than our fair share. We believe that market share-wise we are up a number of points here on a year-on-year basis. We've been building backlog in our applied equipment, and we can follow up and get you an average size.  But right now, because of the expansion, we've more than doubled our capacity. And so, and we're pacing with full utilization of that capacity. So we're ultimately making sure that we're going to be positioned with the demand. And that from a lead time, seeing a point that's been very important to be able to then be able to respond and be able to create the value with our offering and then be able to then convert on time, to be able to capitalize on the demand. Some of these projects are \u2013 they are \u2013 it can be over a year. But a lot of the \u2013 there are now a lot of projects coming into the market that cycle time matters, and you can create a lot of value because you have a short of lead time, where we have orders that we're taking on now that we're going to deliver next year in \u201824. And so from a positioning in the market, we have positioned ourselves to get a very strong order book in our applied business. And that is a core strength of ours across the globe. And it relates to what you said, EV plants, data centers, the chip manufacturing plants and the like. And so on the average size that you can imagine, when you get these large data center customers, they have very large installations, and have multiple pieces of equipment that are deployed to be able to support the capacity that they are building. Olivier Leonetti : And additional color Andrew, we mentioned that earlier, the stimulus we have had in the U.S., or in Europe, so the IRA or the equivalent stimulus in Europe, have not impacted the demand so far. So we believe that those trends we are starting to see are going to be maintained. And last one, we book an order when we received a signed firm contract Andrew. Andrew Obin : Got you, okay. And just a follow-up question on supply chain, are you seeing any ability as some companies are talking about disinflation or even deflation? Are you finally getting back ability to extract pricing concessions from your supply chain into \u201824? George Oliver : Yes, we've always said, when you look at our procurement organization and the work that they do, even through this period of time, we've been strategically sourcing and making sure we're leveraging our scale and demand to drive productivity, drive savings, to try to offset some of the inflationary pressures on the commodities and the like.  So our team has done a really nice job through the cycle to do that, and the answer is of course, yes. I mean, we're now planning for continued strong productivity with our scale, with our buy, making sure that we're positioned at the lowest cost, with the leverage of our overall volumes that gives us a competitive advantage, when you look at our product cost or all of our costs within our cost of goods. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. George Oliver : So on that, I want to close the call. I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning and certainly your continued interest in Johnson Controls. I do believe we're at the beginning of an era that will be defined by deep decarbonization and sustainability. And we are, as Johnson Control is well positioned to be an important contributor to empowering our customers in every industry to create healthy, safe spaces for people on the planet.  And I think our strategy is clear. It's playing out. We have a strong portfolio and now it's just about continued execution. So with that operator, that concludes our call today.

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Lucas : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' fourth quarter fiscal 2023 results. The press release and all related tables that were issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Johnson Controls. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors and cautionary statements in our most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's release. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls' website. I will now turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before discussing our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results, I wanted to take a moment to thank all of our employees for their quick agile response to the cyber incident beginning in the last week of September. Our teams responded quickly and worked diligently to minimize the impact from the incident. We greatly appreciate everyone's patience from customers to suppliers, to shareholders as we work through our remediation efforts. We now have the incident behind us and our operations are back to normal. Now let's begin with Slide 3. We feel it is important to not lose sight of the strong year we had in fiscal 2023, regardless of the impact on our fourth quarter results from the cyber incident. For the full year, we grew sales organically 8%, expanded segment margins 80 basis points to 15% and delivered adjusted EPS growth of 17%. We saw continued strength in our Service business as our efforts in maximizing our large installed base are coming to fruition. In fact, we grew service 10% for the year with solid order momentum ending the fiscal year. Our total backlog grew 9% to $12.1 billion as demand remains strong across our Commercial Building Solutions offerings. In fiscal 2023, we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow, which represented 76% conversion. During the year, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged, targeting to return 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have the highest conviction ever in our strategy to lead in Building Solutions, and we'll continue to prioritize allocating capital accordingly toward that objective. Overall, we are pleased with our continued execution despite macro-driven headwinds over the fiscal year and believe that we are well positioned heading into fiscal 2024 with our strong backlog and resilient service business. We're initiating guidance for fiscal 2024 for approximately mid-single-digit sales and adjusted EPS growth, respectively, and for free cash flow conversion of approximately 85%. Olivier will provide additional color on the guidance later in the call, but fiscal 2024 will show improvement following a seasonally slower first quarter. Now turning to Slide 4. Demand for our Building Solutions is accelerating with our customers around the globe, as we are developing Applied Solutions to deliver outcomes that save energy and reduce emissions, while improving the overall occupant experience. We are able to achieve these outcomes not only through our leading domain expertise and applied HVAC & Controls solutions, but also through world-class fire detection and protection and smart security solutions enabled by an industry-leading digital platform, OpenBlue. All of our systems build on each other in are complementary components of our total solutions offering. The journey starts with our customer as we design, digitize and deploy solutions that achieve efficiency, sustainability and decarbonization. This turnkey offering drives operations, service and maintenance, which underpin our as-a-service offerings that make buildings smarter through our digital solutions. This helps our customers enable peak operating conditions, protect investments and achieve the lowest life cycle cost. Johnson Controls is unique with our value proposition to make buildings smarter through OpenBlue. Our comprehensive ecosystem of connected digital solutions for buildings can break down silos and connect building systems regardless of equipment OEM and make them interoperable to build resiliency and efficiency. We were honored recently to be ranked number two on the Guidehouse Insights leaderboard in an assessment of leading energy service companies. The recognition underscores our commitment to excellence and sustainability on a global scale. It is a testament to our hard work and continued commitment to helping clients meet their sustainability goals. Moving on to Slide 5. Fiscal 2023 saw continued strength in install orders, which creates a strong service opportunity over the life of the equipment. As we advance our digital strategy, including more than doubling our connected assets during the fiscal year, we are gathering more intelligence through data. This data allows us to better segment customer needs and create more proactive offerings across all of our domains, effectively utilizing our industry-leading service organization of over 20,000 professionals that make over 5.5 million visits annually. With our large installed base, improved operations and strong pipeline, we see a long runway of continued growth for our service business. Turning to Slide 6. Our value creation framework remains unchanged. We truly believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth, delivering solutions across sustainable and healthy buildings, while leveraging the increased adoption of OpenBlue to drive margin expansion. Our pipeline remains strong in our longer-cycle Building Solutions business, as we continue to realize top line growth. Our shorter-cycle businesses in Global Products, primarily global residential HVAC and parts of Fire & Security are stabilizing as the new fiscal year progresses. Converting our strong top line growth into improved margins and cash flow is our top priority. We are beginning to see our gross margins improve as supply chain disruptions continue to lessen. Within Building Solutions, we are also seeing stronger margins in our record backlog and as service continues to accelerate, we should see favorable mix as well. Cash flow is a key area of focus for us. On the receivables front, we are making progress in improving the longer collection cycle historically associated with our installed business. Inventories in our short-cycle businesses continue to reduce as lead times normalize, and we are adding capacity to meet the strong demand in our applied HVAC business. As you can see, we are very excited about the opportunity ahead. I will now turn the call over to Olivier to go through the financial details of the quarter. Olivier? Olivier Leonetti : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the summary on Slide 7. Total sales grew 3% to $6.9 billion, while organic sales increased 2% with another strong quarter from our service business, which grew 9% organically. The cyber incident was a 1% headwind in the quarter. Adjusted segment EBITA was flat year-over-year with margins declining 50 basis points to 16%. Price/cost was positive, and we delivered strong productivity savings achieving our $340 million target for the year. Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 8. Adjusted EPS of $1.05 increased 6% year-over-year and include a $0.04 headwind from the cyber incident. Operations contributed $0.03 of the growth in the quarter, benefiting from positive price/cost and our ongoing SG&A and COGS actions. Below the line, we saw favorability from non-controlling interest and a lower share count. Let's now discuss our segment results in more detail on Slides 9 through 12. Beginning on Slide 9. Organic sales in our shorter-cycle Global Products business, excluding the 2% headwind from the cyber incident were flat year-over-year with price upsetting a decline in volume. Global Products saw continued strength in Commercial HVAC, which grew high single-digits after growing mid-teens in the comparable period one year ago. Demand remained strong and our leading position in Commercial HVAC was further extended in fiscal 2023. Fire & Security declined low single-digits as inventory further rebalanced as lead times improved materially year-over-year. Industrial Refrigeration had another strong quarter, growing over 45% driven by EMEALA. Global residential decline high-teens, driven by a greater than 30% decline in North America and a high single-digit decline in Rest of World. North America faced challenging year-over-year comparisons as we were still working out of a backlog from last fiscal year. In Europe, the heat pump market overall experienced lower growth than anticipated. As our book-to-bill business begins to normalize with improved lead times, our global products, third-party backlog decreased 4% from the prior year to $2.5 billion and remained flat sequentially. Adjusted segment EBITA margins declined 85 basis points against a tough comparison to 21% as continued weakness in global residential offset positive price cost and productivity savings. One of the biggest factor impacting our Global Products margin performance is due to lower absorption costs in Global Residential business. Moving to Slide 11 to discuss our Building Solutions performance. Order momentum remained strong with 9% growth. Service orders grew 7% in the quarter and 11% for the full year as our transformation into a service-led organization gains momentum. Install orders increased 10%, led by double-digit orders in North America and EMEALA. Organic sales grew 5%, driven by strong growth in service of 9%. And in-store grew 2% organically against a tough comparison. The cyber incident was a 1% headwind in the quarter.  Adjusted segment EBITA increased 5%, while margins declined 10 basis points as a higher mix of equipment installations and weakness in China offset positive price/cost and savings from productivity initiatives. Strong equipment sales are an important contributor to future higher-margin recurring service revenue. Building Solutions backlog remains at record levels, growing 9% to $12.1 billion. Service backlog increased 12% and installed backlog grew 8% year-over-year. Let's discuss the Building Solutions performance by region on Slide 12. Orders in North America increased 8% with continued strength across our HVAC & Controls platform, up over 20% year-over-year. Overall, there was robust demand in our office, data center, health care, government and manufacturing sectors. Install orders increased 11% year-over-year with solid growth in new construction. Sales in North America were up 8% organically with broad-based growth across the portfolio. Our installed business grew 9% with continued momentum in new construction, up 25% year-over-year. Organic sales in service grew 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year, driven by a strong performance across our shorter-term transactional business which is the direct result of having a large customer base. Sales across our HVAC & Controls platform grew high teens year-over-year, while Fire & Security was flat. Segment margins expanded 70 basis points year-over-year to 15.4%, driven by ongoing productivity benefits, the continued execution of higher-margin backlog and strength in our higher-margin service business. Total backlog ended the quarter at $8.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. In EMEA/LA, orders were up 6% with solid contributions of 16% growth from both served and in store. Demand in commercial remained strong, growing 50% year-over-year driven by HVAC and security as the decarbonization efforts in Europe continue to gain momentum, our offerings in Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC & Controls increased orders by over 20% across the industrial sector. By region, other growth was broad-based. Sales in EMEA/LA grew 3% organically, led by mid-teen growth in service with double-digit growth from both our recurring contracts and our shorter cycle transactional business. Applied Commercial HVAC and Fire & Security grew low single-digits within the quarter. Segment EBITA margins declined 160 basis points to 7.8%, driven primarily by execution of lower margin jobs within the backlog. Backlog was up 10% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. In Asia Pacific, orders grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in service with healthy growth across our HVAC & Controls platform. Overall, we saw strong demand in the institutional sector growing over 30%. Sales in Asia Pacific declined 6%, as the installation business was impacted primarily by weakness in China. Our service business continued the momentum of double-digit growth, increasing 11% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Overall, Fire & Security grew mid-single digits, while HVAC & Controls declined high single-digits. Segment EBITA margins declined 50 basis points to 13.5%, as weakness in China offset ongoing productivity savings and positive price/cost. Backlog of $1.5 billion is flat year-over-year. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 13. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $800 million in available cash and net debt declined to 1.9 times, which is lower than our long-term target range of 2 to 2.5 times. As George mentioned, during 2023, we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Our free cash flow conversion of 76% was better than our updated guidance. On the working capital front, our receivable collection has extended as our installation business critical to generate our service business has grown. We are making structural changes, such as more upfront payments to improve our cash collection cycle in the installation business. While inventories remain elevated versus historical levels, primarily due to the challenges in our global residential businesses, we saw overall inventories improved five days sequentially in the fourth quarter. We anticipate further improvement entering fiscal 2024. We have the fundamentals in place to be a 100% cash conversion company over time. However, continued growth investments and some further restructuring in fiscal 2024 will be headwinds in the fiscal year. Now let's discuss our first quarter and fiscal 2024 guidance on Slide 14. We are entering fiscal year 2024 with a backlog at historical levels, strong momentum in our industry-leading service business and broad-based demand across end markets. When producing first quarter sales guidance of approximately flat year-over-year as we return to normalized seasonality. Our forecast includes a roughly 1% headwind from the cyber incident, as well as continued weakness anticipated in China. We expect Building Solutions momentum to continue, led by our resilient service business. Global Products faces a tough year-over-year comparison as we were working through elevated backlogs in the comparable quarter last year, especially in Residential HVAC and certain Fire & Security indirect channels. For the first quarter, we expect segment EBITA margin to be approximately 13% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.50. We're expecting a slower start of the year as we return to more normalized seasonality, incurred a negative impact from the cyber incident and anticipate continued weakness in China. For the full year, we anticipate Global Products to stabilize in the second half of 2024, as backlog continues to normalize and Building Solutions converts its higher-margin backlog. We expect organic sales to grow approximately mid-single digits with Building Solutions leading the growth, particularly in service. Segment EBITA margins, I expect that to expand approximately 25 basis points or greater as price/cost remains positive and mix improved throughout the year. Adjusted EPS should be in the range of approximately $3.65 to $3.80, representing growth of 4% to 9% year-over-year. For the first quarter, we anticipate our normal seasonal cash usage with incremental impact from the cyber incident. We expect free cash flow conversion to be 85% for the full year. Our results and guidance reflect great progress advancing our service strategy enabled by digital, momentum in our commercial products offering and we enter fiscal 2024 with strong order momentum and record backlog in our longer-cycle Building Solutions business. With that, Operator, open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe we could just touch on cash flow a bit more. A, how much kind of recovery from the cyber incident do you kind of expect embedded in this 85% in 2024? And then also just -- it seems peculiar, Olivier, your net financial charges are going up to $420 million per your guide versus $280 million last year. Is there something going on in the factoring or something else in kind of the capital structure that would explain that sort of delta year-over-year? Olivier Leonetti : Thank you for your question, Jeff. Regarding the free cash flow, we had an impact in the first quarter, which we believe will be about $200 million. If you look at the guide for 2024 at 85%, that includes two elements; one, some restructuring and also some investments in CapEx to support the strong demand in our applied business, George mentioned that in his opening remarks. If you look at the levers of improvement for free cash flow, we see, one, inventory reducing as we reduce our inventory in resi. Two, in receivables, we believe we're going to be able to demand more upfront payments as our lead times have improved, and also we have implemented our supplier financing program across the network, and that will help further improve GPO. To go back to your net financing charge is the byproduct of higher interest rate. We are going to refinance some debt. We have some commercial papers as well, which are going to be priced at the current higher interest rate. Factoring is a small proportion of the cost. Jeff Sprague : And then separately, could you just address -- I mean, orders obviously looked pretty solid in the quarter. Was there any impact from the cyber and the ability to kind of book orders, either as you ended the September quarter or as you've entered this particular quarter? Maybe just give us a little bit more color on what the challenges were in the business as you work your way through this? George Oliver : Yes. So when we look at our orders, Jeff, obviously, they continue very strong. And I think we're seeing strong growth in office data centers, health care, state and local government, education. We do see manufacturing, industrial bookings continue at an elevated level after a strong growth in construction starts. It is focused on the EV and semiconductor manufacturing. And then when we look at our pipeline, it's very strong. And a lot of that pipeline is focused on these key verticals. I would say from a booking standpoint, we were tracking prior to the cyber incident, a little bit better. And then with the outage, I think we're somewhat slowed a bit in that last week. But I think as we look at first quarter and for the year with the pipeline that we have, we're going to see continued strong order growth. And I think when you look at our \u2013 mainly around Commercial HVAC trends, it's clear that we're gaining share pretty much across all of the industries. That's creating significant equipment sales into our Building Solutions business, which is creating a really nice installed base that we're now capitalizing on the service opportunity. In Building Solutions, our applied orders were up about 20%. And then in the ducting space, when you take out resi, our commercial ducting was up over 50%. So our portfolio of Commercial HVAC is playing out strong. And that ultimately is what's driving the installed base within our commercial -- within the Commercial Building Solutions business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everyone. George Oliver : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Hey guys, can we start on just the mix impact this quarter. I was a little surprised to see the Business Solutions business see $100 million impact from mix. And also because it seems like your service business has farly exceeded growth versus install this quarter. So what exactly is going on within Business Solutions that's driving negative mix and is that expected to reverse in 2024? Olivier Leonetti : So if you look at the equipment sales today, particularly in the high end of our market, we are gaining share. This is a strong part of the market. This business is very attractive for us because for $1 of hardware, we typically generate over the life cycle of the equipment another $9 of solutions, including $4 of services. And you saw also Joe in services today we clearly have momentum. Services is growing fast, enabled by digital. And as a reminder, services is twice the profit of the average of the company. So this mix is based upon equipment sales, which would generate attractive profit with the service and UTM solution annuity. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Got it. Understood. And I guess maybe my one follow-on question then would be on 1Q. And so to look, it's December 12, we're clearly well into the quarter. You've given a fairly narrow range for the first quarter. I guess, I'm just trying to understand two things. Number one, confidence that, that will be the range when you report results? And then secondly, just any help that you can give on the bridge? Because even if you adjust for the insurance settlement from last year, it seems like a relatively large decline in the first quarter despite flat organic sales expected this year. Olivier Leonetti : So if you look at Q1, we see a strong order momentum continuing. If you look at, of course, the confidence, we have now a few days to go before the end of the quarter. So that by itself answer to the question. If you look at what is happening in Q1, we have strong momentum in our Building Solutions business, service, solution powered by digital is growing fast. We see weaknesses in our Global Products division, particularly as it comes from resi. We have some impact also in China. Also, we have the impact of cyber, which is about 1% of the top line, and it's difficult to dimensionalize exactly about $0.02 of EPS. And last but not least, GP now is going through a more normalized seasonality after a few years of supply chain impact. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. George Oliver : Good morning. Scott Davis : Can you guy's give us kind of help us understand the materiality of data centers. It seems obviously really bullish commentary we've heard from many folks, and don't always think about JCI in the data center business, but certainly, you guys have a meaningful presence. So can you help size that for us? George Oliver : Yes, Scott, let me take that one. When you look at -- as we look at data centers, we've been obviously, reinvesting in all of our applied product to have the full portfolio to be able to capitalize on what we see to be incredible growth here over the decade. And so when you look at a typical data centers, let's take a 100-megawatt data center that requires roughly about 30,000 tons of cooling. That can be served. Right now, the big trend is air-cooled chillers. We're the leader in the space with the investments that we've made and being able to deliver on those capabilities and that's where we're seeing significant growth in serving that set of customers. And so it can either be air cooled or water cooled. Of course, water cooled we're in a strong position. So roughly about 30,000 tons of cooling. So when you look at the market at 2024, we're projecting somewhere at 15 gigawatts to 20 gigawatts, which will amount to about five tons of cooling needs. Now because of our position with our strong portfolio of the full technology to serve these, we believe we're positioned to get, let's say, half of that volume going forward, which -- the overall volume would be greater than $2 billion. And so for us, this has been a position of incredible strength. A lot of that is because of our multigenerational developments we've made at our engineering center. Just a comment on that, we've -- just in the last 90 days, we've had customers representing over 20% of the US GDP at our technology center because as we're laying out long-term plans with our customers, we're making sure we're positioned with the applications that ultimately achieve their needs. And so it is a very attractive space for us, Scott. And then from a service standpoint, once we get that unit installed, we're getting very strong service growth on top of that, which will then be over the lifecycle of that installation. Scott Davis : That's helpful, George. And when you think about putting servicing and AI kind of heat-intensive data center, is that higher margin -- A, is a higher margin? But B, is a higher margin, if it is, is it higher margin because of the complexity or because of just the scale that you're just getting so much more content into that facility? George Oliver : Yes, I think it's both. I mean the criticality of the applications that we provide and then the ability to be able to operate within those conditions. And then from a data standpoint, making sure that we're secure relative to what we do and how we manage the data that ultimately delivers the outcomes that we can deliver. Certainly, the work that we've done around OpenBlue and the cloud-based technology there, none of that was absolutely -- was not interrupted at all with our cyber incident. So a lot of that is, we believe it's high-margin service opportunity not only at the equipment level, but then with the use of all of the data to enhance how that equipment is actually operated in their environment. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just provide a little bit more detail around the impact from the cyber-attack? I mean, I think you said $0.04 in the fourth quarter, but it was kind of late in the fourth quarter. And then in particular, which businesses it impacted just kind of the mechanics of the thing? And then just clarify what you're saying in the first quarter, I think you said $200 million in cash, but then $0.02 of earnings, I might have missed. I'm not sure I can reconcile like all those numbers. So maybe just a little more mechanical detail on the impact of the cyber-attack? George Oliver : Yes. Let me give you some of the numbers. In Q4, we believe that the impact on the top-line was about 1%. It will be the same in Q1. What you have going on, Steve, I would go to the EPS impact in a second is what you lose in Q4, you recover some of it in Q1, right? That's why you have those numbers going on. So 1% in revenue in Q4 and in Q1. The EPS impact in Q4 is about $0.04 and the impact in Q1 about $0.02. What is mainly impacted is everything which is short cycle, if you need to satisfy demand for something that you need to have in inventory, if you don't have it, you lose it, that's where the impact will be. My $200 million impact in cash is lower collection in the first quarter because we're not able to build immediately as we could not be immediately then that has delayed collection. That's the $200 million, Steve. George Oliver : Steve, just when you look at the overall event, it did create significant distraction internally. We -- it wasn't one or two days. It actually was about three weeks, which was the better part of October. So, while we're able to quantify some of the impact, I think it's harder to put a number to the overall impact in October. As you -- as we -- although we maintained operations, we weren't necessarily operating at full efficiency. But I would tell you the way that our teams have responded and actually got back to operations has been remarkable. And so I do believe, just from an overall momentum standpoint, we lost a little bit of momentum in October. But I can tell you, in November and December, we gained that back. Olivier Leonetti : Steve, a final sort of detail. We have a substantial insurance coverage and the large proportion of our cost, including business disruption will be covered by insurance. Steve Tusa : Okay. And so I guess I'm just struggling to see how you get from like $0.50 in the first quarter, which seems like an operating base to I don't know, $3.75 for the year. That just seems like a pretty steep hill. And I mean, are you -- I know you're probably assuming that the comps maybe get a little bit easier in some of the products businesses. But I mean, are you assuming like recovery, true kind of economic underlying recovery in some of those short-cycle businesses for the back half of the year? Olivier Leonetti : So, what we see happening is earning growth to return during Q2. What we see today is momentum in our Building Solutions business. We talked about that at length, equipment, services, enabled by digital are resonating with our customers. We see GP stabilizing in Q2 and more normalized growth in the second half for our Global Product division. If you look at the theme for the year, commercial strength, service strength with service expected to grow high single digits plus in the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to understand some of the free cash flow moving parts again, maybe as we talk, just dollars year-on-year is the easiest thing for 2024. So, I think you're guiding about $100 million of net income growth, about $300 million of free cash flow growth in 2024. So, just trying to understand that extra kind of $200 million in the free cash, how much of that is sort of CapEx may be coming down or working capital coming down substantially? I'm just trying to understand as well what's the full year impact of cyber in the free cash year-on-year? And if there's anything to be aware of on factoring, I know you mentioned supply chain finance? Thank you. Olivier Leonetti : So, if you look at the key driver of free cash flow, they are going to be around working capital, mainly in inventory. If you look at our level of inventory, we are at about -- we are going to close the year at about 54 days of inventory. We used to be before those supply chain events at about 45. A day of inventory is worth about quite a lot in terms of free cash flow. So inventory is going to be a key variable. Receivables also would be unchecked to declining as we are improving the way we manage that particular balance sheet line. Some of that will include upfront payments as our cycle has been improving to satisfy demand. We're able to demand for acceleration of products. We're able to demand more upfront payment and the final one would be supply chain financing, which we are now deploying across the world. Factoring will be flat year-on-year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks Olivier. And the cyber of $200 million free cash headwind in Q1. Is that like a headwind of $200 million for the year as a whole or are you assuming you recapture most of that in cash flow in the balance of the year? Olivier Leonetti : It would be timing related. We'll catch that up in the second quarter. Julian Mitchell : Okay. And then my follow-up question would just be on the pace of the EPS recovery through the year. Historically, I think Q2 is about 19% or so of full year earnings. Is that roughly what we should expect for 2024 in terms of the seasonality? Olivier Leonetti : We are going to go through a more normalized seasonality in terms of EPS performance as now the supply chain is going back to what we had pre-COVID. If you look at the themes for EPS earnings growth expected in Q2, momentum in Building Solutions have indicated, GP stabilizing in Q2 and then going to an increase in profit contribution in the second half. Those would be the theme for the flow of EPS across the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Good morning. I know we've gone around this a fair amount here. But on the 1Q guide, Olivier, I really struggle to get down to that range down in flat sales and the 13% segment EBITA margin. So is there anything below the line from corporate timing, the interest or anything below the line you think about there? Just any help there would be helpful. And then on the free cash flow, the restructuring, I'm not sure if you did quantify that to Julian's question, but what sort of payback are we seeing on this restructuring action? Where should we dial in for social cost savings for 2024? Olivier Leonetti : So if you look, let me start with the end. On free cash flow, we are going to have an impact of about 10 points of conversion to two elements. One is higher CapEx actually due to the demand we have, mainly in the data center. That's about 3-points of conversion and restructuring, we expect to have 7-points of conversion due to restructuring, the impact, the payback of those restructuring actions is about the year or below that. And we have actually quite a few projects to improve the profitability of our enterprise. On Q1, I go back to what I indicated earlier in the Q&A session of momentum in Building Solutions, that's what we see in Q1. Weakness in global product due to the resi demand, some more normalized comp as the supply chain is normalizing for our global product division and then of course, the impact of cyber. Nigel Coe : Okay. And just on the CapEx. It just seems like it's a $60 million increase. Just wanted to -- I just verify that. But maybe you can talk -- can we just dig into the EMEA/LA segment. The margins have been struggling for so long now. And we've got installation growth in orders and backlog, but inflation is down 5% this quarter. So, I'm just wondering, if you could just maybe just talk about what the problems are in that region and what some of the fixes are? Olivier Leonetti : So we see no structural reasons for the EMEA/LA margin to be double digits. And we expect margin to turn positive in Q2. Clearly, we have work to do in the region. The margin profile of the region is mainly due to the realization of lower margin orders into the revenue. We see that turning the other way, so turning positive in Q2, Nigel. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Olivier Leonetti : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : So your orders accelerated slightly actually in Q4, up 9%, I think, for Building Solutions led by North America. And I know you talked about the strength already and Applied and in markets such as data centers. But as you know, some leading indicators of non-res have been a little weaker. So do you see order growth holding up here across your businesses throughout FY '24? And do you see your backlog staying around that $12.1 billion number for your long-cycle businesses in '24? I think any incremental color would be helpful. George Oliver : Yes, I do, Andy, when we look at -- we've got a pretty robust tracking across all of the critical markets across the regions, and we're tracking not only lead generation to conversion to where we're positioning to deploy our resources and differentiate and ultimately win. So the pipeline generation has continued to be very strong, and it's in line with what I previously discussed as far as the segments that are driving that. And I think as we look at our service business, that's on the -- when you think about new projects and new opportunities to build install. So that has been very strong. And what we're also seeing is that on the service side, with the work that we've been doing with not only going back into the installed base, getting connectivity, getting use of the data and then bringing forward new value propositions. We're seeing significant pickup in our PSAs and being able to get longer-term contracts and build the base there. So, in spite of -- when you look -- when you segment our Building Solutions, whether it be installed, still strong, and then our ability to be able to, even in an economic decline, we should -- with the value proposition that we're bringing to our customers within service, I believe that that's going to continue to hold up. And so right now, there's no even though we look at the same metrics you look at, dodge starts and ABI and all of the key metrics being a little bit weaker, at the end of the day, with the with the way that we prioritized our growth and how we're deploying our resources, we're positioned to capitalize on where the growth will occur. Andy Kaplowitz : That's very helpful. And then maybe you could give us just a little more color on your expectations for Global Products. Do you see global residential markets, for instance, turning positive in the second half? And as the greater segment turns, how are you thinking about the European heat pump market? I think you mentioned GP stabilizing overall in the second half, but maybe you can talk about your confidence level that destocking ends in the second quarter, as you guys mentioned? George Oliver : Let's start with resi. As we look at the US resi market, obviously, there was challenges that set up for resi in 2023, both in units as well as overall sales with the recession. I think when we look at the reason for that, it's higher cost equipment, it's weaker consumer spending. It's now people going back to work and reducing their home improvement spending. So a lot of contributors to that. I do believe that as we look at the transition here with the refrigerant changes, we get into more stabilization, where although there will be less units, certainly with the new refrigerant launches, that's going to demand more price because of the refrigerant. And so on a sales basis, I think we're extremely well positioned now to be able to deliver our portfolio of refrigerant changes in time for the implementation on January 1. We have pulled ahead our new product interactions by as much as two or three months to ensure that we're giving our distributors enough time to rebalance their inventory and ultimately restock with the new 454B refrigerant products. And again, we're working with all of our constituents right from the suppliers to our distributors to partners to make sure we have a smooth transition. So we do believe it normalizes and somewhat stabilizes going forward. And that's on the resi in North America. When you -- your question around heat pumps, I think we believe across our portfolio, that creates an incredible opportunity for us. We believe it's about a $100 billion market. that's grown mid-single-digits. And today, we assess our portfolio, it's about one-third of our sales within HVAC, are heat pumps. And I do believe, although we've seen a pullback in Europe, and it's mainly around our JCH product that we were planning for a pretty significant pick up here, 2023, which ultimately didn't materialize that maybe that's just kind of pushed to the right a bit as some of the countries in Europe have pushed forward the implementation date and the like. And then as a result, I think consumers have pulled back and not ultimately capitalizing on the efficiency that the heat pumps represent to them. And so we're watching that closely. But I do believe that over the next -- maybe it's 18, 24 months, that will come back and come back pretty strong. And then on the commercial side, pretty much globally. We do have a leading portfolio. We're understanding now with the focus on decarbonization and sustainability that we are uniquely positioned with low GWP refrigerants across our portfolio. And we're positioned to now capitalize on that being a significant strength as we're capitalizing on some of the key markets globally. So that's kind of an assessment as I think about where we are with heat pumps. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And it's really actually building on one of Nigel's earlier ones around restructuring and more broadly, productivity gains. You've got the $340 million of productivity savings for 2023. Is it time for kind of an updated medium-term target around productivity? And what do you see as the path forward to drive a stronger margin profile for the business? And how much does productivity play into that? Olivier Leonetti : So we believe, Noah, that fundamentally, we have the ability to be a 30% incremental company. We will achieve improvement in margin through two levers; one, gross margin as we improve our mix as we improve our operations. And the second lever is going to be through OpEx as we keep standardizing and centralizing our operations. And we have, as we see a strong portfolio of ideas and projects to improve the profitability of our enterprise. As I indicated earlier, typically, those projects have below one year payback. We don't think we need to update today our productivity programs. I think you will see that being embedded in the guide, Noah. George Oliver : And Noah, just to comment on that. As we have been able to strengthen our operating system globally, it hasn't identified significant opportunities continuing, so that we can capitalize on and ultimately continue to expand margins going forward to be able to get incrementals 30% plus. And so the payback that we're getting on the work that we're doing is within a year. Noah Kaye : Yes. Appreciate it. Maybe a little bit surprised positively, I would say that the cyber incident didn't more significantly impact the service business. One, can you kind of explain why that was the case? And two, just talk about how the service and install operations performed during this challenging period for IT infrastructure for the company? George Oliver : Noah, let me just comment on the cyber incident as a whole. What we learned is we're not alone, and this is more common phenomenon across companies like ours certainly it was unfortunate. But what I would tell you there was incredible remarkable work by our team with our business continuity plans. And so as we were impacted, our teams really responded well, staying focused on customers, continuing to work and maintain operations with incredible speed and focus. And so with that, we were obviously very proactive in how we've communicated with suppliers, customers, employees to maintain our operations. So that is the foundation of what we were able to accomplish. What I would say is that the agility that we saw and the ability to be able to -- where we were -- where we did have some compromise, be able to get the proper set of data and make sure that we're continuing to serve across the board. We're able to maintain that and stay focused on what matters, which is ultimately delivering for our customers. So even though we had a little bit of disruption in the month of October, which we talked a little bit about earlier, I believe that the work that we've done really has positioned us strong going forward, and we've seen that momentum come back in November and December. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. George Oliver : Good morning. Joe O'Dea: First question, I just wanted to ask on channel inventory trends. I think that first emerged as a headwind in the third quarter. I believe you expected to see a more meaningful headwind in the fourth quarter. And so can you size kind of what you believe you saw in the fourth quarter? And then within the guide, what type of headwind would be embedded in sort of first quarter or even second quarter of 2024? George Oliver : So when you look at our global product book-to-bill businesses that really depend on channel, starting with resi, certainly, we saw a pullback in resi and that was obviously more so in the US versus globally, but overall, there was a decline within resi. So we've been working to offset obviously offset the inventory and get positioned for what we believe the new demand to be. And I think as you look at the book-to-bill, it's getting more normalized relative to on a go-forward basis that we've seen the adjustment -- when we look -- when we track our inventories, so I think we're back to where we were historically relative to what's in the channel with our distributors. And so I'm somewhat optimistic that, that's stabilizing going forward. When you look at the rest of our book-to-bill businesses, and it's mainly around Fire & Security controls, the same hold true there. So we think that we're through most of the headwind with the adjustment of inventory in the channel, we've also adjusted our inventory in line with what we believe the forward-looking demand to be. And so it's important that we're positioned to be able to support that demand on a real-time basis, which we are. And as we go through reviews business-by-business, looking at what is actually happening, we are encouraged that now we're seeing orders across the board starting to build back our backlog so that we can be positioned here through the course of 2024 to continue to build on the revenue base on a go-forward basis. So I mean we're somewhat optimistic, and I feel that we've -- the headwind that we saw in the second, third, fourth quarter, some of that now is normalizing, and we're back to seeing growth. Joe O'Dea: And then I just wanted to understand kind of project activity in the market, I think 2023 would have seen still a lot of constraints as it relates to labor availability for projects, supply chain availability. What you're seeing on that front, kind of the smoothness of operating of projects at this point whether labor still remains a constraint? And then just related, I mean, office strength does come across as a bit of a surprise. And so any additional color on kind of what you're seeing in North America office? Anything that you're doing where you think you might be driving share gains there? George Oliver : Yes. I'll talk a little bit about operations. When you look at our Building Solutions across the globe, certainly, there was significant disruption where from a cycle time standpoint, some of our projects got extended a month or two, as we look at where we are today, we're back to almost where we were. And what we're believing now is our operational, the operating system that we've deployed, we can create now cycle time as a competitive advantage and being able to respond with the improvements that we've made within our supply chain and within our factories and ultimately within the field and how we execute on projects. So I'm very confident now that, that's going to be a critical strength of ours. Your question relative to resources, we have been very attractive in being able to recruit labor, pretty much across the globe and have not been constrained by labor across both our project-based business as well as our service business. And then in our critical factories, we've been able to recruit, retain and develop, the talent is ultimately going to be critical to delivering on our capabilities. So that feels very good. As it relates to commercial buildings, even though there is a thought that maybe buildings is going to be a pullback, the work that we're doing within buildings is differentiating. And so as we go into a building now, especially with the focus on energy savings and decarbonization. There's no company that's consuming as much data as we are within the building. And so because of that, we can actually do upgrades and deploy new technologies and utilize our data platform, consume all of the data within the building, and in many cases, get a payback on what we do within the building. And so that is our focus. And now with building standards being implemented in many jurisdictions not only here in North America but across the globe, we believe that, that really presents a big opportunity for us in that space, especially with the focus on energy and decarbonization. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on the potential timing of the insurance recovery, the business interruption insurance, would that be a fiscal 2024 event? And is that embedded in your guidance? Olivier Leonetti : The timing would be a 2024 event. Some elements of our cost will actually be reimbursed, we believe, in Q1. That's the goal. So we depend when the costs are incurred and when we are able to prepare our claims. So, some of it will come in Q1, certainly in this year. Deane Dray : Okay. Well, that's -- if you get that in the first quarter, that's pretty fast. So that's impressive. Olivier Leonetti : Some of\u2026 Deane Dray : And then, \u2026 Olivier Leonetti : Yes. Deane Dray : \u2026just a second question on China. Just -- it was called out several times as being a source of weakness, especially in Building Solutions. Any color there just in terms of at the margin, what might be changing? George Oliver : Yes. So as they went through different phases of COVID, we saw a pickup last year and capitalize on that opportunity. We believe that we've built a leading position in the higher end of the commercial market there and have a very large installed base that we're capitalizing on to be able to build our Service business. We are concerned that the macro environment has continued to deteriorate, leading to concerns of the overall slowdown now accelerating. I think when we look at these macro trends, not only working against us, but our competitors. And as we have now studied the markets and looking at verticals or looking at the overall region, we are planning prudently for continued pressure in China. So we hope we're a bit wrong and maybe it comes back a little bit stronger than we suspect right now, but that's really what's embedded in our guide. Deane Dray : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes guys. Good morning. George Oliver : Morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hi. Can I just think it seems that JCI is facing as we look more growth, more investment, more inflation, so more CapEx, more working capital. So how do we think about this 100% cash conversion target going forward, that we are in a more, growthy and more inflationary environment, right? How do you balance growth and growth opportunities and investment versus cash conversion? Olivier Leonetti : So if you look at what we said in our prepared remarks, we believe that the fundamentals to allow our company to be a 100% free Cash Flow Company overtime are there. Today, to your point, we are investing in some parts of the business to support the strong growth in high-end HVAC. We believe that the level of CapEx at this level will be what we need to support the growth we see in the coming few years. The big levers of improvement in free cash flow are going to be around working capital. I mentioned inventory just a day of inventory is worth about $50 million of cash. And if you look at where we are at the end of FY 2023 at about 54 days of inventory, we used to be at 45 days of inventory, you can do the math. There was a big level of cash flow trapped in inventory, we are at it inventory are declining, as we put in our prepared remarks. We see also the ability to reduce the collection cycle. As our lead times are improving, we're going to be able to collect faster. And we are now because of the value proposition of our offering, we're able also to demand some prepayments. So some -- so those are the levers. I mentioned supply chain financing as well. So that's basically, Andrew, what is explaining the view on free cash flow and the path to be, over time, a 100% free cash flow conversion company. Andrew Obin : Got you. And I just -- just clarify if I got it wrong. I think you had $220 million in impairments and restructuring charges, whether incremental impairments in that number? And if yes, what were they? Olivier Leonetti : Go again. We had impairment charges, correct. Go again on the second part of your question? Andrew Obin : What assets do we impair? Olivier Leonetti : So we had, first of all, some open blue assets associated with the FM System acquisition. Some of those assets are part of the FM portfolio. They are better. So we're going to discontinue what we have in OpenBlue. We had an impairment associated with the business we have in Argentina. This business is impacted by high hyperinflation and also we had some restructuring charges. Those are the three key levers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning. Thanks. Just wanted to come back to price, cost. You said positive for 2024. Could you just discuss the pricing component within that framework? And how are you thinking about incremental price actions this year? I'm just curious, did the cyber disruptions in any way limit your ability to capture price ask? Any color there? Olivier Leonetti : So on price cost today, we see price cost to be positive we believe we're going to be able to keep the level of pricing we saw in the second half of the year. George Oliver : And when you project the full year, we see -- still see strong -- with the value propositions that we're bringing to our customers in building solutions, strong value propositions that we're pricing to and with the differentiation that we bring with our digital content that really drives margin. And then on the product side, we continue to have record launches of new product introductions, which ultimately we price to the value that we bring to the market. So we're still seeing strong pricing across the portfolio. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up on the capacity expansion. Encouraging to hear, I guess, maybe just a little bit more context. Is it just simply targeted on data center? Are there other geographies? And is there any way to size what that investment was? George Oliver : Yes. It's -- I mean, let's -- there was a big segment here that's targeted on data centers because of the position that we have and the strength that we have earned with the products that we're bringing into that segment. So as I talked with Scott earlier, we see a significant demand here over the next multiple years that we're positioned now to capitalize on in line with the customer relationships that we have. And so that's going to continue. But when you look at applied, when you look at our overall commercial HVAC business, when we -- what's happened is across the board with the secular trends around decarbonization, sustainability, efficiency. We are uniquely positioned with our technology in the way that we develop technology. We engineer and design right from the compressor to the end market, making sure that our equipment is optimized for the application that we provide. As a result of that, that has a broad base positioned us to be able to now capitalize on these secular trends broad-based, not just within data centers, but across many of the other verticals. And so as we think about the work that we've done to reinvest over the last three or four years in a position that we have, we have a very strong position across our applied portfolio that I believe beyond -- well above the economic growth that we're going to now be able to capitalize on because of that increased demand. So it's pretty broad-based. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to George Oliver for any closing remarks. George Oliver : Thank you all for your continued interest and support and Johnson Controls. As we stand here today, we are set up for success through our strong foundation as we continue to build on opportunities to enhance our business from our margin profile, free cash flow generation and growth through the digitization of our service offering. It is all about execution. And as we look ahead, I am confident in our global team's ability to deliver value and results for our customers and shareholders as we enter fiscal year 2024. So with that, operator, that concludes our call today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Lucas : Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' first quarter fiscal 2024 results. The press release and related tables that were issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti; and newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, Marc Vandiepenbeeck. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if the actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release, and in the appendix of this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls website. I will now turn the call over to George. George R. Oliver: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Now let's begin with Slide 3. We are gaining momentum as we exit the first quarter. Our team has been unbelievable in managing through the recent cyber disruption which occurred early in the quarter. While it is challenging to comprehensively quantify the overall business impact as we recovered from the incident, we are back on track. In fact, over the course of the last 120 days since the cyber incident, we have connected with many of our key customers, solidifying already strong relationships and strengthening their trust and confidence in Johnson Controls. It is clear from their feedback that our value proposition continues to resonate, and customers believe in our products and services.  As we enter the new calendar year we are seeing positive signs. During the quarter, we delivered solid first quarter results, generally in line with our forecast. The fundamentals of our business are strong as we met expectations for sales, margins, and adjusted EPS in the face of headwinds from the cyber disruption, ongoing weakness in global residential HVAC, and significant slowing in China. Olivier will discuss the details of our financials more specifically later in the call.  Looking forward, we expect fiscal 2024 to return to more normalized seasonality in our businesses and the operating environment to be more in line with what we saw prior to the pandemic and recent supply chain disruptions. Our position of building a leading digital building solutions platform continues to be core to our strategy, and we are pleased with the strength of our applied HVAC business, especially as we serve the fast growing data center market. We are updating our fiscal 2024 guidance today, reducing the full year adjusted EPS range by $0.05, reflecting growing headwinds in China. Our commercially focused portfolio and long cycle backlog driven businesses, in addition to our record backlog, gives us more clarity of improvement as fiscal 2024 progresses. Before we continue, I would like to take the time to thank Olivier for his partnership over the last few years, and wish him the best of luck in the next chapter of his career. When Olivier informed me that he was taking a role outside the company, we implemented our internal succession plan, and I am very pleased that Marc Vandiepenbeeck is assuming the role of CFO. Marc has been with Johnson Controls for nearly 20 years, with increasing responsibility in finance roles, including CFO of Building Solutions North America. Last year, we moved Marc into an operating role as President of EMEALA. Marc brings deep finance expertise and understanding of our customers, global markets, and operational knowledge. I am confident that we will continue to build on the foundations already in place, and I look forward to partnering with Marc in his new role.  Now turning to Slide 4, I'd like to highlight the strong foundation of operational excellence at Johnson Controls and our value creation framework. We are capturing the secular trends across sustainable and healthy buildings. We have the right strategy and operating system in place to create value for our shareholders and as part of our commitment to disciplined capital allocation, we remain focused on deploying resources to the right opportunities. Our team has made great progress the last two years, creating a digital services model, and our investments have been a key enabler. The addition of FM Systems gave us increased capabilities to serve our customers as they improve their workplace environments.  Digital is a strong enabler to creating recurring revenue, retaining customers, and supporting higher sustainable service growth rates. Within service we are changing the game from deploying a mechanical contractor to creating multiple options for our customers. We are increasing job size, improving margins, and creating scalable solutions. In addition, we are maximizing value creation through digitally enabled offerings and accelerating our life cycle solutions entitlements across all of our domains. Our team's model has a strong foundation and we will continue to accelerate the pace of change. At the same time, we have successfully removed many layers of cost across the organization. But we know there is more work to be done. We serve an incredible market, and it is on us to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. We will continue to simplify and standardize across our portfolio. As we continue to focus on simplifying the company, we are always assessing opportunities to advance our transformation into a comprehensive solutions provider for commercial buildings. As part of the continuous evaluation of our portfolio, we are in the early stages of pursuing strategic alternatives of our non-commercial product lines, in line with our objective to maximize value to our shareholders. We are very excited about our future and are confident we are on the right path to simplify our portfolio, drive margin expansion, deliver consistent cash flow, while serving our customers in the best possible way. I will now turn the call over to Olivier to go through the financial details of the quarter. Olivier. Olivier C. Leonetti: Thanks, George and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the summary on Slide 5. As George discussed at the beginning of the call, our team did an incredible job responding to the cyber incident. The disruptions we experienced during the quarter were factored into the guidance we provided last month. Total revenue of $6.1 billion was flat year-over-year, while organic sales were down 1% as continued declines in global residential HVAC and accelerated weakness in China's in-store business more than offset mid-single digit growth in service and continued growth in applied HVAC.  Segment margins declined 90 basis points to 12.8%, impacted by tough comps in our shorter cycle global products business, coupled with ongoing weakness in China's macro environment. Adjusted EPS of $0.51 exceeded our guidance of $0.48 to $0.50 as we return to more normalized seasonality. The quarter was impacted by lost momentum from the cyber incident, accelerated weakness in China, and tough comps in our global products business. Below the line, we saw headwinds from net financing charges due to higher interest rates and increased debt levels in line with historical trends. On the balance sheet we ended the first quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in available cash and net debt increased to 2.2 times, which is within our long-term target range of 2 to 2.5 times. The elevated cash position was a direct result of positive action to mitigate the potential impacts of the cyber incident on cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow improved $180 million year-over-year, and we anticipate further improvement as we progress through the fiscal year.  Let's now discuss our segment results in more detail in Slide 6 through 8. Beginning on Slide 6, organic sales in our global products business declined 1% year-over-year, with volume declines offsetting price. Global products saw continued strength in commercial HVAC, which grew low single digits after growing low double digits in the comparable period one year ago. We have been investing in our applied HVAC business for the last couple of years, deploying resources to align to more attractive opportunities, resulting in further share gains in calendar 2023. Fire and Security declined low single digits. We believe that the majority of the tough year-over-year comparisons in the shorter cycleandric [ph] business have bottomed out, and we should see a return to growth in calendar 2024.  Industrial refrigeration had another strong quarter, growing over 35%, driven by EMEALA. Global residential declined high single digits driven by greater than 20% decline in North America which more than offset low single digit growth in the rest of the world. North America continues to face market softness and we believe we have one more quarter with these challenges before the industry begins to see growth in the second half of the year. We're improving our North America market share and see momentum building.  Despite ongoing weaknesses in the European heat pump market, rest of world benefited from strong growth in Japan. Our book to bid business continues to normalize with improved lead times and our global product third-party backlog decreased 10% from the prior year to $2.3 billion. Adjusted segment ABA margins declined 240 basis points to 17.9% as we benefited from insurance proceeds from a warehouse fire in the comparable period last year. We are beginning to see better cost absorption in our factory and expect global products margins to improve throughout the rest of the fiscal year.  Moving to Slide 7 to discuss building solutions performance. Orders increased 1% as mid-single digit order growth in North America and EMEALA was more than offset by greater than 30% decline in APAC, which was primarily the result of further deterioration of the China-installed business. As the China real estate market continues to weaken and the outlook remains mixed, we have begun to optimize our go-to-market strategy and have become more selective in the business we pursue. Organic sales were flat in the quarter against a tougher comparison of low double-digit growth in the prior year quarter. Install declined mid-single digits and more than offset mid-single digit growth in service. Segment margins declined 10 basis points as accelerated weakness in China offset positive mix in the quarter. Building Solutions backlog remains at record levels, growing 7% to $12.1 billion. Service backlog is flat and installed backlog grew 8% year-over-year. Let's discuss the building solutions performance by region on Slide 8. Orders in North America increased 6% as we continue to see strong demand across our HVAC and controls platform, growing high single digits following heightened growth in the comparative period a year ago. Overall, there was broad-based demand in our healthcare, data center, government, and education sectors. Install orders increased 9% year-over-year with solid growth in both new construction and retrofit. Sales in North America were up 4% organically with strong growth across our HVAC and controls platform up low-teens year-over-year. Our Install business grew 4% with continued momentum in new construction up over 25% year-over-year.  Organic sales in service grew 4% in a quarter, benefiting from high single digit growth in our recurring revenue contracts. Segment margins expanded 20 basis points year-over-year to 11.5%, driven by the continued execution of higher margin backlog and strength in our higher margin service business. Total backlog ended the quarter at $8.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year. In EMEALA, orders were up 5% with continuous strength in service up 12%. Demand in institutional gained momentum in the quarter, growing 50% year-over-year, driven by public projects in Europe. Industrial refrigeration had another strong quarter with greater than 45% growth.  Sales in EMEALA grew 2% organically, led by high single-digit growth in service with high single-digit growth from our recurring contracts and strong double-digit growth in our shorter-cycle transactional business. Applied commercial HVAC and Fire and Security grew low single digits within the quarter. Segment EBITDA margins of 7.7% remained flat as the growth in service was offset by the conversion of lower margin installed backlog. We anticipate strong margin expansion in EMEALA through the remainder of the fiscal year. Backlog was up 10% year-over-year to $2.4 billion.  In Asia-Pacific, as I mentioned earlier, orders declined 31% due to further deterioration of the China-installed business and were being more strategic in the deals we select. Overall, APAC-severed orders grew low single digits, driven by high single digit growth in our shorter-term transactional business. Sales in the Asia Pacific declined 21% as the installation business was impacted primarily by accelerated weakness in China. Our service business grew 5% in the quarter. The weakness in China's installed business was broad based across the overall portfolio with HVAC and controls down high-teens and Fire and Security down 20%. Segment EBITDA margins declined 140 basis points to 9.1% as weakness in China offset positive mix in our service business. Backlog of $1.3 billion declined 21% year-over-year. I would now like to turn the call over to Marc to discuss our second quarter and fiscal year 2024 guidance. Marc? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our guidance on Slide 9, I want to say how excited I am for the opportunity to partner with George as we simplify and transform Johnson Controls into a comprehensive solution provider for commercial buildings. We exited our first quarter with a cyber-incident behind us and the momentum we lost at the start of the year has recovered. We entered the second quarter with a backlog that remains at historical levels, a healthy pipeline of opportunities, and strong momentum in our industry-leading service business. We are introducing second quarter sales guidance of approximately flat year-on-year, which assume continued weakness in China and global residential HVAC. We expect strong contribution from North America and EMEALA, led once again by our resilient service business.  As we return to seasonality more in line with historical patterns, global product has one more challenging quarter before stabilizing in the second half. For the second quarter, we expect segment EBITDA margin to be approximately 14.5%, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.78. For the full year, we continue to expect the top-line growth of mid-single digit led by stronger performance in North America, further improvement in EMEALA, stabilization in global products, and a cautious outlook on China. We expect segment EBITDA margin to expand approximately 50 to 75 basis points for the full year, as price costs remain positive and mix continue to improve throughout the year. As George mentioned earlier in the call, given the weakening macro outlook in China, we are updating our adjusted EPS guidance range to approximately $3.60 to $3.75. The overall guide assumes a return to normal seasonality, second-half stabilization of global products, and a conversion of higher margin backlog in Building Solutions. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 85% for the full year. The improvement we saw in cash flow for the start of the year demonstrate that our working capital improvement are gaining momentum. With that, operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And today's first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay, hopefully? George R. Oliver: Yeah, good morning, Scott. Can you hear us? Scott Davis : Yeah, fine. Thanks. George, I think it's been a tough couple quarters. Maybe if we take a step backwards, what do you think long-term this portfolio, the growth rate and margin levels and the cash generation, what is kind of your, I don't want to call it dare to dream, but what is the vision of where you think you can get two, three, four years down the road when in a more normalized environment? George R. Oliver: Yeah, so let me start, Scott, by just saying that, as you know we've been through a significant transformation here into becoming a comprehensive solutions provider for commercial buildings. And then as part of that, continuing to focus on how do we transform the business model and how we bring our differentiated solutions to our customers in the commercial space. And so, as you look at what we've been doing, we're well-positioned to invest and lead in the overall building solution space, capitalizing on significant secular trends, sustainable buildings, smart, healthy buildings. We've been allocating our resources and building out the capabilities. When you look at the content of how we differentiate the solutions, it's not only through the leadership of the product, the applied product and continued investment that we're making in product, but also now deploying those products with a leadership platform with Open Blue that we believe is going to now lead the industry. And that all is converting into how we change the outcomes for the customers that we serve. And that's through our engineered commercial solutions and converting what we do within building solutions to a digitally enabled service.  So when you look at the margin structure as we go forward, not only are we getting a more focused approach to the differentiation with the value proposition right from engineering through install to then ultimately getting the life cycle services. When you project the overall performance going forward, we believe that from a growth standpoint will be well above market, capitalizing on the secular trends with the differentiation. From a margin profile, we'll have a much higher recurring revenue within our services, demanding a much higher margin with the content of the software-enabled services. And then from an overall return, when you look at the conversion to cash we're getting now, for the value proposition we bring we're getting much more cash up front relative to that value proposition, and ultimately being able to deliver very strong free cash flow. So I would say well above market growth, continued expansion of margins to what we believe is kind of mid to higher teens and then very predictable cash flow with the mix of the content of what we do for our customers. Scott Davis : That's helpful, George. And when you think about asset sales, you know, and there's some nuance here clearly, but is it more a function of simplifying the portfolio so you can execute on those KPIs that you just mentioned, or is it or do the asset sales themselves kind of change the growth and margin profile of the company? George R. Oliver: No, let me reflect on the transformation that we've been going through. We've been continuously evaluating the portfolio, kind of where we are with the transformation of a comprehensive solutions provider in commercial buildings, and then making sure that our resources are being deployed to the highest priorities. When you look at the non-commercial product lines, they're excellent businesses, but they do not necessarily \u2013 are they consistent with the go-to-forward strategy over the longer term. And that's now why, as we are now pursuing the alternatives here, because these are good businesses, and there's an opportunity with these businesses now to be able to create even more value for our shareholders as we look at the alternatives. We're very excited about the future with the prospects that we have and the opportunities that we're driving towards. We believe that we're on the right path now to simplify the portfolio, continue to drive margin expansion, deliver much more consistent cash flow, while most important is really differentiating the value proposition that we can bring to our customers, which is going to be fundamental to the growth. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Stephen Tusa : Hi. Good morning. George R. Oliver: Good morning Steve. Stephen Tusa : It would be great if Marc could answer this question, but for the second quarter, could you just talk about the various segments and how you get to this 14.5% operating margin target, maybe on a year-over-year and sequential basis, and what do you expect out of them? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yeah, thanks, Steve. So first, I want to address the change in guidance, right. Since we issued our guidance in December, the impact of the economic environment in China on our business has deteriorated. And we have factored originally a fairly cautious outlook in China in the initial guide. However, that outlook has further worsened. We refocused the organization going through that tumultuous environment in China. We see a path of recovery to that volume and recovery of the backlog as well in the second half of the year, but it started to bottom out in Q2. We have more clarity on some of the actions we've taken around productivity and cost structure, and that support the recovery in that backlog. Now focusing on Q2 on the different business, if you look at our field-based business, Building Solutions, the cyber disruption is really behind us. And the loss momentum that we had in Q1 is now recovering and supporting the shorter-cycle businesses, particularly our service mix. If you look at North America and EMEALA, particularly, the margin we have put in the backlog over the last six months, but particularly during the first quarter, gives us confidence that we're going to be able to deliver on the margin rate for those businesses. There's a lot of benefit of cost actions we've taken early on in the year and later last year, but there's also more return to seasonality in our Global Products business as we see the volume providing marginally in those operations. If you combine all of that, I think we see with confidence that margin being attainable, Steve. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then just, George, for you, I guess. It's kind of hard to reconcile the commentary on momentum in your strategy with basically negative organic growth this quarter, do you consider that positive momentum? And then secondly, what was the -- what drove the timing on this announcement of evaluating strategic alternatives, I mean it's not like you have anything really lined up here, official to announce so why are we kind of just throwing this out there today versus maybe over the last couple of years where you've been kind of pursuing the same strategy? Just curious on kind of a straightforward answer on both of those. We don't need a lot of verbiage. Thank you. George R. Oliver: So let me just comment on the quarter as far as momentum. We did have a significant disruption, as Marc said, for about six weeks of the first quarter, and part of that did have an impact on our momentum and our ability to be able to convert and the like. And so that's -- that was more of a short-term impact in Q1, in addition to the year-on-year adjustment that we've had in Global Products. As far as the timing, I'm sure you can appreciate, Steve, that the Board and the management team, we've had a very thoughtful approach to the strategy. We assess all avenues that will deliver value to our shareholders. Our strategy -- our transformation has been focused on really leveraging all of our combined strengths and our differentiated product, our digital platform.  And then from a go-to-market standpoint, the depth and expertise that we have from an engineering standpoint to ultimately be a comprehensive solutions provider and our ability to be able to take the value proposition and be able to convert that to recurring revenue through services. We're seeing that momentum, which is beginning to convert and as we look at the difference in the business models within the businesses when we talk about the noncommercial businesses, there is a different business model relative to how we serve the market. And I think this allows us to be able to position those businesses for continued growth, while we're creating value, while we're focused on really now accelerating the progress we've made within our Building Solutions business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey, thanks, good morning everyone. I wonder if we could just drill a little bit more, George, into kind of the portfolio review. And specifically, as you know, the business is complex day-to-day for you running it. It's even more complex for us on the outside looking in. So can you just size for us what we're talking in noncommercial assets, I think I put an estimate out there, I don't know if I'm in the ballpark or not, but just give us some sense of the total revenues that we're talking about that are under review in consideration and maybe kind of the average profitability across that basket? George R. Oliver: Yes, when you look at the overall revenues of these businesses, it would be less than 25% of the portfolio. Jeffrey Sprague : And how did the margins stack up versus the average of JCI? George R. Oliver: Overall, when you look at the mix of the margins, it would be in line with the overall JCI. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. And then just kind of coming back to maybe a more granular point on this then. Even preceding you, I think, as you well know, there was always this debate about, can you extract Resi from kind of legacy, York, the Resi and then Light Commercial applied are tied together, and maybe it undermines your larger commercial effort if you exit that business. So maybe you found a way to separate Resi and Light Commercial or you think you can, but can you provide any additional context on that and how the Light Commercial business in particular might factor into your strategic thoughts on where the business goes from here? George R. Oliver: Sure. So if you look at Resi, Light Commercial and the businesses now are really back on track. I mean we've had a really nice quarter here picking up share, both in Resi as well as Light Commercial where all our productive business in North America was up double digit, which was supported with 40% growth in commercial, and with Resi being down about 7%. So the businesses now are performing -- positioning to perform going forward. On the [indiscernible] side, when you look at JCH, it's where we had strength in Japan, offsetting some of the weakness we saw in Europe and India. So when you look at the go-to-market, I think it's important to understand that these noncommercial product lines are excellent businesses. But when you look at the go-to-market, they're not consistent with what we're doing as we build out our building solutions over the long-term, and so we believe that when you look at the value proposition that we bring with our customers, that -- although there's an overlap with some of the applied rooftops, that can be managed with the structure that we put into place going forward. And so I think when you look at the -- it does not erode any value proposition in our comprehensive commercial solutions, but also positions the business to be able to take an incredible asset and create more value through growth. Jeffrey Sprague : Alright, I will leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. So another question on the portfolio review. So the press release on Friday highlighted Hitachi, but also talked about Residential, Light Commercial for York. And I just wanted to make it very, very clear that we're talking here about just the U.S. residential assets. But there's also a mention of the ATT business as well. So any more color in terms of the noncommercial assets because it does feel like there are some commercial businesses here? And then on the Hitachi side, obviously, Hitachi still has 40% of that business. How much flexibility do you have to seek options for your majority control of the asset? George R. Oliver: I think you'd appreciate, Nigel, at this stage, with the ongoing transformation, I would caution against making any assumptions at this stage and how we will affect it. I think the communication here today is that we're in -- we are pursuing strategic alternatives. So we're going to continue to simplify and standardize across the portfolio. But we're in the early stages. And at this stage, I'm not going to comment relative to any one of the potential assets that we would look to create value with. Nigel Coe : Okay. Worth a try though, isn\u2019t it. But if we do assume that you execute on some form of strategic realignment for the portfolio, if you had, let's say, $5 billion of cash coming in the door today, how would you look to deploy that, George? George R. Oliver: Yes. As we look at -- I mean, we're, again, speculating on what would happen. I think as we look at what we do within our Comprehensive Commercial Solutions business, we have been doing bolt-ons. We'll continue to be able to do bolt-ons and supporting the technology and our go-to-market as we strengthen that across the globe. And our intent would be to make it accretive as far as whether it'd be through bolt-ons and/or deployment back to our shareholders to offset the dilution that any divestiture might have. Nigel Coe : Okay, I will leave it there, thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Great. First, a shorter-term one. You did mention signs of bottoming out in Fire and Security on the short cycle. Can you just give us some more indicators and confidence there? George R. Oliver: Yes, when you look at the business, whether it'd be at the product level or in the field, as far as the demand signals are coming through strong, we've gone through some adjustment relative to backlog as well as in the product business, the book-to-bill business. We see this really differentiating our overall commercial solutions and how we're utilizing these businesses and differentiating our solutions. On a go-forward basis, we have -- when you look at our pipeline of opportunities it is pretty robust, and we're working to continue now to execute that into backlog and ultimately, then the conversion revenues going forward. So I think it's more short term based on what we've seen here with some of the adjustments in the market, but we're confident that with the pipeline we have, we're going to be positioned to be able to continue to support the growth that we're committing to. Noah Kaye : Okay, thanks. And I think I'd like to return to the why now question that was asked earlier, and maybe frame it slightly differently. Obviously, the U.S. market went through a tough year last year with volume trends. But certainly, there's some secular tailwinds as we look out in the next couple of years, refrigerant transition, ongoing price mix benefits, easier comps. And then you have the transition, both in North America and globally towards heat pumps. So there seem to be some positive prospects, both North America and globally for residential and at the same time, there's, I think, overarching concern from many investors around non-res, right, commercial weakness. And so I guess in that context, why now is a particularly a cute question because I think from a cycle perspective, the market doesn't necessarily see the same trends ahead that would seem to inform this decision. So maybe kind of talk to us about why this makes sense for you and why now? George R. Oliver: Yes. So as I said earlier, we've come through a very disruptive period, and there's been significant progress that has been made across these businesses, and these businesses are positioned to perform. And so as I said earlier, as you can appreciate, we're constantly reviewing the portfolio and understanding how we manage the assets to be able to deliver value for our shareholders. We've taken a very thoughtful approach to the strategy, and this has been continuous and making sure that we're assessing all avenues on how we ultimately deliver value to our shareholders. And so that's what's been playing out. I think tied to -- as we think about our acceleration of becoming the leading comprehensive commercial solutions provider within commercial buildings, this is part of that path forward. And in line with -- consistent with how we continue to update our shareholders, we'll continue to provide those updates as we continue to make progress with these potential divestitures. Noah Kaye : Appreciate that thoughtful answer. Thanks George. Operator : And our next question today comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks, good morning. Congratulations to Marc. And Olivier, we'll see you on the other side. The -- let me just start with Asia because you referenced China a few times on your prepared comments. I'm just trying to understand like how much of the weakness that you saw this quarter was this the market deteriorating versus your own selectivity? And then as you kind of think about the next few quarters, should we be expecting material order declines to continue? George R. Oliver: I'll take that, Joe. Last year, when you look at where we were last year, we were working to recover our backlog from the second wave of COVID shutdowns in China. As the economic environment in China has slowed, we continue to make sure that we're streamlined with our organization and aligning our resources to the market to be able to maximize what we believe is our entitlement. And then make sure that we're executing with discipline to achieve what we see to be very strong life cycle value creation with our services. This is what we played out in North America and which has been very successful for us. We do have a very healthy pipeline as we assess the market, which we are converting. We are anticipating a slower recovery of the backlog and ultimately, the projected revenue, which now has been pushed to the right. And so those are the factors really updating our guidance here, Joe, but I'm confident that we have incredible product for the market, making sure we have the right go-to-market structure and then ultimately, being able to execute on what we see still to be a very attractive market. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, thanks George. And I know that you don't want to provide a ton of specificity on what noncommercial means. Just maybe from my own edification and remembering the old Tyco assets, I mean I think you still had some residential ATPs, international assets as well. Just correct me if I'm wrong, if you don't? And then also just a point of clarification, the Light Commercial business is showing at roughly 6% of sales. I think the last several quarters, we've been seeing it closer to 9%. Did you guys shift a portion of the Light Commercial sales into Applied, just want to understand that a little bit, too? George R. Oliver: No, when you look at the mix within our ducted business, which is mainly what drives our Light Commercial, is we're up 40%. And like I said, in our ducted business, when you look at Resi being down slightly and then commercial being very strong, our whole duct business was up 10%. And so this has been the differentiated product that we've been bringing into the market, getting -- we've increased share, Joe, by -- it's been roughly about 300 basis points over the last year with the recovery of the commercial market, and we've invested in the capacity to be able to do so. So as far as that is the core of our Light Commercial business, and we've been performing extremely well. Joseph Ritchie : So was there a re-cost because it's showing like that business is lower as a percentage as your total sales than it was in the last few quarters? George R. Oliver: It takes into account the VRF. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Joe, the difference is that the 9% is our fiscal 2022 sales in the prior year versus when we move forward, it's now our fiscal 2023, now that, that year is final. It's just a -- it's a math exercise. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. Actually, that math doesn't really tie well, but I can follow up off-line. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning everyone. George R. Oliver: Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Could you give us a little more color regarding your order cadence within Building Solutions and what you're seeing, obviously, most of the slowdown in orders as you said in Q1 was because of the slowdown in China, but did you see a dip in orders because of the cyber incident and then improvement, I think you changed your incentive comp structure for some of your salespeople as well in the quarter, so a lot going on, and how are you thinking about orders and backlog from here? George R. Oliver: Yes. So as we talked about, we did lose some momentum because of the cyber incident. And so when you look at the sales conversion cycle, it did lengthen in the first quarter by about a week, a little bit better than a week. And so when you look at our pipeline, it continues to expand and does support the acceleration of orders in Q2 and through the remainder of the year, in line with what we were projecting prior to having the impact that we had. So we're very confident that with the pipeline, with the generation -- pipeline generation and then our ability to be able to convert with the cycle times we convert with, we're back to where we were. And then that also being combined with our success in services and being able to continue to build strong pipelines for services, convert to PSAs, building backlog, and then ultimately, supporting our ability to get services, deliver high single-digit services for the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks for that George. And this question might be for Marc. I know you ran Building Solutions in EMEALA at least for a little while. So obviously, those margins have continued to be challenging. Can you give us more color into what is holding down that segment, projects ending there, and maybe better margin going forward? And then talk about the changes you began to institute and when they might have more impact on that segment? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Oh, great question. So right away, when I took the role last year, we started to work on implementing our enterprise field operating model. That's very similar to what we did in North America a few years ago. Johnson Controls operates in markets that are very sizable and complex, but that provides ample opportunity for us to grow. But when you face large market, it's important to remain focused and disciplined on the sub-segments of that markets that provide the right level of product capabilities, leverage our engineering talent, and our solutions. And we are looking for those sub-segments of the market that provide the most value for both our customers and the company. As we continue to simplify, standardize, and I would say rationalize that business, the operating model becomes easier to adopt in the field, in the regions, and the benefits of that model get amplified. We get a lot of leverage. And that's really what we've been focused on over the last six to eight months. There's still work to be done, but I see great improvement in our book margin. And as we start seeing the benefit of that model and the actions we've taken, so I'm very confident that EMEALA will return to a comparable profit level that the other field segment are seeing. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color guys. Operator : And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. And thanks, Olivier, and congrats to Marc. Maybe just on Slide 9, the guidance for the sort of existing portfolio. So you're looking at sort of 4% organic sales growth, let's say, for the year. So the second half is implied, up 8%. How should we think about that plus 8%, splitting between Global Products and then Building Solutions? And just trying to confirm, does that second half growth guide of plus 8% include growth in both U.S. Resi HVAC and also China Building Solutions? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So thank you. So as you look at the breakdown between our Business Solutions segments and Global Products, we see a recovery in growth in Asia Pac in the second half of the year. So that will turn positive. And as we continue to see the other segment, BS&A in North America and EMEALA continuing to clog at mid-single digit, you can see the balance of those two offsetting and getting very strong single digits all the way to almost double-digit in the second half of the year. That support the growth you're seeing on the slide. When it comes to Global Products, we continue to see an improvement in orders. As we said, we believe that Q2 is really the bottoming out and the stabilization of that business, and we see quite good momentum in the recovery into Q3 and accelerating into Q4, supporting that number you see on the slide. Julian Mitchell : Got it. So both GP and Building Solutions grow at a similar rate in the second half to each other? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : That's right. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just a second question. I understand you can't talk too much about the portfolio. So maybe thinking about some other items. Just wanted to, Marc, on the perspectives on sort of receivables factoring from here and what the approach will be in terms of does that factoring get unwound now because lead times are going back to normal? And pillar two has come in, so should we think about the medium-term tax rate moving up to the high teens? Thank you. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So starting on that last question on tax rate. Obviously, there are some headwinds there with the good changes in the rate. We are continually assessing it, and we'll continue to look at it. But you're right, there is a headwind longer-term on the rate. When it comes to factoring, we always look at different methods to finance the company. And as you said, when lead times got difficult, when inventory were a little bit more elevated than traditionally, factory became a logical avenue. We will continue to review the most economical ways to finance the company. We'll make sure that we take appropriate action against that program to align it with the financial commitment we've made to you, both in terms of profitability and free cash flow conversion. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Hey, good morning guys. George R. Oliver: Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if you could comment on pricing in the various verticals. What you're seeing with respect to pricing power? And then I had a follow-up. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. As part of that simplification of our business model, one benefit that comes in, we have more clarity on our cost accumulation and our ability to drive price, focusing the businesses, particularly of Business Solutions segments towards better vertical and better product lines and solution. We are able to drive more price to the market than we have been historically, chasing less the segments of the market where competitiveness but also value is hard to sell to the end customer. So as part of our Building Solutions operating system, you can see a great improvement, both on the price we can command in the market but also the price realization we see in our backlog and our executed margin. When it comes to Global Products, we've always tried to shy away from the more commoditized part of the market. For the parts where we actually have differentiated product, we see tremendous momentum both on pricing, but as well as the margin that comes on the back end of that particularly thinking about our Applied HVAC businesses that have been operating at very strong margin over the last few months and continue to see quite good momentum from a price cost standpoint. Gautam Khanna : Okay, and could you expand that commentary on the Resi market as well, are you still able to get price, is there any pushback, are you seeing any evidence of trade downs or movement to repair versus replace and the like? George R. Oliver: No. As we've said previously, we've continued to lead pricing, making sure that with all of the reinvestments that have been made to support these regulatory changes, that we're positioned to be able to get the proper price and that continues. And so in spite of us being maybe not one of the top players, we've been very disciplined relative to how we're creating the value proposition and ultimately, how we're pricing in the market. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Chris Snyder at UBS. Please go ahead. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. So for revenue, you guys are guiding March up about 10% sequentially, which is a good deal stronger than the typical mid-single-digit ramp that we've seen in most years. Maybe can you just talk about the drivers of this, the sharp increase into the March quarter? I understand there's a couple of points of cybersecurity catch-up, but it sounds like GP maybe has yet to stabilize. I think you said it troughs in the March quarter, so I would expect some headwinds there still remain? Thank you. Olivier C. Leonetti: Yes. It's coming and I think you mentioned it in your question. There's some return to normal seasonality versus the prior year. As we were flowing through the backlog, you can see that seasonality picking up, and that's lifting us a couple of points. But you're absolutely right. The cyber disruption and the loss of momentum it had created in the quarter there were very few orders that were lost, but the cycle time of our commercial team expanded as we were going through the quarter. And that created a challenge in the first quarter that now provides tailwind from a growth standpoint in the second quarter. Christopher Snyder : And was it 1 -- I know you guys called out 1 point in the December quarter, if I remember correct. Was it 1 point again from cyber in the March quarter? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : I don't believe we were that prescriptive, to be honest with you. It's really hard to measure with precision, how much was cyber versus the markets at the time. But I think if you look at the momentum we've built now in Q2, I would tell you, it's a few points of benefit that we are seeing. Christopher Snyder : Got it, thank you. And then for my follow-up, on Global Products, you guys talked about seeing stabilization. Can you maybe talk about the respective product lines within that, but being Resi, Light Commercial, and Fire and Security, are they all showing stabilization, are any leading, any lagging on that normalcy? Thank you. George R. Oliver: When you look at our -- the global products and more of the transactional businesses book-to-bill, we went through a significant inventory adjustment last year in the channel. When you look at our order rates now coming in and now what we're projecting in revenue, we're seeing that positive across the board. Again, in the duct business, Resi still is down -- still down about 20%, with price, we're down single digits. That will continue to improve as we go through the year. But beyond that, across the board, we're seeing very strong orders in line with what we're projecting for revenue as we go forward. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah, thanks, good morning guys. So we've covered a lot of ground here. I guess the last thing I just wanted to ask about is, I'll just keep it to one question, is you guys gave guidance and reported earnings obviously pretty late in the fourth quarter, with only a couple of weeks to go. So how did China take you by such a surprise where we're only a month later and we have to cut guidance by $0.05? Thank you. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. The disruption that came from the cyber incidents also slowed down the pace at which data flows through the organization. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we had factored a fairly cautious outlook on China. But our ability to really pin down exactly the impact, it was actually going to have in the current quarter and following quarter, as we all know about six weeks smarter and more educated about the challenges and that outlook has worked on further. We discussed it in a prior question, it's a combination of the market condition and us being more selective in the type of deal and the type of transaction we decide to pursue. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joseph O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning. In your reference to simplifying and standardizing costs across the portfolio, I think you've been on some kind of notable cost out as it relates to both COGS and SG&A. Is this sort of setting up for the next chapter or can you talk a little bit about where you see the biggest opportunities on simplifying some of the cost structure and any sizing of those opportunities? George R. Oliver: Yes, so let me reflect on that. I mean we've been through a major transformation, taking a set of businesses that were a lot of a lot of variation in the fundamentals within the operating system. We now have standardized that across the board. That has allowed us to become much more efficient, reducing layers and ultimately, the cost that is required to support the business. As we continue now, so it's a twofold not only standardizing the processes but then with automation and IT supporting those processes with good data, that is all accelerated within the company, which has allowed us to be able to now capitalize on more simplification. That's one element. And then from a selling standpoint, as we then standardize our operating system around commercial, we've also been able to align our commercial resources in line with the market with the segmentation that we're driving to be able to drive our growth, and we're seeing a significant pickup there also. So it's really across the board on all of our cost elements in line with being much more simple, much more standard, and more agile in how we now pursue growth. Joseph O\u2019Dea: And then could you talk about service order trends by region when we look at EMEALA, the last couple of quarters, we're looking at low double-digit, mid-teens type of growth in service orders in each of those quarters, whereas in North America, we've been seeing low single digit. So what you're seeing in terms of sort of differences in terms of those growth rates, demand trends on the service order side in field? George R. Oliver: Yes. Let me just touch upon the fundamentals, and Marc can talk a little bit about the orders. The fundamentals here, we're increasing our detach rates and now we're up to mid to upper 40 percentile. We're getting a more -- a higher percentage of our installed base served. This year, we're going to be able to expand our connected assets by well over 10,000. We're going to be able to get PSA growth longer-term services up over 20%. And then when you look at the way that we're connecting our services, we're getting much lower attrition rates. That all now is playing out and positioning us for a strong high single-digit service growth again this year. On the order rates, as we look at any one of those elements, we're consistently driving that strategy across all three regions. So Marc, maybe you want to comment? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes, commenting on the three regions. So North America is our largest service business, and was also unfortunately the most impacted by the cyber disruption. So that's why you see a little bit of softness in Q1. It's a very transactional business, day-to-day business that has a lot of automation and reliance on our system to be able to order -- book orders and execute that revenue rapidly. The fundamentals of that business hasn't changed, and I think the recovery is coming in the balance of the year, and we are seeing now in the second quarter a really strong pickup in that business. If you look at EMEALA and Asia, touching on EMEALA first, those are mature businesses, but at a different part of the cycle when it comes to growth. There's enormous amount of opportunity in getting after our installed base and continuously maturing our business model similarly to what we've done in North America to really drive long-term double-digit growth in those service business. And in Asia Pacific, particularly in China, part of our refocus on the market is really focusing on those sub-segments of the market, where we see a strong long-term service profile for our business in order for us to really maximize the whole life cycle of those opportunities. Joseph O\u2019Dea: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you, good morning everyone. Just a quick question from me please. Regarding the potential or expected divestitures, a separation of Resi, what would that do to RemainCo in terms of free cash flow potential, just maybe down to the level of working capital, does that change your ability to hit this target of 100% free cash flow conversion? George R. Oliver: Yes. Not at all, Deane. I mean we've been working on our free cash flow and the fundamentals of that across both the building solutions to be able to get more billing upfront and more in line with revenue, and then in our Global Products business have significantly improved, not only the inventory, but also our ability to be able to collect. So as far as the commitment to our free cash flow target, we're going to be well positioned to be able to deliver on that target. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to George Oliver for any closing remarks. George R. Oliver: Yes, just to wrap up, as we've discussed here today, we've been on a transformation journey for a number of years and have made incredible progress and have had many successes. While we're building strong fundamentals, we're also better leveraging our people and portfolio and ultimately, serving our customers in a better way. We're very confident we've built a very robust operating system across the portfolio and are going to be well positioned to deliver for our shareholders. And I do look forward to updating all of you as we continue to make progress. So with that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Lucas : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results. The press release and related tables that were issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com.  Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and Chief Financial Officer, Marc Vandiepenbeeck.  Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.  We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls' website.  I will now turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.  Let's begin with Slide 3. We were very pleased with our second quarter performance as our adjusted EPS came in at the high end of our guidance. Sales growth returned this quarter following the cyber disruption at the start of the fiscal year, and our team delivered strong margin expansion. This was driven by productivity and conversion of our higher-margin backlog. Orders noticeably rebounded in the quarter, up 12% year-over-year. This was driven by continued strength in data centers, which I will talk about in an upcoming slide. Our backlog remained at record levels, growing 10% to $12.6 billion, and the quality of the backlog is strong, as I mentioned.  Customers continue to come to Johnson Controls because of our ability to deliver attractive outcomes. The fact is our focus on delivering engineered solutions for commercial buildings continues to serve as a differentiator for Johnson Controls, allowing us to deliver unparalleled value. With the business performing at a high level, free cash flow continues to improve, and we are taking action to further strengthen our balance sheet. Most recently, we reached a broad settlement with a nationwide class of public water systems related to our AFFF product. Additionally, we announced that we discontinued use of our receivable factoring programs.  Our efforts are turning into results and the value of our transformation is coming into focus. Going forward, we remain active in pursuing strategic alternatives of certain noncore product lines that do not align with our focus on being a comprehensive solutions provider for commercial buildings. While we do not have any updates to provide at this time, we continue to make good progress on the exploration of alternatives for some of these assets. The results from the quarter and the performance of our team give us confidence that we will continue to build momentum into the second half, and we will be able to meet our financial objectives for the year. Marc will discuss these in more detail later in the call.  Please turn to the next slide. I want to take an opportunity to discuss how we see the composition of our company going forward. The core of Johnson Controls is our engineered solutions offering. These solutions include commercial HVAC controls, fire, security and services. Our solution center around our domain expertise, forming the smart building trifecta of energy-efficient equipment, clean electrification and digitalization.  We have created one end-to-end operating model that we now have deployed around the globe, which allows us to better serve our customers more efficiently with greater predictability. Our solutions include both systems and services that focus on maximizing the opportunities around the life cycle of the equipment. These solutions are enhanced further by our digitally enabled offerings, which allow us to provide tailored outcomes for the customers which we serve.  Our systems business begins at the engineering and design phase. It is managed through installation of the project. The systems business is an important vehicle to capture a service event, and we have created a scalable service model that is driving more consistent growth, and that carries higher margins. The service business will continue to be a positive contributor to our long-term margin expansion. Our solutions operating model is enabled by connected equipment throughout the building, allowing us to collect data that drives a consistent and enjoyable occupant experience with repeatable outcomes. We create incredible value for our customers, which is clearly demonstrated by our results in the most recent quarter.  The transformation of our portfolio into a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings is an opportunity. Once complete, we will be able to flow additional resources to the most attractive opportunities. Part of our commitment to disciplined capital allocation remains ensuring that we are deploying resources to the right opportunities. Turning to the next slide. Johnson Controls plays an important role in serving the rapidly growing data center market. We provide cooling needs for the top hyperscale and colocation data center customers. The demand for data centers is accelerating globally with the next generation of data centers projected to be designed for more than 1 gigawatt of power consumption.  We have intentionally positioned the company to benefit from this emerging trend due to our relentless innovation efforts and inherent strategic advantages. These include : one, creating leading technologies around a broad range of air-cooled and water-cooled chillers to support the exponential growth in cooling demand. Two, investing in R&D teams and world-class test laboratories to design, build, test and demonstrate performance of equipment over the entire data center operating envelope. Speed is the key, so we are investing to accelerate the pace of innovation.  And three, creating leading domain expertise to provide complete package solutions that drive outcomes, such as high-efficiency chiller plant, space cooling, critical environmental monitoring, security systems and fire safety and asset protection systems while providing service for the entire life cycle of the asset. Underscoring these advantages is our core identity as a comprehensive solution provider for commercial buildings. This enables us to fulfill more than cooling needs for our customer, which makes us a preferred partner that can expand with our customers across all geographies.  In fiscal 2023, our sales to data centers were approximately $2 billion. We continue to see solid demand for our solutions, which is evident in our orders. This is reinforced by the fact that our fiscal first half orders for data centers have already surpassed the orders we booked for all of fiscal 2023.  With orders growing, we have been investing in capacity to be able to execute on our accelerated data center backlog. Our strong presence in data center starts with our advanced chiller technology. Given the amount of heat generated at data centers, our customers are looking for solutions that maintain constant temperatures in even the most extreme environments.  In addition to chillers, we have extended our offerings with both air-handling units and computer room air handlers. Our cooling solutions continue to advance, and we are working on next-generation technologies to keep up with the growing needs of data centers.  The case study on this slide was for a 0.5 gigawatt facility that is being expanded now to a full gigawatt. The project included the deployment of our chillers air handlers and just as important, we have secured planned service agreements for all of the chillers.  Our pipeline for data centers remains very healthy, and we are continuing to expand our capacity to meet the strong demand. We remain excited about the opportunities in this fast-growing vertical and look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.  Before I turn the call over to Marc to go through the financial details, I want to say how proud I am of the Johnson Controls team. While we faced some challenges in the first fiscal quarter, and we'll continue to navigate a dynamic environment. We delivered on our commitments to our customers to drive value for our shareholders.  Now with that, I'll turn it over to Marc. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with summary on Slide 6. Total revenue of $6.7 billion was flat year-over-year, while organic sales grew 1%, as strong high single-digit service growth more than offset continued weakness in China's system business and declines in the global residential HVAC. Segment margins expanded 70 basis points to 14.5% as we delivered strong productivity and converted higher-margin backlog. Adjusted EPS of $0.78 was up 4% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.74 to $0.78. Operations contributed $0.06 of the growth in the quarter benefiting from recover momentum following the cyber incident at the end of our last fiscal year as well as improved productivity.  Below the line, we saw headwinds from net financing charges due to higher interest rates. Overall, we are pleased with the strong adjusted EPS performance in the quarter. On the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with approximately $800 million of available cash and net debt increased to 2.4x, which is within our long-term target range of 2 to 2.5x.  For the fiscal first half, excluding the impact of the receivable factoring unwind, adjusted free cash flow improved $166 million year-over-year. As we end the use of factoring, we will continue to focus on further improvements on our core billings and collection capabilities, leading to continued improvement in our cash performance over time. We've also made tremendous progress in reducing our inventory levels and expect further improvements in the second half.  Let's now discuss our segment results in more details on Slides 7 through 9. Beginning on Slide 7. Organic sales in our Global Products business declined 1% year-over-year, with volume declines offsetting price. We saw low single-digit growth in commercial HVAC, highlighted by mid-teen growth in light commercial. Applied HVAC declined mid-single digits against a tough year-on-year comp.  Fire & Security declined low single digit against tougher comps as decline in fire suppression more than offset growth in fire detection and security video surveillance. Industrial Refrigeration grew over 25% with another strong quarter in EMEA/LA. Global residential HVAC declined low single digit, driven by low single-digit decline in global ductless residential, primarily in Europe. Our global ducted residential business declined mid-single digits with a mid-single-digit decline in North America, offsetting strength in Latin America.  Dealer growth is up high double digit with channel inventory normalizing and distributor sell-through continuing to increase. We see momentum building in our North America market. Adjusted segment EBITDA margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.9% as positive price/cost and improved productivity more than offset mix headwinds.  Moving now to Slide 8 to discuss our Building Solutions performance. All those regained momentum with strong 12% growth in the quarter. Overall, service orders grew 13% with broad-based growth across the regions. Systems orders grew 12% as North America offset declines in EMEA/LA and APAC. Organic sales increased 2% in the quarter, led by service growth of 8%. Systems revenue was down 2% as declines in APAC and EMEA/LA more than offset high single-digit growth in North America. Building Solutions backlog remains at a record level, growing 10% to $12.6 billion. Service backlog grew 3% and systems backlog grew 11% year-on-year.  Let's discuss the Building Solutions performance by region on Slide 9. Orders in North America increased 19% in the quarter, driven by 26% growth in systems. We continue to experience strong demand in data centers, which led to nearly 50% growth across our HVAC & Controls platform. Fire & Security orders grew low single digits.  Sales in North America were up 8% organically with strong growth across our HVAC & Controls platform, up mid-teens year-over-year. Overall, our system business grew 9%, while service grew 6%. Segment margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year to 13.6%, driven by the continued execution of higher-margin backlog and strength in our higher-margin service business. Total backlog ended the quarter of $8.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year.  In EMEA/LA, orders were up 8%, with strong double-digit growth in service, offset by a decline in system to a strong year-over-year compare. Consistent with our strategy, there is an increased focus to drive higher margin into our backlog. Controls had a strong order intake with solid growth in Europe and Latin America. Sales in EMEA/LA grew 4% organically with low-teen service growth offsetting a decline of system business predominantly driven by Latin America and Middle East HVAC businesses. Our service business benefited from strong double-digit growth from both the recurring and shorter-cycle transactional businesses.  Industrial Refrigeration, another solid quarter with low-teen growth year-over-year. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points to 8.4%, driven by improved productivity, positive mix from the growth in service and by the conversion of higher-margin systems backlog. Backlog was up 10% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. In Asia Pacific, orders declined 9% as we remain selective of the jobs we book into the China system backlog. Overall, APAC service order grew high single digits, driven by high single-digit growth in our recurring contracts. Sales in Asia Pacific declined 23% as the system business was impacted primarily by the continued weakness in China.  Our service business grew 7% in the quarter with strong growth in our shorter-cycle transactional business. Segment EBITDA margins declined 80 bps to 11% as weakness in China offset positive mix from our service business. Backlog of $1.3 billion declined 18% year-over-year.  Now let's discuss our third quarter and fiscal year '24 guidance on Slide 10. We enter seasonal strong third quarter with good momentum, evident by our robust order and resilient service. Our margin-rich backlog remains at historical levels. And our Global Products book-to-bill business have stabilized. We are introducing third quarter sales guidance of approximately low single-digit growth, which assumes one more quarter of top line pressure in our system business in China. We expect strong contribution from North America and EMEA/LA, especially from the regained momentum in our service business. Global Products is expected to return to growth as our book-to-bill orders remain positive through the second quarter.  For the third quarter, we expect segment EBITDA margin to be approximately 17% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.10. We are maintaining our full year guide. We expect sales growth of approximately mid-single digit, led by continued momentum in our service business, stabilization in our Global Products and a cautious second half outlook for China.  Segment margins are expected to expand approximately 50 to 75 basis points through productivity improvement, positive mix from the service business and conversion of a higher-margin backlog. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is unchanged and is expected to be approximately $3.60 to $3.75. The high end of the guide assumes accelerated recovery in China, normalized channel inventory levels in North America resi and service acceleration.  Excluding the impact of unwinding the receivable factoring, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 85% for the full year. Our working capital metrics continue to improve, supported by our first half performance. In summary, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial and operational commitments.  With that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Can you just maybe talk about was there anything that was pushed from 1Q into 2Q? And then, I guess, looking at the guidance, fourth quarter definitely looks like a step-up here even more so than before. What gives you the confidence even at the lower midpoint to see that kind of ramp from 2 to 3 to 4 at this stage? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So in terms of push from Q1 to Q2, we had some orders that did slip due to the cyber incident and the recovery in the momentum. I wouldn't say it's material in terms of what pushed from 1 to 2. There was some smaller ones. But the strength of our orders in Q2 is really coming from the fundamental positive trend we're seeing in our data center business and some other core businesses.  Now in terms of the guide for the balance of the year and maybe first address third quarter. If you look at the third quarter guidance, we provided over $1.05 to $1.10. We feel very strong about Q3. We regained momentum during the second quarter, and that gives us strong confidence especially when we enter the third quarter. All of the short-cycle businesses we've been talking about have seen very strong order during the second quarter and we continue to see that momentum building as we enter the third quarter. And that gives us the confidence that our book-to-bill Global Products businesses, resi business and of course, our business solutions service business will achieve the target we've set for them.  You know that China is still facing one more quarter of revenue pressure in Q3, but the order momentum there remains very, very strong. And we are really expecting a very strong sequential performance in both EMEA/LA and North America. And so if you think about the guidance about the balance of the year, we're still showing the same range as we did to the prior quarter, even though we created a pretty strong second quarter at the high end of the guide we have provided. And if we look at the second half and the balance of the year, what you need to see and what we're expecting to see from a guidance standpoint is the China business will have to accelerate its momentum both on order and on revenue. We would also need to see the resi business with a sequential quarter-over-quarter growth to increase. And you know that business is facing some additional variability associated with the fact that we are switching refrigerant as part of the market change.  And finally, to achieve the very high end of that guidance, we would have to achieve improved service growth from where we closed the second quarter and where we see the third quarter lending. So -- and Steve, I would also remind you that looking comparatively into the second half, we have much easier comps than we did in the first half. C. Stephen Tusa : And then lastly, just any updates on deal timing? George Oliver : Yes. So as I said in my prepared remarks, Steve, we are making good progress. As we've said, these businesses are outside the core and represent roughly about 25% of our sales. While they are noncore, they are good businesses that are adding value. So we're remaining focused on maximizing shareholder value. And like I said, pretty much across the board, making good progress. And we'll keep you updated as we continue through with these businesses. Operator : And our next question today comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Just Marc, I think you just alluded to the warranty add back in Global Products. Maybe just -- could you just maybe just flesh that out a little bit why that wasn't considered operating, why that's a discrete item? And then on the fourth quarter guide, I mean, I think the implication is like low-double-digit organic growth in the fourth quarter to get to that mid-single digits, even the low end of mid-single digits for the full year. So is that the intention? Do you actually see a pathway to low double-digit organic growth, even though it's easier comp and still quite a tough bar. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : So let me start first with the Global Product quality issue, which is really not a warranty issue, it really is a quality issue. The reserve really relates to an anticipated remediation action we need to address in a very recently identified firmware issue within some of our legacy products that are sitting in the field. We are currently testing that firmware update within those device, and we are developing a remediation plan for this particular issue, and we'll announce when we are done with the full remediation. There's been no reports of any injuries or damage-related issue with that issue. These kind of problems are very unusual, fairly rare, particularly for field devices like this. Now when it comes to the -- your second part of your question, I'm sorry, I forgot what you asked. Nigel Coe : Yes. The low double-digit implied organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : We see closer to higher single-digit growth for the balance, to be honest with you. That's improved. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then my follow-up question is on the factoring change. Obviously, I think most of us agree that good news to try and clean up the kind of cash generation. Just wondering what other measures you are considering to improve the quality of the free cash flow? And in particular, is there any change in the way that you're sort of approaching the market via JC Capital? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So I don't think we're going to change our approach on JC Capital. This is really a tool we have to strengthen our ability to provide value and attach a service and deepen our relationship with customers as we provide like the full suite with the system, the service and then the financing that wraps around that.  When it comes to our trade working capital, I mean, we had a very strong start of the year. We've improved pretty much every single fundamental there in terms of both receivable management, I would say, as well as our ability to manage our inventory. If you look at our cash collection cycle overall and if you exclude the impact of the unwinding of factoring, we improved our cash collection cycle by about 5 days, which we are very happy with that outcome.  If you look at the guidance we've given for the year on free cash flow conversion, we are maintaining the 85% despite very strong performance in the first half and we see the continuous improvement in our working capital metrics. But you need to understand, we continue to invest in almost attractive organic growth opportunities particularly as we increase capacity to meet the very high demand we see in data center. We are going to be able to make those investments and maintain that 85% conversion but we want to capitalize on that growth we see in the market. Operator : And our next question today comes from Scott Davis at Melius Research. Scott Davis : I just -- I'm looking at the APAC numbers and applied obviously down a fair amount. But fire more flattish -- Fire & Security more flattish. I'm just -- to me, it's -- I would have expected those to be a little bit more correlated. So was there more project selectivity on the applied side? Was that what you were saying, George? I kind of lost the train of thought there for a sec when you were talking about it. George Oliver : No. As we're looking at what we're deploying from a solution standpoint, we're looking at each of the domains and then how we differentiate and how we go to market, being able to capture what we see to be the secular trends around data centers in some of these key end markets. And so it's really just based on the backlog that we've had, how it's converting. And then as we're getting more integrated solutions, you'll see where we get more of a broad-based pickup in all of the domains.  The applied was specifically where in the construction market, as Marc said, we have a big base of business in China. We have the market-leading position. And we've probably seen more of a decline on the commercial side, commercial -- more of the commercial resi side. And so as we have adjusted inventories and as we've been working to now make sure that our resources are allocated more broadly across some of the other verticals, we're starting to see a real strong pipeline to develop. And we're converting that pipeline.  So as Marc said, through the second half, we'll get back to positive orders as well as positive revenue by the end of the year. So we're confident that we're going to recover that. And then, Scott, in general, just making sure that we're with the differentiated solutions that we are deploying, not only are we getting the share, but then from a service standpoint, getting the attached service also. Scott Davis : Okay. That's actually really helpful. And then switching over to data center side. I mean where -- I understand your traditional capabilities and then Silent-Aire gave you, I think it was air-handling capabilities at a higher level. Where are you as far as capabilities at chip-level cooling? And is there anything -- any partnerships that you are forming to address liquid cooling? George Oliver : Yes. So let me frame up data centers because it has been obviously a key area for us as we've been deploying our resources, investing over the last few years because we saw this coming. I'd say that we are well positioned with the cooling technologies and solutions and a lot of that is working directly with each of the key hyperscalers and colos. Now we are partnering with them, understanding from a technology deployment how does that cooling technology then get deployed at the chip and depending on how these are going to be configured. So we're making sure that only with our -- not only with our innovation and investment it's complemented with what we're doing and how we go to market to serve their needs. So we've got the right capacity to meet the increased demand.  And like we said earlier, we're providing more than just chillers. So as we go in with our customers, we've got strong capabilities across air handlers as well as crawls and now we're including the full solution, including controls, building controls, fire and security.  Now as you look at the -- how these data centers are being designed for the future, they're going to be over a gigawatt of power consumption. They're going to need a wide range of air cooled and water cooled to support the exponential growth to support as well as then how it's deployed from a liquid cooling standpoint. So not only are we innovating with hyperscalers and colos on making sure that we are partnering with the right application of our cooling technology that ultimately delivers the most amount of efficiency.  And I would say, Scott, that the investments we've made with R&D and with the world-class laboratories that when we design, build, test and demonstrate performance of the equipment over the entire data center operating envelope, we've engaged almost 100% of the data center operators and working very closely with them, not only with how we differentiate the solution, but as important, as Marc said, we've been investing in making sure we've got the right capacity with the right technology to ultimately be able to support the demand.  We're projecting right now when I said our orders in the first half exceeded all of fiscal year 2023 orders for data centers. And we have a pipeline that continues to support that type of growth. So we've been adding capacity to meet this demand. And I believe we are positioned to see some of these forecasts that projects potentially 50-plus percent growth over the next few years, and we're positioning to be able to serve that. And so I think that is what gives us confidence as we get through the year. We see continued strength in orders. And then as we set up for '23, a good visibility into -- I mean, '25 good visibility in our ability to be able to continue that trend. Operator : And our next question today comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: Marc, just a couple of clarifications to start. First, in terms of the quality issue and confidence that there are not kind of additional reserves going forward. Anything from a time line to remediate? And then secondly, just related to your answer to Nigel's question, when you're saying high single-digit implied growth, was that a back half of '24 comment? Or was that a fourth quarter comment? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : It was a fourth quarter comment, just to clarify. On the quality, we're early in the process. These, again, are very unusual. At this stage, we don't expect anything additional, but we are still reviewing how we are going to develop and deploy that firmware fix. And generally, we're able to resolve those issues fairly quickly within a couple of quarters. So it's not something that's going to drag along for years on because it's critical for us to fix those pretty quickly. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. And then I wanted to ask on Global Products and the applied organic down mid-single digits, the Light Commercial up mid-teens. And when we look kind of a year ago, both had pretty challenging comps. And so just any additional color on the difference in those organic trends in the quarter, regional or otherwise? George Oliver : I would say across our applied, I mean, when you look at I mean both whether it be direct or indirect, and we have a much higher mix as we're differentiating our solutions, our Commercial Solutions business. When you look at the overall applied volume on a 2-year stack, we're up over 20%. And the pipeline right now that we're building is extremely strong because of the secular trends that we're addressing, which is the data center expansion and a lot of the industrial expansion as well as a focus on sustainability. So we've been positioning our technologies globally, regionally to be able to get more than our fair share. And I think we're positioned to continue to see that trend. Operator : And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Sorry to be a bore, but just to sort of try and circle back to the second half assumptions for a second. So I think the segment margin is guided around sort of 17.5% in Q4 and you just did 14.5%. So maybe help us understand that 300 bps uplift is there anything by segment that stands out or they're all up a healthy amount? And just there's a bunch of questions on China and APAC. So just to understand, for the year as a whole, what's the APAC Building Solutions' revenue expected to be down? I think it was down 22% in the first half. So what's the full year assumption for that APAC BS revenue change, please? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So first on the second half and you're directionally correct on Q4 segments. Again, our expectation there and where that margin comes from is really driven by 3 things : the improvement in our mix associated with the growth in our service business. As you know, the service business is much, much more profitable than our system business. It's the volume increase we are seeing both in our residential business as well as our book build business, where orders have been progressing well throughout the second quarter and as we enter the third quarter.  That volume provides a benefit in terms of absorption and productivity within our manufacturing and provides good leverage and allows us to get there. And then we've addressed our base cost earlier in the year, and we set ourselves up for the ability to leverage the P&L a little bit better than we've been able historically, and that's why we are comfortable at where we are.  Now for the full year on Asia Pac, I would say if you look at where we've guided, we're assuming a mid-teen negative growth for the full year and the sequential growth that you can see will therefore be positive in the fourth quarter in order to obtain that weighted average performance for the full fiscal year '24. Julian Mitchell : That's a very clear answer. And then just my second question, just to understand that data center exposure a little bit better. I think George, you gave a very clear explanation of the products and the focus points for JCI. But in terms of sort of revenue, the $2 billion of sales you mentioned, George, I think that's a 2023 number, is it? And just to understand maybe any sense of how those sales split across kind of HVAC, BMS and Fire & Security? George Oliver : So I mean when we look at the $2 billion, that's -- that was the 2023, as you said. And then we're obviously seeing a significant pickup on that this year. So as we said, for the first half, we're already at the level that we were all of last year. Now a significant amount of that is being driven by the cooling technologies across our not only our air cool, water cool but also the application of Silent-Aire. So we've got a good pick up there.  What we're doing is making sure that as we're working with the hyperscalers and colos that we're now going to market in more of an integrated solution that ultimately creates a lot more value in how that solution is put into service. So you can imagine with all of the technology integration that we've been having with these providers, it is really differentiating what we're actually doing.  And so -- and we've already seen a big pickup in air handling and crawls and now we're seeing the pickup in building controls and then more recently, now fire. So you're going to start to see a more broad portfolio that ultimately is going to be delivered through those solutions. And then what's important is that we're getting all of that connected and ultimately put into service. So the ability to be able to then provide service through the life cycle. So we're making really good progress here, Julian. Operator : And our next question today comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : You mentioned need to see services growth acceleration in the back half as part of the key to getting to the high end of the guidance. I mean it was up 13% right, in terms of orders in 2Q. What kind of acceleration do we need to see? And what's your visibility to that? George Oliver : Well, what we need to see is where we were. I mean we were pacing high single digits pretty consistently in the last couple of years when the cyber incident hit in the first quarter, that really set us back -- set the momentum back because it hit a number of our systems that ultimately execute not only from orders, but ultimately, how we fulfill service. So we are regaining the momentum as we said. Across the globe, I would say we're executing well on that strategy, recovering from that lost momentum. Obviously, the focus that we have in becoming a commercial solution, building solutions provider is now being able to leverage our entire installed base, being able to differentiate the outcomes that we can deliver on maximizing the value over the life cycle for our customers.  And then the way we were the most impacted was North America, and that's our largest geography. We did make progress in Q2. That's continuing, and we're going to see that continue to accelerate Q3 and Q4. And then we get back to really strong sustained high single-digit, double-digit service growth on a go-forward basis. You might -- Marc talked about this on EMEA/LA and APAC, we've already recovered. We're already back seeing double-digit orders and growth in EMEA/LA, and we see accelerating orders in Asia Pac. So it's a matter of just the time line and our ability to be able to get that same momentum back in North America. Noah Kaye : I think you mentioned in the remarks that applied and controls orders in North America were up 50%, nearly 50%. So please confirm that. How concentrated was that in data center given the focus or whether it's more broad based? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So that 50% was around HVAC applied as well as control for North America, North America in terms of orders this quarter. So a very, very strong momentum. A lot of it came from that data center, some of the key colos and key hyperscale are accelerating their orders. But what's also incredible to see is the pipeline continued to grow even after a lot of orders are coming in. So we think that momentum is going to continue building, and we are very comfortable about achieving those targets. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : George or Marc, can you update us on your progress in terms of improving your margin in EMEA/LA? I know you've talked about all the changes you made in terms of project selection. Would you say your progress in line with what you expected? And what's your confidence level that margin should reach double digits by the end of the year? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : No. Good question, Andy. So first, I want to start by saying we are pleased with the performance in EMEA/LA in the second quarter. While it's not yet at par with the regional peers, the rapid progress we made both on backlog growth and margin in such a short period of time is a testament to the transformation and the application of that one end-to-end operating model George was talking about. I'm very proud of what the regional and functional teams have been able to achieve by leveraging further that integrated global business solutions operating model.  And as you look at the balance of the year, we have 2 strong tailwinds in EMEA/LA. The first one is, we see a continued strong mix that is provided by the robust growth in service you saw in Q2. And the second one, we continue to improve the order margin rates that are coming in our backlog. And that's really coming from an improved go-to-market strategy we talked about as well as better commercial discipline. These 2 factors combined with the fact that we've rightsized our base cost structure provide us with great visibility to achieve double-digit segment margin and maintain it there towards the end of the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then George, I just want to follow up on your commentary regarding your pipeline of opportunities in China. It seems like maybe you're undergoing more of a transformation from, call it, traditional commercial markets there to nontraditional markets. I don't know if that's a fair characterization, but maybe you could comment on that. But you also sound confident regarding an order of sales recovery by the end of the year. So maybe you could elaborate on the risk that the recovery could slip. George Oliver : Yes. So a year ago, as we were rebuilding up to the second wave of cyber, there was a hole, and we were rebuilding our volume there and rebuilding inventory. And if you look at year-on-year in Q1 and Q2, there was a ramp last year. And obviously, we have a tough compare to that. What I would tell you is we are broad-based. So we're not just in the commercial resi, but it's we're in broad-based all of the end markets. What I would tell you, market back, we know where the opportunities are, how we're positioning, how we're deploying each of our technologies and differentiating the solutions we go to market. We're back really building, so building not only a very strong pipeline, but we're converting at historical rates as far as how we're converting to orders.  And so that is what gives us confidence that with the backlog we're building, it's going to -- as it converts here, third and fourth quarter and then the revenue that really we get back to on a positive basis by the end of the year. We're very bullish on the business. It's -- we've got a great product. We've got a great facility there. And it's just making sure that as we reset with the inventory build that we had last year that were reset to where the market is going to be and ultimately how we capitalize on more than our share. Operator : And our next question today comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So I have a couple of quick clarifying questions. Just the $33 million product liability charge that you took this quarter, just a product quality charge you took this quarter, like what portion of your product portfolio is that actually touching? Just again, I just want to get some comfort around ring-fencing that number. And then also on the factoring program, what -- how should we be thinking about the impact from factoring through the remainder of the year? George Oliver : On the product, Joe, that's in our fire detection business. It's a sensor that ultimately, as Marc said, firmware in a sensor that the legacy product as far as when we look at all the products that's being produced today, it's totally compliant. So it's making sure based on what we've seen with a couple of failures, making sure that we're addressing that in the legacy product. And as Marc talked about, that's how we kind of estimated what that potential could be. And we're going to be disciplined in how we actually go about remediating that. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : On the factoring and the finance charges, yes, the unwind of the factoring will provide some benefit in the balance of the year. What's offsetting part of that is the PFAS settlement. As you know, we are going to settle $750 million for the half, as well as slightly higher interest rate environment than we had originally anticipated. But I think the factoring and the cost benefit that it provides gives us confidence that our guidance is at the right level. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's both helpful clarifications. And then my other question was really just around the -- what's happening with Global Products mix going forward because it seems like the guidance is baking in a pretty good improvement in Global Products margins. And I'm just curious, like is global products expected to turn mix positive in the second half? I know it was a headwind this quarter. Just any color on that would be helpful. George Oliver : When you look at Global Products historically, when you're in a more stable environment year-on-year, I mean, last year, we had a tough year because as we were really working down backlog and have built up with all of the supply chain disruption. And then when lead times went back to normal, obviously, we were a shortfall of orders and orders coming in through the year. As Marc said, we're back to normal flow of orders to fulfillment. We've got our lead times down back to where they were. And so we're seeing good flow, right, from market demand, orders, building backlog and then converting. On the margin side, you can imagine when we were disrupted, there was significant cost with that disruption. And so we have been significantly improving the productivity as we've recovered. Now with normal flow and stability, we're getting significant conversion cost productivity. And then with the continued volume increase on the conversion in the second half, that will lever really nicely in the second half from a margin standpoint.  And then what we've done across the company as we went through this cycle, we've taken out significant G&A. And so as we've addressed that across the board and gone to one operating system, we're going to start to see much better leverage on our G&A structure. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : And then I would add on mix. What you saw in the quarter, that negative mix of $80 million Global Products really came from the volume challenge we saw in APAC, that really led to an under absorption Global Products. Outside of that, the general mix of the product is neutral to the margin Global Products. What you get is really the lift, George just talked about. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : A couple of questions, obviously, on the Q4 guide. And I know there's kind of some squiggles around the growth rates and everything. But it does seem to me that if Q3 is a low single-digit organic growth and Q4 is high single digit 8% or 9% and the year is closer to 3%. So maybe just address that, is that kind of what you're thinking you're kind of progressing towards the very low bound of what we might call mid-single digit for the year? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : I mean I would think of Q4 in the teens, 10% of the growth. And I think you're right, there's a step function change between Q3 and Q4 from a growth standpoint. But I don't think it's that challenge if you see the momentum we see in orders. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. So just to clarify that, as somebody asked you if it was low double digits, and then you said high single digits, but now you're saying low double digits. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : High single digit to attain the midpoint of where we are guiding. To get to the high end, you would need that 10% growth rate in Q4. Jeffrey Sprague : I see. Okay. And what was the nature of the goodwill charge in the quarter? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : That goodwill relates to an impairment charge we took on our subscriber business. That subscriber business sits within our EMEA/LA segment. And it came really from a combination of small actual result delta versus an internal forecast we had but it was mostly associated over time the effect that the Argentinian peso had in the mix of results of that particular business. Then I'll remind you that, that impairment is noncash in terms of what the charge relate to. And it has absolutely no impact on our ability to deliver free cash flow for the balance of the year. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just a really quick follow-up just on cash. So the PFAS settlement you're expecting to go out the door here before the end of the year, and are you expecting any insurance recoveries against that in 2024? Or that's more of a kind of protracted negotiation with your insurers? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. The PFAS settlement will be in 2 tranche. The first tranche coming shortly and the second tranche later in the year. I do not want to speculate on the timing of the recovery of the cash from the insurance. I would tell you we have significant insurance with about 20 insurers. We are doing everything we can to recover as much as we can. We have a line of sight of recovering a very material portion of the settlement. But at this stage, I'm not being able to pin down an exact time line on that recovery. Operator : And our next question today comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : I had a couple of questions on the divestments. First, I was curious if you could characterize the level of interest from potential seaters. If you could talk about maybe the aggregate tax basis. And if you could also speak to any potential dis-synergies and if you have any quantification of that, that would be helpful. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : I mean I don't want to overspeculate on exactly where we stand. What I'll tell you is that there's different combination of divestiture structure that we are looking at, and we are simply trying to optimize shareholder value and our ability to return a very large portion of that, the proceeds associated with the divestiture back to shareholders. The divestiture will require like any material divesture for us to take action around our base cost and our central cost of operating. We have good line of sight to action that. We've already started planning around it. Gautam Khanna : Can you speak to the timing or the tax basis of the assets, so we can... Marc Vandiepenbeeck : At this stage, it would be very hard for me to pin ourselves down on the timing. We're doing everything to accelerate the process. Depending on how we structure the divestiture, the tax effect will be very different. So at this stage, that's giving you a very wide range of the different options that are being considered from a divestiture of structure, I don't think would be helpful. But again, we're doing everything to maximize shareholder value here. Operator : And our next question today comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital. Deane Dray : I just want to take another pass at this -- the Page 5 data center exhibit, which is terrific. And especially the pie chart at the bottom that does show all the different products and services that JCI offers. And it goes back to Julian's question, it would be really helpful, just really rough size some of these categories. So if I said cooling and group chiller, space, cooling and monitoring as 1 bucket and then fire and security is the other 2. Would rough numbers be 60% cooling and then 20% each for fire and security? Would that be the right neighborhood? George Oliver : Yes, I would say it's about -- it's in the range where about 2/3 would be chillers, and the others would be -- air handling would be crawls, would be fire and security, all of the other systems that ultimately support the deployment of the cooling technologies. Deane Dray : Great. That's really helpful. And just I think a lot of people think of the security side, just the 3 levels of access that most of these data centers have. But if you look at just about every row of these data center rooms, there are cameras and fire suppression on every row. So this is part of your offering, correct? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : It's absolutely part of the offering and those very complex solutions. We are really set up with our engineering and our product offering to really leverage that market. And that's where we see the pipeline continuously growing as the complexity and the structure of those data center continue to increase. George Oliver : And Deane, I think it's important to note also from a service standpoint, when you go to one of these sites and you see the installations and all of the equipment, both across the domains, what is really strong is our footprint, providing the service. And so how our teams then are positioned to support all of these large facilities that are being put up. And so that's where we see significant opportunity to be able to deploy our system so that then from a life cycle standpoint, we have the domain and expertise deployed to be able to support these large operations. Deane Dray : Terrific. And just one last quick one for Marc. I know it's still early, but when would be the earliest we might hear some reset working capital metric targets? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : I think we're still early stage. As you mentioned, we are looking at next year and where we're going to deploy our resources from a growth standpoint. I think as we close Q4, we'll probably be able to give you a strong view on where we are going to land for next year as well as our long-term algo. But I don't think we'll shy away from the comment I made last time that 85% to 90% free cash flow conversion plus, although the long term is really where we should be thinking. Operator : And our next question today comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question. We're looking at macro data and it seems that labor inflation is picking up back again. How are you guys thinking about your contract structure, particularly on the installation side? In the face of inflation, are you sort of giving any thought -- you've clearly cleaned up the balance sheet was factoring. This is great. Are you guys giving any thought about sort of resetting the contract structure to maybe adjust for the fact that we -- in a higher inflation, labor inflation environment for longer? I know it's a big, long question, but I would love to hear your thoughts. George Oliver : No. What I would say is when we went through that high inflationary period, obviously, that exposed a lot of our weakness because we were in a low-inflationary period for so long. We've built very robust pricing and costing pricing, and then from a selling standpoint, focusing on value. And so as we plan long term now, we're factoring in. We're, from a costing standpoint, anticipating higher than level -- higher than the kind of the market forecast on inflation.  So we've been factoring that in and then making sure we have contracts that ultimately gives us the opportunity to be able to recover longer term on some of the longer-term contracts. So we've been -- and that's been deployed across the globe. What I would say, we have very robust pricing, costing as we do deal reviews and making sure that we're going to be positioned to be able to achieve the margin rate that we're booking. So we're now in a situation where we're booking much higher margins, and then we're executing at or above those margins on a go-forward basis. And that's a big deal. And that's a big part of our -- in our solutions business, our ability to be able to deliver stronger margins going forward. Andrew Obin : Great. And then just a follow-up question. If we look at the bookings on data center, clearly got a lot of attention, growing 50% plus. What's happening? You guys have kindly provided a very nice pie chart of your end market breakout. Can you just highlight what else is doing well? And if there are any headwinds within your key end market verticals on applied? George Oliver : I mean what I would say it's broad based. When you look at our applied business, right from -- and we have the full portfolio of technology, whether it be water-cooled chillers, air-cooled chillers which obviously is focused on data centers. The Silent-Aire packaged cooling solutions that we deploy.  So when you look at what we see, it's not only data centers but it's the industrial expansion that we see pretty much globally. It's education. It's been some government. And more important, there's a broad-based demand addressing some of the challenges that our customers are having, achieving their sustainability goals.  And so we can go in and ultimately package a solution. And then with that, be able to get significant savings that actually then, in some cases, get a decent payback. And so it's broad-based in our applied business across end markets. Certainly, data centers is a key driver. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Commercially, Europe, I made a comment in the opening remarks around industrial refrigeration growing really fast. There's multiple pockets of the market that are growing, probably not as fast as what we're seeing in data center, which is really unprecedented and continue to see that pipeline growing, but we see pipeline growth across the board. George Oliver : Across the board. And then what we've learned is technology wins. And so we've been investing multiyear in our technology differentiation. And as we're applying that into the key verticals, that's what ultimately is delivering the value. Operator : And our next question today comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Just a couple of real big picture questions for me. First one, you talked about some investments in, I guess, product development, et cetera, but also some capacity. Is there any reason to think there'd be a step change in that as we go to next year? In other words, are there some projects that kind of get done? Or is that a good run rate? George Oliver : When you look at our reinvestment, and we've been talking about this for multi-years, applied, when we look at our applied cooling, we're a significant leader in that space across the globe, and we've been investing in multigenerational technologies. And if you would go to our technology center in New York, Pennsylvania, our JADEC center, you would see that. So we've been significantly elevated reinvestment over the last number of years, which has ultimately positioned us with the competitive advantage we have today in data centers. So that's going to continue. And then on the capacity side, certainly, we've -- from an investment standpoint, we've been -- we've got great factories across the globe and then now we've been scaling those factories to be able to now support this data, what's being driven by data centers, but the data center demand.  And so we saw it coming. We saw it coming 2 years ago and we started that expansion. But obviously, that has accelerated over the last 12 months. And we're strategically engaged with each one of the hyperscalers and colos and understanding exactly what is going to be built here, multi-years, and we're positioning to make sure we have the right -- as I said earlier, the right technologies with the right capacity to then be able to support their build out. And so all of that has been factored in our current run rate of reinvestment. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to George Oliver for closing remarks. George Oliver : Yes. Let me wrap up. I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and I'd like to end the call by highlighting the strong foundation of operational excellence at Johnson Controls and our value creation framework. I think we demonstrated with the disruption in Q1. And then as we've now come back and created momentum in Q2, gives us a lot of confidence that we're beginning to see not only the results, but now more important, the opportunity to be able to accelerate here as we go forward.  Our results demonstrate that we're both capturing the secular trends around sustainability and healthy buildings and that we do have the right strategy and operating system in place that ultimately not only meets our customers' needs as a preferred partner, but certainly elevates the ability to be able to create returns for our shareholders. So we are very excited about what is to come and what we see now playing out. We believe that we are poised to continue creating value for our shareholders, and we all look forward to continuing engaging with all of you here over the next days and weeks as we continue to execute.  So with that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you, sir. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful evening. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Johnson Controls Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Lucas : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls fiscal third quarter 2024 results. The press release and related tables that were issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver and Chief Financial Officer, Marc Vandiepenbeeck. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls\u2019 website. I will now turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u2019s begin with Slide 3. We were very pleased to deliver fiscal third quarter results that exceeded almost all of our targets. Organic sales growth was 3%, which was in line with our guidance of low single-digits. We delivered a robust 150 basis points of segment margin expansion to 17.9%, which exceeded our guidance of 17%. We are also proud of our free cash flow generation during the quarter, which was more than $500 million higher than the comparable period one year ago. Service led the way, once again, with 9% growth, which continues to validate our transformation efforts. It is encouraging as we continue to build momentum toward meeting our full year financial objectives. Orders grew 5% during the quarter. We expect some quarterly fluctuation in our order pattern, given the strong demand for our data center solutions. With the investments we have made over the last few years in technologies for data centers, the launch of a dedicated organization and our one-of-a-kind offerings, we remain well positioned in this fast-growing segment, with solutions that are clearly resonating with customers. We have built a leading position in data centers in North America, due to a unique and compelling customer value proposition. As our customers expand internationally to meet the rapidly growing demand for data centers, we grow alongside them as they choose to partner with Johnson Controls around the world. Our backlog grew 10% in the quarter, as we continue to see demand for our solutions, both systems and services. The growth in orders and backlog give us increased confidence in our ability to continue delivering sustainable long-term growth. As part of our ongoing business transformation, we announced two divestitures, our Residential and Light Commercial HVAC business and our Air Distribution Technologies business. These two transactions represent roughly 20% of current sales. At the same time as our earnings results, we announced this morning that I informed the Board it is time to initiate our CEO succession plan. Following recent significant milestones in our portfolio transformation and as we move to the next phase of growth, I believe that now is the right time to begin the process of identifying the next leader the new Johnson Controls. Accordingly, the Board has engaged a nationally recognized search firm and begun a comprehensive search for the company's next CEO. Once my successor has been named, I will remain Chair of the Board to help facilitate a smooth transition. I am confident in our position as Johnson Controls enters its next chapter, and I remain committed to supporting the full team as we work to ensure Johnson Controls realizes its full potential. Along with the initiation of the company's succession plan, we also announced that as part of our ongoing Board refreshment efforts and following a constructive dialogue with Elliott Management, Patrick Decker has been appointed to our company's Board of Directors effective immediately. Patrick brings experience to our Board, and having led a transformation of his prior company, and his appointment reflects our commitment to continuously refreshing our Board to ensure the skills and experiences of our directors appropriately reflect our ongoing transformation. Lastly, before moving to the next slide, we are tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.66 to $3.69 from a range of $3.60 to $3.75. Marc will give additional details later in the call. We have made tremendous progress on our business transformation into a simpler, higher-growth company, positioned to deliver more consistent, predictable results. Turning to Slide 4. We have made good progress on simplifying our portfolio. Most recently on July 23, we reached an agreement to sell our Residential and Light Commercial HVAC business to the Bosch Group in an all-cash transaction. The transaction includes 100% of our North America Ducted business and our 60% interest in our Global Residential joint venture with Hitachi. The total transaction is valued at approximately $8.1 billion, which results in approximately $6.7 billion of consideration to Johnson Controls. We are expecting net proceeds of approximately $5 billion after tax and transaction expenses, the majority of which will be used to accelerate returning capital to shareholders and also address leverage. The Residential and Light Commercial HVAC transaction is expected to close in approximately 12 months, subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We expect to report the operating results of the business in discontinued operations beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, on June 18, we agreed to sell our Air Distribution Technologies business to Truelink Capital. The sale of Air Distribution Technologies is also an important step in simplifying our manufacturing footprint, with the elimination of nearly 30% our manufacturing facilities. Taken together, these two transactions represent significant milestones in our portfolio transformation. We are now even better positioned going forward as a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings. Our efforts in turning into results and the value of our transformation is coming into focus. Slide 5 presents a pro forma look at the new Johnson Controls, representing composition of our company going forward. Following completion of the two divestitures described earlier, we will be a simpler, higher growth company focused almost exclusively on our engineered solutions offerings. These solutions include commercial HVAC, fire, controls, security and services, forming the smart building trifecta of energy-efficient equipment, clean electrification and digitalization. The benefits of our transformed portfolio include an enhanced margin profile, less complexity and a more focused operating model. In addition, these divestitures further increase our exposure to the fast-growing data center vertical to nearly 10% of sales from 7% as of fiscal year 2023. We expect this percentage to further increase over time given the robust demand we are seeing in this key vertical. While we will continue to look at opportunities to further enhance the portfolio, we believe that the largest elements of the portfolio transformation are now complete. Turning to Slide 6 to discuss our focused business model and how we plan to deliver more consistent, predictable outcomes for our customers and maximize value for shareholders over the life cycle of buildings. Johnson Controls has a unique value proposition for our customers that directly translates to shareholder value creation. Our ability to serve our customers over the lifecycle of the building allows us to deliver safe, healthy and sustainable buildings. As a simpler and more streamlined company, we are now better positioned to leverage our integrated domain expertise, coupled with our extensive branch network to significantly expand margins. Our journey with the customer provides system and service solutions that maximize the opportunities around the lifecycle of the asset, delivering outcomes to the customer that save energy, reduce emissions and optimize building lifecycle costs, all while improving the overall occupant experience. Most importantly, our ability to drive direct outcomes ensures that we have long-term customers that use several of our services, which creates a compounded impact for the customer and for our shareholders. In fact, $1 of systems revenue has the potential to generate up to 10 times the revenue over the lifecycle of the solution. It all starts with our local teams supported by our centralized engineering teams to provide operational excellence throughout the construction of the new building, starting with the product and technology development through the installation of the new systems. This grows the installed base. Throughout system deployment, our teams are building customer intimacy and confidence in our team to ensure we are creating linkage with our service offering. We have redoubled our focus to build this initial relationship and greatly improved our operational execution over the past few years to drive an enhanced margin profile and grow service. Simply put, service and maintenance delivers recurring revenue for us, and this provides resilient revenue throughout economic cycles. Moving to Parts & Repairs. Our service organization is digitally enabled and unlocks additional value by collecting data from the connected equipment within the building. Leveraging this data lets us detect issues before they occur, leading to reduced downtime and cost savings for the customer. The last part of the cycle is the building retrofit, including the monetization and technology refresh of existing systems. We work closely with the building owner to discuss lifecycle planning and the prioritization of the building needs. We have found this to be the perfect opportunity for Johnson Controls to sell additional domains. By compounding the effects of this cycle, we are able to deliver solutions to our customers, leading significant margin expansion. The ongoing transformation of our portfolio into a quality pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings means that we can service these buildings to deliver outcomes that matter. Accordingly, we are extending our journey with our customers, while capitalizing on attractive opportunities in the market. Together, this delivers value across our stakeholder base for customers, employees and for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Marc. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a summary on Slide 7. Total revenue of $7.2 billion grew 3% organically, as strong high single-digit service growth more than offset continued weakness in China's System business. Segment margin expanded a robust 150 basis points to 17.9%, as we delivered another strong quarter of productivity and converted our higher-margin backlog. Adjusted EPS of $1.14 was up 11% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.04. Operations contributed $0.18 of the growth in the quarter, as improved productivity and the conversion of higher margin backlog more than offset higher corporate costs related to additional IT investments, cybersecurity enhancement costs and increased centralization of functional costs. Below the line, we saw favorability from a lower share count. As we continue to build a more consistent and predictable business, we are pleased with the strong adjusted EPS performance in the quarter. On the balance sheet, we ended up the third quarter with approximately $900 million in available cash and net debt decreased to 2.3 times, which is within our long-term target range of 2 to 2.5 times. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow improved approximately $700 million year-over-year to $1.3 billion. We remain on the path to driving higher free cash flow conversion more consistently. Let's now discuss our segment results in more detail on Slide 8 through 10. Beginning on Slide 8. Organic sales in our Global Products business grew 3% year-over-year, with price offsetting a modest volume decline. Commercial HVAC remained a bright spot for the business, growing mid-single digits against a tough comp of mid-teens growth a year ago. Fire & Security declined low single-digit, as a decline in fire suppression more than offset growth fire detection and security video surveillance. Industrial Refrigeration grew approximately 20%, with strong double-digit growth in both North America and EMEA/LA. Overall, Global Residential grew mid-single digits in the quarter. Global Ducted Residential grew low single-digits as strong double-digit growth in APAC more than offset continued declines in Europe. In conjunction with improvement in North America residential market, our Global Ducted Residential business grew 10%, with strong double-digit growth in both North America and EMEA/LA. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin expanded 240 basis points to 24.5%, as positive price cost and improved productivity more than offset mix headwinds from ongoing weakness in China. Now moving to Slide 9 to discuss our Building Solutions performance. Order momentum remained healthy with 5% growth in the quarter. Overall, service order grew 12%, with a broad-based growth across the region. Systems order grew 2%. North America offset decline in APAC. Organic sales increased 4% in the quarter, led by service growth of 9%. Systems revenue grew 1% as decline in APAC more than offset growth in North America and EMEA/LA. Building Solutions backlog continues to remain at record levels, growing 10% to $12.9 billion. Service backlog grew 7% and system backlog grew 10% year-over-year. Let's discuss the Building Solutions performance by region on Slide 10. Orders in North America increased 5% in the quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in both systems and services. As a reminder, our quarterly order growth can fluctuate based on the timing of certain large projects, particularly in the data center vertical. We remain confident in our competitive position in the data center and our pipeline remains quite robust. Sales in North America were up 8% organically, with continued strength across HVAC & Controls, up over 20% year-over-year. Overall, our system business grew 9%, while service grew 6%. Segment margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year to 15.9%, driven by the continued execution of higher-margin backlog, improved productivity and solid service contribution. Total backlog ended the quarter at $9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. In EMEA/LA, orders were up 11%, with over 25% growth in service. Systems, although were flat as we continue to remain focused on driving higher quality growth with higher margin and improved cash flow conversion. Across the portfolio, we saw strong double-digit growth in controls, fire and security. Sales in EMEALA grew 8% organically, with broad-based growth across the portfolio, Momentum continues to build within our service business, up 15% year-over-year, driven by strong double-digit growth from both our recurring and shorter cycle transactional businesses. Our system business grew low single digits, led by strength in controls. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points to 10.3%, driven by the positive mix from the growth in service and the conversion of higher-margin system backlog. We've made tremendous progress in improving the profitability in EMEA/LA as well as mix of higher-margin service. A more disciplined funnel in systems gives us further confidence in continued momentum in margin improvement. Backlog was up 12% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. In Asia Pacific, orders declined 2%, as we have focused on deploying resources to the most attractive part of the market and remain selective on the jobs we court and ultimately, book. Given our strong installed base in the region and our continued focus, we saw high single-digit growth in service. Sales in Asia Pacific declined 19% as the systems business continue to be impacted by ongoing weaknesses in China. Our service business grew 8% in the quarter, with strong double-digit growth in our recurring revenue contracts. Segment EBITA margin declined 220 basis points to 11.7%, as weakness in China offset positive mix from our service business. Backlog of $1.4 billion declined 12% year-over-year. Now let's discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 guidance on Slide 11. We entered the fourth quarter with solid momentum, led by our resilient service business and continued demand in our North America system business. Our margin reach backlog remains at a historical level, and our Global Products book-to-bill business have stabilized and returned to growth. We are introducing fourth quarter sales guidance of approximately 7% growth, as strong demand in North America and EMEA/LA is somewhat muted by one more quarter of slower recovery in the system business in China. Global Products momentum is expected to continue as our book-to-bill orders remain positive throughout the third quarter and the tough comparison in China base. For the fourth quarter, we expect segment EBITA margin to be approximately 19% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.26. For the full year, we are tightening adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.66 and $3.69. We now expect organic sales to grow approximately 3% and segment EBITA margin to expand approximately 110 basis points. Our working capital metrics continue to improve, and our free cash flow performance year-to-date has been strong. We continue to invest capital in attractive areas, including data center manufacturing expansion and ongoing ERP consolidation. While this will be a slight headwind, we expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 85% or better for the full year. With our recent announced planned divestiture, I want to highlight some financial details and future reporting on Slide 12. As George mentioned at the beginning of the call, we were extremely pleased with our announced sale of the Residential and Light Commercial HVAC business. This came just a few weeks after we announced that we tend to sell Air Distribution Technologies business. Together, these two transactions represent hopefully, 20% of the sale and the majority of portfolio we have previously highlighted as non-core. We expect to report the Residential and Light Commercial business as discontinued operation with our fiscal fourth quarter results and will provide our official fiscal year 2025 guidance on a continuing operation basis. While the two transaction would be dilutive to EPS prior to any cost offset, we have actions in place to address the stranded cost and we are working on accelerating some of these actions prior to closing. Through the combination of share repurchase, debt pay down and restructuring, we have a plan in place to fully offset the stranded costs. We will provide more details when we report our fiscal fourth quarter results. Before we open up the lines for questions, I want to conclude with a summary of our recent transformation on Slide 13. We have spent the last few years transforming the company into a comprehensive solution provider for commercial buildings, and this continues to be a differentiator for Johnson Controls. We took a major step in simplifying the portfolio with our two recently announced divestiture, and we believe one operating model will enable us to deliver more consistent, predictable results. We operate in many attractive markets, which allows us to build our backlog with margin rich jobs that have a service still throughout the lifecycle of building. Our systems backlog, coupled with our resilient business, positions us for sustainable and continued margin expansion. As our margins continue to improve, coupled with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation, we would expect double-digit EPS growth. As George mentioned earlier, the result of our portfolio transformation is now a faster-growing, more profitable, less complex and more operationally focused Johnson Controls, and we are excited for the next chapter. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Scott Davis at Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, George and Marc and Jim. And congrats, George, on the announcement. George Oliver : Thanks, Scott. Scott Davis : I wanted just to dig in on the data center kind of impact on backlog a bit. I would assume that a big chunk of that backlog growth is data center, but maybe you could give us some color on the impact of materiality that growth in that vertical? Thanks. George Oliver : Yes. Let me give you a framework, and then Marc can talk a little bit more about the -- how it's being built in backlog and converting. We're already now -- we said in the prepared remarks that we're about 7% a year ago. When we look at the business today, it's about 10% of sales on a pro forma basis. It continues to be very strong. We're working across all of the hyperscalers colos. We've got a global team now, making sure that our leadership technology and all of our domains, that we're positioned now to be able to provide the best solutions globally. So that pipeline is continuing to build. And I think as we think about our orders and backlog, certainly, this is going to be a higher mix of backlog playing out. In many cases, it is a multiyear backlog. And for us, we look at the next 12 months as far as how we book the backlog. And then as we think about the growth, Scott, going forward, this is going to be strong double-digit growth in 2024. It's going to be, for this year, a strong double-digits and continuing to accelerate over the next few years given the work that we're doing. Marc, do you want to talk about the mix a bit? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So Scott, if you look at that growth in backlog of 10%, almost $13 billion in backlog. The mix remains consistent year-over-year because a lot of those data centers, as George mentioned, are multiyear. There is clearly more data center work in that $12.9 billion. But that mix will continue to evolve more towards the data center as we churn that backlog. We will maintain our definition of backlog as what we see in revenue for the next 12 months. And with that consistency, you'll see a change over time, more tilted towards the higher growing segments of the market. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And I'm just looking at this Slide 6 and the 10 :1 numbers on service and digital versus the OE side. I don't remember seeing that before. Maybe you've put it up, and I just have missed it. But is this kind of a theoretical number? Or you actually have expectation that these are achievable type ratios going forward? George Oliver : The algorithm that we've been working for multi-years now as we've been building the service business depends on -- it starts with the installed base, Scott, relative to not only what we're putting into the installed base, but going after the existing installed base. When we can, right out of the gate, get connectivity and ultimately, that first level service and then now with OpenBlue and connectivity with the use of data, the significant value proposition that we add on to the -- what would be historical maintenance and break/fix. And so as we now are seeing that over the last couple of years, we're getting to that level of multiple relative to what we see on a run rate basis that over the lifecycle can achieve that level of revenue. So that is real data with customers that we've had connectivity. We've had installed base connectivity. We're using data, and we're now adding on additional services. That is absolutely real. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : And that revenue multiplier evolves based on market vertical and product line. So -- we've tried to lay that out on that chart. HVAC is a multiplier that's a little lower than 10 turn, while you go to Security Controls and then Fire provides the higher level of multiplier over the life cycle of the product. So depending on the market vertical, depending on the product, that multiplier expands, but this is a real experience data that we've looked through over the past few years, and we believe we can continue to deliver that that through operating model we've now implemented. George Oliver : I think it's important, Scott, that we're -- it's really tied to outcomes versus just the traditional buy-the-drink type service. And so as we're now converting not only the technology and the product, but with our OpenBlue and data that, that really changes the game. And then from an attrition standpoint, it significantly reduces the attrition, which continues to build our base going forward for service going forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell at Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. Good morning. Congrats, George, on a very good run. George Oliver : Thanks, Julian. Julian Mitchell : In terms of -- I suppose just first off, I wanted to start with the overall kind of top line growth outlook and sort of two elements of that. I think one is, the total company this year is growing about 3%. And when we look at the sort of the sort of the go-forward business, $22 billion revenue base or so, is that 3% rate abnormal in any respect when you're looking at the backlog and assuming no big changes in interest rates or U.S. policy kind of as we're looking ahead? And related to that, the Fire & Security business is something that you've known for a long time. It looks like sales are flat there this year, and that will be about 45% of the go-forward revenue, I think. What do you think Fire and Security can grow at sort of medium term? George Oliver : Great question. So let's start first with the 3% for the full year. Really, we had a lot of cyber headwind in the first quarter that if you did somewhat that growth rate year-on-year. So I'll tell you for longer-term algorithm, 3% is absolutely what absolutely what -- not our expectation would be. It'd be closer to mid-single digits, and that's really on the basis of a mid- to high single-digit growth in our service business and a mid-single-digit growth into our systems business overall. And so those fundamentals driving a better mix overall are different depending on the different product line. And right now, HVAC is benefiting from a lot of tailwind coming from decarbonization, data center and other market verticals that have really propped up the growth there. And you're right. We've seen a little bit of softness overall in the market on Fire & Security this year. We are seeing, particularly in our book-and-bill business, some sign of recovery, and we think can maintain that mid-single-digit growth over time for that business. As the service and recurring component aspect of that business will continue to be higher than mid-digit target. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nigel Coe at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Hi. Thanks, good morning. George, you had one hell of career, so congratulations and good luck with your next steps. Yes. So just on that topic, do you have a time frame in mind for this succession? I know you obviously want to find the right person to do search. But any timeline? And then maybe just touch on Patrick's appointment to the Board. Obviously, you know Patrick very well. What sort of skills kind of made him the right person to the Board? And I wonder if maybe he's under consideration for the next year? George Oliver : The timing of this, I mean, we've made great progress on our portfolio with the moves we've recently made. I think it's clear that we have a lot of confidence now in the strategy playing out, and we're starting to see that -- the results from that. And we've also put a strong leadership and team, and I'm very confident of their capabilities and the work that they're doing that's going to position the company to continue to be successful. Now the Board -- working with the Board, we've had succession plans that we've been building over time. So that's well underway, and we're looking at both internal and external candidates. The Board is engaged directly with a national recognized search firm and making sure we're also looking and developing at our internal candidates. So it's hard to find the timeline, but we are moving forward. And as far as myself, I couldn't be more committed and more passionate and energized relative to where we are committed to make sure that we see through a very smooth transition to my successor, and then I'll continue on as Chairman of the Board. So that's kind of where we are. We'll keep you up-to-date as we make progress through the year and through the remainder of the year and keep you updated. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning and congrats, George. George Oliver : Thanks. Steve Tusa : The free cash flow in the quarter was pretty good. How do you see that playing out in the fourth? I know 85% conversion would suggest. I think somewhat of a step down in the fourth. And you're already -- on a trailing basis, you're already very close to 100% conversion. So just curious as to how sustainable this good result is. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Great question, Steve. So you're right, we saw a really solid improvement year-on-year, and the momentum year-to-date has been quite strong. We're seeing working capital fundamentals continuously improving and continue to trending very positively. The work we've done on lowering inventory and improving our SOE S&OP process have allowed us to really drive overall more predictability to the working capital. As far as that 85-plus conversion for the year, we continue to invest aggressively in parts of the market that are attractive to us, particularly increasing the capacity in our data centers as we expand more lines in our factory in North America and elsewhere as well as continue to involve the investment in our ERP landscape. We do believe that the momentum allows us to probably do better than 85%. And structurally, in over term, we'll be able to continue to improve on that. But as of today, I'll tell you, 85 plus is where we're comfortable. Steve Tusa : And then just as far as the guide is concerned next year, anything -- any details that you can give as far your strategy, there's obviously going to be a bit of a dislocation moving these things to disc ops with a lag in the capital deployment? How do you plan to address that on earnings? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes, we'll start providing guidance next quarter on continued operation you're right, there's going to be a little bit of noise, but we are very comfortable that the overall algorithms we've committed to for next year will hold through as we navigate to that continued operation. As you know, some of that residential, like commercial business had solid cash flow. But the momentum that we see in our core business, thanks to that singular operating model, is really providing strong tailwinds that will allow you to continue to improve on our free cash flow conversion and our overall free cash flow performance. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks. So in the release, there's a call out of the gain, the significant gain on some of the insurance recoveries from that AFF settlement. Can you just walk us through where your expectations are in terms of actual cash outflows relative to the $750 million settlement that was previously disclosed now that; you've gotten some benefit from insurance and maybe talk through the timing of those outflows? George Oliver : Let me just frame this up here. We did -- just going back, we reached a settlement with plaintiffs relating to the PFAS liability. The -- this settlement obviously resolved a significant amount of our PFAS liability. Just also, you might recall that, when it comes to July 2023, that we're going to discontinue the production of the sale of our fluorinated firefighting foams by June of 2024, which is what we've done. So that's behind us. And we have a significant amount of insurance through more than 20 insurers that is applicable to these claims. And so that's the framework. And you've seen that we did received 351 from our insurers. And maybe, Marc, you can talk about as we -- what we expect going forward. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So from a timeline, no, we took the charge in Q2 for $750 million. That's part of the settlement. And in the third quarter, we had received from the first few agreements with a venture of about $351 million. So we recovered almost half right off the bat. And those payments will go back to the water provider according to our agreement. There's more payments that are going to come and come in over the next few quarters, and we believe that we're well covered from an insurance standpoint, and the net effect overall will be de minimis. The timing between recoveries and we see -- in payments may slip from one quarter to the other. But overall, we think we're in good shape there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks and good morning, everybody. Congratulations, George, on the succession announcement. Marc, I want to -- just one quick clarification on the 4Q guide. So as discontinued ops out of the 4Q guide? And if so, what is the impact of that? And then going forward into fiscal year 2025, how should we think about GP margins at this point? You guys put up a great number this quarter. Just trying to understand kind of like the puts and takes of the moving pieces with some of the portfolio divestitures. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Sure. Thanks, Joe. The fourth quarter guide we just gave is for the full payment of the company. We'll start breaking it down at the next quarter. So that guide really holds together, with perspective that we are going to continue to see sequential improvement, both for the business that we have contemplating to divest as well as the core of our businesses. Now if you look at the global product margin and if you reflect on the year, Global Products really has benefited from improved processes from an SOE S&OP process that really drove massive improvement in our material handling and our or inventory. And that improved inventory management, created massive absorption benefit as well as productivity and net-net better conversion costs. That means that any incremental volume you saw created good leverage and solid leverage in that business. Now that performance in Q3 that we see continuing improving in Q4, as you look into 2025, we'll go back to a more regular seasonality, right? So you'll see that the first half of the year performance more in mid-teens, given the volume that businesses in the first six months of the year. And then I think we are now very comfortable seeing that business clocking in the 20s in the second half of the year as a natural seasonality and volume ramp up in the second half. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Congrats, George, and congrats to all of you on the portfolio announcements over course of the quarter. Just curious if you can outline on ADT, the anticipated proceeds, as well as any revenue margin kind of EPS related to that exit. And then separately, just wanted any clarity on destock this year. What you saw during the quarter? Confidence that you think that's behind you? And any sizing of the overall headwind Global Products in 2024 from some of those destock pressures? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. Let me start with ADT, and then I'll give some color on destock. But George, you can add more. So that business, we signed on June 18, we expect to close the transaction actually this quarter. We've not disclosed the financial terms of the business because it is a smaller transaction and really not that material. I think what's important to remember is this is really part of our simplification journey. We really eliminating, I'm sorry, about 30% of our manufacturing footprint, but we're also eliminating a whole series of SKU and complexity. This is a very commodity business, and accessory business and it's evolved a lot over the past decade since we acquired that business. But it's an important step in our journey as a prepaid provider. And the net effect of that divestiture after we buy back some shares is immaterial to the overall company. On destocking\u2026 Joe O'Dea: Apologies. Please proceed. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : On destocking, I think we see a stock level getting back hopefully to normalization. There are some pockets of the market that are still and simplifying a little bit their stock level. But overall, I think that for most part, that large destocking is behind us. And we feel very confident, particularly when product have been refreshed that we have a new norm and a new standard on our stock levels, and the distribution seems to be holding up pretty good. George Oliver : Yes, being very familiar with these businesses, when you look at what we've done around, Marc mentioned it, as it related to productivity with material planning and the like, and then the work that our team has done really simplifying our SKU base, we've done a really nice job now, not only reducing the inventory, but really decreasing our lead times. And so I think we're well positioned now from a commercial standpoint, to be able to pick up volume because of our short lead times while we're continuing to reduce inventory. So we're back to where we were prior to this ramp-up because of all of the disruption in the supply chain. And I feel confident that now on a run rate basis from a growth standpoint, we're starting to see the come back and we're doing it with less inventory. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Good morning, everyone. And George, good luck on whatever is next. Just want to come back to the portfolio changes. Obviously, you're not going to report Q4 or 2024 on the basis with which you guided given things going to disc ops. So maybe you could just actually share with us, given where your guidance stands today and what you're doing on stranded and other costs, what the reset 2024 base looks like on an equivalent basis relative to your current guide? And then when you do have the proceeds to deploy, should we expect you to kind of solve to your same leverage ratios that we see today kind of split between share repurchase and debt reduction to kind of maintain the same leverage? Or will you do something different with how you structure the balance sheet? Thank you. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Got you, Jeff. So on disc ops, this is not changing any of our commitment and is actually -- we feel very comfortable with where we've guided from a full portfolio as well as where we think the continued operating business will go. As far as the use of proceeds and what we plan on doing, so we expect the transaction to close in next 12 months. And we plan to return most of the net proceeds to shareholders through a share repurchase program, very similarly to what we did a few years ago when we divested our Battery Power Solutions business. As far as addressing our leverage, it will very much depend on the timing of the closing. We're thinking 12 months, but it could go three months either way. And so we could easily see ourselves growing into our existing debt level and not have to redeploy much or we could see ourselves in the transaction close much, much quicker than we anticipating having to address some leverage at that point. Our goal is to remain committed to our investment-grade rating, and we'll work with the agency, depending on the timeline as to what's most appropriate to be able meet that commitment. And I'll leave it at that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. George, congratulations. George Oliver : Thanks, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Could you update us on what you're thinking regarding the ability to start growing backlog in earnings in Asia Pac? And what your expectations are for Q4 bookings and backlog? Backlog was up slightly sequentially in Q3. And I know you've talked about expecting a bigger uptick by the end of year, while telling us that China is still muted. So do you still see bookings beginning to accelerate in Q4? And do you still see recovery in that region in FY 2025? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : No. Great question. And you partially answered it. Yes, we continue to see sequential improvement. There is a slower recovery than we had initially anticipated. So one of the reasons we tightened the guide for the year and why you see a revenue growth a little lower than we anticipated, but that momentum has continued to build. And the order intake we saw in Q3 was sequentially a good improvement from Q2, and we see that sequential improvement continue in Q4. While we expect one more challenging quarter in the fourth quarter here, we're still probably declining revenue year-on-year in the low single digits. That of the momentum is going to turn positive positioning as well as we enter 2025. So we absolutely see that business recovering in 2025, particularly on a year-on-year compare. The comps are going to become easier given the challenging year we just went through. The backlog, as you mentioned, has been sequentially improving over the last few quarters, and we continue to redeploy the resource in this most attractive part of the market, but we continue to remain very disciplined in the type of job and counterparty we deal with in the market in China as that market continues to be pretty challenging. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning and George, congratulations. George Oliver : Thanks, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question, just maybe a little bit more detail. You highlighted a more disciplined approach in EMEA/LA systems. What did you do? And what's your ability to apply this approach elsewhere in the portfolio? George Oliver : Great question. So the discipline that we've put in place is really part of our overall operating model. And operating model really started as we refined it in North America a couple of years back. And you can see North America really benefiting from that discipline over time and that focus. There's really two things that are happening. We centralize more the decision-making process as which vertical and which markets we really approach. And we really focus that commercial organization towards those parts of the market where we see a very much attractive margin as we can sell value and we have customers that are interested in our product and see value over that cycle, but also parts of the market where you see a stronger service attach. And when you do that, you're able to actually drive modest growth in the system business but a much larger growth in our service business as that service attach yields better outcome overall. So that's that operating system has been really fully deployed in North America. That's probably where the maturity is at the highest. EMEA/LA still going through that. I see EMEA,LA closing the gap with its regional peers. Asia had a strong operating model. I think the market moved on us very fast, and we are repivoting as quick as we can. But you'll see, as I mentioned on the prior question, you'll see APAC repivoting very quickly, and that operating model maturing across the board outside of North America, including in EMEA/LA. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and add my congrats to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Deane. Deane Dray : I don't think you've given much detail here, but could you share us with any of the economics of the divestiture of air distribution technologies? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. As I mentioned, Deane, while this is a critical step in our simplification journey, the financial terms are not disclosed because they're really -- it's really a smaller transaction and not very material for the overall value of the enterprise. We struck what we feel is a very attractive deal for the enterprise with trolling capital. We're hoping to close that business very, very quickly and hopefully within the next few weeks. Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. And then second question, George, there's been a lot of interest in your peers regarding not just data center, but liquid cooling technologies and data center. You've seen your peers make direct investments in technologies, businesses. Is this something that you all are looking at as well? You've got certainly components that are part of these technologies, but there's a big developing opportunity high growth, and it seemed like it would be a good fit. George Oliver : Absolutely. We're incredibly well positioned with all of our hyperscaler and colos customers. And from an R&D standpoint, understanding what their next generation is. How do we leverage our -- what we would say is a leadership portfolio with a lot of IP? And then as we go to liquid cooling, with the cooling distribution unit at the end of -- it's still going to require a lot of the cooling technology that we deploy on making sure that we're going to be positioned either producing those units and/or partnering to make sure that we have the full solution and how position with our hyperscalers and colos. And so we see this playing out as an incredible opportunity for us and one that we've been investing in not only in our core technology, but our application of that technology with overall liquid cooling. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Hi, thanks. Good morning and congrats, George. George Oliver : Thanks. Good morning, Gautam Gautam Khanna : I wanted to ask on that CEO search, what -- George, from your perspective, like what kind of attributes are you looking for from whoever succeeds you? What do you think they need to bring? George Oliver : Well, I mean as we think about the company and the simplification of the company, it's important that we bring a lot of domain expertise and industrial expertise. We're a company that is a product technology company. We're a service company and how we deploy that technology. Certainly, we're solutions in how we actually go to market. So there's a lot of experiences there that we'd be looking for to complement. As we did the Board refreshment with Patrick, just to talk to that a little bit, we are constantly looking for qualified board candidates and how we think about refresh and succession. And Patrick is a fantastic addition, a world-class executive with experience transforming Xylem, and similar experience going from an industrial products company into an advanced technology service solution enterprise. So as we think about CEO succession and the like, obviously, strong operating experience, strong domain experience and the ability to be able to take the incredible foundation that we've built here to the next level, leading the new Johnson Controls. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. And I'll add my congrats to George on the announcement today. Just wanted to ask about orders. So you guys mentioned lumpiness around data center may be contributing to the 5% organic growth this quarter. I guess how do you think about the potential opportunity for order acceleration from here based on what you're seeing in the pipeline today as we try to calibrate expectations for the next few quarters? Thanks. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : As you know, we try to shy away from providing guidance on all those. But what I can tell you is you're absolutely right. We see lumpiness in the orders, particularly coming from the data center vertical. That also means that there's going to going to be a quarter where you're to see very large order, and we continue see an increased pipeline in that particular vertical. That gives us confidence that you will see a pretty large order quarters over the next few coming quarters. This particular last quarter, we have a tough compare year-on-year. We had very solid orders, particularly in the in the data center vertical third quarter of last year. But again, that pipeline remains self, and that lumpiness will probably not go away anytime soon. George Oliver : And I think just to add on to that, when you look at the value proposition that we bring to data centers with our portfolio multi-technologies, in the way that we've been building out capacity to be able to serve our customers as they achieve their growth, these become multiyear agreements. And so as we're positioning, you can get very large orders multiyear. And that's what we're seeing as we're partnering and making sure that we're positioned to get more than our fair share bringing our technologies and capabilities with the full solution to our customers globally. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning and congrats to George. Just wanted to come back to the fourth quarter guide. So 19% EBITA margin, I wanted to understand your level of visibility there. Is this something that you're converting out of backlog and you have line of sight to? Just any color towards that 60% incremental margin. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : We absolutely have strong visibility to it. And if you look year-on-year, for sure that 19% looks pretty heavy with 250 to 300 basis points year-on-year improvement. But now if you look at it sequentially, when we went from Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4, jumping from almost 18% 19% is absolutely part of that sequential run rate. The same fundamental we saw from Q2 to Q3 having a strong backlog, having really our book-to-bill business both in the field and our Global Products continuing to driving more volume. And the comments I've made on Global Products and the incredible work that's been done there to take care of the base cost and conversion cost, allowing us to really drive a lot of bottom line benefit for small volume increment, gives us very strong confidence that we can achieve that margin rate in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to George Oliver for any closing remarks. George Oliver : Thank you, operator, and I'd like to thank the entire Johnson Controls team for their incredibly hard work and dedication in getting us to where we are today. Our transformation into our pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions commercial buildings is substantially complete, and we're well positioned to now deliver long-term sustainable value for our shareholders as a simpler, higher growth company. We know we're on the right path as our strategy is already delivering results, and we are looking forward to this next chapter for our company. I am proud of the growth Johnson Controls has been able to achieve and couldn't be more excited about where we go next. So with that, operator, that concludes our call today. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful rest of the day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Johnson Controls Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today all participants\u2019 will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Lucas : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls fiscal fourth quarter 2024 results. The press release and related tables that were issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver and Chief Financial Officer, Marc Vandiepenbeeck. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls\u2019 website. I will now turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I would like to start today's call by taking a moment to acknowledge and thank all of our employees for their contributions in delivering strong quarterly results. We also made significant progress in our transformation to simplify our portfolio and become a pure-play provider of comprehensive solutions for commercial buildings. Today, we are a faster-growing, more profitable, simpler company. Let's begin with slide four. We ended fiscal 2024 with momentum, delivering double-digit organic revenue growth, robust margin expansion and 96% adjusted free cash flow conversion. Order growth of 7% in the year was led by data center demand and contributed to our record backlog, which ended the year at $13.1 billion. Our differentiated solutions to enhance efficiency and sustainability in commercial buildings continue to resonate with our customers across the key verticals we serve. For example, we extended our leading position in cooling for data centers with orders for the full-year more than doubling the sales we delivered. In fact, we are now seeing key customers placing multi-year orders in the hundreds of millions of dollars to provide cooling solutions. Our pending sale of the Residential & Light Commercial to Bosch is progressing and we expect the transaction to close in the fiscal fourth quarter. Today, we are introducing our fiscal 2025 guidance from continuing operations of $3.40 to $3.50, which Marc will give more details on later in the call. We believe we are well-positioned going forward to deliver long-term shareholder value. Our business transformation is almost complete and we are benefiting from more consistent, predictable performance. Slide five presents a pro forma look at the new Johnson Controls, representing the composition of our company going forward. Today, Johnson Controls is a leader in building solutions, dedicated to solving our customers\u2019 needs for energy efficiency and clean electrification. Our innovative approach and commitment to sustainability are driving us forward, ensuring we provide cutting-edge solutions that meet the evolving demands of the market. Johnson Controls unique customer value proposition directly translates to shareholder value creation. Our multi-domain presence enables us to serve our customers over the building life cycle, while also delivering safe, healthy and sustainable solutions. This means we can meet the needs of our customers all over the world and deliver cost savings and efficiencies for them. We are confident we are well-positioned with the integrated domain expertise in an extensive branch network to deliver greater value to our customers. In turn, we believe this will lead to sustained top line growth and significant margin expansion. As part of our path towards simplification, we have now deployed one end-to-end operating model that we leverage globally across all of our key verticals. This is positioning us with a unique capability in serving buildings and leveraging our digital expertise to expand our connected services model. We are improving productivity on behalf of our customers, helping them maximize outcomes for their buildings. Whether it is the fast-growing data centers, expansion of campus housing and labs in higher education or solving needs across healthcare from hospitals to outpatient facilities, we deliver engineered solutions across all of our key verticals. This enables us to realize the benefits of this model over the life cycle of our solutions, ensuring sustained value creation. Johnson Controls is better positioned than ever before to help customers create safer, more sustainable buildings, while also maximizing the occupant experience. Our strong finish to fiscal 2024, coupled with our record backlog, reinforces our confidence that Johnson Controls will continue to lead globally in building solutions. With that, I'll turn it over to Marc. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide six. Our performance in the fourth quarter highlights continued strong execution across our portfolio. Our single end-to-end operating model provides the visibility needed to drive consistent and predictable results. This was evident in our performance in the quarter as organic revenue grew 10% and segment margin expanded a robust 260 basis points to 18.6%, led by substantial improvement in both EMEALA and Global Products. We delivered another strong quarter of increased productivity, while converting our higher-margin backlog. Adjusted EPS of $1.28 was up 22% year-over-year and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by $0.02. Our operational efficiency contributed to the majority of the growth and more than offset additional corporate expenditure, primarily related to IT investments. The strategic allocation of resource ensured we are well-equipped to support our growth and safeguard our infrastructure. Below the line, net finance charges were higher, while EPS benefited from a lower share count. Overall, we achieved significant EPS growth and we are pleased with these results. On the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $600 million in available cash and net debt decreased to 2 times, which is the lower end of our long-term target of 2 times to 2.5 times. Our adjusted free cash flow conversion of 96% was a strong improvement year-over-year and substantially exceeded our previous commitments. This trend is reflecting of our improved fundamental in working capital management. Adjusted free cash flow of $2.4 billion improved nearly $800 million year-over-year. For the full-year, we returned $2.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Let's now discuss our segment result in more details on slide seven through nine. Beginning on slide seven, our Global Product business had a strong finish to the year. Organic sales grew 8% as price remained positive and we delivered 5 points of volume growth. Low double-digit growth in HVAC, both commercial and residential, offset declines in Fire and Security and Industrial Refrigeration. Strength was broad-based across the region, led by double-digit growth in North America. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin expanded an impressive 700 basis points to 28%. We have made tremendous progress over the past year in improving our operational efficiencies, leading to substantial margin improvement experienced in the fiscal second-half. Turning to slide eight and nine to discuss our Building Solutions performance. Building Solutions delivered a solid performance this quarter, underpinned by sustained order momentum, double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. Additionally, we increased our record backlog, which remains at historical levels and underscore the strengths of our business model. Our outcome-driven solution offering continued to resonate with our customer across many of the attractive vertical we serve, with strong growth in data center, government, healthcare and high ed. Orders grew 8% in the quarter, led by mid-teen service growth, while system order grew 5%, again, a tough double-digit comparison. Orders in North America increased 7% in the quarter with low-teen growth in service led by strength in Fire and Security. System orders grew 3% against a tough comp. In EMEALA, orders were up 14% with over 20% growth in service, while system order grew 9%. Across the portfolio, we saw strong double-digit growth in HVAC controls and industrial refrigeration. In Asia Pacific, momentum is building as orders rebounded from the past few quarters of decline. Overall, orders grew 6%, led by 9% growth in service. Our pipeline of opportunities within Building Solutions remain healthy as we continue to build on the momentum of the past several quarters. Our Building Solutions segment entered the quarter with a record backlog, which provided a solid foundation, enabling us to capitalize on high demand for solutions and services. Organic sales increased 11%, led by double-digit growth across both systems and service. Our sustained service growth sets us apart as we continue to deliver differentiated lifecycle solutions for our customers. Sales in North America were up 16% organically with continued strength across HVAC and controls. In EMEALA, organic sales grew 10% with double-digit growth in controls, security and industrial refrigeration. In Asia Pacific, while sales declined 5%, we saw sequential improvement. This improvement was driven by a stronger backlog and our resilient service business. The margin profile within our Building Solutions segment continues to strengthen due to the enhanced productivity, favorable service mix and the improved operational efficiencies while executing our higher-margin backlog. By region, EMEALA adjusted segment EBITDA margin expanded 370 basis points to 11.5%, driven by improved productivity and the positive mix from growth in service. In APAC, adjusted margin expanded 70 basis points to 14.2% as positive mix from our service business offset a decline in systems business. In North America, adjusted segment margin declined 40 basis points to 15% related to mix, as systems grew faster than service. Building Solutions backlog remained at record level, growing 7% to $13.1 billion. Service backlog grew 12% and system backlog grew 6% year-over-year. Let's discuss our first quarter and fiscal 2025 guidance and the impact of discontinued operation on slide 10 and 11. We are entering fiscal 2025 with momentum and our record backlog offers great visibility into the new year. Our service business remains well-positioned and provides a favorable mix to margins. As we look to our guidance for fiscal 2025, we will be presenting both the first quarter and the full-year on a continuing operations basis. After moving the Residential & Light Commercial business to discontinued operation, our fiscal 2024 continuing operational adjusted EPS is $3.21 per share. For the first quarter, we anticipate organic sales growth of mid-single digits, adjusted segment EBITA margin expansion of over 100 basis points to approximately 14.5% and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.57 to $0.60, representing 24% to 30% growth. While the first quarter is against an easy comparison, the overall fundamentals are strong entering the year. For the full-year, we expect organic sales growth of mid-single-digits which is consistent with our long-term growth algorithm. Adjusted segment EBITA margin are expected to expand over 50 basis points. Our adjusted EPS range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share represents 6% to 9% growth. We expect free cash flow conversion of 85% or greater, consistent with the performance of fiscal 2024 on a continuing operations basis. We continue to target returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect the Residential & Light Commercial divestiture to close during the fiscal fourth quarter. Consequently, we have not included any capital deployment from sale proceed in our fiscal 2025 outlook. Additionally, we are committing to a multi-year restructuring plan to address stranded cost and further right-size our global operations, following our previously announced portfolio simplification actions. We anticipate incurring roughly $400 million in expenses over the next three years, resulting in expected annual cost savings of approximately $500 million. Similar to the timing of deploying capital from the closure of the residential and light commercial divestiture, many aspects of this restructuring plan will depend on the timing of the close of the transaction. We are confident this factor will drive sustained success and create long-term value to our stakeholders. While fiscal 2024 was a year of significant portfolio transformation, we are better positioned as a faster-growing, more profitable, simplified company. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we continue our strong momentum entering fiscal year '25. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Mr. Coe, your line is open. You may ask your question. Nigel Coe : Oh, good morning. Sorry, I had the mute button there. Thanks for the question. So the -- I think, Marc, this question for you, the mid-single digits, how do you see that across the segments? I'm assuming APAC probably is a bit above that. So just curious how you see mid-single digits across the segments and any color on the 50 bps, again, across segments? And I just want to verify. Obviously, the restatements are happening within Global Products and it looks like the clean EBITA margins in '23, '24 were 25.7% and 27.1% ex Hitachi and York. So just want to make sure those are right numbers? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes, good morning, Nigel. A lot to cover there. So first on growth, we had a very strong growth quarter and very happy with the results. But we're entering the new year with a record backlog of about $13.1 billion. And I think we continue to target that footprint of mid-single digit, granted, we have a lot of confidence given the level of backlog we have. As you know, the timing of some of the larger projects can impact quarter-over-quarter growth rate. And I think we are seeing some very strong tailwind in the core vertical. Now, if you think by segment, how that growth rate in mid-single digit is going to break down, we think APAC is going to be slightly above that overall guide for the enterprise and really on an easier compare, and as we showed in the fourth quarter, we're starting to see sequential order growth for that business. And the rest of the businesses, North America, EMEALA or Global Product, will be at or just slightly below that overall guide throughout the year. Now when it comes to margin, and I hear you both on the total margin and the continued operation basis, Global Product margin, what we covered in the last quarter when we gave guidance for Q4 is, with the base cost and how we dealt with that base cost within that business and a lot of the disruption from a supply chain standpoint being behind us, a little bit of volume was going to go a long way and you saw that in Q4. And I think that's going to remain true as we enter fiscal year '25. We've been driving significant operational efficiency that are structural and fundamental across both the manufacturing base and the supply chain. And you can see that that Global Product business has benefited and we continue to see benefit from an improved absorption, and that leverage will continue to provide easier comps year-on-year. Now that business has some seasonality to it. So the first part of the year will be a little bit softer than the second part of the year, but that margin we feel is very well set for fiscal year '25. Nigel Coe : And just wanted to make sure I've got the [Technical Difficulty] for the Global Products margins in fiscal '23-'24. So any help there would be good. But I'm just wondering, George, maybe if you could comment on the CEO succession, what progress has been made identifying the right person to replace you when you retire. George Oliver : Yes, good morning, Nigel. We understand there is significant interest in the ongoing CEO succession process. At this time, we don't have any new updates to share. Now you can be rest assured that the Board is actively considering an impressive list of candidates, both internal and external, and we do expect to have an update in the first-half of calendar 2025. Operator : And today's next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. George Oliver : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Sorry, just wanted to better understand that in the first quarter -- I'm not quite sure if the guide you just gave was for the year or the first quarter, but I mean with orders trending up [8%] (ph) with your organic being so strong this quarter and the comp not looking particularly hard, what is the reason why first quarter is only up mid-singles in organic, specifically? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So if you think about the timing of some of those larger orders and how the revenue, particularly the big verticals that we are benefiting from, whether it's large decarbonization projects or the data center project, we had very strong performance in the fourth quarter in those particular vertical. And that quarter being the busiest season for our service business, we also had very strong performance there with double-digit service growth. While that's probably sustainable over the long-term, there's some quarter-to-quarter volatility to that. And so mid-single-digit growth for Q1, granted on an easier compare versus last year is where we feel comfortable, really coming from places here. North America will see some strong performance, probably a little bit higher than that mid-single digit, but both EMEALA and APAC, as well as Global Product will be right in line with that mid-single digit or slightly lower. And I think that's where we feel comfortable and where the growth is going to come next quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then can we just get for the refresh portfolio, what percentage of revenue now is data center than you expect in '25? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Consistent with what we said prior, give or take a little bit, our data center exposure is about 10% of our revenue and continues to grow faster than the rest of the portfolio with very solid double-digit growth sequentially, at least for the foreseeable future. Steve Tusa : Okay. And [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, George and Marc and Jim. George Oliver : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Yes. So -- hi. When you get a big data center order and you do an install, does it typically come with a similar kind of attachment -- service attachment rate in OpenBlue that you would have in the building or is it -- is there a different kind of attachment rate there? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. Very good question, Scott. The service overall is slightly better than our portfolio from an attach rate standpoint. And the digital services really depends on the type of customer. That particular vertical is very sensitive to digital solution and is very cautious about how they deploy it. There are some customers that have a little bit more cutting-edge than other expecting to have full connection, some others would like to manage that on their own. But the service attach rate for that business is very, very strong and better than the rest of the portfolio. And it's changed a lot, I'll tell you, over the last, probably, five or six years, where that vertical probably five or six years ago was not very high service attached, where a lot of those key customers had -- I've taken the view that they wanted to self-serve some of that. I think what they've learned with the complexity and also the quality of our capabilities, we are really able to differentiate ourselves and provide a full suite of service with guaranteed outcomes for those customers. George Oliver : Scott, what I would tell you, the short-term, the trend is significantly up because as you look at these data center sites, we have hundreds of units deployed on these sites and we have dozens of our technicians that are supporting these operations. And we made the case that when we have connectivity, number one is not only are we more efficient in how we serve them, but we can be very proactive in making sure we're maintaining the overall operation. So the trend is actually significantly up because of that. Scott Davis : That's helpful, guys. And just now that you've had another quarter of seeing big orders come through and such, how would you compare kind of the pricing power in that vertical to the traditional building segment? Is it a little bit better because it's more complex, or is it more comparable because, honestly, everything in Applied isn't that easy? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. Well, there's some parts of Applied that are slightly commoditized, but most of Applied is engineered solution that require kind of a strong partnership with the customer and allows us to deliver value to that customer and drive good pricing. The way we've approached the data center vertical is we've really embedded our engineering resource with those customers to try and solve really higher the value chain, the problems they're trying to solve for when it comes to heating, cooling, as well as the way they control the fire and security of their building. So across the board, if you compare, probably the margin of those particular vertical businesses vis-a-vis the rest of the market is probably slightly more than what you see. Now, it's going to continue to evolve as a market over the next few months and years. We've developed differentiated solution from our peers that allows us to command a little bit more price and we're expecting that to continue to drive a better margin profile than the more traditional Applied equipment business. George Oliver : And I would add to that also on the product side, we've been ahead of the curve with our reinvestment in product. And so, as we've been differentiating our product and getting positioned for the next generation of data centers, I believe that we're positioned extremely well with that value proposition. So we believe that the margin profile that we've been able to achieve with what we've done to date is going to continue to improve going forward. Operator : And today's next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to understand first off on the restructuring announcement that you made. Maybe help us understand the phasing of the $500 million of sort of cost-out savings and how much of that is reflected in the 2025 operating margin guide. And similarly, on the, I think 400 or so of costs for that program, how much is in the free cash flow guide for the current year? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Now, great question and good morning, Julian. So as with any significant change to a business portfolio, like the divestiture of the Residential & Light Commercial, we've been pursuing opportunities to refine our business structure and our operating model better to really facilitate how we deploy resource in a simpler, more clear and quicker to market. And we've been driving many different aspects of that restructuring as we go through that. As you know, we still have a business to run until the transaction closes. Some of the timing of that cost is going to be hard to predict because it's very attached to the timing of the closing of the transaction. But as any restructuring, we expect the restructuring costs to come ahead of the restructuring benefit. So the $400 million will come ahead of the $500 million. It's not a one-to-one perfectly timed structure. As we looked at the free cash flow conversion guide for the year, we've included a substantial amount of that $400 million into our guide for fiscal year '25, which is kind of one of the large structural headwinds we have for the year, alongside some CapEx investments and our traditional delta between effective tax rate and cash tax rate. there's a large portion of restructuring, probably right about half of that, that is included in our guide for fiscal year '25. Operator : And today's next question comes from Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask about North America Building Solutions margins and kind of the outlook into '25. So clearly a lot of pressure on the segment in Q4 on that systems mix. But it sounds like that's supposed to kind of normalize into the first-half of the year, I guess, really through fiscal '25. So can you just kind of talk about what that can mean for Building Solutions margins as that mix headwind goes away and what's in the guide for that? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Now, thanks for the question, Chris. Great question. Yeah. It is -- I wouldn't say it's material margin pressure, but you saw North America in the quarter growing extremely rapidly on the back end of those larger -- on those larger projects. And those larger systems projects come at a margin that is slightly lower than what the service business is able to drive. So even though the team was able to drive in North America a very solid service growth, it was not enough to compensate, if you like, for the mix effect of those large data center and new energy projects and decarbonization projects that the team completed in the quarter. And so if you look forward, the valuation you're going to get quarter-on-quarter on those projects will remain, but the headwind that it creates will tail out, especially as we move towards the year because the net effect of service and the service attachment rate, as all the projects come live and we start revenueing, the service on this particular system project will start supporting an improved margin rate. Operator : And today's next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys, good morning. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. Marc, maybe just kind of focusing on Global Products for a second, I think you guys said a little volume goes a long way, but these are margins that candidly like we haven't seen before. And so, maybe just kind of dovetailing that question that Nigel had earlier as well, was there anything kind of one-off in the margins this quarter? And then really just trying to understand what the right jumping-off point is for 2025. So what was like the pro forma Global Products margins for 2024, so that we have that locked in as we think about next year? Thank you. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Very fair question, Joe. So no, there's no really one-timer or mix effect of any particular one deal that really helped that margin. It's really back to the structural work we did -- the team did in Global Product over the past 12-months. That really set up that business to be able to drive significant operational efficiencies. If you want to think about that business from a pro forma continued operation margin, I would say, take the 20% margin rate and I would say the first half of the year will be on one side of that -- of that margin rate and the second half of the year will drive well above that 20% margin rate. And I think that business now, that is being operating much more efficiently and much more focused as well, we'll be able to continuously perform at that level, if not better. Operator : And our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed. And also your line is open, you may ask your question. And Mr. Bystricky, your line is open. You may ask your question. Mr. Sprague, your line is open. You may proceed and ask your question. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, maybe just kind of a multi-part question on some of the non-operating items here, so to speak. First, just on corporate, it's kind of interesting that it's nominally roughly the same dollars, 430 million-ish in both cases. I thought the stranded friction would show up there. So maybe some color on that. And also what's taking the tax rate down to 12%? And Marc, I think some of the global changes have you believing your tax rate would actually be drifting up and instead we're stepping down here. So maybe you could give a little color on that. And just finally, the share count seems to just imply you're buying back stock kind of pay-as-you-go as the cash comes in the door over the balance of the year. Is that correct? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yeah, I'll start with that last part. You're absolutely right. So first, I'll start with our guide, the $3.40 to $3.50. Our guide does not contemplate any deployment at all of proceeds associated with the sale of our residential business. So it's just a regular pay-as-you-go return to shareholder100% of our free cash flow. Now, on your couple of questions, the corporate expenses. It's flat year-on-year. You would have expected it to be a little higher. We've done a lot of work to lower that cost, but we've made also a couple of substantial investments in hardening our cybersecurity and IT infrastructure, as well as we are left with those stranded costs that while we want to take action on them, we need to pace and time some of those action with the timing of the divestiture of the Residential & Light Commercial business. We still have a business we got to take care of and we need to continue to provide support for that business. Now on your question on the continued -- on the CO tax rate, on the continued operation tax rate, we are seeing 100 basis points of pressure year-on-year. So if you look at pure CO rate, we were at about 11% in fiscal year '24 and it's stepping up to 12%. You're right, I had indicated that I felt we were probably going to see a little bit more pressure than that. And as we were seeing the Residential & Commercial transaction happening, we started planning around that and prepare for that particular headwind. And that allows us to manage a little bit better the rate for 2025. Now in all transparency, as you look at 2026 and beyond, we see quite a bit of pressure on that rate because of global mean tax rate and the tax reform globally that have happened. We probably see 400 to 500 basis points to that 12% for fiscal year '26, as the planning and the closing of that transaction on Residential & Commercial will be behind us. Operator : And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Good morning, Andrew. George Oliver : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Just a question. Can we just get more color on Applied sales in North America by key verticals? I know their focus is on data centers, but what are you seeing elsewhere? What stands out positively or negatively? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : There's four or five verticals that are really supportive. Of course, data center is one of the critical ones. But whether it's healthcare, hospitals, where we're seeing a strong pickup, there's still a lot of activity associated with manufacturing and new energy, the re-onshoring of some of the battery manufacturing has been a great help to our business. And then finally, overall, as the commercial real estate market is softer, but a lot of that portfolio is rebalancing as people repurpose some of the spaces associated with the post-pandemic reallocation of that office space, it creates opportunity across the domain, not just for Applied to be able to drive new opportunities throughout the market. Operator : And the next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Good morning, Deane. George Oliver : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey. Questions about the free cash flow guide. Just for fiscal '25, kind of talk us through what the impact is of taking Resi and Light Commercial out structurally lower working capital, but just how does that play out and support the 85% conversion? And then I noticed you put it in twice the longer-term goal of 100% conversion. Marc, just structurally, what has to change to get you to that threshold? Thank you. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. Just to be clear, I -- what was in the prepared comment is 100% free cash flow return to shareholder, not 100% free cash flow conversion. Now, longer term, I'm willing to tell you that we will be better than 85%, but we have some structural headwinds that we got to continuously deal with. From a trade working capital, it's not a lower trade working capital. So trade working capital is going to continue to be a tailwind and support an improvement in our free cash flow conversion. However, there's two or three structural headwinds that become a little bit more weighted to our free cash flow conversion. As we separate from the Residential & Light Commercial business, that had some structural benefits or were accretive, if you like, to free cash flow conversion if you look at the whole company. As you know, we were owning about 60% of that joint venture with Hitachi, that is now in discontinued operation. That means we would actually get 100% of the free cash flow versus where the earnings landed overall. And the timing of the dividends was not always aligned with the free cash flow generation of that business. But outside of the discontinued operation, on a continued operation basis to get to 85%, there's a couple of structural headwinds. The first one is the restructuring we talked about earlier with Julian, as well as we continue to make substantial CapEx investment to continue to increase our data center capacity with the goal to doubling it and maybe beyond as we continue to see opportunities in the market. And then finally, the delta in the effective tax rate, right, between our cash tax rate and our effective tax rate is -- continued to stay at that 8% to 10% level. I see that coming down as we see pressure on the effective tax rate, but I don't see that much pressure actually on our cash tax rate. But for '25, as we look at it, this will be -- this will be a headwind. So you see improvement in trade working capital with the headwind associated with restructuring CapEx and taxes overall. Operator : And the next question is a follow-up from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Steve Tusa : Got it. Hey, sorry about that. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : No problem. Steve Tusa : Well, I just wanted to -- I just wanted to make sure my math was right on this Global Products margin. I mean, we have about -- just backing out continuing op sales from what you guys reported this year is about $5 billion in revenues for that kind of for RemainCo at Global Products. Is that right as a starting point? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : The RemainCo of Global Products is probably going to be a little bit less than $5 billion, I would say. Steve Tusa : Okay. So then if I divide that by the 14 -- whatever number that you gave as a continuing ops for Global Products profits, I think that's in the slides. Like that's a -- that's a high-20s margin, not 20% that you're talking about. Is that like -- am I missing something there? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : No. So I didn't say 20%. I said the first half will probably be on one side of 20% and the second half will be on the other side of 20%, but much, much higher than the 20%. Steve Tusa : Okay. But the 28% on a proforma basis -- ish -- 27%, 28%, it is the right kind of base in this year and there's nothing unusual about that? So we should assume that you can leverage volume on that? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : We can absolutely leverage volume on that and I think that's the right ballpark. Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then lastly, sorry, just on data center, you broke up a little bit there. Did you say 15% or 10% data center exposure? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : 10%. Steve Tusa : Okay. Operator : And our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Nicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So just a question on, I guess, order growth and backlog. When you guys put together the outlook for fiscal '25, is the expectation that backlog starts to come down from these record levels, or do you think it kind of remains consistent through the year? Thank you. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Well, it's going to depend a little bit on the mix of jobs we are going to book in the year and how strong will be the data center vertical. But assuming the trend line we are seeing, as well as the growth in our -- in the pipeline of opportunities we see in the market, we see that backlog continuing to improve and the margin continuing to solidify. So I think the trend is going to be -- it's going to be strong in growth in the backlog. That's why we are very comfortable with that mid-single-digit revenue growth as we're going to be able to drive a lot of revenue out of that backlog. Operator : And the next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Just on slide five and the revenue mix, it looks like maybe 15% or so indirect. Could you just talk about the end-market exposure within that, how you think about that fit within the portfolio on a go-forward basis? And then, Marc, just with the restructuring announcement today and as you think about proceeds toward the end of the year, just any perspective on how you're thinking about kind of offsetting the exits dilution and sort of timing objectives around achieving that? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yeah. So on the mix, Joe, we view our operating model as an integrated operating model. So for every market, every vertical, we segment the market by product, sometimes by brand even, and we make sure that we get to our full entitlement from a market share standpoint. And so for some markets where we see an ability to both sell value, create high service attach rate and being able to drive the life cycle value of those products in the buildings we are in, we are always going to choose our direct channel and our branches are going to do the vast majority of the work. Now there's parts of the markets where maybe it's harder to sell value or that's not where the customer wants to meet us, or the lifecycle value comes in a different profile, either because of the application of the building itself, the type of vertical it addresses, or just simply the complexity of that market. It's more commoditized part of the market, more mid to low end of the market. And there we use a leverage highly or indirect channel through our distribution and sales partner, where we're able to hit mostly the mid to lower end of the market and try and stay away from that more larger complex part of the market. Now, the second part of your question on capital and restructuring and our ability to offset dilution, the capital deployment plan is going to be very similar to what we've done historically when we've had large divestiture. And you can see how we took that approach, for example, in 2019 when we divested of our battery power solutions business. The goal is going to be able to return as quickly and as efficiently as possible the proceeds of the divestiture, as we see a clear line of sight of closing of the transaction. The restructuring action, we are going to take them as early as possible. We are not going to wait for the transaction to close. Now there are certain actions that are going to have to be taken at or after restructuring. So that's why the timing on some of that benefit and cost is a little bit difficult for us to commit to, but we have a clear plan on how to deploy and continue to improve our operating model as we have throughout the past couple of years. Operator : And the next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Noah Kaye : Thanks. A couple of questions. First, I assume the free cash flow conversion guide doesn't include the tax payments on the divestitures. Would you expect those to fall within the year, just for housekeeping purposes? Second, just to put a finer point on the answer to the earlier question, the $500 million of benefits over time from restructuring, that's assumed to be immaterial to the '25 guide. I just want to confirm that. But then I think more sustainably, can you just give us the broad strokes of what the cost-out program entails and perhaps more qualitatively, how you may be changing the configuration of the business or your go-to-market within that program? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : So, now your first two comments, you are correct. So you're making the right assumption there. In terms of -- in all detail exactly where we're going to focus on, it's around really simplifying and leveraging better our cost structure. With the work we've done over the past six to nine months to right-size our organization and really get a better grasp around where and how we deploy resources against the market opportunities, further driving that simplification and provide better clarity, and also at the end, improving the customer experience that most of our clients and customers are facing. Now from an operating structure, as you see any significant change to our business portfolio, we've been pursuing opportunity to refine the business structure and the operating model to facilitate that simplicity and clarity we talked about. So we'll keep you updated as we see changes needed in how we operate and present ourselves. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. George Oliver for any closing remarks. George Oliver : Yes, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. As we conclude fiscal 2024 and look to the future, I am confident Johnson Controls is heading in the right direction. Our team has delivered an important achievements this year and created momentum entering fiscal 2025. Our customer value proposition is resonating, demonstrated by our sales and service growth and multiple consecutive quarters of building a record backlog. We are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead, provided by our leadership in Building Solutions and our end-to-end operating model. So I want to thank you for your continued support and confidence in Johnson Controls. And with that, operator, that concludes our call. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. And thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Lucas : Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' fiscal first quarter 2025 results. The press release and related tables that were issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations' portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and Chief Financial Officer, Marc Vandiepenbeeck. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion these and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix of this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations' section of Johnson Controls' website. I will now turn the call over to George. George Oliver : Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'd like to start by taking a moment to thank all Johnson Controls' employees for their hard work and tremendous contributions in helping us achieve an excellent start to the year with our strong quarterly results. Before we get into the details of our results, I want to briefly address the CEO transition we announced today. As you've likely seen, the Board and I have selected Joakim Weidemanis to succeed me as CEO of Johnson Controls in March. I will remain on the Board through August 1st to support a seamless transition and will remain an adviser to the company until I officially retire at the end of December. It has been the honor of my career to lead Johnson Controls for eight years working alongside an incredible team and to have been a part of the JCI-Tyco merger before that. We have accomplished a tremendous amount during that time and I could not be more pleased with the company we have built. Together, we have successfully simplified our portfolio and positioned our company as a leading pure-play building solutions provider. We are driving results based on our unique value proposition with an ability to serve our customers over the life cycle of the building. The company's future lies in building on the momentum we have underway. Our company has an incredibly strong bench, including our talented CFO, Marc. This transition came together after a rigorous and thoughtful succession planning process and I am confident that as you get to know Joakim, you will agree that the company is in very capable hands, and he is the right leader for Johnson Controls. Joakim comes from Danaher, where he worked for 13 years. He is a highly accomplished executive with extensive experience scaling global companies with a foundation of customer orientation, innovation, and efficiency. His track record of leading service-oriented businesses and leveraging technology to deliver best-in-class financial performance is uniquely suited for where Johnson Controls is in its value creation journey. I will remain fully engaged until Joakim steps into the CEO role, and then I will work with him and the rest of the management team as we seamlessly transition leadership and set Johnson Controls for continued success. With that, I will turn to a more in-depth discussion of our first quarter performance. Let's begin with Slide 4. Johnson Controls is starting 2025 with great momentum and a clear focus as validated by our first quarter results. Importantly, each of our businesses contributed to robust revenue growth and significant margin expansion and remain positioned for ongoing shareholder value creation. These results reinforce the considerable progress we have made through our transformation efforts and demonstrate the success of our strategic initiatives, which have driven increased demand for our core systems and service offerings. We are confident that our performance provides a solid foundation as we move through the year. Order momentum remained solid with 16% growth in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in both systems and service. The sustained demand for our tailored engineered solutions offerings has not only fueled growth but also positions us well for continued success. Our focus on driving operational excellence and fostering innovation is enabling our performance and building on our capability to deliver consistent, predictable results. Taking into account our strong performance to date, we are raising our guidance for the year. Marc will provide more details later in the call. We are confident in our ability to maintain our momentum and deliver long-term shareholder value creation. Please turn to the next slide. . Johnson Controls is experiencing consistent progress across key verticals, demonstrating the breadth of our expertise and stability of our business model. Our global presence across multiple domains with a simplified operating model enables us to assist and grow our customer relationships over the course of the entire building life cycle, while also delivering safe, healthy and sustainable solutions. By focusing on the entire life cycle, we create great customer intimacy while achieving a high level of customer retention, a key metric and differentiator. Our services business, supported by long contractual engagements empowers us to optimize performance at every phase across all building systems, driving increased value for our customers. This is largely achieved through our global branch network in its more than 20,000 qualified technicians, but also through the continuous advancements in innovation and strategic use of AI. We leverage remote monitoring by employing AI to drive utilization and efficiency. For instance, proactive repair recommendations are contributing to a larger share of our overall services growth. Additionally, customer surveys indicate that Johnson Controls technicians are regarded as trusted advisers, which is due in large part to our local market strategy. Our product-agnostic central operations infrastructure supports our technicians with monitoring, call intake, dispatch and technical support to ensure a seamless and efficient process. This provides best-in-class turnaround time and improved system uptime. We continue to build momentum as a leading solutions provider to data centers, which is one of our fastest-growing verticals and remains an attractive opportunity. I am pleased to report that Johnson Controls was recently named the number one implementer among data center thermal management providers. It was recognized as a top innovator. We are one of only two players to be named an overall leader in the field, and are proud to be a key partner in supporting the infrastructure of the digital economy. We are capitalizing on the significant transformation underway to support safer and more efficient manufacturing reshoring initiatives in Industry 4.0. This is illustrated by how we are driving mission-critical solutions in the healthcare vertical. Hospitals and healthcare facilities face growing challenges, including aging infrastructure and the need to meet ambitious sustainability targets. Our comprehensive portfolio, including advanced HVAC systems, fire protection and our OpenBlue platform helps healthcare providers enhance air quality, improved infection control and reduce energy cost, while meeting regulatory requirements. OpenBlue is another area where we have expanded upon our generative AI capabilities. Our software can now easily explain building equipment faults and trends using generative AI and help users with easy-to-understand investigation and resolution steps. Additionally, we can now analyze energy and carbon emissions across their real estate portfolio and evaluate compliance against any local regulations related to excess carbon emissions helping customers better plan and prioritize capital improvement projects and facility improvement measures. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is also a dynamic area where demand for advanced production environments including clean rooms has surged to support the production of innovative therapies and medications. These facilities require precise temperature, humidity and air quality management. Our leading solutions ensure that they can operate efficiently, safely and sustainably. Across the broader manufacturing sector, our ability to integrate smart, energy efficient and resilient technologies helps manufacturers optimize their operations and achieve their long-term goals. Our performance in these verticals and our use of AI demonstrate our ability to address the unique needs of mission-critical environments across a range industries. By leveraging our advanced technology, digital innovation and focus on sustainability, we continue to deliver measurable value for our customers and position ourselves as a leader in driving long-term growth. In summary, our strong start to fiscal 2025 reflects the success of our strategy to simplify our portfolio and position Johnson Controls as a leading pure-play building solutions provider. The significant progress in our transformation is enabling us to achieve more consistent and predictable performance as we continue to deliver value for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Marc. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Thanks, George. Before I review our results, I would like to thank you for your leadership of Johnson Controls. I have deeply appreciated your partnership over the years and want to wish you all the best in your well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with you and Joakim over the coming months to ensure a seamless transition. Please turn to Slide 6. Our long-cycle backlog and unwavering commitment to operational excellence enables us to produce strong first quarter results and deliver enhanced shareholder value. Organic revenue grew 10% and segment margin expanded a robust 200 basis points to 15%, led by substantial improvement in both EMEA/LA and Global Products. Adjusted EPS of $0.64 was up nearly 40% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.04. We are pleased with our strong start to the year that reinforce our operational strength and effective strategy. On the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $1.2 billion in available cash and net debt decreased to 2.3 times, which is within our long-term target range of 2 times to 2.5 times. Our adjusted free cash flow of approximately $600 million improved nearly $800 million year-over-year. This trend demonstrates the significant improvements in our working capital fundamentals, leading to increased efficiency reduce cost and enhance customer satisfaction. Let's now discuss our segment results in more details on slide 7 through 9. Beginning on slide 7, Global Products had a strong start to the year. Organic sales grew 15% as price remained positive, and we delivered 11 points of volume growth. Applied HVAC grew more than 30%, with strong double-digit growth in North America and EMEALA. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin expanded an impressive 740 basis points to 30.1% as our enhanced operational efficiencies are producing substantial margin improvements. Turning to slide 8 and 9 to discuss our Building Solutions performance. Building Solutions delivered a strong quarter with consistent performance across all regions. Orders grew 16% in the quarter with strong double-digit growth in both systems and service. Orders in North America increased 18% in the quarter led by over 20% growth in systems as we continue to see strong demand for data centers, health care, broader industrial and manufacturing. Additionally, we experienced an uptick in order during the quarter as our customers proactively adapt to the changing global landscape, including anticipated tariffs. Service grew 10% with broad-based strength across the portfolio. In EMEALA, orders were up 6% with 9% growth in service and 4% growth in system. In Asia Pacific, progress continued as our year-long effort to rebuild the pipeline led to positive outcomes. Overall, orders grew 32%, led by 40% growth in systems, while service grew in the low teens. Organic sales increased 8%, led by 10% growth in service and 8% growth in systems. Sales in North America was up 10% organically with continued strength across HVAC and controls. In EMEALA, organic sales grew 6% with solid growth in controls, fire, security and industrial refrigeration. In Asia Pacific, sales grew 5% organically, led by strong double-digit growth in our resilient service business. The Building Solutions segments have experienced notable margin improvements through strategically building backlog with higher-margin system jobs with a long service sale. Our margin story remained consistent this quarter, mirroring the positive trends observed in previous quarters. By region, EMEALA adjusted segment EBITDA margin expanded 240 basis points to 10.1%, driven by improved productivity and the positive mix from growth in service. In North America, adjusted margin expanded 60 basis points to 12.1%, reflecting the execution of a higher margin backlog. In APAC, adjusted margin expanded 20 basis points to 9.3%, driven by positive mix from our service business. Building Solutions backlog remains at record levels, growing 11% to $13.2 billion. Service backlog grew 8% and system backlog grew 12% year-over-year. Our record backlog provides visibility into future revenue, enabling us to drive consistent and predictable financial results. This strong foundation allows us to strategically plan and meet the sustained demand for our solutions, ensuring continued growth. Let's discuss our fiscal second quarter and full year guidance on slide 10. We exited the first quarter with strength and sustained momentum as we executed on our strategic initiatives and expanded our record backlog. This solid foundation offer great visibility into the remainder of fiscal 2025 and position us well for continued success and growth. For the second quarter, we anticipate organic sales growth of mid-single digits. Adjusted segment EBITDA margin expansion of 150 basis points to approximately 16.5% and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.77 to $0.79, representing 12% to 14% growth. For the full year, we continue to expect organic sales growth of mid-single digits, which remains consistent with our long-term growth algorithm. Following a strong start to the year and an improved service mix, we are pleased to raise our full year guidance for both margin and adjusted EPS. Considering the potential impact of tariffs as known today and reflected in our guide, we anticipate higher profitability and continued enhancement in our financial performance. This expectation is primarily due to our operational focus and strong beginning to the year. We now anticipate adjusted segment EBITDA margin to expand over 80 basis points and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share, representing 9% to 12% growth. The positive cash flow at the start of the year demonstrates our working capital fundamentals continue to improve. As a result, we now anticipate achieving a free cash flow conversion of 90% or greater for the full year. We continue to target returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. Our strong start to the year was driven by our ongoing transformation effort, enhanced operational focus and precise execution. Streamlining processes and prioritizing key initiatives have led to early successes, setting a positive tone for the rest of the year. This solid foundation position us well for continued growth and achievement. We look forward to leveraging our strong momentum throughout fiscal year 2025. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the details. So congratulations on Joakim's appointments. I'm just wondering, George, as Chairman of the Board, maybe you could talk about what sort of mandates you're delivering to Joakim as he comes in with a free hand. Just wondering any sort of guardrails around his mandate? George Oliver : Yeah. I mean, we named Joakim effective on March 12. It was through our rigorous and thoughtful succession planning process. He comes with, as we've discussed on a 13-year Danaher -- experience Danaher, extensive experience scaling global companies with a foundation of customer orientation, innovation and efficiency. I think as you look at his background, his track record of leading service-oriented businesses, leveraging technology to be able to deliver best-in-class financial performance is uniquely suited for where Johnson Controls is in its value creation journey. I think as we've talked about, with the strategy that we've developed, you can see the momentum that we've built with that strategy. I think he comes in, brings incredible operational background. And a lot of work around strategy that as we take that foundation forward, we're going to be positioned to be able to capitalize on the full growth potential of the company, couldn't be more excited to have him coming on board, working with him and ultimately going through a seamless transition. Nigel Coe : Okay. Okay. It doesn't sound like there's any -- okay, great. And then just maybe a question for Marc. On the free cash conversion, that's sort of kind of 90% plus for the full year. Maybe just remind us, how much does that include cash restructuring payments with the ongoing program? And just maybe just touch on some of the changes you're making to the process maybe just deliver better and more consistent free cash flow? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. Hey, Nigel. So \u2013 $250 million of restructuring cash in our 90% conversion. And that's obviously a headwind against what you would expect to see at around 100%. We've talked about the other structural challenges that we've seen. As far as changes we are making and we've made, it's all about our operating system. And going back to the fundamental on what type of jobs we accept, how do we plan on billing the customer and collecting on the progress payment. It's also a lot of the work that has been done within our global products team in leveraging better volume and relying less on inventory to be able to drive that growth. You saw global products in the quarter grew about 11% unit with about the same level of inventory they had to hold in those businesses versus last year. So we are very pleased with what we're seeing from an operational standpoint and also fundamental change and that allows us to convert better from a free cash flow standpoint. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Good morning. Congrats on the appointment. And it seems like it was a nice exhaustive search. It seems like a good outcome. So just kind of calibrating the guidance here, I mean, your orders are comping up 16. Your organic this quarter was pretty strong, yet you kind of held the mid-single-digit guide. Anything you're concerned about in the next few quarters, although you did guide second quarter pretty well as well. So anything in the back half. Obviously, the comps get a bit tougher, but anything you're worried about in the back half to drive that type of slowing? George Oliver : Yes, I wouldn't call it slowing. But yes, you're right, Steve. The second half comp has become more difficult, particularly our fourth quarter, where we had very solid growth last year in Q4 and year-on-year compare there is pretty heavy. And the math, of course, our Q4 is also higher from a total revenue standpoint, make the arithmetic of the second half growth a little tougher. I think the way you need to think about that mid-single digit is all of our businesses will grow in that mid-single-digit level. APAC may be a little bit higher than the rest. I think for us to be comfortable to start raising above that level, we need a little bit more clarity on what we think tariff is going to do overall to our markets or end markets, particularly in North America. And then seeing if APAC actually rebounds. Right now, we're seeing them kind of bottoming out and we're starting some growth, but it's not the level of growth you would expect given the couple of challenging years these markets have seen. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just lastly on data center-related business. I assume the orders are still pretty strong. Do you expect an acceleration in -- you booked a lot of orders last year, the lead times are a bit longer. Are you still seeing accelerated growth rates from a sales perspective in data center for 2025 versus 2024? George Oliver : Yes, yes, versus 2024, both orders and revenue is accelerating. What you saw in the first quarter that solid order, particularly North America, some of that had to do with some acceleration of those orders that people who are trying to get ahead of the change in leadership in the country here in January. And then some of it had to do with further visibility that some of our large data center customers have now on their demand for cooling over the next couple of years. But we don't see that momentum slowing down whatsoever. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey good morning, guys. And I'll echo my colleague's comments on Joakim, we know him well, and he's going to be a great fit for you guys. So congrats. George Oliver : Thanks, Scott. Scott Davis : I'll wait until he starts to ask the questions about his mandates and stuff. But I do want to ask a little bit about your order book and -- has it changed over time, meaning are the orders a little bit longer duration now than they used to be? Are people trying to get in the queue just given how large so many of these projects are, obviously, data center but not just data center, the projects overall. It's going to be meaningfully larger than perhaps what we've seen at least in recent history. Do you see a change in that order book, the duration, the lead times, that type of thing? George Oliver : We do see a little bit of a shift toward longer cycle businesses, and that comes not just market back, but also how we address the opportunity we see in the market. And we see the pipeline of opportunity continue to grow. And as we focus our commercial organization towards the most attractive parts of the market where we can actually sell value in margin, but also attach a long service sale to the opportunities we look at. Naturally, that means we build a little bit stronger customer intimacy. With that comes order that are probably a little bit earlier than we saw historically where we were a little bit more transactional and reactive to the market and therefore, we take order later in the cycle. So yeah, naturally, our holders have a have a tendency now to little bit longer tail than they did. And then the core verticals that are growing, data center, health care and manufacturing, more, I would say, complex and elaborate customer that do multiyear planning. That includes pushing orders ability to revenue a little further down the timeline. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And this is not a criticism, just one would love to have some color though on incremental margins. When I just think about the service mix this quarter and then the price in that backlog, I would have guessed maybe incrementals to be a little bit higher than 30%. But I know there's lots of -- there's always puts and takes to that. Maybe if we can just get a little color on that and then I'll pass it on. Thank you. George Oliver : No, absolutely. There's two real aspect, I would say, conservatism still. The first one comes from foreign exchange. We have about a nickel of pressure coming from just purely the dollar strengthening. It's not big, but from a margin rate standpoint, it puts a little bit of pressure. And the second thing I'd tell you is we really need to have a little bit more clarity around tariff and what it will do and how we will be able to pass on that price to the customer? And can we drive also margin on that price ultimately? And as you know, the tariff landscape is very fluid and changing rapidly. And so our ability to risk clarity predict what it will do to our margin expansion is a little bit muted in the second half. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to follow up, if you could give any more detail on the tariff perspective in terms of share of costs or production from some of the affected areas and how we'd think about the speed with which you'd offset those effects with higher prices and then anything more fundamental post that? Thank you. George Oliver : Yes. It's hard to tell you with precision exactly how it's going to be affecting. I'll tell you two or three things. The first one is, we have evolved our manufacturing strategy to manufacture in the region for the region, and that has helped us protecting some part of what's been announced. As I mentioned earlier, that landscape around tariff is very uncertain right now, and every day almost, is changing. But we do have manufacturing capabilities in North America that are not just based in the Continental U.S., some of it in New Mexico, some of it is in Canada. And so depending on how those tariffs will be enacted, will have a particular impact. I'll tell you, we have successfully dealt in the past with tariff, either by passing it on to the customer, sometimes with margins, sometimes just one for one. And we've also been able to pass on some of the pressure we see through the supply chain, either directly on price concessions from our suppliers, or naturally, you'll have the effect of currencies on some of the tariffs that will offset some of that pressure. We are working very diligently on our supply chain levers to drive better resilience in that supply chain and allow us to continue to drive that regionalization. We're working a little bit our supply chain network to kind of minimize ultimately the effect of tariffs should that be enacted. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. And then just my follow-up would be around the corporate cost. Just really spirit of the question trying to understand the sort of pace of stranded cost reduction and the exit rate into 2026 for that line? Because I think your guide this year implies it's sort of $260-ish million the corporate cost in the first half, and then a decent step down in the second half from that number. So is the sort of exit rate from this year a good steady state with kind of stranded costs leaned out when we're thinking about the medium term? Thank you. George Oliver : No, for sure. So part of that stranded cost is obviously sitting at corporate and the timing of moving some of that cost that you would have maybe historically seen in the segments that we've divested is now kind of sitting at corporate. And as we look at the restructuring and the benefit of that restructuring, as you mentioned. You're going to see a lot of that coming out of the corporate expense in the second half, but particularly into 2026 as we are going to be able to fully enact a lot of the activities from a transformation and restructuring, allowing us to really drive a lot of leverage on our corporate cost and taking it down quite materially, looking beyond this current fiscal year. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra from UBS. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. George, as you -- I just wanted to come back to the CEO question, maybe one more time. There's obviously been a lot of progress on the strategic side. So I assume we shouldn't expect much change in terms of where the portfolio of businesses is today, maybe an acceleration of the product, productivity margin opportunities. So maybe you can just talk about what you guys found Joakim would be bringing to the table that you and the Board found particularly attractive for the company? George Oliver : Yeah. The journey we've been on and with the strategy, we've really set Johnson Controls up to be the leader building -- building -- commercial solutions they're really built on at the core of it is technology in our products. It's our digital platform that we deploy and then it's ultimately the services that we gain with the connectivity and the use of data. And so as we've looked at the portfolio, we are -- we'll complete the residential and light commercial divestiture by the end of the year. That's a big step towards being more of a pure play. There's roughly about 10% of the remaining portfolio that might not be core to the commercial building solutions. And so we'll continue to update you as we address those on an ongoing basis. But we feel really good about how we're positioned in the market, the differentiation that we bring to our customers and in the operating model that we're operating with that now is delivering very predictable results right from how we're working with customers, how we're building pipeline, how we're converting pipeline and ultimately, how we're attaching services. And so as I said earlier, with the Joakim's experience coming in and his operational experience as well as strategic experience. Certainly, as we look at the portfolio and the ability to be able to create growth, we see significant opportunity. And so a lot of the focus will be now capitalizing on that opportunity with the strong operating system that we've built, really understanding secular trends that are underway in the commercial building segment, and we believe that we're going to be uniquely positioned now to capitalize on more than our fair share. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And just related to that, maybe one follow-up for Marc. With respect to the margin outlook, can you just talk about maybe the cadence of margins from here as we progress through fiscal 2025? And then as you think about benchmark the business and look at where the productivity opportunities are, maybe more longer-term question, where do you think the biggest margin opportunity exists today for the business? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. Looking first at how we look at the second quarter, you'll see margin improvement, obviously, across the board, but the biggest opportunity will come from EMEA/LA and global product as well as, as we see that lift in volume Asia Pacific, you'll see margin returning more closer to historical levels. So for second quarter, and probably the same applies consistently for the second half for the same segments. That's where we see the opportunity for margin lift. North America will see improvement, but not -- not at the same level as to other three businesses that see a lot of opportunity. Longer term, if you think about the opportunity set here is really two-fold. The first one is we've set in place an operating model that works really well and is starting to deliver performance, but the continued simplification and the restructuring effort we are doing around where we manufacture, how we manufacture, the amount of product we have in our line card and how we deploy our commercial resource around the market against that great franchise of product we've established. And we continue to establish customer intimacy in all the market to drive better growth, I think that's where you're going to continue to see improvement in our margin because that will provide the right level of growth to support better lift in our base cost. We kind of fix the foundation of our cost and it's all about leverage here, and it's really that focus around customer back, trying to continue to drive more than our fair share from a market growth standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Maybe I wanted to ask about two kind of longer term questions here. The first is on the growth profile. The company is talking to kind of mid-single-digit growth this year. Obviously, some tough comps here in the back half, so maybe stepping down to exit the year, but when you think longer term, how much runway do you think there is for the company to kind of maintain this mid-single-digit organic growth? Obviously, backlog is still incredibly high, orders don't seem to be slowing down much. So, any views on just the duration behind this? Thank you. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. So, if you look at the long-term, I get around that mid-single-digit, it's supported first by our continued service growth. That service business is probably going to run mid-single to high single-digits, really coming from two fundamental change in the operating model. First, every time we think about a new system, we try to get as much as we can from a service entitlement associated to that. That means focusing on the right vertical, but also continuously increasing our customer intimacy. The second thing I'd tell you is we have -- we have created a base of products and capabilities that are well suited for the sub-segments of the market that are fundamentally growing at a higher pace than what you would see in the expectation of GDP or market growth. And I'm thinking here about obviously, data center, we keep on talking about, but it's also generally our manufacturing capabilities as well as -- or healthcare businesses. Those three segments continue to outpace the market. That comment is actually applicable to the vast majority of our geographies. And I think it will continue to evolve that way. So, continue to drive product capabilities that serve that market well and where we can continuously generate value will help support that mid-single-digit and hopefully more than that over the long-term algorithm. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I appreciate that. And then I want to follow up on some of the earlier commentary about the company realizing better margin backlog kind of starting to flow through into the P&L. So, I guess -- is that -- will that continue? I imagine prices kind of steadily pushed higher here over the last couple of years. So, is the expectation -- or is the margin in the backlog kind of continually getting better? And then the second piece of that, you guys obviously have a very big backlog, there's long duration behind it. Is there a price protectionism in the event that we get more tariffs coming through here? Are you guys able to offset that with price on what's already in the backlog? Thank you. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Great question. So, the margins in the backlog continue to improve simply because we continue to be able to sell value to customer. There's obviously going to be an inflection point at some time in the future. But we're far from that inflection point the way we see it. As far as tariffs, a large part of our backlog has contractual abilities for us to pass on that price. Some of those contracts allows us to pass the price and probably maintain margin. Some of those, it's more of a one-to-one and therefore, we can recuperate the headwind associated with the tariff, but maybe not the margin on top. And then there's a portion of our backlog that is with larger holder, largest customer that have, I would say, a little bit more leverage, and we will have to negotiate with those customers how we are going to deal with the potential tariff that could be applicable for those products. I'll tell you that for the vast majority of those customers where maybe not word for word, we have full protection. We have created products that are critical to their success, and we have real great partnership with them. So I feel very comfortable that we'll find a way to make it economical for both side and create a successful relationship with those customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Hi, Joe. Is your line on mute? Our next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys. Good morning and nice start to the year. Let me just kind of focus, I guess, my questions on margins. So if I recall last quarter, when we were talking about Global Products, there was an expectation, I think, that the margins were going to be kind of closer towards like the low to mid-20s. They came in a lot better. And so my first question is what really surprised to the upside this quarter on Global Products margins? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : I wouldn't say surprised, right? We always put some conservatism to our guidance to try and make sure we don't surprise to the negative too much. There's two elements that really drove the outsized margin of Global Products in the first quarter. It's first tenability from a third-party revenue standpoint to drive a nice unit growth. That 11% unit growth was a little higher than what our original low to mid-20s first half was contemplating. That team has done an excellent job driving that book and bill business, that short-cycle business at a very high level. Some of it came from very transparently from some orders accelerating as some people were positioning inventory prior to the new administration taking control in January, but some of it is really fundamentally better blocking and tackling from a commercial standpoint. The other part is that as the data center vertical growth continues to accelerate, that business saw the benefit both internal margin and external margin as we saw a lot of growth in our product sales through our field-based business or building solutions business in the other segment. And as you know, a little bit of volume in that business goes a long way, and we saw across the board, better volume, better units, particularly on our equipment and our HVAC business that helped really absorb those factory, get great productivity and really see a nice margin lift. Joe Ritchie : That's super helpful, Marc. I guess, maybe just a quick follow-up to that. So was there a way to maybe quantify that kind of tariff floating comment for the first quarter? And then as you think about the second half of the year, it looks like you're embedding about flattish margins. Is that just some conservatism because you're not really sure how the tariffs are going to play out? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : I'll answer the later with one word, yes. The uncertainty on tariffs as forced us to say, to put some conservative on how we look at the second half and what it's going to do to margin rate. As far as what that did to the first quarter, I'll point you more in orders than revenue. If you look at that really strong first quarter of order of about 16%, I would say about one-third of that was orders that we would have normally probably saw in the second quarter where customers were just accelerating the orders because they wanted to get the uncertainty associated with not just tariff, but overall, the macroeconomic or political landscape, and they wanted to get ahead of it. So there's a little bit of volatility in our orders, as you know, if you look at orders quarter-over-quarter, and so I think this will solidify the year as we start really strongly, but we probably had some benefit in Q1 of orders that we would have normally seen in Q2, and that will probably be reflected in our orders in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thank you. Just looking at the organic sales growth by mix of offerings, applied really leading the group here. When we think about the mid-single digit organic growth for the year, Marc, can you kind of give us some goalposts for how you think about that among the different offerings? I would assume applied -- we continue to be a leader here. But any color you can provide would be helpful. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : We do see continued growth in applied and also in this industrial refrigeration. Both those businesses with the heat pump conversion in Europe as well as the data center globally and manufacturing is a great tailwind for our HVAC applied business. Or more transactional business or more electronics business, I'm thinking about our controls business as well as Fire and Security has a challenging second half of the year, to be honest with you. The indicator still from a construction standpoint are not super, super strong, they're flattish, and that dampens a little bit our ability to grow from that market vertical. We've also been very diligent in driving the commercial team within those businesses to really focus on the subparts of the market that drive service. And so we think that while those particular product lines may be a little bit challenged in the second half of the year from a growth standpoint, not being able to read double digits, they will at least provide a great base for our ability to grow service in the long-term. Noah Kaye : Very helpful. Thanks, Marc. And then you mentioned earlier, the real focus on service entitlements for new business. Maybe just refresh us on where that entitlement, the attachment rate related to today and where you see it going over the next year or two? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Our attachment rate right now is depending on the business line between the low 40s to the high 40s, the best businesses are higher than that, obviously, in the 60s and 70s. And where we think ultimately our entitlement is, is while I don't want to box myself to an exact number, I always point to industries that have demonstrated an ability to drive a very, very high attach rate. I'm thinking about oil and gas industry, for example, the elevator industry that is able to drive 60, 70, maybe sometimes higher than that. We feel that's where our entitlement is long-term. It means making some change to our operating model, drive more manufacturing for service and a few changes to how we address certain end market, but we think that entitlement is absolutely attainable over the mid to long-term. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. How are you? Congratulations on successful CEO succession. George Oliver : Andrew, thank you. Andrew Obin : Just a question. I apologize if it was asked, in North America Building Solutions, productivity was a negative $20 million drag. As I said, I apologize if you explained it, but I think it's somewhat unusual and how should we think about it for the rest of the year? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. It's a short-term thing. So as we continue to see growth opportunity in North America, we've invested in incremental resources to drive against that growth. Whether it's our commercial team and continue to hire more sellers and more sales support as well as the ability to drive incremental service and technician to be able to support that growth. And as you go through a large hiring docket like that, one ends up happening in the very short-term, you have a little bit of productivity as you onboard those people and make them the best possible self and drive productivity for the rest of the enterprise. So I wouldn't take that small $20 million headwind in the quarter as the new normal for that business. It's really more of an uptick as we -- has really made investments to continue to fuel that growth. Andrew Obin : Got you. Thank you. And on Fire & Security, mid-single digit, nice growth. A, could you just talk about sort of what's driving acceleration mid to high single digits, Global Products mid single digits? And how sustainable these trends are into the second half? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yes. The accelerated growth in EMEA/LA is really around what we've been talking about for the last year almost is we repivoted completely that commercial organization and have taken a little bit more control over which part of the backlog they look at and just basic commercial intensity. We're going to continue to drive that team, and we believe that the mid to high single-digit on Fire & Security in that business is going to continue to evolve. I'd say that the mid single-digit that Global Products you saw in the quarter is twofold. Very strong performance commercially, but kind of an easy compare if you look at the first quarter of last year where we were still railing out the challenges we saw associated with cyber incident, and so they had a bit of an easier compare that team, because they were very impacted by incident. Operator : Our next question comes from Sahil Manocha from RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Sahil Manocha : Hi. Good morning. This is Sahil Manocha on for Deane Dray. Just one quick question for me. With net debt to EBITDA of 2.3 times and a cash position of $1.2 billion. How are you thinking about capital deployment priorities in the current environment? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Our capital priorities have not changed. So we'll return 100% of free cash flow back to shareholders this year. The proceeds of our divestiture, assuming there's nothing material from an M&A standpoint that comes between now and in the fourth quarter will be 100% returned to the shareholder via share repurchases. We will take our discontinued operations business cash flow and use that cash flow to reduce a little bit leverage and to bring it closer to the lower end of our 2% to 2.5%. But our capital allocation and the diligence we have there has the full support of the Board, and it's not going to change anytime soon. Sahil Manocha : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephen Volkmann : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions, I guess, on sort of where you are relative to capacity. So applied and I guess large chiller specifically, I'm guessing things are fairly tight. Is there some color you can give us on that? And then should we be expecting some capacity additions at some point? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : I would regionalize that answer a little bit. In North America, we have a little bit of capacity, but we are very close to be at capacity. We see, obviously, a very strong backlog and a continued backlog. So we have great visibility there. In EMEA/LA, we are at capacity, we need to probably expand a little bit capacity to be able to follow the trend we see in data center as well as heat pump. And then in Asia Pacific, we still have quite a bit of capacity to be transparent with you because the market has bottomed out, but it hasn't rebounded yet. And so our factories in Asia have the ability to drive a whole lot more growth in the future. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. All right. Great. And then maybe also on the same thread here. I think, Marc, you just said something about adding some additional field engineers, I guess, in systems and service. But where are you on sort of utilizing these folks? Is there still upside to that? Do you really need more people in order to grow that business more? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : So, our operating model really drives very high level of productivity within a field technician. We are continuously working on tools to make them more productive. We -- George talked about it in his opening comments. AI is not just a great opportunity for us from a cooling and top line growth standpoint, it's also an incredible opportunity to make our field technician that much more productive. Either it's helping them figuring out what the problem is with a particular system or having them standing ready a little faster when it comes to the type of products or services that they need to deliver that particular day therefore, making their day more enjoyable, but also much more productive and keeping the customer kind of happy as we come in and out of those facilities quicker. We continue to invest in our field labor because it's a critical element of our service growth. Our ability to continuously drive service is critical. And as you see us growing services mid to high single digit, productivity will help us rely less on labor, but there's still going to be a labor component, and we are going to continuously be searching for the next great talent there. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. George Oliver : Good morning, Andy. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : So APAC order growth, as you said, was actually quite strong. I know you're still probably a bit cautious about calling the all clear there. But -- can you call a definitive turn in that market with the understanding that it's still a fluid environment given the tariff situation? George Oliver : Yeah, Andy, as we saw early signs of the softness in the region, this goes back over the last 18 months, we proactively took steps to adapt to the lower demand. And ultimately, the increased counterparty risk. And as we rebuild the pipeline, we've now seeing a very strong rebound here with orders at 32%, in the quarter. We believe that we found the bottom and with the current run rate, which is in line with the lower market demand. And so I think based on what we've seen, we've seen real stabilization in the business, and now we're really returning to growth, not only in building the backlog, but the way that we're going to convert going forward. I think, Andy, what's most important is, the way that we continue to build services in spite of some of the pressure on the new systems. Service is continues to be strong. We'll continue to help maintain a healthy segment EBITDA margin as well as continuing -- while we're continuing to rebuild the systems business. So I think we'll see continued growth within Asia Pac, not only recovery in China, but across the overall Asia Pac region. Andy Kaplowitz : It's helpful. And obviously, there's a lot of questions on data centers, which makes sense. But you obviously have a lot of applied verticals. And it seems like you're still getting leadership out of healthcare or education, but maybe you can opine on some of these verticals and the visibility that you have, you seeing improvement in office, for example, like what are you seeing across the verticals? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yeah, great question. So we continue to see strong double-digit on data center as well as healthcare and some other vertical. We still don't see any acceleration in what I would call core real estate, which is offices and mix buildings would fall into that, that category for us. You still have owners that are trying to figure out what they're going to do with their current asset. And you still see some hesitation in making certain investments. It's a market that's not declining, just not growing at the pace of the other. We have great solutions and products to address that particular vertical as it rebounds, but it's not where we are seeing the most growth. Infrastructure is seeing still some good tailwind from higher commitment from a construction standpoint. And then we're still some positive sign there. And then everything from a Semiconductor Manufacturing or Clean Room, Biomed Manufacturing still globally sees a great tailwind, and I don't think we are going to see us stop to that trend anytime soon. Operator : The next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea: Hi. Sorry about that earlier. Thanks for getting me back in queue. Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Okay. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to start on just restructuring and progress over the course of the quarter, just revisit kind of how you're thinking about the cost impact in 2025, the savings impact, whether anything is trending kind of ahead or behind the plans there? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Yeah. So our expectation hasn't changed from a cost or timing of it. What I'll tell you is, embedded in our guide in the second half we've seen early signs of progress of the benefits. We started addressing very early on, the stranded costs we saw as we were getting close to closing the transaction of a divestiture of the ADTI business as well as the residential and light commercial. And that gave us a little bit of a leg up on our ability to drive some of cost out earlier on. I think you're going to see some good sign in the second half of the year from a cost standpoint. The vast majority of the benefit will really be yielded in fiscal year 2026 as we close the transaction in Q4. It will give us an opportunity to really address the vast majority of that stranded cost in the fourth quarter into the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 -- 2026. Joe O'Dea: Great. That's helpful color. And then just wanted to come back to an earlier comment about pricing going into backlog and talking about sort of selling value to the customer and just to understand your evaluation of the pricing today and the pricing opportunities. And so what goes into kind of evaluating the value you're delivering and to what degree do you think you're being appropriately compensated for that? Marc Vandiepenbeeck : Well, it varies on all the different vertical we play. But what I'll tell you is our ability to drive outcome for customers allows us to not have to go into deep detail into what is the actual pricing of each component of the offering we present to them. It's a full solution, it's package. And it allows us within our organization to drive best costing and maintain margin at. Obviously, things change whether it's tariff or otherwise, and we have contractual ways to actually address that through change orders with customers as we actually go and implement those systems, the application varies out. And most of our contracts have an ability for us to address that through a process that is very defined and allows us to most of the time, recover not only our cost, but as well the margin and sometimes drive even better value for the customer and JCI. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to George Oliver for any closing remarks. George Oliver : Yes. Thanks. To wrap up the call today, this quarter, Johnson Controls achieved record-setting backlog, double-digit organic sales growth and broad-based strength across our portfolio. Our strong start to fiscal 2025 is a testament that Johnson Controls' talented, hard-working team as well as our unwavering commitment to innovation and operational excellence. And I am confident that Joakim is well-suited to lead Johnson Controls next chapter of growth as we build on the strong momentum underway to unlock enhanced value for our stakeholders. With that, operator, that concludes our call today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
