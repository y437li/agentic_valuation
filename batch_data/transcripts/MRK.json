At this time I would like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joseph Romanelli : Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning everyone. We\u2019d also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck\u2019s first quarter 2014 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out just a couple of items. First of all there are a number of items in the GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and you can see them in our press release in table two. This will give you a better sense of the underlying performance. There are three tables in the press release, the first table provides the GAAP results. Table number two reconciles our GAAP P&L to the non-GAAP results for the first quarter and table three provides the sales performance for the company\u2019s business unites and our products both on a reported basis and excluding exchange. During the call we will be referring to table two when we discuss the P&L and table three when we talk about revenue performance. Finally I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon current beliefs of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The company\u2019s SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. Our SEC filings can be found on the website of merck.com and you can also find our earnings release and all the tables there as well. Now since this is a busy morning for earnings and we\u2019ll be together next week for the investor briefing in Boston we are going to have a shorter call today. Now this morning, I\u2019m joined by Ken Frazier, Peter Kellogg, Adam Schechter, Roger Perlmutter and Rob Davis, our newly appointed CFO. So with that I like to introduce Ken Frazier. Ken? Ken Frazier : Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. As expected we delivered another solid operational quarter with growth in several key brands and disciplined cost management. The fundamentals of our business remained strong which we believe will keep us on track and deliver on our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance. Looking beyond the first quarter this is an exciting time at Merck as we prepare to commercialize the next wave of innovation coming out of our labs over the next few years. Our commitment to innovation remains strong as it\u2019s only by bringing to market new products that make a meaningful difference to patients, healthcare providers and payers that we will continue to create value for society and shareholders. This quarter we delivered on this commitment in a number of important areas including oncology where we continue the rolling submission of a BLA for MK3475, our anti-PD1 immunotherapy in advanced melanoma. MK3475 is currently being studied in 17 clinical trials estimated to enroll over 4,000 patients across more than 30 types of cancer. Earlier this month we presented pharmacy Phase II data from our investigational Hepatitis C treatments which have accelerated our path to Phase III development. We also presented Phase II data for MK1439 our investigational next generation HIV therapy which will move into Phase III development by the end of the year. Each of these candidates represents the kind of innovation that has the potential to make a meaningful difference to patients. Roger will talk more about our pipeline and the status of our regulatory applications for our near term candidates later in the call. We look forward to providing a more comprehensive update regarding these and our other promising pipeline programs at our upcoming investor meetings on May 6th at our Research Campus in Boston. For now, I will reiterate that, we are excited by our pipeline and what\u2019s to come. Turning back to the first quarter, we saw growth in many key areas of our human health portfolio including diabetes, immunology, vaccines and Isentress. We are preparing for many upcoming product launches. In March, we announced the appointment of Robert Davis, as Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Peter Kellogg who has served in that role since 2007. Peter has been an important member of our leadership team and instrumental in helping guide Merck during a period of significant change in our company and in our industry. Peter will leave Merck a stronger company and we are grateful for his many contributions. As we announced previously, Peter will remain at Merck through mid-May to ensure a seamless transition and is with us today to discuss our first quarter results and to answer your questions. Rob joined us from Baxter where he most recently served as Corporate Vice President and President of that company\u2019s medical products business. He previously served as the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Rob is an accomplished executive with significant financial expertise both in pharma from his time at Lily and in broader healthcare from his time at Baxter. I believe his broad, global, business, financial and healthcare experience make him a great addition to our team. Rob? Robert Davis : Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. I must say, it\u2019s a privilege to be a member of the Merck team. I spent many years in the healthcare industry and I have long viewed Merck is a premier research company in the pharmaceutical industry. There is a strong legacy here of translating science in to medicine so when Ken called to discuss the opportunity with me, I jumped at the chance. I look forward to working with the management team and leading the financial organization. This is my fifth day on job but know am excited to be here and I look forward to seeing of you next week at the investor briefing in Boston. Ken? Ken Frazier : Thank you, Rob. We are also excited to have you here. In closing, our strategy of focusing on our best opportunities while being disciplined about managing our costs continues to deliver bottom line performance. Our robust pipeline contains many promising candidates representing a suite of near and long-term opportunities that will continue to drive growth and shareholder value. I look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming investor briefing where we will share more about how we are sharpening our commercial and R&D focus bolstering our innovative pipeline and preparing to launch and commercialize on many long-term opportunities. And with that I would like to turn the call the call over to Adam. Adam Schechter : Thank you. Ken. Good morning everyone. This morning I will provide you with an overview of first quarter Global Human Health results. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. As we anticipated, immunology, diabetes and vaccines continue to be areas of growth. Sales growth in these areas were offset by few things, the continued impact from loss of exclusivity of several brands, product divestitures that we previously announced and the biannual price declines in Japan. We continued to take action to focus our resources on areas that provide the greatest potential for long-term growth. Those include our top markets, our core therapeutic areas and our launch opportunities. We are making critical choices and we are prioritizing our resources and you can see these efforts reflected in our reduced expenses. Let me provide more details on the performance of our core products and core markets and I will start with the Januvia franchise. The franchise has sales of $1.3 billion and 5% growth in the first quarter. In United States, sales increased by 4%. Our international market sales, which now represent about 50% of our total sales grew 6%. We drove double-digit growth in Europe and the emerging markets but we also saw the impact of customers reducing their inventory levels in Japan ahead of the April 1st price reductions. Globally, the diabetes market is significant and the macro trends support our growing markets. We will continue to focus resources around the world to ensure continued leadership in the branded global diabetes market. Moving to Isentress, we had another good quarter with Isentress with 8% global growth, that\u2019s despite new competition. Turning to immunology, the combined immunology business consisting of REMICADE and SIMPONI grew 13% in the quarter. Sales of SIMPONI alone grew over 40%. SIMPONI is the fastest growing immunology biologic in the market where it\u2019s available. Sales of REMICADE grew 7% and that\u2019s despite biosimilar entry in some of the smaller EU markets. As an important reminder we maintained patent protection for REMICADE in markets that represent 80% of our sales until early 2015. Lastly, moving to our vaccines business. In the first quarter, vaccines sales grew 4%. Demand for vaccines portfolio remained strong and there are many global growth opportunities. Gardasil sales increased by 2% in the quarter, 10% sales growth in the U.S. and strong sales in the emerging markets were offset by the loss of sales in Japan. Looking now at Zostavax, Zostavax sales were $142 million this quarter. As expected, sales in United States declined sequentially due to seasonality. As you may recall last year, we saw benefit to sales from flu season extending into the first quarter. This year, the flu season did not extend into the first quarter. In addition we are continuing to educate customers on the broad managed care coverage for Zostavax and the process for getting reimbursement. Internationally, we\u2019ve launched Zostavax in select Asian markets and the UK and we are seeing good uptick in those markets. Now I would like to briefly touch on our performance at regional level beginning with the United States. In the U.S. growth in our core areas of diabetes and vaccines was offset by the [inaudible] loss of exclusivity, revised cholesterol guidelines and the changes in in the HCV market. In Europe, we drove strong growth in immunology in diabetes and with Isentress. We also saw generic entry for Nesonex and pricing pressure continues throughout the region, Japan sales \u2013 and Gardasil. Sales in emerging markets grew 3%, strong growth in key emerging markets like Brazil, Turkey and Korea was partially offset by declines in this quarter. The timing of tenders affected our performance this quarter as well. Looking ahead this year, we continue to expect that the emerging markets will be strong growth drivers for us. In summary in the first quarter, Global Human Health drove growth of key franchise including diabetes, immunology and vaccines. As we anticipated there were headwinds including loss of exclusivities, divestures and buying patterns in anticipation of the biannual price declines in Japan. We continue to prioritize our investment. We\u2019re sharpening our focus on the best opportunities for long-term growth which includes our core products, our core markets and launches. We have multiple near-term launch opportunities and I look forward to discussing these with you next week at our investor briefing. Now I would like to turn the call over to colleague Peter Kellogg. Peter Kellogg : Thank you Adam and thank you Ken for the kind words. Good morning everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are on track in executing against our plan to reshape and refocus the company for future growth. This morning, I will provide additional color on our accomplishments in the first quarter and I will comment on re-confirming our outlook for the rest of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. On this basis we earned $0.88 per share in the first quarter as compared to $0.85 per share in the prior year. EPS growth was driven by growth in key brands effective cost management and contributions from asset sales. Now I would like to walk through P&L, starting with revenues. On an ex-exchange basis, total company revenues in the first quarter decreased 2%. As expected this decline reflects several moving parts including the impacts of divestures, loss of exclusivity of certain brands, partially offset by growth in core products. Building on Adam\u2019s discussion of Global Human Health results I will speak to the other revenue elements in the quarter on an ex-exchange basis. Animal health revenues were flat year-over-year, however excluding Zilmax sales in animal health grew 5% in the quarter. Consumer care revenues declined by 3% as a result of product divestures and the shortened allergy season in North America this quarter. Other revenues increased by approximately $85 million this year driven by proceeds from the divesture of U.S. Saphris rights. These proceeds were partially offset by the continued decline in supply sales to the AstraZeneca joint venture. Regarding the joint venture we continue to expect AstraZeneca to exercise its option which would bring the longstanding partnership to a close on June 30th. Moving to expenses and starting with product gross margin. PGM was 74.1% this quarter which was slightly higher than expected due to exchange and the Saphris proceeds. As noted in February, we still expect the 2014 full year gross margin ratio to be slightly lower than in 2013 full year ratio of 74.3%. Our SG&A expenses were about $250 million lower than prior year, driven by reductions and promotions, direct selling and administrative expenses as well as some foreign exchange benefit. While we are focusing our resources on key markets and core products, we are also preparing for several launches this year. While we will invest in launches to maximize these opportunities we do remain on track for full year SG&A reductions versus 2013. Similarly research and development expenses were about $340 lower year-over-year, as a result of continued prioritization of R&D programs and some phasing of spend that we now expect to occur in the second half of the year. As communicated in the last few weeks we are initiating a broad Phase III program for our investigational hepatitis C regiment and we are continuing to invest heavily in immune-oncology. But as with SG&A we continue to expect full year reductions in R&D spend compared to 2013. Moving other income and expense, this quarter we had other income of $39 million reflecting a gain from divesting Sima. Also recall that in the prior year we had significant foreign exchange losses as a result of the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. Moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 26.1% in the first quarter. This is in line with our expectations for the year. We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full to be between 24% and 26%. Now turning to the outlook for the rest of the year, on the top-line we continue to expect revenue of $42.4 billion to $43.2 billion at current exchange rates. Similarly we are maintaining our bottom line guidelines for earnings of $3.35 to $3.53. On a GAAP basis we expect to earn between $2.15 and $2.47. Both of these EPS guidance ranges reflect a potential devaluation in Venezuela this year. Although the timing and magnitude of such a devaluation remains uncertain as we indicated in February. Also as noted earlier both SG&A and R&D expenses will be lower than 2013 but the timing of some of these expenses has shifted from the first quarter into the second-half of the year. However we still expect earnings for the second half of the year to be stronger then the first-half of the year. Now touching briefly on capital allocation, a year ago we announced a new $15 billion share repurchase program with the intension to repurchase $7.5 billion over the first 12 months. We have now accomplished that milestone. In fact over the past 12 months we have returned over $12 billion in total to shareholders through these repurchases and the dividends. These accomplishments place Merck as one of the top performers in the industry in returning cash to the shareholders. So in conclusion. Merck is entering a new phase of innovation and launches and we are preparing to drive growth in the future. You can see results of our efforts in the form of a lower cost base, growth in core product franchises and acceleration of key pipeline assets such as our anti PD1 and hepatitis C programs. With our first quarter results in hand we are on track to accomplish the goal set forward to reshape Merck for future growth. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Roger. Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Thanks Peter. The first quarter was an especially busy one for the regulatory approvals group at Merck Research Laboratories. During the last two months we obtained FDA approval both for GRASTEK our sublingual desensitizing tablet for patients suffering from grass induced allergic rhinitis, and RAGWITEK, a similar tablet for patients suffering from ragweed allergy. Both agents developed in collaboration with our colleagues at Alcatel have demonstrated a significant efficacy in alleviating the troubling symptoms of patients suffering from seasonal rhinitis. As with some other desensitizing agents patients prescribed these drugs to have access to [ertapenem] to assure that these severely allergic patients are protective against the possibility of a hematologic reaction. Also in the first quarter the committee for additional products for human resource or CHMP or the European medicines agency provided a favorable opinion regarding the conditional approval for vintafolide for the treatment of advanced fully receptive positive Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer when used in combination with pegylated doxorubicin. We are developing vintafolide in collaboration with colleagues at Endocyte, the lead responsibility for our companion imaging reagent, used to assess the degree of folate receptor expression on tumor cells. Vintafolide binds to the folate receptor and thereby delivers a cytotoxic vinca alkaloid resulting in significant tumor cell destruction. Conditional approval of vintafolide require ratification by the Europe Commission which should provide an opinion in the second quarter. Meanwhile we are making good progress advancing the review of Vorapaxar with the FDA. As you will recall, Vorapaxar an antagonist of the thrombin receptor on platelets was evaluated in a large outcome study in combination with aspirin and Plavix as a means of reducing atherothrombotic events in patients that have previously sustained a myocardial infarction and they were considered to be at high risk for subsequent events. Details of potential vorapaxar labeling language are currently review. We are optimistic that it will be possible to agreement on this language in the very near future. There are numerous other products for which regulatory evaluation is proceeding. The FDA has accepted our application for V503 our New 9-valent Papilloma Virus vaccine which we have demonstrated can expand the protection offered by Gardasil to five additional viral cerotypes. We are ready to bring this important new vaccine to patients around the world. Also in the first quarter we have resubmitted our application for Suvorexant and the rexant antagonist for treatment of Insomnia for which we received a complete response letter last year. Our resubmission provides data regarding new, lower starting doses for this drug in the quarter with the FDA recommendations. Suvorexant is also under review in Japan and other jurisdictions. And in Japan we are pursuing registration for vaniprevir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection when used in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin. We have received priority review from the Japanese PMDA into this agent. Finally we made very good progress in the first quarter advancing the submission of MK-3475 our PD1 specific antibody for the treatment of patients for the advanced melanoma refractory to other therapies. Detail about this program will be presented as part of our Business Review Meeting next week. So I\u2019ll not cover them here. I do wish to say however that the finalization process that we introduced last year is clearly very improved, as can be seen in the reduced R&D expenses that we are reporting this quarter. These expense reductions were not achieved without substantial effort. And I am grateful to all of my colleagues for their diligence in focusing on investments on programs that can make a real difference for the patients who we serve. Finally, we are looking forward to the business review next week where we intend to review some of our most important programs addressing metabolic disease and diabetes, hepatitis C virus infection, improved therapies for patients suffering from human immune efficiency virus infection and cancer. We are building in each of these cases on our long legacy of scientific achievements which positions us well to make further contributions to human health. Joe? Joseph Romanelli : Great. Thank you, Roger. And before we open up the call to your questions Stephanie just please as a reminder please limit your questions to one or two, so we can get to as many callers as possible. So with that, Stephanie if we can open up the line for the first caller. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Mark Schoenebaum : Thanks a lot for taking the questions. First of all, hats off to Peter. Thanks for everything you have done of the biotech and now the pharma community and welcome Robert we all are looking forward to working with you. Number one, maybe on PD1 if I may, I suspect you are going to give me an unsatisfying answer to this Roger but I am going to try anyway. But we learned today that Bristol is going to file for lung cancer around the end of the year it sounds like, probably in 4Q. And I am just wondering if you could give us any kind of update, I know we\u2019ll hear about this next week but on your potential filling timelines in lung cancer base case and upside case. And then maybe for Peter, these assets sales that helped to reduced EPS this quarter, was that something that you had planned for when you issued 2014 guidance? And then maybe for Ken just big M&A obviously what\u2019s going on at Pfizer has created a lot discussion around the merits of big M&A. Merck\u2019s a big company capable of doing big M&A I think it would be good time to here to get your updated views on such transformative deals. Ken Frazier : Thanks Mark for the questions. Let me take a crack at the third question. So, our strategy is to remain true to who we are, a research intensive biopharmaceutical company that seeks to make a long-term difference through cutting edge size science. I prefer therefore to driving long term shareholder value through innovation rather than consolidation. And we believe Merck is at its best when it\u2019s inventing new treatment such as anti-PD1. Therefore we will remain focused on those opportunities that are right before us in advancing our pipeline. We also announced a new global initiative last October as you know to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus and we are making critical choices about the areas where we look complete new investments that are required. In doing so we are also reducing our cost base by 2.5 billion and this is on top of the $3.5 billion worth of synergies for the merger. As you heard this morning the initiative is already showing progress and we are divesting assets and making structural changes to increase our operating leverage. And we are also exploring strategic options for consumer and animal health. So while we continuously evaluate external opportunities our preference is to enhance our pipeline and commercial business with smaller bolt-on acquisition versus large mergers for consolidation purposes. On the other hand of course we carefully monitor and evaluate what is happening in the industry and we\u2019ll continue to be objective and comprehensive in our assessments. But to be clear our strategy is one of innovation. Joseph Romanelli : Thanks Ken. So Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Yeah Mark. With respect to non-small cell lung cancer we have a quite a lot of studies going on as you know with nearly 1,500 patients under study. We have the opportunity to go through all of that and to describe our registration strategy next week and I think that\u2019s probably the right way to approach this. Suffice it to say that we look for every opportunity that we can to bring the benefits of MK3475 to patients who need this drug and where we see substantial evidence of efficacy we are going to pursue the most accelerated kind of registration program that we can imagine we think it\u2019s that important. Peter Kellogg : Mark, this is Peter thanks for your comments. And so relative to the asset sales and the sale of the commercial right for Saphris, yes we did as you recall last fall we announced our strategy of focusing on growth opportunities whether it be by franchise or geography and we also at that time announced that we will be taking some of our lower prioritized areas and potentially divesting them let\u2019s say we are better off in someone else\u2019s hands. I mean as we put together guidance for this year we are well aware of all these transactions and we incorporated that into our guidance. And so on the one hand we are getting some benefits from the sale of the U.S Saphris rights in the other revenue line and the gain from sales of Serna in the other income expense. The flip is of course we are giving up the revenue of some of these assets that we are divesting. So just as an example for Q1 the loss of revenue on divested assets was about a $120 million and on a full year basis this year which is incorporated in our guidance the total is about $600 million based on 2013 sales. So as you implement this sort of focus portfolio strategy you are going to end up little bit of period where you are getting some reductions in revenue and the other hand you gain the impacts of the transactions in the P&L. Joseph Romanelli : Great thanks Mark for the questions and Stefanie next caller? Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Thanks very much and Peter just want to wish you best of luck with everything. It\u2019s been great quite working with you. So a couple of questions here. Maybe first coming back on the capital deployment priorities, there\u2019s obviously been a lot in the press about the potential to sell the consumer franchise. Can you just give us an update of should we think about repo as the preferred use of capital to the extent that you ought to monetize one of these businesses? And the second question was on the HCV program and can you just comment on how you see differentiating your combo relative to the two primary competitors are going to little bit of a head start in terms of time to market here? And just the one would you be comment on type of market share targets that you think you will be able to take as you look to commercialize this product looking out a few years, thanks very much. Ken Frazier : Thanks Chris I will take your first question. So as you know it\u2019s pretty well established and we\u2019ve said that we are going to evaluate our consumer care business and our animal health business. We\u2019ve also been clear that we might reach very different conclusions about the two businesses. So with respect to your fundamental question that you asked. I don\u2019t think we are positioned to comment on hypotheticals at this point. In general, our frame work for the utilization of [hatch] has not changed. First, we will allocate resources to those areas that we feel presents the highest potential growth opportunities, for example our anti PD1 program which we intend to be studying for multiple tumor types overtime. Second, we will execute on compelling business development opportunities to strengthen our pipeline and that can create value. Third, we plan to return a high level of free cash flow to shareholders through both the dividend and the stock buyback and just note that we have returned over $12 billion in cash to shareholders over the past 12 months. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thanks Ken. Roger? Roger Perlmutter : So with respect to the HCV combo Chris just as you have the opportunity of course to see the data that we presented at the European Meetings. 5172-8742 has very desirable properties as a fixed dose combination and in particular we showed really quite impressive sustainable logic responses in patients with \u2013 who are quite difficult to treat, those who have Cirrhosis, who are co-infected with HIV and the other thing to note about the combination of course is that that the drugs are \u2013 can be used in patients with substantial comordities which is really quite important it\u2019s something that I mentioned before. So as a single agent in those settings I think there is quite a lot of differentiation and obviously we are looking at every possible means of accelerating the process of completing the registration enabling trials and the registration of these drugs for we have breakthrough designation. And with respect to the market share I guess I\u2019ll speak for Adam. Adam Schechter : No, Chris let me say that we are taking a hard look and we know this market pretty well. We think it\u2019s a very large opportunity that\u2019s been a play out over many years. It\u2019s not going to play out in just one or two years and it\u2019s going to play out over years across the globe. There are some drugs obviously that are ahead of us but we are not thinking that as a winner take all scenario in just a couple of years. So there is going to be plenty of opportunities for promising drugs in our pipeline as we move forward we will be talking a bit more about that next week. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thanks Chris for the questions. Stephanie, next caller. Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Just a follow-up on some of the M&A related questions Ken. I mean what\u2019s going on the industry is obviously very exciting companies are getting more aggressive, increasing their focus on areas that they are good at, getting out of businesses where there is less focus and you know as you said we are all anxiously waiting to see what happens to your animal health and consumer business. But beyond those two businesses which are relatively small contributors to your top line, are there other strategies that you can pursue, other carve-out opportunities that you see that would allow you to accelerate your shift and focus from primarily care to specialty biological and we are seeing a lot of this activity from many of your peers? And then secondly, Peter to you. And again I wish my congratulations to you as well and best of luck in your next opportunity. But why wouldn\u2019t you raise at least the bottom-end of your guidance, very wide range at this point, you beat on the first quarter. Just what are \u2013 what should we be thinking about as we think about the rest of the year. You did say I think second-half would be stronger which is I think how we have always modeled it. But just wondering why you wouldn\u2019t take the opportunity to raise the bottom end of the guidance? Thanks. Ken Frazier : Well, thanks Jami for the questions. Let me just go back to what we have said back in October, which is that we intended to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus as we move forward. You have seen some of the things that we have already done and I think we will continue to look for those opportunities to focus in those areas where we know that we can compete and make investments, where we know we can bring forward innovation PD1 and where we think we can run in the marketplace. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. There are going to be opportunities. And at the same time, on the other side of the ledger we are also looking to M&A to enhance our pipeline through the right types of value creating opportunity that maybe out in the marketplace. Peter Kellogg : Yeah, thanks Jami. This is Peter. See you are right. In the guidance range we gave for this year obviously we had a lot of factors incorporated. We recognized that we will be doing a certain matter of investment to launch into the pipeline. We understood that the AstraZeneca joint venture would go away and that was included in our calculation. We did know about the divestitures that we have announced so far, that was also put in there as well as the loss of exclusivity for certain products. The bottom end of the range though is defined actually by our trying to estimate what might happen with Venezuelan bolivar. So quite frankly you can think of the high end of the range as sort of our performance ex that impact and the low end of the range is just trying to make some estimate as to what might be the case. You know you recall the last year that devaluation took place in the first quarter and it was about $0.07 per share impact on us and we have tried to make some estimate. It\u2019s very hard to estimate what that is. So that\u2019s why we have left the range fairly wide. And as we see what happens in Venezuela we\u2019ll make \u2013 we\u2019ll adjust, we\u2019ll how kind of what that means to our P&L and if necessary or appropriate we will adjust our EPS range accordingly. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, great. Thanks Jami. And Stephanie, can we open it up to the next caller please. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Tim Anderson : On JANUVIA it seemed a little bit weaker I guess than what we and I think consensus were looking for in the U.S., I mean I believe more than 20% in price increases at least on a list price basis, maybe you don\u2019t report that obviously in the U.S. number. So I am wondering if you can just talk about net U.S. pricing trends going forward where the DPP-4 is. And then internationally sales seem to be on the weaker side. I am wondering what the driver was of this. And then can you talk about the timing of top lining the [Chikos] trial. Can we think about that possibly as a third quarter event? And can you discuss the what-if scenario whereby [Chikos] may show heart failure signal like we have seen with one or more other DPP-4 inhibitors in that category? Adam Schechter : So, Tim let me start with the JANUVIA performance and ex-ForEx we had 5% growth. And if you look at the U.S. we had 4% growth. We had a couple of points that came through on price and we had some increase in the inventory as well that was partially offset by a small decline in TRX volume. If you look at TRX volume in the U.S. we have seen this month better than the last month and last month better than the prior three months. So we have certainly seen a stabilization of the TRX volume when you look it year-over-year and now we are looking to see if we can actually turn it around. If you look at new to brand share we are actually doing better and if you look at new to brand volume we have actually seen an increase in the month of March which is the first time we have seen an increase in the new to brand volume in a very long time. So it\u2019s still early yet but we feel we have certainly stabilized the U.S. now we are looking to see if we can actually grow TRXs again. If you look outside the U.S. we had very good growth in the emerging markets and in Europe. If you look where we saw some softness it was in Japan and the reason why is because wholesalers stopped purchasing or reduced purchases prior to the re-pricing that took place and we have seen the wholesalers began to purchase again after that re-pricing occurred in March they are beginning to repurchase again in April. Overall, the diabetes market continues to show reason for strong growth. If you look at the epidemiologic incidents, if you look at governments around the world and the importance that diabetes plays in the overall healthcare expenditure the markets certainly shows why it should grow. And we continue to invest strongly in the marketplace to now with the success outside the U.S. to do everything that we can to increase the success in the U.S. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thanks Adam. Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Yeah, Tim. With respect to the Chikos trial you know we continue on track with that trial for [14,000] patient study but I need to point out of course that it is eventually a trial and so those events ultimately drive timing. We are not seeing anything that suggests to us that there will be an acceleration in terms of the read out of that trial earlier this year. So it continuous on track. And then with respect to any signals that one might see in that trial you know there has been an interest in the question of the specific finding of heart failure hospitalization based on other studies understandably, we have looked at it both in terms of our Pharmacovigilance activity as well as the data safety, monitoring board has looked at it with respect to the chikos trial because these adjudicated events. At their most recent meeting which was at the end of year just a few months ago they reported no reason not to continue this study as planned and we have seen no evidence of a signal on our Pharmacovigilance study so we are not seeing anything there. We will wait to see the final data we are hopeful that the trial will complete at the end of the year. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, great. Thanks Tim and Stephanie next caller. Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions. Just have two. First question for Roger. If I look at your competitors PD1 clinical development plans by trying to piece those together from clinicaltrials.gov you can certainly see where there\u2019s certainly home in some indications where you might be able to use your breakthrough designation to be able to file additional early stage data if it comes out well. So let me just focus on a couple of areas like hematology or head and neck as examples where you might be presenting data at ASCO. Is there an opportunity to potentially file those additional datasets with the FDA and by using your breakthrough status getting potentially an accelerated approval on those? Second question has to do with M&A for Ken, certainly tax inversion very important not only company issue but certainly policy issue just your thoughts about large scale M&A versus franchise enhancing, either asset swaps and/or franchise enhancing acquisitions versus large scale M&A. Just your thoughts on that and then your thoughts on tax inversion and then certainly want to wish the best to Peter Kellogg in his new endeavors and welcome Rob Davis and look forward to meet him. Thanks. Ken Frazier : Well thanks for your questions John. You know I just have to repeat what I\u2019ve said before for us the major consolidation of the industry type has actually is not our preferred strategy. The best way for us to create sustainable value is through innovation and that\u2019s why we are focused on value added bolt-on opportunities as a priority for us. With respect to the policy implications of inversions and business implications I think we\u2019ll just all have to wait and see how that plays out. And I don\u2019t have any particular comments on the strategies of the companies or what the government\u2019s reactions might be. So I think that\u2019s it from me. Roger Perlmutter : Okay John again as I said before in response to Mark Schoenebaum, that we are eager to bring the benefits of MK-3475 to patients wherever we can demonstrate them. We have breakthrough designation in the Melanoma setting, based on the data that we obtained in patients who had advanced small number of refractory to other therapies. That\u2019s not a broad breakthrough designation for any cancer. And nevertheless opportunity exists always to pursue an accelerated approval where the results are favorable, where you have patients who are refractory to other treatments have no other options and where you can bring something of real benefit, meaningful benefit rapidly to the market place. So we\u2019ll continue to look at that. We\u2019ll have the opportunity and talk about the totality of our program next week at the business review and we\u2019ll touch on a lot of these issues that you raised particularly with respect to squamous carcinomas, head and neck and homological exigencies. Joseph Romanelli : Great thanks, John. Stefani next caller. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks for the questions and again congratulations Peter and good luck in your future endeavors. Just very quickly as it relates to Roger, the question around HCV is there any chance in your view to see this product actually achieve an 8-week duration? And is there a material difference in your opinion between an 8-week and a 12-week duration for an HCV dual combination? Second question, can you help us understand why you chose to work with Agenus for these Merck targets. So may be if you can just walk us through the Agenus transaction and help us understand why Merck wouldn\u2019t be the one generating those targets internally. And then lastly is there anything written into your immunotherapy collaboration announced earlier this year with Pfizer, Incyte and Amgen that will allow you to continue working together? And why I am asking this question is do you have something written into these agreement to prevent a pharma set like outcome where one company helps generate lots of great data and then another companies swoops and basically prevents you from advancing those combinations? Thanks. Roger Perlmutter : Okay. Let me try and get out these here. First of all with respect to HCV treatment you know I think we are always, we and the entire community are always looking for more rapidly affected regiments that can in these patient populations and of course there are a lot of patients infected with hepatitis C virus. You know a sustained biologic response that can be achieved rapidly is a good thing, we and the entire community have moved that back substantially from where we were previously and we have the expectation that we are going to be able to continue to drive that process using our drugs and we\u2019ll have a chance to talk about the additional molecules that we have in the HCV space as the business review next week. So I think that will be a good time to get into that. You asked about the Agenus transactions which we announced earlier this week. We\u2019ve been talking for some time now or quite a lot time with 4-Antibody which is a Swiss company that Agenus acquired in February. So the transaction really was one that we spent a long time talking with 4-Antibody about. They have a technique that enables them to generate human antibodies of high affinity against a variety of different targets and we have worked with them to look at that technology and to see if we could apply it to some of the more difficult targets in the immuno-oncology space. This goes back a while that we\u2019ve been doing this. And so we were prepared to go forward with them to try and explore whether or not those antibodies could actually be used for, they of course were acquired by Agenus and that led to the transaction that was announced but no other special details I think to be concerned about there. And then with respect can some one swoop in and take the data, I guess is the question from our ongoing collaborations with respect to combination parts. Really I don\u2019t think so. I mean these data will give us the opportunity to ultimately see which kinds of combination can be most effective with MK3475. And we hope if there are some very effective ones to commercialize MK3475 in combinations in those indications. So no special things were written in that would have an impact on that. Joseph Romanelli : Okay. Great thanks Seamus for the questions. And Stefanie I think we have time for two more callers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala : I have two questions. On the Q4 our call the company said that H1 EPS would be lower than H2 and of course that was repeated today. But at that point it was also said that Q1 would be the lowest quarter of the year. Is Q1 also still expected to be the lowest quarter of the year? Or if not is Q2 now expected to be the lowest quarter of the year? And secondly I am just curious what are your plans for full Remicade data what meeting is being targeted and will we get important new data at the meeting next week? Thank you Joseph Romanelli : So Peter why don\u2019t you go ahead. Peter Kellogg : Thanks Steve, for the question. Steve, everything you said is correct relative to second half still remains at the higher EPS quarter. Really what happened in the first quarter was that our expenses came in even more favorably than we anticipated. I think everything else was pretty much in line with our plans and our thinking. Some of those are true efficiencies that will help us and some of them will be things that is timing related that will show up in the second half of the year. Very specifically to your second question which is Q2, we didn\u2019t actually provide any specific update on that, so I am going to hesitate to do it right now. But in general I think you can kind of see that the operating expense benefit allowed Q1 to look a little better and so I think we are very much on track to be in the range for the full year. So we haven\u2019t given specific guidance for Q2. Ken Frazier : Great thank you Peter. And Steve with respect to Remicade we do have the full dataset in house. And so we are in the process of now looking through that, cleaning up that dataset and evaluating it with \u2013 assuming things go well, I hope we will be in a position where we can say something at the business review about it because we have the data set and that\u2019s what we are trying to do and then we\u2019ll be able to give a full discussion of what our plans are with respect to that molecule book. We need to make our decisions here first. Joseph Romanelli : Great thanks Steve. And I think Stefanie we have time for one last caller. Operator : Your final question comes from Mark Goodman with UBS. Mark Goodman : Peter congrats from me as well, good luck. Just a follow on to the last comments you are making about expenses. Can you give us a flavor for the beat was more in efficiencies or was it that your timing of things, can you, was it 50-50. Just give us a sense on how we should think about the spending and the gating throughout the year will be helpful. And then on the allergy tales I was kind of curious what the strategy was for that product. I mean no one really talks about the product and then your level of excitement and obviously the doctors make money on these shots, I was curious how what the strategy is with this product? Peter Kellogg : So let me take your OpEx question first Mark thanks. So there is lot of moving parts obviously in the operations of companies the size of Merck. Let me take first R&D I think R&D in general Rogers\u2019 managing quite a broad portfolio. I think there is probably more timing related. That said he\u2019s still targeting to be below prior year overall but he is got a lot of \u2013 so there is \u2013 I won\u2019t speak up for Roger but a lot of things gearing up in the focus areas both in oncology as well as hepatitis, there is lot of clinical work going on. In SG&A I think we have made a lot of effort that we announced last fall to take to kind of retune our cost structure and take headcount out as well as take some operating expenses out that\u2019s a very global effort. I think that we made a big effort to try to move ahead of schedule if you will, we went through this year. So I think so that\u2019s very broad based in SG&A. That said as we go through this year we do anticipate we already know we\u2019ve got a couple of launches we anticipate perhaps more and so we are recognizing we have to make the investments to really launch these products extremely well. So I would think in terms of overall efficiency in SG&A and then some very focused efforts to drive growth opportunities as we go through the second half of the year. Adam Schechter : And Mark to answer your question regarding GRASTEK and RAGWITEK our launch strategy is really focusing on introducing those two products to specialist audience of allergists and \u2013 doctors. We are trying to do that where we get access quickly with the payers and we have some education and market development work that we have to do. I think that we missed the grass season this year so we\u2019ll have to try to do a lot of work to get ready for the grass season next year. But as you look at the overall market there is about 25 million people that have severe allergy, moderate allergies in the United States and only about 3 million people get immuno-therapy shots today. But if you look at that there\u2019s still we estimate about 3 million people that refuse shots all together. So the 3 million that refuse shots are definitely a target for us. But of the 3 million that get shot it\u2019s estimated about 50% of those stop getting their shots after one year. So that will be another target audience for us as we move forward. So every launch is important to us. I am actually heading up to a launch meeting this week and we are looking forward to doing a lot of market development work as we go through this year to prepare for next. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thanks Adam and I turn it over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Let me just summarize very quickly. So in the first quarter we ended up more or less where we expected to be and we are on track for the full year. We saw a solid growth from Januvia immunology vaccines and Isentress and we are also seeing strong progress on our initiative to sharpen the focus on our commercial and R&D expenditures including evaluating what assets are core to our strategy. So more exciting thing for us as we look to the future we see steady and substantial progress in the pipeline. And so we are looking forward to meeting all of you at the business briefing on May 6th so that we can talk about our future in more detail. Thank you very much and we look forward to seeing you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joseph Romanelli : Thank you, Jacky and good morning everyone. We\u2019d also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck\u2019s second quarter 2014 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out just a couple of items. First of all there are a number of items in the GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and you can see them in our press release in table two. This will give you a better sense of our underlying performance. There are three tables in the press release. The first table provides the GAAP results. Table number two reconciles our GAAP P&L to the non-GAAP results for the first quarter and table three provides the sales performance for the company\u2019s business units and our products both on a reported basis and excluding exchange. During the call we will be referring to table two when we discuss the P&L and table three when we talk about revenue performance. Finally I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon Merck\u2019s current beliefs and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The company\u2019s SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. Our SEC filings can be found on the website at merck.com and you can also find our earnings release and all the tables there as well. Now this morning, I\u2019m joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and CEO; Rob Davis, our CFO; Adam Schechter, Head of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, Head of Merck Research Labs. So with that I like to introduce Ken Frazier. Ken? Ken Frazier : Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. Our performance this quarter reflects our continuing progress towards transforming Merck and building a platform for future growth and innovation. Our underlying portfolio is growing and we are particularly pleased to have reported solid growth in our top five brands. We\u2019ve now delivered a strong first half of the year which we believe positions us well to deliver on our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance. I\u2019m excited that as we move into the second half of the year we\u2019re preparing for a series of promising product launches and data presentation. These represent near and longer term opportunities that will allow Merck to drive value for shareholders and society. They include pembrolizumab our Anti-PD-1 Antibody. New treatment options for hepatitis C; Zontivity for post-MI or PAD patients; Sugammadex for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade; suvorexant for the treatment of insomnia; odanacatib for the treatment of osteoporosis; and V503 or 9-valent HPV vaccine. Importantly each of these candidates underscores Merck\u2019s commitment to translating cutting-edge science into medicines and vaccines that have meaningful differentiated attributes. Additionally, we represent the kind of innovation that while making a potentially significant difference to patients also can provide strong value to payers, providers and healthcare systems. This quarter we further sharpened our commercial and R&D focus by continuing to rigorously prioritize our portfolio to ensure that all of our businesses have the potential to be market leaders and create value for shareholders. This approach led us to enter into an agreement with Bayer for the sale of our consumer care business for $14.2 billion and concomitantly to establish a worldwide collaboration with Bayer to develop and market, Adempas, a novel sGC modulator for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as other novel compounds in development. We also entered into an agreement to acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals and its promising portfolio of hepatitis C candidates. These candidates will both complement our hepatitis C therapies currently in development and advance our work to develop highly effective once daily oral, pan-genotypic regimen that could benefit millions of patients around the world. We remain on track to complete this acquisition in the third quarter. These transactions are in keeping with our intention to be the premier research intensive bio pharmaceutical company by focusing on our highest potential growth opportunities and augmenting our pipeline with external assets that can create value and continue to provide an industry leading return of capital to our shareholders. In closing, as I said last quarter this is an exciting time at Merck as we prepare to commercialize the next wave of innovation coming out of our labs. This innovation represents a suite of near and longer term opportunities that will make a meaningful difference to patients, healthcare providers and payers while also creating value for our shareholders. And now I would like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter. Adam Schechter : Thank you Ken, good morning everyone. This morning I will provide you with an overview of Global Human Health second quarter results. My commentary will be on a constant currency basis. Overall, sales reached $9.1 billion. Immunology, diabetes and vaccines continue to be areas of growth. However, these areas were offset by the continued impact of loss of exclusivity of several brands, product divestitures that we announced previously and the biannual price declines in Japan. As we move through 2014, I look forward to speaking with you about our core business and also multiple launches that we are planning for including pembrolizumab, suvorexant and others. I would now like to discuss results from some of our core product areas and I will start with the Januvia franchise. Januvia franchise had sales that reached $1.6 billion and grew 2% in the quarter. Growth was driven by our international markets which represent about half of our total sales. These markets grew 4% as a result of strong growth in Europe and the emerging markets. In the United States, sales declined 1% but volume growth continues to improve. In fact volume growth was 3% in the latest rolling four week average. We are encouraged by the volume trends that we are seeing. We expect that volume growth will continue in the U.S. over the remainder of 2014 as we defend our market share of nearly of 75% and we work to grow the DPP-4 class. Importantly, we continue to expect global sales growth of the Januvia franchise in 2014. Moving to Isentress, sales grew 10% driven by solid performance in Europe and emerging markets and some benefits from buying patterns in the U.S. Growth outside of the U.S. remains an important driver for the brand that help offset slight volume declines we are seeing in the U.S. The START Merck study in treatment naive patients provides long term head-to-head data in our label that will help support the continued growth of Isentress. Next, our immunology business consisting of Remicade and Simponi saw another strong quarter of growth. Sales grew 15% driven by continued strong uptake of Simponi and steady growth of Remicade despite biosimilar entry in some of the smaller EU markets. Now moving to our vaccine business; in second quarter vaccine sales grew 3%; Gardasil growth of 9% and Zostavax growth of 10% were partially offset by declines in Varivax and Pneumovax. Gardasil increases were driven by the U.S. and emerging markets. Sales growth of 16% in the U.S. reflects higher public sector purchases of about $30 million. Zostavax growth came from our ex U.S. launches. In the U.S. we remain focused on educating our customers on the reimbursement process and we are also initiating promotional efforts ahead of the fall flu vaccine season. Zostavax is now available in over 25 markets and we expect additional launches in 2014. Now I\u2019ll briefly outline sales performance on a regional level beginning with the United States. In the U.S. sales growth for the Zetia franchise, Dulera and Gardasil was more than offset by the loss of exclusivity of Temodar, HCV declines and product divestitures. In Europe, we drove strong growth in immunology, diabetes and Isentress. We also saw a continued generic erosion for Nasonex as well as declines for our HCV products. Japan sales declined 6% primarily due to the biennial price decreases and the negative impact of suspended promotion for HPV vaccines. Sales in emerging markets grew 2% on good growth from vaccines, acute care products and Isentress. China grew 6% and growth in other important emerging markets such as Brazil and Turkey were partially offset by continuing pressure in Mexico, Egypt and Eastern Europe. For the full year, we continue to expect that the emerging markets will be good growth drivers for us. Moving to the future, we are looking forward to important launches and we are investing in pre-launch preparations. First on suvorexant, we\u2019re anticipating regulatory action in the middle of August. Following that we need to await the DEA decision on product scheduling. We anticipate launching late this year or early in 2015. We are very excited about the potential launch of suvorexant. Second and importantly, we are ready to launch pembrolizumab as we continue to expect regulatory action by October 28, this year. We are resourcing the launch with a focus on clinical capabilities that will help address the needs of oncologist, our payers and cancer patients. We built our capabilities with an emphasis on assembling the best internal and external talent. Upon approval, we will rapidly engage oncologist to ensure they are prepared to appropriately prescribe this potentially first in class breakthrough product. We will partner with payers to ensure that pembro is readily accessible for patients and we will have support for patients with reimbursement assistance. The anticipated approval of pembro would mark the first approval from our exciting clinical development immuno-oncology program. More importantly this will be a tremendous opportunity for Merck to help make a difference for patients and their families. Let me be clear, we are ready to launch pembro. In summary, Global Human Health drove growth of key franchises including diabetes, immunology and vaccines. We are prioritizing our investments and we are intent on driving future growth with our core brands, with our core markets and with our exciting new launch opportunities. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague Rob Davis. Rob Davis : Thanks, Adam. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here this morning for my first earnings call as CFO. We\u2019ve had a strong first half of 2014 and our second quarter results demonstrated that we continue to sharpen our focus as a company. This morning I\u2019ll provide additional color on our P&L and comment on our outlook for the rest of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. On this basis, we earned $0.85 per share in the second quarter as compared to $0.84 per share in the prior quarter. Our EPS was driven by growth in key brands and effective cost management, which was partially offset by patent expiries and divestitures. Turning to the top line, total revenue in the quarter decreased 1% year over year. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on the revenues this quarter. As Adam stated our sales in the pharmaceutical business were driven by solid growth in key brands. Animal health revenues increased $27 million, 3% year over year, excluding exchange or 9% if we also excluded the impact of the Zilmax suspension. Our Animal Health results were driven by the strong performance of bravecto, our newly launched oral flea and tick treatment for dogs in the US and Europe and the strong growth from our poultry business. Consumer care revenues increased $100 million or 20% excluding exchange. Sales in the quarter were driven by sales of Claritin and Coppertone. As you may recall, we had a onetime unfavorable adjustment to sales in the second quarter of 2013, which represents a single significant percentage of the positive year over year comparison this quarter. Excluding those actions, Consumer Care global sales grew 4% including 1 percentage point of negative impact due to foreign exchange. As a reminder, we expect the divestiture of the consumer care business to close this year. Regarding the joint venture with AstraZeneca, revenue from the JV was $316 million and benefited from the timing of purchases in the quarter. As expected, Astra exercised its option to end our partnership on June 30th. As a result we will no longer record supply sales or equity income from the JV in the second half of this year. Moving to expenses, gross margin was 72.6% in the quarter, representing a decline of about 300 basis points from last year. The decline was the result of product mix and inventory write-offs primarily for Victrelis. We continue to expect the 2014 full year gross margin to be slightly lower than 2013\u2019s full year ratio of 74.3%. Marketing and administrative expenses were $208 million lower than prior year driven by reductions in promotion and direct selling costs. While we continue to focus our resources on key markets and core products we\u2019re also preparing for additional product launches later this year. We will invest in these launches to maximize our opportunity for growth. We\u2019re also making resource allocation decisions so that we remain on track for full year marketing and administrative reductions versus 2013. Likewise research and development expenses were $232 million lower year over year as a result of our continued prioritization and rationalization efforts. As we said last quarter our R&D expense for our current portfolio will increase in the back half of the year. In addition we will also invest in the HCV assets we will acquire from Idenix and the research collaboration with Bayer. As a result, we now expect our R&D expense in the second half of 2014 to be a few hundred million dollars higher than the second half of 2013. Overall, we continue to expect our full year R&D expense to be below 2013 levels. Finally, on our tax rate our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.2% in the quarter which was in line with our expectations for the year. We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full year to be between 24% and 26%. Now our outlook for the rest of the year, on the top line we are reconfirming our revenue guidance up $42.4 billion to $43.2 billion at current exchange rates. We\u2019re narrowing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.43 to $3.53 which excludes a potential impact from a devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. This range reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year and includes roughly $0.06 to $0.09 of dilution from the divestiture of the consumer care business, the resulting research collaboration with Bayer and the acquisition of Idenix and its HCV assets. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn between $4.44 and $4.77 in 2014. As noted earlier both marketing and administrative and R&D expenses in 2014 are expected to be lower than 2013. Due to the strength of the results in the first six months of the year and the additional developmental costs associated with the Bayer collaboration and Idenix portfolio. We now expect EPS in the second half of the year to be generally consistent with the first of the half of 2014. With that, I\u2019d like to provide a quick update on capital allocation. While we continue to focus on improving our productivity and transforming our business model, we also remain committed and focused to return cash to shareholders. As we said, during the investor briefing in May, we are going to use the proceeds from the Bayer transaction to augment our pipeline with business development activity and returning capital to shareholders. We\u2019ve delivered on that commitment by agreeing to acquire Idenix for $3.85 billion and we expect to deploy a significant amount of the after tax proceeds to repurchase shares this year. We now project our average diluted shares to be slightly lower than the 2.95 billion share count we gave last year for 2014 depending on the timing of the purchases. In summary, we feel good about the results and are reassured by the strength of the performance in the first half of the year. That strength is allowing us to invest in the business in the second half of 2014, meet our guidance targets despite the dilution of two transactions and return cash to shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to Roger. Roger Perlmutter : During the second quarter, our R&D organization made substantial progress in advancing important new therapies. In April, our regulatory affairs group obtained FDA approval for Zontivity, the first thrombin receptor antagonist ever introduced into clinical practice. Zontivity has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack stroke and the need for procedures to restore blood flow to the heart in patients with a history of heart attack or a peripheral arterial disease who are already receiving optimal therapy. Because of the increased bleeding risk associated with this anti-platelet therapy, Zontivity should not be used in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. We are excited about the potential for Zontivity to improve outcomes in patients at high risk for heart attacks and are working assiduously to make certain that heart specialists are aware of the clinical data supporting the use of Zontivity. In Europe, we\u2019re engaged with the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, who are evaluating our file for this product. Meanwhile, during the second quarter, we advanced a regulatory review of Suvorexant, our orexin antagonist for improving sleep in patients with insomnia. You will recall that we submitted our response to the FDA\u2019s complete response later in February. We\u2019ve worked closely with the agency and are now discussing features of product labeling. The PDUFA date for action by the FDA with respect to Suvorexant is August 14. We\u2019re also making progress in supporting the regulatory review of V503 our 9 valent human papillomavirus vaccine designed to extend protection from the risk of cervical cancer across approximately 90% of vaccine genotypes associated with this disease. We are eager to bring this important new vaccine to world markets. During the second quarter, the FDA accepted our filing for pembrolizumab in the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma refractory to all available therapies. FDA review of our filing including a number of clinical and manufacturing inspections is proceeding in advance of the PDUFA date of October 28. During the second quarter, we also filed for approval of pembrolizumab in the treatment of advanced melanoma in Europe. This file has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. At the American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting in June, we\u2019ve summarized a very large body of information that we are assembling regarding the use of pembrolizumab both by itself and in combination with other agents in the treatment of malignant disease. Currently, we have pivotal studies underway or in planning for the treatment of malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and bladder cancer and we have early evidence of activity in several other important tumor types. In all, we are testing pembrolizumab in a treatment of more than 30 different malignancies. Our clinical development organization working closely with the bio-process groups involved in supplying clinical material has managed to maintain a very challenging schedule of patient enrollment with a goal of determining the full spectrum of activity of pembrolizumab. We have submitted numerous abstracts for the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in September and we will hope to share quite a bit of new data with you regarding pembrolizumab at that time. At our May 6 Business Review in Boston, we described our plans for the development of novel treatment paradigms for patients infected with hepatitis C virus we have made excellent progress in advancing our registration enabling program using a fixed dose combination of MK-5172 and MK-8742 in treatment na\u00efve and previously treated patients and those with and without evidence of significant liver injury and in more complicated patients with renal insufficiency or who have simultaneous inflections with human immunodefficiency virus. Our goal as I have made plain, is to advance an effective therapy for all patients irrespective of the genotype of their HCV infection and regardless of co morbidities and to achieve a very high rate of sustained virologic response following less than six weeks of active therapy. To this end, we have initiated studies combining the MK-5172, 8742 doublet regimen with Gilead\u2019s sofosbuvir. We will use information from this triplet regimen to advance our internal programs that employ a uridine analogue HCV polymerase inhibitor to complement MK-5172, 8742 therapy. Of course this was the reason that we pursued the acquisition of Idenix to gain access to their advanced nucleoside-based polymerase inhibitors. We\u2019re looking forward to working with our new colleagues at Idenix and we\u2019re very encouraged by what we have seen to this point. We believe quite strongly that these new regimens which are advancing quickly in the clinic will form the basis of rapid genotype independent definitive therapy for millions of patients at risk for liver failure, as a result of HCV infection. We also announced in May that through the sale of our consumer products division to Bayer we will gain access to a set of soluble guanylate cyclase activators including Adempas. We\u2019re working closely with our colleagues at Bayer as we assume shared responsibility for the development of Adempas which is approved in the United States for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in two different settings and which is being studied as a possible treatment for pulmonary hypertension and a third setting in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Meanwhile we continue to actively prosecute our C. difficile toxin antibody program, our novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor doravirine for HIV therapy. Letermovir for the prophylaxis and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, our beta secretase program in patients suffering from or at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, our development of long acting DPP-4 inhibitors for diabetes and our late stage program testing the ability of anacetrapib to reduce cardio-vascular risk in patients on optimal cholesterol lowering therapy among many, many others. Despite this deep clinical agenda, we have managed to reduce expenses versus 2013 largely through operating efficiencies. As Rob noted, we do expect that clinical trial expenses will increase in the second half of the year principally as a result of the large set of late-stage opportunities in cancer treatment that we see for pembrolizumab. Nevertheless through rigorous portfolio prioritization, we will ensure a highly disciplined approach to expense management. Joe. Joe Romanelli : Thank you Roger, and thank you Jackie. Before we open up the line to Q&A just a quick reminder to get to as many callers as possible please limit your questions to one or two that way we can try to make sure we cover everyone. Jackie, why don\u2019t we go ahead and take the first caller. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of John Boris from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. John Boris : First question, Roger. Just possible to maybe articulate -- obviously there is an upcoming oncology meeting, ESMO, and then AASLD -- what we might be looking to see coming out of those conferences in terms of additional data that you could be presenting? Then a question for Ken and Rob. Certainly been some speculation in the press about divestiture of additional non-core late-lifecycle pharma-type assets. Can you walk us through where you might be within that process and, upon a sale of such assets, what you might be using the proceeds for? Roger Perlmutter : John, with respect to ASMO we have submitted a substantial number of abstracts but so far we don\u2019t know exactly which ones of those will be accepted, suffice it to say that we will have the opportunity to present a substantial amount of new data with respect to pembrolizumab and similarly for AASLD where as you know our C-SWIFT regimen that I mentioned which is a triplet regimen that will give us a sense of where we stand with respect to short duration, active therapy we won\u2019t have all the data by then but we should have some available data and we will hope to have the opportunity to describe that to you at that time. Ken Frazier : John, thanks for the question, so with respect to what\u2019s been reported in the press we obviously can\u2019t comment on those rumors but what I can say that as a broader question about focus and prioritization, we communicated last October that we\u2019re going to look across the entire business to determine if assets might have more value outside the Company or as part of our business. So for example with these diversified brands as they are known inside Merck, those products can be very important to our business in the emerging market. We have to look at whether or not selling all or part of those brands is going to make sense to our business over the longer term. You have already seen us take action with respect to MCC, Saphris, ophthalmology, and some select diversified brands as part of our Aspen deal. And all I can say is that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities as appropriate going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Colin Bristow : Morning. Thanks for taking the questions. On hep C, can you outline the development plan for the Idenix nuc and when we should next see data on this asset? Then perhaps, while we are on the nuc, can you remind us of what gave you comfort to acquire this, in light of the turbulent history with that class? Then on M&A, can you just talk about your appetite for large-scale M&A, particularly in the context of a tax inversion? Thank you. Roger Perlmutter : With respect to hep C, as you mentioned there is a turbulent history that you described for nucleoside polymerase inhibitors in hep C. What we\u2019ve learned over time is that the structural features of those get one more comfort with respect to the safety characteristics and the Idenix nucleoside inhibitor has those characteristics as we learned. And in addition we had exposure to nearly 100 subjects and some of it for a reasonable period of time without evidence of significant hepato-toxicity so that gives us some confidence going forward; we of course also know as they presented the data that there is a very substantial reduction in viral burden across numerous genotypes using their nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. So in many respect to sort of the ideal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor we will be studying that in combination with ours just as soon as we can gain access to the molecule, but of course we don\u2019t have access to it until the time that the deal actually closes. So that\u2019s the general plan and we\u2019ll hope of course to be able present quite a bit of data at AASLD as I mentioned. Ken Frazier : And relating the other question on M&A I would say that Merck is not interested in pursuing a business development deal either solely or primarily for the specific purpose of tax inversion. Obviously every company takes a very different path to drive long term shareholder value. As we\u2019ve said before, our goal is to be the premier research driven biopharmaceutical company; our strategy is built on innovation in the pipeline and so from our perspective that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on, delivering novel programs like our Anti-PD-1 program and our HCV program. We believe this is the best path for Merck to drive sustainable growth in shareholder value over the long term. So we are not focusing on a major consolidation of the industry type transaction as a preferred strategy. We continue to look for value added bolt on opportunity to augment our pipeline like Idenix. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Thanks for taking the question. First, just on the DPP-4 side, it's interesting you mentioned you expect, I think you said, global growth in 2014 for the franchise, which, compared to where we were a few months or a year or so ago, would not really be news but interesting. Just thinking about how you would forecast that going forward, is that something again where we might see just flat or lowish single-digit growth like we saw this quarter? Or do you see any of the investments you and some of your competitors are making in regenerating the growth of that franchise to make more of an impact as we go forward here? Then the second question I just have, related to one of the other questions, in terms of future data later this year. Just curious about ASH and also the San Antonio breast convention, do you think you guys will have anything on immuno-oncology assets in those, either on the hematology side or on breast cancer, later in the year? Thanks. Adam Schechter : This is Adam thanks for your question on the DPP-4 class. Let me give you some additional context on the Januvia franchise and where we\u2019re standing. As I said before our second quarter sales were $1.6 billion which was 2% growth and that was from 4% growth outside the U.S. and minus 1% growth in the U.S. So let me focus on the U.S. first. We have always said that what\u2019s most important is to watch TRx volume, there is going to be wholesale or buying pattern changes that occur over year and if you look at the second quarter this year we had a tough comparison to the second quarter last year which as you may recall we grew 9% over the prior year. So that\u2019s what I always focus on, the underlying volume. The good news is that the TRx trends right now are more positive than they have been. We have 3% growth over the rolling four weeks and if you look at the past two weeks we actually had 4% growth versus the same week prior year. So we expect the growth in TRX to continue as we go to the second half of the year and that\u2019s why we\u2019re cautiously optimistic on the volume increases that we\u2019re seeing in the United States. In the international markets we had good volume growth in Europe, Canada and emerging markets and we maintain our strong market leadership position. Those were partially offset a bit by the April 1st price reductions that occurred in Japan. When you look at the strength of our franchise we have maintained about 65% share globally and about a 75% share of the class in the U.S. So really is about getting patients to be considered for DPP-4s prior to sulfonylureas and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re beginning to see some progress in the U.S. and remain cautiously optimistic as we expect growth for the second half of the year. Roger Perlmutter : And with respect to presentations at ASH on the San Antonio breast cancer conference, we have studies in both hematologic malignancies and in breast cancer and we do expect that we\u2019ll have an opportunity to present some of those results again the pembrolizumab program is far ranging. So we\u2019re looking forward to those as well, of course they occur somewhat later in the year or be in the next year. Joseph Romanelli : And Jackie could we turn it over to the next caller please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger - Morgan Stanley Yes, thanks very much. My question is, could you just update us, please, on the expected readout timing, so when investors should expect to see a press release on the results of three cardiovascular trials, IMPROVE-IT, TECOS, and the anacetrapib Phase III? Thank you. Roger Perlmutter : Dave it\u2019s roger. With respect to improve we are expecting that the last patient visit will occur sometime in September, of course this is a very large study, more than 18,000 patients study conducted nearly a decade so it will take a long time to pull together all the data, clean the files have all the queries go out to the sites et cetera. But over a period of some weeks thereafter that will get done, the database log will take place and then we will analyze it and then of course top line data will be shared with you. The situation with TECOS is similar, except that their last patient visit is in December. So again we are not going to be able to share data from that and of course that it\u2019s under supervision of an academic group that will do it until after that database has been cleaned up and all that\u2019s done so that you will see next year. And then with respect to anacetrapib, there of course we are conducting interim analysis and the first interim analysis is not going to be available to us until the early part of next year, or sometime during the first half of next year is the expectation and we will share all of these things with you just as soon as we have them available. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Adam, on pembrolizumab. Roger, just curious to know if, with the European filing, were you granted accelerated assessment? Can you give us a sense for timing of that approval? Adam, for you, can you just help to frame the market opportunity for pembro in the US? Patients resistant to Yervoy, what is the market opportunity size for that? What would you expect the launch to look like? And would you anticipate that there would be some off-label use? Thanks. Roger Perlmutter : Yes, Jami for pembrolizumab in the EU, we are working with our repertoires there in order to get a closer assessment of what the timing will be for the filing. In Europe, there is a different strategy as you know in terms of the timing of assessment. So I can\u2019t really speak to that, I think the best thing to plan for is a traditional standard review and we will let you know as we hear more from our repertoires, they\u2019ve just accepted the file. Adam Schechter : Hi, Jami this is Adam. So as we said before, we expect regulatory action by October 28 this year in U.S. and we are preparing for the launch obviously. We realize that with the label that we get from the FDA, we will have to be very clear on the appropriate utilization and where physicians need to use the product based upon the label that we get from the FDA which will be in ipi-refractory patients. So we are going to be very clear on the appropriate utilization of the product. Now if you look at physicians that prescribe Yervoy which is primarily for melanoma, you can see it\u2019s a very small fraction of the total number of oncologists across the United States. And in fact if you look at the total number of oncologists, the ones that are really prescribing Yervoy are less than 15% to 20% of the total. So we are going to really focus in on the physicians that are prescribing Yervoy to really know who the ipi-refractory patients, where that will be seen and where we will be best able to reach them. We believe we will be able to get to each of those physicians within 7 to 10 days after the launch of the product. With regard to off label utilization, we will not promote nor will we do anything to encourage off-label utilization, however we realize in certain situations with cancer patients that that does occur. Our manufacturing facilities will be able to supply if need be the utilization and we have enough supply but we don\u2019t look to try to encourage that, nor do we try to forecast what that can be. We just want to make sure if it happens that there is supply for it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Mark Schoenebaum : Maybe a couple for Roger, if I may. Also, welcome, Rob, to the call; it's nice to hear your voice. Roger, on hepatitis C, a lot of us on Wall Street, I think are waiting for the data that you might have at AASLD, which is looking at the doublet-plus-Sovaldi in a 4-week regimen. I would just love to get your thoughts -- I think everybody would love to get your thoughts on whether or not you think that generating high SVR rates at 4 weeks is a high-probability event. Just scientifically, what your thoughts around 4 weeks are? Then number two, I and at least some other Merck observers always felt like you guys have felt like it is at least a possibility you might be able to accelerate the pembro lung filing. I just, Roger, would love to get your updated comments on that, since I haven't heard you speak about it since the analyst meeting. Thanks so much. Roger Perlmutter : Okay, Mark. First of all, with respect to the hep C data, we do expect that we will have a chance to share at least some of the data from C-SWIFT at the AASLD meeting. And my view is that there is a high likelihood actually that there will be good responses at four weeks in a triplet combination, based on the potency of the drugs that are being used and the information that we already have available from combination regimens that have a six-week end point. As you know, the determination of what optimal duration of therapy is for infectious diseases is often empirical, and we struggle with that, and we still look at those kinds of things, for example, for the question of how long one treats bacterial osteomyelitis is an example. And so, we don\u2019t know what the ideal treatment regimen is, but my guess is that we can get to a four-week regimen, and that\u2019s of course why we are doing the study and we are eager to see what the results look like. And with respect to pembrolizumab in lung, we have lot of opportunities to evaluate potential filing strategies, we have quite a number of ongoing studies in non-small cell lung cancer, we are not going to go through what that filing strategy could be, but as we see the data we are certainly working very closely with FDA to understand how we could get this drug to market sooner in fact the data supported it. Joseph Romanelli : Thanks Mark. And Jackie, we would open up the line to next caller please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Tim Anderson : If I could just go back and clarify the answer to the question about M&A and potential targets, Ken, is it safe to assume that you are looking primarily at bolt-ons? That's the term you used in answering that other question. Second question is on Animal Health. Earlier in the year, you talked about having potentially very different outcomes with Consumer Health versus Animal Health. Should we assume that you are keeping the Animal Health business? Is that the safest assumption? Then last question is just Merck's opinion in general on the CTLA-4 antagonists and whether you view those as promising in terms of combining them with the PD-1s. You have at least one trial where you are looking at a combination regimen, I believe. Ken Frazier : Thanks for the questions Tim. As we tried to say before, we are not interested in pursuing a major consolidation of the industry-type transaction as our preferred approach. We are much more focused on value added bolt-on opportunities and business developments that augments our pipeline, and I would say Idenix is an exemplar of that. I also think you should look in the future to see us continue to demonstrate that kind of value creating business development deal is really a priority for us as a company to augment on pipeline. Turning to Animal Health, when we made the consumer announcement, we also said that we plan to augment our Animal Health business with additional business development. We continue to look at this business as a key growth driver that has industry leadership, healthy margins, and a strong market outlook. So, we will look for opportunities to supplement our diverse portfolio in that business again in ways that create long-term shareholder value. Roger Perlmutter : Yeah, with respect Tim to CTLA-4, as you know we have embarked upon a number of different combination studies using a variety of different sorts of molecules with pembrolizumab of standard chemotherapeutic regimens, oncolytic vaccines, as well as immunomodulatory agents, our owned and others, and CTLA-4 is in the mix. I think another question really will be how much additional efficacy do you get, and is the toxicity of the regimen tolerable, and I think there are concerns with respect to both of those, but there may be opportunities. We are just sort of eager to see the results, and no one should expect that the results are predictable with the new regimen until you\u2019ve actually done the studies, that\u2019s what we are going to do. Tim Anderson : Great. Joseph Romanelli : Thank you for the questions Tim, and Jackie, next caller. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much for the questions. I actually have three for Roger. With regard to KEYNOTE-006 in melanoma, can you just update us on the timing? If there is an interim analysis, the timing of that? And how important, can you tell us, is comparative data of pembro versus ipi in the treatment-naive melanoma setting, and why this wouldn't happen very soon considering the pace at which your competitor is filing in melanoma? Second is pembro in lung cancer. Has the interim evaluation of response rates in KEYNOTE-010 yet occurred or are we waiting for that? I believe it says that there is a response rate evaluation. And can you just update us on whether or not those data could be provided to FDA for a potential early lung filing? Then lastly on C-SWIFT, when would you start or hope to start a triple combination with the Idenix nuc? And would you consider going head-to-head if C-SWIFT is meaningfully positive with the Idenix nuc? Thanks a lot. Ken Frazier : Okay Seamus, great questions. First of all with respect KEYNOTE-006, we are expecting to have the data in February of next year, that\u2019s what we have described, and we are moving along very well on that. With respect to the KEYNOTE-010 interim analysis, we will have an interim analysis for KEYNOTE-010. We do not have the data in front of us right now, and those data like all of our data particularly since we have a file under regulatory review, all of our data will be shared with the agency. That\u2019s one of a number of options that we have looking at the potential for demonstrating to regulatory authorities that there is an opportunity to introduce pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer. We\u2019ll look carefully at all of those, and for C-SWIFT, again we will be presenting some of those data at AASLD. We will have the opportunity to study the Idenix compound once we gain access to it, and of course that depends upon the completion of the acquisition of Idenix. We will move just as quickly as we can, and yes of course, my expectation is that when we have access to the compound, if we are encouraged by those results, we will prepare to go head to head against any regimen because our belief is it\u2019s going to be superior. That\u2019s why we are doing the study. Joseph Romanelli : And Jacky, next caller please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman : Good Morning, Roger. If you could talk about the progress you are making for the internal development of some of these non-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. Second, Adam, can you talk about emerging markets a little bit? China just seems to be a little weaker than we'd think it would be, and you mentioned some of the other countries, Eastern Europe. What is going on there and Mexico? Obviously, we know what is going on in Egypt. Then, for 2015, the formulary changes should be announced pretty soon. I was curious if you can maybe preview that a little bit. Are there any major changes that we should be expecting for 2015? And specifically, we're definitely focused on Januvia. Have you been as aggressive this year as last year to make sure you're maintaining that on formulary and not getting kicked off on the exclusionary formularies? Thanks. Roger Perlmutter : So, Mark yes, with respect to other checkpoint approaches beyond pembrolizumab, we\u2019ve mentioned the anti-GITR approach. Again, that\u2019s a stimulatory agent and that program is just beginning. So, we are starting that program now, and we have numerous others that are moving along and heading towards clinical trials. So a lot of good progress have been made in characterizing those agents. And in particular, in identifying those that we think are most promising based on a set of clinical samples and pre-clinical studies that we can do, so we are doing quite well on those and looking forward to seeing the data as we go forward. Adam Schechter : And Mark, this is Adam. With regard to emerging markets, we had 2% growth ex-Forex. And as I said in the past, there are certain things that happen in terms of timing of tenders and lumpiness in the emerging market business. But in addition to that, we are seeing some pressure in Egypt but also in Eastern Europe, in the Ukraine for example. At the same time, we are seeing strength in certain markets like Turkey and Brazil. We continue to believe that emerging markets will be growth drivers for us. We continue to invest significantly across the emerging markets. And if you look at China, the 6% growth actually is a bit better than the growth we\u2019ve had in the past couple of quarters, and we expect that China will continue to be a good growth driver for us in the second half of the year. In addition, Mexico, we believe will be an accelerator for us in the second half of the year. So although, this quarter was a little bit lumpy versus other quarters, we expect that we will have good growth in the emerging markets. With regard to formulary changes in the U.S., those are still in progress as we speak. We have had very good access capabilities across managed care for the portfolio of products that we have in United States, and we continue to work very closely with our managed care customers, and we expect that in 2015 we will have good formulary access for Januvia and other products as well. It\u2019s too early to have exact numbers on access, but overall, we feel that things are moving forward in a good way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a good quarter. Adam, could you provide us a little bit more color on Remicade and Simponi? Both were very strong. Just wondering if you could just talk about the key drivers in the major markets and also what kind of penetration you are seeing from the biosimilar. I apologize if you mentioned this already, but on Gardasil in Japan, I believe there were some safety concerns. I am just wondering if there has been any update on that. Thank you. Adam Schechter : So let me start with Remicade and Simponi. So we had combined growth of the franchise of 15% excluding Forex. If you look more specifically, Simponi grew 37% and Remicade grew 9%. We continue to see strength as we are launching Simponi around the world, and if you look at our growth for Simponi, it\u2019s faster than any of the other anti-TNFs in the marketplace. As we continue to launch, we are seeing increased market share, patient days of therapy, and penetration rates with the UC indication that we have for Simponi as well. As you look at Remicade, we continue to have good growth, but it\u2019s driven by the gastro indications. And if you look in about 20% of the smaller European markets, biosimilars are available. Up until now, we\u2019ve been very aggressive and we\u2019ve been able to maintain a good bit of our share despite the entry of the biosimilars. It will continue to be tough. We continue to expect increase in competition from the biosimilars, but we have been very successful to date, and we will continue to be successful we believe as we move forward. But the real growth driver as we move forward is going to be SIMPONI particularly in markets where biosimilars of Remicade are available. If you look at Gardasil, there was last year suspended promotion in Japan and that occurred in 2013, and it was due to a government decision that they made. We continue to believe in the large amount of safety data we have for Gardasil, and we continue to work with the government in order to see how they can move forward to have the proactive recommendation moving forward, and we are excited about both HPV vaccines and also the launch of V503 as we move forward. The second thing I\u2019d say is that we will be lapping the Japan issue in the second half of this year. So we expect in the second half we won\u2019t have that as a reduction in the ability to grow Gardasil because we are lapping in June. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff Holford : Give this maybe to Roger. Your latest thoughts on your combination strategy in immunotherapy, and whether you think you will need to acquire or make more exclusive in-licensing deals to support that strategy. Then just secondly, on [CART-I] (ph) immunotherapy, just give us a sense of your level of enthusiasm for this approach. Thank you. Ken Frazier : Jeff, we\u2019ve adopted the approach of looking as closely as possible at pembrolizumab monotherapy, because my view is that we need to understand how well pembrolizumab works as monotherapy before we can put into context how combinations might work. And to be clear, there is also a mechanistic issue to the extent that we understand how pembrolizumab actually works. We\u2019ll do a better job of picking combinations. I don\u2019t doubt the combinations will be used, that\u2019s what happens in cancer therapy, the question is which ones, and one can argue that radiotherapy or conventional cytotoxics might be good or vaccines might be good or other checkpoint inhibitors, and to really sort that out, we need to understand what\u2019s the base of monotherapy and then to understand what mechanistic improvements can we engineer to actually drive higher response rates and more durability beyond what we already have. So we\u2019re looking at all of those things. We are doing strategic combinations in the clinic based on what we see pre-clinically. I don\u2019t see right now a need for us to acquire other molecules for combinations, but I do not have any hesitation about acquiring them either through licensing or through acquisition if that turns out to be the right thing to do. So, we\u2019re definitely going to move forward with those kinds of programs, and with respect to the CAR approach, I think in the setting of hematologic malignancy for a certain number of individuals, there is no doubt that engineering of T-cells, introducing them into patients can have a dramatic effect. I think we don\u2019t know yet from the limited studies that have been published of what the balance of efficacy and safety might be and whether that approach will have a greater breadth in, for example, solid tumors. Time will tell, that work is being pursued in other organizations and of course largely in academic centers, and we\u2019re certainly interested in following them. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, great, thanks Jeff. Jacky I think we have time for two more callers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen Thank you. I have two questions. First for Dr. Perlmutter, should Merck look at and file the Phase II subset of KEYNOTE-010? Would that in any way inhibit the ability to file the full Phase III data when the study concludes in September 2015? Then the second thing, the second question is : Is Merck prohibited in any way from purchasing the Novartis flu vaccines business and selling flu vaccines on a global basis, given the vaccines JV with Sanofi, since they are a major flu provider? Or is Merck not interested in flu? Thank you. Roger Perlmutter : Okay. So first with respect to KEYNOTE-010, and more generally regulatory agencies are always interested in more data, so are we, so as we have more data available, we make those data available to FDA and other regulatory agencies, and there is prohibition based on -- for example, an early filing if that were to be performed on coming back with subsequent filings. So, in general, without getting into details, there is nothing about early strategic approach that limits what you can do later if that\u2019s the gist of your question. Roger Perlmutter : And with regard to flu vaccine, outside of the EU where we have the JV, we have freedom to operate within the JV area, we have to work with the JV to see if it is a possibility. Flu is of interest in certain areas, but it\u2019s not something that we have aggressively pursued in the past. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thanks Steve. And Jackie, I think we have time for one last call. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Just two here. First I just would love to get your updated thoughts on the HCV market and the durability of that opportunity. I guess, based on the rapid adoption of Sovaldi this year, does that change your view at all in terms of the HCV adoption curve over time? The second question, it is a follow-up on the established products unit, and I don't know if it's the one you will answer, but what are the factors that weigh into a decision here? I guess my question is how much of this is based on the performance and health of Merck's core business and pipeline, so continued pipeline success would suggest a greater likelihood of further divestitures versus a decision on that unit that is solely based on the value you believe you could achieve for those assets in the market. Thanks so much. Ken Frazier : Let me start with the HCV market, and the HCV market is a very large market in the United States, but also globally, and although there has been success from competition there recently, we still believe there will be a significant amount of potential for additional agents moving into the future, particularly shorter-acting agents. There is 3 million patients if you look at the number of patients in the U.S. alone, and in fact only a certain number of patients can get through the physicians that treat hepatitis C in any point of time. Also, if you look, we believe that you can only get about 90,000 patients through the system in a given year. So when you have 2 million patients and you\u2019ve got 90,000 to 100,000 go through the year, it tells you you\u2019re going to have a market for quite some time. In addition to that, there will be a cirrhosis wave that we believe will occur over the years to patients that have HCV and then develop into cirrhotic patients, so there will be a rational reason to treat these patients as they go through the system overtime. So, we believe in the long term growth for this market. With regard to diversified brands, we look at the diversified brands in a global basis, and we look at brands that fit into our therapeutic categories, so for example, we have a primary care business and we have diversified brands in primary care and we are in the physicians\u2019 offices any way. There is reason for us to continue to maintain those brands. On the other hand, when we look at ophthalmology for example, we had brands that we weren\u2019t in the office for any other reason, but for a few products for ophthalmology, we didn\u2019t have any new products coming in the future in ophthalmology. We didn\u2019t have a pipeline in ophthalmology. Therefore, it made sense for us to divest those products. Same thing with Saphris. We didn\u2019t have a reason to call many of those physicians in the future based upon our pipeline. So we look at them as whether they fit into our core today or in the future, whether we have pipeline in the future for calling on those physicians that we\u2019re calling on with those brands today, and of course we look at the potential growth of those particularly in the emerging markets. Joseph Romanelli : Thanks Adam and Chris, thank you for your questions. And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Ken. Ken Frazier : We had a strong first half, we are very reassured by the outlook for the full year. We have been able to reconfirm our top line guidance despite divestitures that we\u2019ve been able to narrow our EPS guidance while covering the $0.69 dilution from the two deals we\u2019ve talked about. What\u2019s more important, what\u2019s more critical, what\u2019s more exciting for us is the innovative momentum in our pipeline, and we look forward to regulatory updates in the second half of the year with respect to pembro, suvorexant, and also filing odanacatib, Bridion, and another things in the second half of the year. This business is ultimately about innovation and we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re seeing innovation momentum at Merck. Thank you very much. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, thank you, Jackie and good morning, everyone. We\u2019d also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck\u2019s third quarter 2014 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to remind you of a couple of items. First, there are a number of items in the GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. We've excluded these items at our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and you can see them in our press release in table two. This will give you a better sense of our underlying performance. There are three tables in the press release. The first table provides the GAAP results, Table No. 2 reconciles our GAAP P&L to the non-GAAP results and Table 3 provides sales performance for the Company\u2019s business units and our products, both on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange. During the call, we will be referring to Table 2 when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 when we talk about revenue performance. Finally, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon Merck\u2019s current beliefs and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The Company\u2019s SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. Our SEC filings can be found on the web site at merck.com and you can also find our earnings release and all the tables there as well. Now with that, I'd like to say good morning to Ken Frazier, our Chairman and CEO; Rob Davis, our CFO; Adam Schechter, Head of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, Head of Merck Research Labs. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken Frazier. Ken? Ken Frazier : Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining the call today. We again reported solid earnings this morning, but before I discuss our performance, please allow me to remind you of the strategy that consistently guides us. Merck remains focused on bringing forward medicines and vaccines that make a difference to patients, payers and healthcare systems around the world. In a healthcare marketplace, where resources are increasingly scarce, our strategy continues to be all about meaningful innovation. To accomplish this, last October, we announced our global initiative to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus, redesign our operating model and reduce our cost base. We launched this multi-year initiative to transform Merck into a more competitive, more innovative company and to build a platform for sustained future growth. Now one year later, I'm pleased to report that this quarter's results reflect the steady progress we've made in each of these areas. We identified four areas of focus where we will compete to win and our investments are paying off. In our diabetes business, we reallocated resources and invested significantly in JANUVIA and have now reported our second consecutive quarter of growth in the U.S. and in international market. This marks an important turnaround from where we were last year. Our acute care business grew by double digits this quarter as we're now seeing the impact of our investments. These brands will continue to be key drivers of growth in emerging markets. Our vaccines business remains a fundamental contributor to Merck, despite a decline this quarter due to the timing of U.S. public sector purchases. We're also looking forward the regulatory action for V503, our next generation 9-valent vaccine for HPV. And in oncology, our integrated business unit has made strides to file and launch KEYTRUDA. This quarter, we received approval from the FDA for KEYTRUDA, the first anti-PD1 therapy approved in the U.S. for advanced melanoma. And I'm happy to report that we also recently received breakthrough designation from the FDA for KEYTRUDA as a potential therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We continue to study KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types and are encouraged by recent data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology in five different cancers. Roger will talk more in a few minutes about the progress we continue to make with the KEYTRUDA program and Adam will discuss the recent U.S. launch in advanced melanoma. Also during the third quarter, we received U.S. approval from the FDA for BELSOMRA, our novel treatment for insomnia, which we anticipate launching early next year. In addition to increasing our focus on the key therapeutic areas that represent our best opportunities, we continued to rigorously prioritize our portfolio to ensure that all of our businesses have the potential to be market leaders and create value for shareholders. This approach led us to divest human health product business areas that amounted to nearly $1 billion annual revenue. That focus also led to the recently completed sale of our $2 billion revenue consumer care business to buyer. We then employed the proceeds of that sale to complete the acquisition of Idenix and to increase our return of cash to shareholders this year. The same approach let us to a different conclusion with regard to our animal health business, which we believe will continue to generate long-term value for Merck. Animal health saw strong growth this quarter across all species. We look forward to additional innovation coming out of our animal health pipeline and remain committed to growing this business, which is already a market leader in key segments of the global animal health market. Let me now turn to the progress we made in sharpening the focus of our R&D organization. Along with the strong progress we\u2019ve made on our KEYTRUDA program, we continue to advance our work to develop a highly effective once daily oral pan-genotypic regimen of the treatment of hepatitis C. As I mentioned earlier, we also completed the acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals and its promising portfolio of hepatitis C candidates which complement our internal development efforts. We will continue to focus on our highest potential growth opportunities, while rigorously prioritizing our pipeline, bolstering it with external assets while divesting our out licensing programs and candidates that are better suited to create value elsewhere. For example this quarter we entered into an agreement to out-license MK-3222 our investigational treatment for chronic fasciolosis to Sun Pharma. All of these actions are keeping with our intention to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company. Lastly we\u2019ve made significant progress in redesigning our operating model and reducing our cost base. You will recall that last October we targeted a net reduction in annual operating expenses of approximately $2.5 billion off our full year 2012 expense levels by the end of 2015. As a result of disciplined cost management, I\u2019m pleased that we remain on track to achieve our target for 2014 and our overall savings goal by the end of 2015. These savings have enabled to better target resources to key priorities across the enterprise and to accomplish the goals I\u2019ve mentioned today. At the same time, this discipline allowed us to return a high level of cash to shareholders through both the dividend and our stock repurchase program. Over the past 12 months we\u2019ve returned nearly $11.5 billion to our shareholders. We are rebuilding Merck for sustainable future growth. We've sharpened our commercial focus and on launching products with the potential to make a significant difference to patients, while providing value to payers, providers and healthcare systems. We focused and prioritized our R&D efforts so that we may continue to translate cutting edge science into medicines and vaccines that have meaningful differentiated attributes, and we continue to aggressively manage our costs to ensure that our resources are focused on our most promising opportunities for growth. Taken together, these actions have created nearly and longer term opportunities that will allow Merck to continue drive value for both shareholders and society. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter. Adam Schechter : Thank you Ken and good morning everyone. This morning I\u2019ll provide you with an overview of Global Human Health third quarter results and also provide some commentary on the early days of the KEYTRUDA launch. My commentary will be on a constant currency basis. Overall sales reached $9.1 billion reflecting the following : growth in core areas such as diabetes, immunology and acute care, which were offset by more than $150 million in product divestitures, hepatitis C market dynamics and patent expiries. First I\u2019ll review our core product areas and then I\u2019ll provide an update on our regional performance and I\u2019ll start with primary care. The JANUVIA franchise reached more than $1.4 billion in sales and grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting growth in the U.S. and international markets. In the U.S. sales grew 6% on continued volume increases. We are encouraged by the growth trends we saw in the third quarter in the month of October. We are seeing positive results from our efforts to defend our 75% market share and to grow the DPP-4 class. In our international market sales grew 4%, driven by Europe and the emerging markets. Sales declined in Japan due to the 10% re-pricing that occurred in April and the overall competitive environment for DPP-4s. We are confident that we will deliver global sales growth for JANUVIA franchise in 2014. Next in hospital and specialty care; sales of ISENTRESS were approximately $410 million in the third quarter, a decline of 3%. Internationally our growth in Europe was balanced by the timing of tenders in the emerging markets. In the U.S. ISENTRESS sales were impacted by customer buying patterns and the competitive dynamics in the HIV market. Several immunology products reached more than $770 million in the third quarter, growing 9%. We are seeing continued strong uptick with Simponi across multiple indications and Simponi remains the fastest growing anti-TNF in markets where we promote. REMICADE grew 3% reflecting growth in core markets and offset by biosimilar competition in some of the smaller EU markets. In acute care, sales exceeded $600 million and grew by 17% this quarter. Growth was driven by continued up take of Bridion in Japan, Europe and emerging markets and solid performances across our portfolio of antibiotics and antifungals. While growth rates may vary from quarter to quarter due to timing of tenders, we continue to expect this core area to be an important contributor to future growth. Now turning to our vaccine business. In the third quarter vaccine sales were approximately $1.7 billion, a decline of 6%, primarily due to roughly $100 million of U.S public sector purchases of GARDASIL and RotaTeq in the third quarter of last year that did not occur in the third quarter of this year. Sales of ZOSTAVAX were approximately $180 million in the quarter, declining 2% compared to last year. As we enter the flu season in the United States, we have initiated promotional efforts, including a new direct-to-consumer campaign to educate consumers of the importance of talking to their physicians and their pharmacists about shingles. We have broad access for ZOSTAVAX and we are working with customers to help them understand the reimbursement process. Now turning to some geographic highlights in the third quarter, in the United States sales declined 8% as growth in the JANUVIA franchise and Dulera was offset by lower vaccine sales, the loss of exclusivity of TEMODAR and declines in our HCV portfolio. In Europe sales are 1%. We drove continued growth in diabetes, immunology and ISENTRESS, where sales were impacted by the divesture of our ophthalmology products continued declined in HCV portfolio and a generic erosion for NASONEX. Sales in Japan declined 14%, primarily due to biannual price decreases and ophthalmology price divestures. Sales in emerging markets grew 8%. China grew 33%, in part due to timing of purchases. Demand in China remains strong for a broad portfolio of innovative and also established products. Other important emerging markets such as Turkey and Mexico also delivered solid growth in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect that the emerging markets will be good growth drivers. Now I\u2019ll spend a few more minutes speaking about the early days of the KEYTRUDA launch. First let me say, we are very excited to launch the first and the only anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the United States. We are still in the early days of launch but we have been moving rapidly to ensure the medicine is available to patients and feedback from our customers is very encouraging. Upon approval, we think KEYTRUDA will be available within a week and we were taking orders and shipping in just a couple of days. Our colleagues in manufacturing worked tirelessly to ensure that patient would have access to this important medication as soon as possible. On the commercial side we reached the top ipilimumab prescribers in a matter of days from approval. We\u2019ve now expanded our reach into community practitioners. We have reached more than 75% of the key physicians and we have made multiple call into many of the high volume prescribers. Regarding access, most payers are covering the cost of KEYTRUDA for its current indication without restrictions. Additionally we offer patient assistance for patients requiring reimbursement assistance. As we said at approval, we believe there are about 1,200 patients in the U.S, who are eligible for KEYTRUDA based upon our current label. Additionally we expect a few hundred new patients to become eligible for treatment with KEYTRUDA each month. Since approval in early September, we believe that approximately 900 patients are being treated with KEYTRUDA. Many of these patients were previously part of the expanded access program and are now in a process of moving from the EAP to promotional product. Our global oncology business unit is passionately engaged on maximizing the potential for KEYTRUDA for appropriate patients. We are looking forward to sharing more launch details with you on the fourth quarter earnings call. In summary, Global Human Health is transitioning to through a period of patent expiration divestures. Since late last year we have consciously re-directed our focus to core product areas, to core markets and to new product launches. We drove growth in many of these core areas and we are successfully introducing KEYTRUDA to the U.S market for patients suffering from advanced melanoma. We continue to prioritize our investments and we are intent on driving future growth and broadening our impact in Global Health. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis. Rob Davis : Thanks Adam. Good morning everyone. We've had solid results in the first nine months of the year. Our third quarter results demonstrate that we continue to sharpen our focus as a Company and as Ken mentioned our cost production program is on track. This morning I\u2019ll provide additional color on our P&L and comment on our outlook for the rest of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. Total company revenues were $10.6 billion for the quarter a decrease of 4% year over year, with a 1% benefit from Foreign Exchange. This decrease reflects in part the loss of more than $400 million of sales in the prior year from divestitures and the now ended joint venture with AstraZeneca. As Adam stated, our sales in the pharmaceutical business were driven by solid performance in our key brands, which have benefitted from continued resource allocation to our priority therapeutic areas by diabetes and acute care. Animal health revenues increased $83 million or 10% year-over-year, excluding exchange. These results were driven by strong performance across the portfolio, including significant growth in our companion animal and poultry businesses. Consumer care revenues decreased 9%, excluding exchange. As a reminder, this is the last quarter in which we will record sales results from consumer care business since the transaction of Bayer closed on October 1st. Moving now to expenses, gross margin was 74.3% in the quarter, which represents a 30 basis point increase year-over-year. We continue to expect the 2014 full year gross margin to be slightly lower than 2013's full year ratio of 74.3%. Marketing and administrative expenses were $148 million lower than the prior year, driven by reductions in direction selling and promotion costs. We continue to focus our resources on key markets and core products, while ensuring we appropriately invest in our product portfolio launches, and in support of these efforts, we expect M&A expenses to be sequentially higher in the fourth quarter. Research and development expenses were $1.5 billion in the quarter, a $109 million lower than prior year. We expect our R&D expense in the fourth quarter to be higher year-over-year as we invest in our portfolio. Finally, regarding the tax rate, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.5% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full year to be between 24% and 26%. In terms of our bottom line performance, we earned $0.90 per share in the third quarter as compared to $0.92 per share in the prior year. Now, our outlook for the rest of the year. On the top line, we are narrowing our revenue guidance to $42.4 billion to $42.8 billion at current exchange rates. This takes into account recent currency movements, as well as a public sector vaccine purchase in the third quarter of last year that did not occur this year, which Adam described earlier. We are also narrowing our non-GAAP EPS range raising the bottom end of the range to $3.46 and lowering the upper end to $3.50, while maintaining the same midpoint. Our EPS range reflects our strong performance in the first nine months of the year and includes the absorption of roughly $0.06 to $0.09 of dilution from the consumer care divestiture and the Idenix acquisition. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $4.06 and $4.29 in 2014. Both M&A and R&D expense in 2014 are expected to be lower than 2013 and as I said earlier, we remain on track to achieve our target of $2.5 billion reduction in expenses off of the 2012 base by the end of 2015. Now touching briefly on capital allocation, by the end of the year, we will have deployed the balance of the after tax proceeds from the Bayer transaction, net of cash used for the Idenix acquisition for share repurchase. We continue to project our average diluted shares outstanding will be slightly lower than 2.95 billion shares for 2014. We remain focused on our commitment to return cash to shareholders, and as Ken said, we have returned over $11 billion to shareholders over the past 12 months in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we look at capital markets more broadly, we recently took advantage of favorable market conditions and restructured some of our debt through a tender offer and a $2.5 billion debt offering. We are pleased with the results of the transactions which created economic value for the Company and will benefit annual interest expense in 2015 and beyond. In summary, the third quarter was another solid quarter for Merck. Since our announcement at this time last year, we have refocused our business and divested non-core assets with 2013 full year sales of approximately $3 billion. In addition, we continue to term our expense base putting a solid way on track to achieve our expense reductions by the end of 2015, while also investing in our promising new product launches and pipeline. Now I will turn the call over to Roger. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks, Rob. The third quarter was an especially busy one for our regulatory affairs group, with multiple product approvals in several important areas. In August, our novel first-in-class orexin receptor antagonist, BELSOMRA was approved by the U.S. FDA. BELSOMRA acts to improve sleep initiation and sleep maintenance in patients suffering from insomnia. As Ken mentioned, the BELSOMRA launch will begin early next year. In September, we gained approval of BELSOMRA in Japan, where we also gained approval of vaniprevir, a potent highly selective protease inhibitor for the treatment of genotype-1 hepatitis C virus infection. Also in September, we received approval for KEYTRUDA, our monoclonal antibody directive against PD-1 for the treatment of patients with advanced malignant melanoma refractory to currently available therapies. As I had previously mentioned, our development program of KEYTRUDA has expanded to include more than two dozen studies around the world, involving more than 6,000 patients and addressing more than 30 different tumor types. At the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month, we presented data documenting the activity of KEYTRUDA in patients with gastric, bladder and head and neck cancers and also presented more comprehensive data describing the activity of KEYTRUDA in patients suffering from ligand melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer. Today we announced that the U.S. FDA has granted breakthrough designation to KEYTRUDA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed platinum-based therapies and whose tumors do not bear EGF-receptor or alk gene mutations. We are working closely with the FDA to define an optimal data set that would permit registration of KEYTRUDA for this important indication. Later in the year we expect to have a chance to describe our studies of KEYTRUDA in patients with so called triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer conference and then some hematologic malignancies at the American Society of Rheumatology meeting. Combination studies employing KEYTRUDA for the treatment of a variety of devastating malignancies are also underway. These studies employing conventional therapeutic modalities as well as novel targeted agents will benefit enormously from the broad understanding of KEYTRUDA monotherapy that we are developing. Turning now to infectious diseases, we are looking forward to the upcoming American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases meeting next month. During the meeting we plan to present complete data from Phase 2 studies of our MK-5172 8742 doublet. I will remind you that the FDA has granted breakthrough designation to these agents for the treatment of Hepatitis C virus infection. Indeed the Phase 3 registration program for MK-5172 8742 is now completely enrolled and we expect to see data from these studies in the first half of 2015. At AASLD, we will also present early data from the C-Swift study, which pairs the MK-5172 8742 doublet with the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, Sofosbuvir. The goal of these studies, which we announced five months ago at our business review to is advance the case given the case for an all oral ribavirin-free genotype independent regimen that can be used in patients irrespective of comorbidities, for example in patients with established cirrhosis, simultaneous infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus and/or renal insufficiency; and that will achieve sustained virologic responses over a shorter course of therapy. Because of the difficulties in ensuring patient adherence in the real world, shorter course therapy is clearly desirable. Our triple-therapy regimens have been enabled by our recently completed acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals, through which we gained access to potent nucleoside polymerase inhibitor that we now call MK-3682. Data describing the effectiveness of MK-3682 monotherapy will also be presented at the AASLD meeting. Beyond HCV, we continue to make very good progress in rolling other Phase 3 infectious disease therapeutics programs, including once daily ISENTRESS and letermovir, a treatment for patients at risk from disseminated cytomegalovirus infection. During November we also expect to present the results of IMPROVE-IT. Our study testing weather a cholesterol lowering regimen of ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin alone improves outcomes in patients at high risk for major cardiovascular events. The first patient was enrolled in this trial exactly nine years ago. With design and protocol review, it has been a decade since the question that the trial addresses was first posed. In all, IMPROVE-IT enrolled 18,145 patients presenting with stabilized acute coronary syndromes. There been more than 5000 composite events that will soon be reviewed. The MRO clinical team and I along with the rest of Merck management remain blinded to the data, and our statisticians have only a very short period to conduct analysis before the presentation in mid-November. My number one consideration regarding the study has been to ensure that we work closely with our academic colleagues to obtain a complete and robust dataset generated during the decade that it has taken to conduct IMPROVE-IT. Given the size and complexity of this study, I expect that the IMPROVE-IT data will provide important insights into the appropriate care of patients at high risk for major coronary adverse events. Returning briefly to regulatory affairs, we have now submitted our complete response to FDA questions regarding Sugammadex, our parenteral agent for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade during anesthesia. Included in this response are new studies designed to examine hyper sensitivity reactions that can occur with Sugammadex administration, as well as an updated review of our Pharmaco-Vigilance experience, with Sugammadex, which is marketed in more than 50 countries as Bridion. Separately we have had a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss our Odanacatib results. We have agreed together upon a plan to characterize more completely the adjudicated adverse event reporting in this study, which will mean that our filing will be delayed until 2015. The data that we presented at the ASPMR meeting in September demonstrate that Odanacatib could provide a meaningful therapeutic option to reduce the frequency of osteoporotic fractures in women at high risk for these events. Finally as Ken mentioned we continue to work closely with the FDA on the review of the V503 our 9-valent Human-Papillomavirus vaccine for the reduction of cervical malignancy. We expect that the FDA will complete its review before the end of the year. Joe? Joseph Romanelli : Great, thank you Roger. And Jackie I think, we're ready to start the Q&A segment of the call. Just as reminder, if you can limit yourself to one or two questions, that way we can get to as many as caller possible. So Jackie, I think we'll turn it over to the first caller. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just two questions here. First, with the breakthrough status in lung for KEYTRUDA, can you just update us on anything about your filing strategy or at least key data points we should be watching for that could support a filing in lung? And then second, just your thoughts on TECOS and risk of heart failure with JANUVIA; there's obviously been a lot of discussion around this point as of late and we want just to get Merck's perspective on the risks associated with that study. Thanks very much. Roger Perlmutter : Yes, Chris, just with respect to the filing strategy I think -- we certainly are pleased to have gained breakthrough designation for non-small cell lung cancer. As you know, we have a number of studies underway, large studies and we have the opportunity to look at those studies and we are working closely with the agency to develop and ideal registration strategy as I indicated. So we won\u2019t just have any more to say about that than what I have said to this point. With respect to TECOS, I think that we do expect that the final patient will be available -- patient data will be available, last patient, last visit by the end of the year. This is of course a study that's been conducted -- led by academic institutions. So we\u2019ll be made aware of those data. I think it\u2019s important to recognize that the data safety and monitoring board has been following this study extremely carefully. The observations that have been made in other studies, employing regimens to treat diabetes are well known to the data safety and monitoring board. The last data safety and monitoring board review was in December of last year. Given that, the fact that the DSMB came back and said the study should be continued without change, I think it provides some reassurance with respect to the overall conduct of the study. It's a large study and would important answers to questions about the meaningfulness of intervention with sitagliptin in patients with type two diabetes. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, great. Thank you, Roger. Jackie next caller? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : So a couple of quick questions for Roger. Roger, can you talk to us a little bit about -- I don\u2019t see PD-L1 status highlighted for the breakthrough designation for KEYTRUDA, but my understanding is that much of the data that was generated in non-small cell lung cancer was in the PD-L1 positive patient population. Can you just clarify for us if this indication is specific to the PD-L1 patient population or if it isn\u2019t and it is actually for the broader patient population. And then as we think about the next sort of data points in the KEYNOTE-010 study, can you just update us on whether or not you've officially taken the look at the response rates which is sort of specified on clinical trials.gov relative to the 2 milligram and 10 milligram dose and if that look included a comparison to Taxotere. The reason I ask is if that can be utilized as supported evidence for a potential filing. Thanks. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks Seamus. First of all, the breakthrough designation is not specific to PD-L1 positive patients and as you know, we have done quite a lot of work. I\u2019m trying to understand the meaningfulness of PD-L1 positivity, what we\u2019ve shown in a whole variety of settings is that patients whose tumors are judged PD-L1 negative, or more precisely the fall into the PD-L1 staining less than 1% category, nevertheless do demonstrate some responses and we and other groups that studying this are still in the midst of trying to understand exactly how to correlate PD-L1 expression status with outcomes. We know there is a relationship but exactly what the meaningfulness of that is, I think remains to be elucidated. With respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study, as I've indicated, we have a variety of different ways that we can look at these data in order to come up with an optimal registration strategy and that something that through the close interaction that we have with the FDA, and we\u2019ll have more particularly because of the breakthrough designation that we\u2019re going to be doing in order to come up with the best possible strategy. Joseph Romanelli : Thank you, Seamus. And Jackie, next caller? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : Maybe just a follow on Seamus. The KEYNOTE-010 Roger, what is the timeline for data readout on that? Can you update us? I believe last time you spoke about it, you had talked about late 2015. Could you just remind me if that\u2019s correct or incorrect data? And then on hepatitis C if I may Roger, last call you expressed a great -- what I interpreted to be a great period of optimism for the four week regimen. Obviously the bar is very, very high given the Gilead data that is out there. I was wondering if you could update us on your expectations for the four-week data? And I know this is the third but this is just a yes or no. Just to be clear, the breakthrough designation was for -- if I'm reading the press release -- so that was actually for second line and later lung. Is that correct? Roger Perlmutter : Mark, first of all the breakthrough designation doesn\u2019t specify line of therapy. The breakthrough designation is for patients who have failed platinum based therapies, and that\u2019s understandable of course, because you get breakthrough designation for those circumstances under which there is the anticipation of a meaningful intervention beyond what exists as standard of care. So that's understandable I think. With respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study, again I think the timing remains as before. We continue to march forward with that study. We as I said have opportunities to examine that data at different times and one of the things that we'll be doing is discussing that with the agency, but we do expect to have data available by the end of next year for sure. And then with respect to hep C, I think the important thing to remember here is that what we proposed when we described the study back in May was that a triplet regimen would provide the opportunity to test whether it was possible to get sustained virologic responses that is eradication with very short regimens. We don't know what the nature of those regimens would be. And so we've tried to bookend those for genotype 1 and genotype 3 in the C-SWIFT study. We have access now of course to 3682, our own nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and the things that we learn, from our studies was Sofosbuvir can then be applied to our triplet studies with 3682 recognizing of course that no two polymerase inhibitors will behave in exactly the same way, but it basically provides the kind of guidance that we need in order to design effective Phase III study. So we're looking forward to having the opportunity to review in those data in detail. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thank you Mark. And Jackie, next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Roger, just a follow up on those comments. Could you please remind us what the similarities and differences are from what you can tell from your [indiscernible] Sovaldi? And Adam, could you please give us a little bit more on the Gardasil performance and your outlook. It seems to have been a little bit lower than expectations? Ken Frazier : Roger? Roger Perlmutter : So Alex, you will have the opportunity to see Phase Ib data for MK-3682 at AASLD, which will be interesting. But of course it's very difficult to compare two different agents, when they're not studied in the head-to-head context because of differences in patient population. I can't really speculate about that. We'll have the opportunity to look at those kinds of data sometime later but right now I think the important thing will be to look at the data -- the Phase Ib data which I think you will find intriguing. Ken Frazier : And Alex, regarding Gardasil, let me provide some additional context. So sales in total were $590 million for the quarter. The U.S. declined 7%. The U.S. declines were mostly due to higher public sector purchases in 2013. That did not occur in 2014. If you look at the cumulative 15 to 18 year old penetration rates in the U.S., it's about 65% for females, and about 50% for male. So there's still room to grow there. If you look at males, we continue to have good uptake and if you look at the private sector data, it suggests that about 50% to 55% of first doses are now being administered to males. If you look outside the U.S., the declines were due to Korea, and also there is the end of the catch up cohorts in several of the smaller markets. But overall we continue to be pleased with our market share greater than 90% on a global basis and 99% in the U.S. and we believe that there is still room for additional growth in the future. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, great. Thank you, Alex. And Jackie, next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. John Boris : First question just for Ken. I think you traditionally go through your planning process this time of year. I know you can't give, or not ready to prepare -- to give guidance for 2015, but if you can just help us understand what some of the pushes and pulls are? Especially since 2015, you've indicated us return to growth year going into that year. So that would be very helpful? And then for Roger, if you can just characterize why it's so difficult to potential to get four weeks of therapy in the HCV population at either four or eight weeks going forward that would be real helpful? Ken Frazier : So let me start by saying of course we are not giving 2015 guidance today. We'll do that on our fourth quarter call. But you're correct. We still expect to go off our 2014 base and there are number of factors that are going on outside, right now. For example there has been a change in currency rates which will have an impact on 2015. But also on an operational standpoint, we are looking forward to several launches, we are looking forward to the continued development of several key programs in our pipeline. So from an operational standpoint, we're pleased with the progress that is being made and with the upcoming launches and obviously they will have to be looked at in the context of the overall headwinds that I think everyone is experiencing from things like currency. Roger? Roger Perlmutter : John, the duration of treatment in infectious disease is always a difficult process to assess. I think first of all there are aspects of molecular cell biology to consider that you have hepatocytes that are infected with HCV. They differ almost certainly one cell from another in terms of replication rate and those that are replicating more slowly, it can be difficult to inhibit that process and there will be variability in terms of the degradation of the viral nucleic acid. So there is lot of heterogeneity in the liver itself. And then there is also variation in terms of the exposure to drug in individual liver cells. And beyond those sort of molecular sales are considerations there is also the clinical context. So we all recognize that despite that fact we\u2019ve more or less understood the nature of -- for example, just to pick one the nature of osteomyelitis, bacterial infection in bone, the length of treatment in the clinical setting is different in different parts of the world and different regions. We really don\u2019t have an established length of treatment that we can justify with good clinical data. And one can expect that it will be easier in HCV because we can measure viral burden much more readily. But still the clinical context will change depending upon the, for example the degree of liver disease. So you can imagine where there's a lot of fibrosis and it's difficult to get drug penetration, that that will make things more challenging. All of which means that it may be hard to get to a single, short course recommendation for all patients, but instead patients will have to be satisfied and may be the satisfaction can be determined before treatment begins. But most likely it will be in response to therapy. These are the things that we have to learn, now that we have these potent direct acting anti-virals and our C-SWIFT studies I think will provide an important data on this. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Just a few questions. Roger, do you expect to receive priority review for your doublet hep C therapy? I know you mentioned you've completed enrollment. Those trials should be completed by the end of I guess middle of next year, Should we anticipate priority review in timing of approval? Second question on KEYTRUDA for lung. When is the earliest we can expect to see randomized data showing overall survival for KEYTRUDA. And then thirdly a question for you Ken we had read, I guess rumors in the past about Merck considering selling its diversified product line or its legacy business. Can you give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about that? There have been a couple of trades as you know of those businesses. I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about that for Merck. Thanks very much. Ken Frazier : Roger. Roger Perlmutter : Jami thanks. The first question, of course, we do have break through designation for the doublet and that doesn\u2019t by any means stipulate that priority review would occur. I think it will be driven in large part by the strength of the data and the assessment of meaningfulness. So we\u2019ll get to that point when we have a chance to evaluate all the Phase III data and get it submitted. With respect to the randomized overall survival, again we do have data coming from the KEYNOTE-010 study. There are other possible approaches to this but certainly one would expect towards the end of next year, we'd have an early look at that. Again, a lot of depends of course of the survival statistics for the population but we\u2019ll have data around that time. Ken Frazier : Thanks Jami for the question. And let me start with a broader focus on it. And as I said, we continue to prioritize and focus within our business and as we communicated last October, that required us to look across the entire business to determine which assets might have more value outside Merck versus inside the Company. As part of that you\u2019ve seen us take action and divest assets with approximately $3 billion of 2013 sales including MCC certain GHH products. We will continue to evaluate opportunities as appropriate. But specifically with respect to the diversified plans, we will also be considerate of the fact that a lot of these more mature assets also provide strong cash flow, which enables us to continue to invest behind meaningful innovation that's at the heart of our strategy. So we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward but we\u2019ve got to balance the cash flow concerns as well as what we can do to monetize assets where appropriate. Joseph Romanelli : Okay great. Thanks, Jackie. Next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford C. Bernstein. Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein Thank you. I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on the KEYNOTE-006 trial, pretty important in that it compares your PD-1 head to head versus it'd be in first line melanoma and I am wondering if you can update us on timing of read out and just more generally, your views of CTLA-4 antagonist and specifically your views of those products from a risk-benefit standpoint as part of combination therapy with PD-1s in two settings, melanoma and lung? And then just a quick question on TECOS. Is it possible you would topline those results by late 2014 and more generally how we handle data disclosure when you do have those results? Ken Frazier : Okay Tim, for KEYNOTE-006, yes we do expect the data moving along and then we will have comparative data versus sifalimumab and there is nothing particularly to update with respect to KEYNOTE-0063. What you see on clinicaltrials.gov is a fair reflection of what we have and we are expecting to have data next year. You asked a more general question of how we view PD-1 antagonism versus CTLA-4 ipilimumab in particular and there is been a lot of discussion of this is as you know very well, there has not been an opportunity for us to compare KEYTRUDA vis-\u00e0-vis ipilimumab directly to this point, although ultimately we will have those kinds of data. I think what we've seen from the registration materials for these drugs is that at the current exposure levels, there is substantial amount of systematic toxicity that has seen with CTLA-4 antagonists. But time will really tell how that plays out, particularly as their dose adjustments and different approaches to combination therapy. So I don\u2019t think we can say that that\u2019s going to turn out to be an impossibility. I think that the important thing, in order to design combinations correctly, speaking not just for ipilimumab or CTLA-4, but speaking for the totality of combinations, is we have to have firm understanding of how these molecules behave as monotherapy. And we have a very large monotherapy program for KEYTRUDA which involves more than 6,000 patients as I've noted. In addition we have 17 combination studies currently underway, which explore KEYTRUDA in a variety of other settings used with other drugs. So we'll have the opportunity with this firm foundation of monotherapy results to understand the meaningfulness of combination therapies, including combinations with CTLA-4 antagonists by ipilimumab. Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein And now on TECOS? Ken Frazier : TECOS. So the TECOS data -- as I've indicated but we should have, last patient, last visit, I remind you, this is a study that is coordinated by an academic group. They are managing the study but we should have last patient, last visit by the end of this year we hope and the data will be presented in 2015. That\u2019s all we know about it. I mentioned before the data safety and monitoring committee that is overseeing the study as well. But we don\u2019t know anything more than that. Joseph Romanelli : Great, okay. Thank you Tim. And Jackie next caller? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman : Ken, obviously the restructuring program takes your expenses down pretty significantly by the end of the next year. I'm just curious from there -- are we now rest and as we start to see this top-line from the new launches kick-in, will we get the operating leverage that we would expect to see, given that Hepatitis C oncology, these businesses that are not primary care kind of drive the top line. And curious how much investment you need to make in those areas that would offset and that we wouldn\u2019t see that operating leverage. And then Adam if you could just talk about the emerging markets just little bit more; obviously China was really strong. What type of one-timer was there or was this kind of a catch-up for the year? And maybe you could talk about just some of the key drivers and what\u2019s going on in the emerging markets. Thanks. Ken Frazier : Adam, why don\u2019t you start with emerging markets? Adam Schechter : Yes, so if you look at the emerging markets, I've always said that growth can vary from quarter-to-quarter and timing of tenders becomes very significant in the emerging markets. China as you mentioned had strong growth of 33%. A lot of that was in the acute care products, of which timing played a part in, and also the diversified brands continued to show good growth, which was not related to timing. I also mentioned that in Turkey and Mexico we had very good quarter as well and that was driven by specialty products, but also cardiovascular products. Ken Frazier : And on the overall issues with respect to our cost structure and how we're approaching it, we have been pretty aggressive in the first nine months to reduce costs and change our operating model, and we're on track for the overall $2.5 billion in cost savings by 2015. And so we think that actually positions us well as we move into the future. Beyond that I can\u2019t say much because we're not providing guidance in today\u2019s call. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, thank you Mark. And Jackie next caller? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : Regarding anacetrapib, a question for Roger. Would a positive protocol analysis for IMPROVE-IT at AHA make you any more confident about the anacetrapib trial, given the beta about its proposed LDL mediated mechanism of action? And I know you are aware that two presentations are scheduled. Second, just following up on the KEYNOTE-010 trial, should I be thinking about an earlier interim analysis for your trial compared to Bristol's equivalent given you are selecting PD-L1 patients and it's obviously much larger and therefore where would that put the interim just on your modeling? And then just an adjunct to that, do you still remain convinced that looking at PD-L1 expression on tumors rather than on the different cohorts of white blood cells is the right way to go to optimally select patients? Ken Frazier : Okay Andrew. Three questions. First of all, for anacetrapib, as I've indicated, we have no idea what the results of IMPROVE-IT are going to be. IMPROVE-IT tests the question as you know of whether or not one can be aggressively lowering LDL cholesterol levels in patients who already are optimally managed with simvastatin, one can achieve a beneficial effect on cardiovascular events and the magnitude of that effect. Our studies with anacetrapib are different and because we have an anacetrapib, both the significant LDL cholesterol lowering effect, but also the HDL elevating effect, I\u2019m not sure that I can read out much of anything from IMPROVE-IT to anacetrapib. I think anacetrapib is testing really quite a different question and we\u2019ll just have to wait for the results of the reveal study. With respect to the KEYNOTE timing, I can\u2019t speculate about how Bristol-Myers is pursuing their analysis versus our own. I\u2019ve indicated when we expect our data to become available and we\u2019re going to examine those and make decisions based on that. And with respect to the PD-L1, we've presented really quite a lot of data using our proprietary PD-L1 antibody to look at expression in tumors, and what we've shown is that there is substantial associated between PD-L1 expression and tumors, which is judged at different cut points and responses to KEYTRUDA; and we've shown that in a number of different tumors and most recently we showed it in our presentations at ESMO. The important thing to recognize as I said, that doesn\u2019t mean that there are no responses in those who PD-L1 negative. It's simply an association. It is an association that is biologically plausible, but we don\u2019t by any means feel that we are able to inventory all of the PD-L1 that's expressed in an around those cells that might be responsible for tumor killing and so no matter what, we only get a partial picture of it. My feeling is that PD-L1 assessment in the tumor is much more likely to be revealing than PD-L1 assessment and circulating white blood cells as an example and certainly that\u2019s our experience. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, great, thanks. Jackie, next caller? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Colin Bristow : Sorry if I missed this, but on hep C, how importantly do you view hitting four weeks from commercial standpoint? It feels like physician feedback has not indicated a high level of importance as perhaps we would expect. And then just a second one on the IMPROVE-IT study. If the trial does not meet the primary endpoint, how do you think about the level of investment in the franchise going forward? Adam Schechter : This is Adam, Colin. With regard to hep C, this is a very large market. In U.S. alone there's about 3.2 million people with chronic HCV, of which only about 50% are diagnosed and only about 150,000, 200,000 are cured. So the market is very large. I believe that four weeks would be helpful, but as long as in comparative dynamics, there is quality in terms of the regimens, I think that you can be successful commercially under either circumstance. So at this point we\u2019re not commenting specifically on IMPROVE-IT. We continue to believe in the LDL cholesterol hypothesis and of course we\u2019re prepared for all scenarios but there is nothing specific at this moment. Joseph Romanelli : Great. Thanks Colin. And Jackie, next caller? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : I have. Adam, you mentioned that roughly 900 patients are being treated with KEYTRUDA. I was curious if you\u2019re seeing orders and shipments that are pretty consistent with that? Is it a pretty tight relationship between individual patient and managed shipments or is the system kind of gearing up for broader usage, even though you can't talk about broader usage from Merck's standpoint. And Roger, how confident are you in the scientific community, if you can speak for the community in the reproducibility of a particular patient's PD-L1 status? It sounds like investors want things in neat boxes. I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s actually going to play-off that way but curious on your thoughts there on the testing and the status and whether that could flux within patients? Thanks. Adam Schechter : It\u2019s Adam. So first of all, as I said before, we're pleased with the uptake in customer feedback that we have early in the launch, but we are still very early in a launch. We're taking orders KEYTRUDA since the first day of availability. Nearly all the top 50 accounts are purchased since we launched the product and a majority have made repeat purchases and at this point in time we believe we have about 900,000 patients that are being treated with the product. Ken Frazier : Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Yes, and Gregg; you\u2019re absolutely right with respect to PD-L1 status in that the PD-L1 gene itself is responsive to a variety of different stimuli, including cytokine. So the inflammatory [indiscernible] could easily influence how much PD-L1 is expressed and that could be different from one; for example size of metathesis to another. So there could be quite a bit variability. That variability may underlie the challenges that people have experienced in trying to dissect the relationship between PD-L1 expression and responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. Nevertheless the fact is there is such an association. So summiting over everything, there still is a general relationship between PD-L1 express and in tumors in responsiveness that's been seen many times. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, great, thanks, Gregg. And Jackie, next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Tony Butler : Two brief questions Roger on, we've talked about 010 and platinum failures. The question is, what's the difference between 024 and 042 in the Phase III setting at least in first line advanced non-small cell lung? And the second question Adam, the top 50 accounts having ordered KEYTRUDA, can you provide any additional color on the percentage of patients who were already on therapy in the access program and have moved on to if you will as a pain customer and those that are actually new to therapy? Thank you. Ken Frazier : So, Adam do you want to take the first question. Adam Schechter : So right now as we said we have, we believe there's about 900 patients that are being treated with the product. Many of those we believe are coming from the EAP program. And if you look at the top 50 accounts, it's not easy to tell where the purchases go, to which patients exactly. So you can't comment on that. But I think the bottom line is we're on track for all in 60 days to move from the EAP program into the commercial area. So we are working hard on that and we're on track for that. Ken Frazier : Okay, Roger. Roger Perlmutter : Yes, if you look at the 024 and 042, you will see that there, we're talking about similar kinds of studies but they differ in size and differ on primary outcomes and that's kind of understandable and not atypical for registration strategies in these sorts of settings. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, great. Jackie, and next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : I have a couple of questions. First, with respect to your hep C program, could you talk about your development vision for Idenix nuke, including the timing for Phase III? And then second, I have a little bit of a lengthy question on KEYTRUDA and this relates to the KEYNOTE-06 trial. So the approved dose of KEYTRUDA is 2 milligrams per kilogram every three weeks and it costs a $150,000 a year. But in KEYNOTE-06, the KEYTRUDA dosing is 10 milligrams per kilogram every two or three weeks, which would cost $1.15 million or $750,000 a year respectively. So since KEYNOTE-06 is supposed to read out early next year and assuming that it shows that KEYTRUDA is superior to YERVOY in first line melanoma, it should get Compendia be listed at 10 milligrams per kilogram, but how should we think about actual use in the real world and how should we think about pricings for that compound? Thank you. Ken Frazier : Hey Roger. Roger Perlmutter : Yes, so I guess the question is first of all with respect to MK-3682 and the timing; I should note that for MK-3682, and again the data will be -- Phase Ib data will be at AASLD. We do have an IND now in United States for that molecule and Phase II studies will begin shortly and thereafter based on the results of that, we will begin to decide how best to conduct registration strategy. So that's more or less how we are thinking about it. It's fairly conventional. And then with respect to KEYNOTE-06; well as you know, we began our studies of pembrolizumab in a variety of different doses, 2 milligrams Q3 and 10 milligrams Q2 and 10 milligrams Q3 and what we've learned in the course of those studies is that the dose response curve is relatively flat and 0.02 milligrams Q3 was selected as the dose to go forward in melanoma. And we're also working on a fixed dose at 200 milligrams Q3, which will give the equivalent exposure 2 milligrams Q3 for most patients and doesn't require the weight calculation. And my expectation is that because we'll have large amount of data from all of these different settings, we'll be able to make the appropriate analysis. I can't speak of course to how Compendia will look at this in any other aspect of the commercialization process. Ken Frazier : And Dave what I would say is we've been very active to ensure that patients that are in need of KEYTRUDA have access to it and claims are being paid for KEYTRUDA consistent with the indication without restrictions and we've got our clinical presentations, where all of our top 30 target health plans either occurred or are going to occur. So as we look at the future, of course we continue to work to maintain access as appropriate. Joseph Romanelli : Thank you, Dave. Jackie I think we have time for just two more callers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Diwan with Credit Suisse. Vamil Diwan : A couple here. One on JANUVIA and JANUMET. From what we understand I think that product starting in 2015 is not going to be available to people with United Healthcare commercial plans. Can you just confirm if that is indeed the case, if there's been a change there? And while I assume that losing one plan is not likely that material to you guys, are there any other changes to the access of that franchise that we should be aware of as we start thinking about 2015? And then the second question just on the PD-1 side of things; any update you can provide on the status of the lawsuit that you guys filed against Bristol in Europe and also the one that Bristol has filed in the U.S. against you guys once you get the approval for KEYTRUDA? Ken Frazier : So Adam, do you want to go first? Adam Schechter : JANUVIA continues to have good access in 2014 and based upon preliminary reviews in \u201815, we expect to continue to have good access. JANUVIA is still on preliminary for United Part D plan in 2015 and continues to have preferred assets. The contract with United was signed recently but since it not had been signed when United filed their 2015 formulary with CMS, the United Part D website and CMS required notice to insurees that that did not list JANUVIA as on formulary, but I would just want to repeat that it still is on formulary for Part D in 2015. Ken Frazier : And Vamil, we\u2019re confident with respect to PD-1 and the litigation issue with the patent. We\u2019re confident we'll be able to market KEYTRUDA to any country in which it is approved. Litigation appeals -- they are a multiyear process. So you won\u2019t hear anything much for a while. If there are any updates we\u2019ll provide those in the queue. Joseph Romanelli : Jackie, I think we have time for the last caller. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Jeff Holford : I wondered if you can just give us a bit more color on what the biosimilar situation in Europe looks like, what you are really learning from the early stages of this and what you\u2019re going to take forward as access to biosimilars becomes more prevalent in Europe? Roger Perlmutter : So if you look at Remicade and Simponi, as I said, we had about $775 million of sales about 9% growth. We continue to have growth with Remicade about 3%. That was driven by the core EU markets driven by gastro indications. But there was some offset due to biosimilar competition in the smaller markets. If you look at the biosimilar specifically, there has been relatively limited uptake of either biosimilar product or acceptance on tenders and formularies and what we\u2019ve seen so far is there has been movement of the biosimilars, it\u2019s been limited to new patients only. However we have seen increase pricing pressures that are required in order for us to compete with the biosimilars. So we expect the pressure to continue into small markets this year and then we expect there to be some pricing pressure and new patients in the core EU markets after February 2015 loss of exclusivity. Joseph Romanelli : Okay. Thank you Adam. And Ken? Ken Frazier : So just in closing, we reported another solid quarter Company performance. As I mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on our strategy initiatives we announced last year. We're now seeing the benefit of investing in our core therapeutic areas like we\u2019ve seen in diabetes. We've made significant advancements in some of our most important research programs, including the launch of KEYTRUDA and receiving breakthrough therapeutic designation in non-small cell lung cancer and as Roger mentioned this morning, we\u2019re making steady progress in in hepatitis C as our registration study for the doublet is now fully enrolled. We also continue to focus on improving our operating model. Over the past year we've seen our operating expenses decline significantly. We will remain on track to achieve our $2.5 billion cost saving. Our prioritization is also let us to divesting $3 billion in sales through the MCC transaction with Bayer and other divestiture in human health. We've used those proceeds to fund the Idenix acquisition, and repurchase shares this year. Over the past 12 months we\u2019ve returned more than $11 billion via the dividend and share repurchase program. We remain strongly committed to returning cash to our shareholders. So again, thank you for joining and hanging in with us for little bit of lengthy call, and we look forward to updating you again on our fourth quarter earnings call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan Operator : Good day, everyone. And welcome to Merck\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Joseph Romanelli : Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019d also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to play out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as the acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results. There are reconciliation tables available in our press release, so you can get a better understanding of the underlying performance. We have also provided tables to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units, as well as for the products. This could be found in Table 3 of our press release and the reconciliation table, I mentioned earlier, is in Table 2 of the release. During the call, we will be referring to Table 2 for the P&L and Table 3 as it relates to revenue. Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call might be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risk or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck underscores no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings, as well as today\u2019s earnings release on merck.com. So, with that, this morning, I am joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. Our performance this quarter is the result of the proactive steps we are taking to further sharpen our commercial and R&D focus, redesign our operating model and reduce our cost base. We are evolving Merck\u2019s operating model and recognition of the evolution underway in healthcare markets across the world and we will continue to focus our resources on those internal and external opportunities that can generate the most value for patients, customers and shareholders. While we made real progress in 2014, you should all know that we are by no means content. Over the past year our greater focus has led to better execution, a point underscored by the effort that led the KEYTRUDA being the first PD-1 inhibitor approved in the United States. Another example of focus execution is restoring JANUVIA\u2019s growth. It is our intention to continue this focus discipline execution especially in areas where we have the greatest opportunities to grow internally. While we are transforming the way Merck operates and executes, our fundamental strategy has remained consistent. Our success and our future will continue to be predicated upon what is long defined Merck, innovating at the intersection of scientific opportunity and global unmet medical need. In short, there is no substitution for innovation, which we believe remains the best path to intrinsic long-term value creation, we intent to stay at the forefront of biopharmaceutical science and innovation. Now turning to our results, I'm pleased that both on an annual and a quarterly basis, excluding exchange, we reported sales growth in diabetes, hospital, acute care and vaccine, as well as in our animal health business. We also delivered on both our quarterly and full year non-GAAP EPS commitments. Our core underlying portfolio continues to perform well and our commercial organization remains focused on those areas where Merck medicines and vaccines commit their greatest contributions. We have also said that an important part of our strategy is actively pursuing the best external opportunities to augment our portfolio, while divesting products and businesses that we believe can be better maximize outside Merck. The divestiture of our Consumer Care business, as well as the acquisition of Cubist are examples of how we are executing this strategy. As we move into 2015, we will continue to look for the best opportunities to collaborate with academia and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms to bring forward the next-generation of medical breakthroughs that can deliver value to patients, physicians and payers, and fuel our future. Our increased commercial focus, acquisition of key assets and an unprecedented number of regulatory approvals in 2014 will enable us to launch several new innovative products in 2015, each with the potential to serve a critical unmet medical need. We are poised to capitalize on each of these opportunities. I am pleased that last year, we not only achieved six new product approvals in the U.S. but also made steady progress in advancing our late-stage pipeline. We now have over 10 Phase 3 programs targeting many of the world's largest public health needs. Roger will talk more about the exciting programs in our pipeline shortly, but let me reiterate, our industry is built on a foundation of innovation, effectively pursuing the most promising scientific discoveries both internally and externally, ultimately will be the key differentiator in determining company's ability to create long-term value for their shareholders and society. Reducing our operating costs has allowed us to respond more rapidly to changes in the healthcare environment, drive greater profitability and invest in our late-stage portfolio. A little over a year ago, we pledge to reduce R&D and SG&A costs by $2.5 billion by the end of 2015 and I'm pleased to say that we are on track to meet this goal. Finally, we have not lost focus on the importance of returning cash to our shareholders. The past year allowed us to return approximately $13 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. In 2015, our framework for deploying capital will remain consistent. We will balance investing in our business with funding compelling business development opportunities. And we remain firmly committed to returning cash to our shareholders. Today, Merck has the opportunity to reduce the burden of disease in five of the most significant global health battles, cancer, hepatitis C, cardiometabolic disease, resistant microbial infection and Alzheimer's disease. This is only possible because of our unwavering commitment to the discovery and development of transformational medicines and our willingness to challenge how we operate. These are both important forms of innovation and both will enhance our ability to thrive the changing healthcare environment and produce long-term value for patients, customers, society and shareholders. In closing, we are continuing the strong momentum we achieved in 2014. We've made significant strides in our strategic initiative and accomplished groundbreaking milestones in our R&D labs. Moving forward, we expect to continue making major progress in advancing our late-stage pipeline, gaining first-in-class approvals in launching new innovative product. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter. Adam Schechter : Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will provide you with an overview of the Global Human Health fourth quarter results. We\u2019ll also provide you with some context in the 2015 outlook. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. We finished 2014 with solid performance. Sales reached $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter and they reflected growth in our four core areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology. And those are partially offset by hepatitis C market dynamics and product divestitures. If you exclude the divestitures, sales grew 3%. First, I\u2019ll review performance of several key products and then I'll provide an update by region. And I\u2019ll begin with JANUVIA. The JANUVIA franchise reached approximately $1.7 billion in sales and grew 6% in the quarter and 4% for the full year. And our fourth quarter sales in United States grew 5%. Our increased focus on investment enabled us to defend our 75% market share and to grow the DPP-4 class. In our international market, sales grew 6%. Europe and emerging markets continue to grow on strong demand. In Japan, sales declined as a result of DPP-4 class replacing in the competitive environment. We committed to grow JANUVIA in 2014 and our team worked hard to deliver on that commitment. We're entering 2015 with momentum to deliver another year of growth. Next, in hospital and specialty care, sales of ISENTRESS were approximately $420 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 1%. Internationally, we drove growth in Europe on continued volume increases. Emerging markets sales grew as a result of demand and of tenders. In United States, sales declined due to a tough year-over-year comparison and competitive dynamics. On a full-year basis, ISENTRESS grew 3%. We expect continued competitive pressure in 2015. And we believe that based on its efficacy and tolerability, ISENTRESS will remain a compelling treatment option for our physicians. Sales of our immunology products reached approximately $750 million in fourth quarter, growing 5%. Simponi remains the fastest growing anti-TNF in the markets we promote the brand. REMICADE sales declined 3% reflecting biosimilar competition in smaller EU markets, partially offset by growth in core markets. For the full year, our immunology business grew 10%. However, we will lose patent protection for REMICADE this month across the remainder of our European markets. We expect competition for biosimilars to begin upon patent expiry. While we believe, we will retain many current patients being treated with REMICADE, we will face increased competition in new patients and there will be mandatory price reductions in certain markets. In hospital acute care, sales were approximately $650 million and grew by 12% this quarter. We saw continued uptake of BRIDION in Europe and emerging markets as well solid performances from our antibiotic and antifungal treatments. Our hospital acute care business grew 11% for the full year. In 2015, we expect continued growth driven by the strength of our legacy brands in the acquisition of Cubist. As a global leader in hospital acute care, we look forward to this business being a significant contributor to growth for Merck. Now turning to our vaccine business. In the fourth quarter, vaccine sales grew 18% to $1.6 billion. Growth was driven by pediatric vaccines, Pneumovax and ZOSTAVAX and they were partially offset by GARDASIL. Sales of ZOSTAVAX were $285 million in the quarter, the highest quarter of sales of the brand. In the United States, sales grew 7% in part as a result of our new DTC campaign, Internationally, sales grew 15%. We\u2019re now launching in more than 25 markets globally. GARDASIL sales declined 6% due to timing of customer purchases as well as fewer captive cohort vaccinations in certain emerging markets, we look forward to launch of GARDASIL 9 in the U.S. in the coming months. The ACIP is expected to discuss GARDASIL 9 at its meeting in late February. We see GARDASIL 9 as the best-in-class HPV vaccine that will offer greater protection against cervical cancer and build upon our legacy in this important market. On a full-year basis, our vaccine business grew 4% to sales of $5.7 billion. Vaccines remain an important core focus area in 2015. Now turning to some geographic commentary for the fourth quarter. Sales increased 1% in the U.S. but decreased 4% in Europe. In both regions, we drove growth in JANUVIA in our hospital acute care but sales were impacted by continued declines in hepatitis C portfolio and from product divestitures. Sales in Japan grew 1% despite the increases in Pneumovax sales, the biennial price decreases and ophthalmology product divestitures impacted growth this quarter. Additionally in Japan, we launched Boursorama in November and we are encouraged by the early results of our launch efforts and from feedback by physicians. Sales in emerging markets grew 7%, driven by strong performance in China which grew 14%. Mexico and Turkey also contributed meaningfully to emerging market growth this quarter. Now I\u2019ll spend a few moments speaking about the KEYTRUDA launch. We have made significant progress in bringing KEYTRUDA in the United States and through our expanded access program in several markets around the world. Sales of KEYTRUDA were $50 million in the fourth quarter. Important to the early success of our launch is the strong market access we secured for KEYTRUDA, virtually all claims for the labeled indication are reimbursed without restriction within two months. In December, through broad acceptance of academic centers and community of treaters, we estimate roughly 2000 patients were receiving treatment with the KEYTRUDA. These figures indicate rapid uptake in patients fighting refractory metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, we continue to fortify our oncology business unit as we prepare for potential launches in other tumors, such as non-small lung cancer. We are investing to be a global leader in oncology. Now I\u2019ll briefly discuss 2015. 2015 will be an exciting year for Merck with current and new product launches. We will be launching GARDASIL 9 and as we speak the launch meetings for ZERBAXA and Boursorama are occurring in the United States. We also look forward to the potential launch of BRIDION in the United States later this year. And of course, we will continue to maximize the potential for KEYTRUDA. In summary, global human health executed on our strategy in 2014. We focused investments on priority commercial areas in priority markets. We drove growth in Januvia, in hospital acute care and in vaccines. We acquired key assets from Cubist with near-term revenue and good long-term growth prospects to solidify our leadership position in hospital acute care. We divested several non-core products and franchises to increase our focus while reducing our costs. And at the same time, we executed on a robust launch of KEYTRUDA. I believe that the strength of our underlying business, our commercial strategy and our new launch opportunities position us well for future growth. Now, I will turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis. Rob Davis : Thanks, Adam. Good morning everyone. As Ken and Adam shared with you, 2014 was a year of strong execution and solid performance for Merck. From a financial perspective, we are leading a transformation in the business and are on track to achieve our strategic goals while sharpening our focus. From a deal perspective, we executed a significant number of business development deals in 2014. From our divestiture of the Consumer Care business to the acquisitions of Idenix, Cubist and OncoEthix, our deal strategy shows we are focusing our business on our core areas, which we believe will help drive future growth. We are also making steady progress to change the business model and achieve our cost production goals. Consistent with our guidance for 2014, we were successful in lowering our M&A and R&D expenses below 2013 levels. This drove a leverage P&L and is an example of how we\u2019ve changed the way we operate. For shareholders, 2014 was a significant year from a capital allocation perspective. We returned approximately $13 billion to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. This was a record year for Merck in terms of returning cash to shareholders and showed our commitment to being operationally focused and shareholder minded. Lastly, we met our guidance targets in 2014. We achieved the top end of our EPS guidance range by delivering $3.49 of earnings. Our performance throughout the year shows that we will manage our business to achieve our financial goals. Now turning to the fourth quarter and as a reminder, my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. Total company revenues were $10.5 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 7% year-over-year, which includes a negative 3 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. This decrease reflects $600 million in lost sales due to the divestitures, including the sale of the Consumer Care business to Bayer and approximately $200 million from the now ended joint venture with AstraZeneca. Excluding these items, as well as the impact from patent expiration, foreign exchange, the underlying business grew 3% in the quarter. As Adam stated, sales in the Pharmaceutical business were driven by growth in our core areas, offset by divestitures and competition for our Hep C vaccine franchise. Animal Health delivered a strong quarter with revenue of $885 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year excluding exchange. We had strong growth throughout our portfolio across both species and regions. We continue to see the benefit from the launch of BRAVECTO, which is now in 30 markets. The Animal Health business grew 5% ex-exchange and for the full year 2014, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in 2015. Now moving to expenses, gross margin was 74.6% in the quarter, which represents a 160 basis point increase year-over-year. Full year gross margin of 73.9% was approximately 40 basis points below prior year in line with for guidance. For operating expenses, we continue to manage our cost base and met our fourth quarter guidance. For the full year, we reduced our operating expenses by $1.3 billion year-over-year by disproportionately focusing our resources on key clinical programs, core brands and new product launches. We remain on track to deliver $2.5 billion of cost savings versus our 2012 base by the end of 2015. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 20% and 24.3% for the full year. The quarterly employee rates reflected benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014. Taking together, we earned $0.87 per share in fourth quarter as compared to $0.88 per share in the prior year and delivered full year EPS at the high-end of our guidance range. Now as we turn to guidance and our outlook for 2015. On the topline, we expect revenue to be $38.3 billion to $39.8 billion in 2015, using mid-January exchange rates. This range takes into account several key assumptions, including the negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, approximately $1 billion of net lost sales from acquisitions and divestitures and $500 million from the end of AstraZeneca joint venture. Additionally, this range reflects $2.6 billion of negative impact of revenue due to the recent strengthening of U.S. dollar against virtually all other currencies. This foreign-exchange headwind will also impact our EPS in 2015. At mid-January rates, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.32 to $3.47, which reflects a $0.27 impact from foreign currency. If you exclude the impact of exchange, we expect mid-single-digit EPS growth in 2015. We also expect EPS in the first half of the year to be lower than EPS in the second half of the year. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.62 and $1.91 in 2015. Now, I would look to provide some additional color on the other elements we have build into our EPS guidance. We expect product gross margin to be 75 to 100 basis points higher year-over-year, as we see margin expansion from the divestiture of lower margin businesses and products, improving product mix and manufacturing cost improvements. In 2015, we expect operating expenses overall to be lower year-over-year. For our marketing and administrative expense, we expect a decline versus 2014, as we continue to focus on our operating model. For research and development, we plan to invest in our innovative late-stage pipeline and therefore, expect a modest increase in our R&D line year-over-year. Altogether, we remain on track to achieve our target of a $2.5 billion reduction in expenses off of the 2,000 base by the end of 2015. I\u2019m sorry that was a 2012 base. Regarding tax, we expect the full year tax rate to be 22% to 23%. As in prior years, our guidance does not assume a renewal of the R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately $2.86 billion for 2015, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year. In summary, 2014 was a year of focused execution for Merck. Our commitment to the strategic reshaping of our company has been evident in the actions we've taken over the past year. We've been able to execute against our goals, while thoughtfully removing expenses from our operating base and continuing to drive productivity in our commercial business and in our labs. Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks, Rob. The fourth quarter saw increased investment in discovery research, clinical development and in regulatory affairs activities at Merck research laboratories. Turning first to product registrations, in December, we obtained FDA approval for Gardasil 9, a 9-valent Human Papillomavirus vaccine. As previously discussed, this vaccine will permit immunization against more than 90% of HPV strains associated with the development of cervical cancer. Summing over the calendar year, in 2014 we received U.S. approval for more new molecular entities, that is, new drugs and vaccines than in any previous year in the history of Merck & Co. Also during the fourth quarter we submitted our file supporting the registration of Bridion, for which we had previously received the complete response letter. It is our expectation that the FDA will convene an advisory committee of the Bridion file with an action expected in the second quarter of this year. On the development side, we continue to make progress on the evaluation of grazoprevir/elbasvir, together known as our doublet therapy for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. Phase III studies for this once daily therapy were fully enrolled during the fourth quarter, which, assuming that these data recapitulate what we have described previously in our Phase II program, should permit FDA filing in the first half of 2015. Results from some of these Phase III studies demonstrating the favorable attributes of our doublet therapy will be presented at the European Liver meetings to be held in Vienna in April. As noted in our press release, last week the U.S. FDA informed us of their intention to resend our breakthrough designation for grazoprevir/elbasvir for the treatment of Genotype 1 HCV infection, based on the availability of newly registered drugs that address this medical need. We intend to discuss this matter with the agency in the coming weeks. I will remind you that data presented during the AASLD meetings in November demonstrated the potential of our HCV doublet therapy to provide impressive sustained virologic responses in the vast majority of infected patients irrespective of co-morbidities. We also provided data on our polymerase inhibitor, now called MK-3682, which we hope to use as future triplet therapy for HCV infection. A robust Phase II program testing MK-3682, in combination with doublet therapies, is already underway and we expect to initiate Phase III studies with MK-3682 by the end of the year. Also in the fourth quarter, we provided data at the Society for Melanoma Research on the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma with KEYTRUDA. In a randomized trial compared with chemotherapy, the objective response rate was 21% versus 4% for chemotherapy at the labelled KEYTRUDA dose and the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.57, favoring KEYTRUDA. We continue to study KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy for malignant melanoma, data from our KEYNOTE-006 study comparing KEYTRUDA with ipilimumab and first or second line therapy as advanced disease will become available by midyear and we have registration enabling studies ongoing or planned in six other tumor types. As previously disclosed, we intend to file for approval of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer in mid 2015. In December, we also announced the acquisition of OncoEthix, which provides us with access to their leading BET-domain antagonist for hematologic and other malignancies. I will have more to say about this molecule during future earnings calls. The fourth quarter saw important progress in other therapeutic areas. In November, we presented the results of the IMPROVE-IT trial demonstrating that Vytorin provides significant benefit versus simvastatin in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients hospitalized following an acute coronary syndrome. The fact that two different mechanisms of LDL cholesterol lowering, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, that is statins, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors, that is Zetia, both reduce cardiovascular risk suggests that LDL cholesterol is itself the target of action of these drugs and augurs well for a favorable outcome in the REVEAL study of anacetrapib. Although an interim analysis of REVEAL will take place in 2015, we expect the trial to continue to an event driven completion. Also in the metabolic disease area, we have been informed by the executive committee of the TECOS study that they expect to have results available for presentation at the American Diabetes Association meetings in June. The trial has been administered by the Duke Clinical Research Institute and is currently still accruing data. As Ken mentioned, we are delighted to have the opportunity to form common cause with colleagues in the cubbies research and development organization. We have just embarked upon a holistic review of cubbies programs. But suffice it to say that this group complements our already strong programs in anti-viral agents and vaccines. Finally, I should note that our 2015 schedule promises to be exceptionally busy with substantial new data becoming available across all of our major programs. I look forward to sharing this information with you on future calls. Joe? Joseph Romanelli : Great. Thank you, Roger. And Christy, I think we are ready to turnover to the Q&A portion of the call and why don\u2019t we go ahead and take our first caller. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Vamil Diwan with Credit Suisse. Vamil Diwan : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just couple on the hep C breakthrough therapy designation discussed that you have implications on the companies that receive breakthrough therapies, designations for their products. So is there any other color you can provide on the back and forth around this decision? Did you have a sense that it\u2019s coming or just a real surprise to you when it came last week? And then just on the pricing side a lot of investors focus there as well in hep C. Are the dynamics in that market playing out in terms of pricing somewhat of the way you expected? Is it changing in a way how you view the longevity of this market? And then maybe back just throw in along pricing, if there is comments you could give on the PD1 in terms of access and the level of discounting necessary there, even that still has a somewhat similar access as well? Thanks. Ken Frazier : Roger. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : So Vamil, let me just -- this is Roger, let me just comment with respect to breakthrough designation, we continue to have the source of discussions that we have been having with the agency with regard to our doublet therapy which we are very excited about. Breakthrough designation of course doesn\u2019t affect our filing strategy and the data or the data. We have our Phase III moving along with our program. The agency has invited us to comment on their intent to withdraw breakthrough designation, and we intend to have those discussions with the agency. And we will see where that goes, but meanwhile we are moving forward with our program. And Adam, I think you have some to add. Adam Schechter : Hi, Vamil. So with regard to hepatitis C first, the first thing I want to say is that it is still a large market. There is over 3 million patients in U.S. alone and 100 million patients worldwide. So we believe that this is a market that will be sustainable for a long period of time. Whenever there is competitors, there is going to be increased competition in U.S. on pricing and rebates. And although the magnitude maybe discussed, I think the fact that there is competition is not a surprise at all. The good news is as we look at our success in managed care over the years, we\u2019ve had a lot of success across every therapeutic area that we compete within, whether it would be diabetes or cholesterol or HIV, even HCV when we had details in the marketplace. So we still feel good that we will be able to compete in the competitive environment with our very strong managed care capabilities. And if I remind, we have the doublet coming which we are excited about, but we are also excited about the potential of the triplet in the future as well. As you look at KEYTRUDA, so we are very pleased with the market access that we have today and the fact that reimbursement is happening very quickly for the approved indication. We continue to believe that the market is going to reward innovation. Particularly, innovation is going to improve clinical outcomes over the current therapies. And if you look at KEYTRUDA, the key is building a wall of data around that product and we\u2019ve got a very broad clinical program with over 60 studies. And we are looking at KEYTRUDA monotherapy as well as in combination therapies. And we believe as that data comes out, it will continue to reinforce the value proposition that we have for KEYTRUDA. So we are pleased with the initial access and we are going to continue to compete very effectively in that marketplace as well. Ken Frazier : Great. Thanks, Vamil. And Christy next caller? Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions on KEYTRUDA and then on Remicade. On KEYTRUDA, can you give us an updated timing on KEYNOTE-010, which is Phase 3 and lung cancer survival data, Clintrial seems to suggest that could report out later this year. And on that, will there be an interim look at any point at those results? And second KEYTRUDA question, can you comment on how you view the impact of KEYTRUDA from the new Compendia listing that supports the use of both your product and Optivo? In first-line melanoma, it seems like an unexpected win for you guys given the fact that at least to my knowledge you don\u2019t have any first-line melanoma data yet. Yet, NCCN just recently gave you this recommendation? And then on Remicade pricing in Europe in Norway, the product that the biosimilar product looks like it\u2019s coming in at something like a 60% discount. I know that\u2019s a small market, but I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about where you think biosimilar pricing might land in major markets in Europe in 2015? Ken Frazier : So Roger, do you want to\u2026 Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Yeah. So Tim, with respect to KEYNOTE-010, this trial as with the most all of the others is an event driven trial. And so the overall survival results will be looked at as a function of the number of events that occur in order to be adequately powered to see a difference, which we would hope would anticipate would exist. So we can\u2019t really predict what the timing will be, the timing that is in clinicaltrials.gov is our best estimate of what we\u2019re expecting. And we, of course, have a data safety monitoring board, that\u2019s reviewing these data. There always could be changes in terms of what seen and they might call us and want us to look at it, but that\u2019s really the status of the trial as it currently stands. I would just like to say that with respect to melanoma data and the question that Adam will take on, but we do have a considerable amount of data in all lines of therapy in melanoma, which we presented in various different settings. So we have a lot of efficacy data, that\u2019s already available in the first-line setting in na\u00efve patients. Adam Schechter : So Tim, I\u2019ll give you some context on KEYTRUDA, then I\u2019ll get directly to your question on NCCN. So we believe there\u2019s about 2,000 patients that are being treated in December. And we believe that virtually all of those patients were treated on the current label. And to give you some perspective on Compendia, if you look at the approval on 2014, NCCN compendium guidelines added KEYTRUDA for melanoma treatment consistent with our label very quickly. But as you mentioned in mid January, NCCN updated the guidelines for melanoma and they broaden the recommendations on melanoma and I\u2019ll give you a sense of what they did. First, there was consensus among NCCN panel that KEYTRUDA and Optivo has a higher response rate and less toxicity, compared to ipilimumab. Second, both drugs are included as options for first-line treatment and included on the list of preferred regimens. So although we promote on label only, it\u2019s clearly a positive for anti-PD-1 class and it\u2019s a positive for the future of cancer treatment. So we'll see how this plays out over the coming months, but we believe obviously, it\u2019s a positive for the class. As you look at Remicade, I think there\u2019s a couple things to think about. First of all, we had continued growth of Simponi, but we had declined in Remicade of 3%. And we are certainly trying to see some impact from the 20% of markets that had availability of biosimilars last year and Norway is one of those. And what we saw in Norway is first of all, it\u2019s been available for over a year. It was launched in October 2013 the biosimilar and I want to comment on the commercial strategy of the competitors, but we have seen this tender at a very sharp discount as you mentioned. But our expectation remains that customers will continue to take a measured approach and how they use biosimilars and especially, for the patients who are well controlled, at least at this early stage as we go into the broader European markets. So therefore, we believe in the broader European markets, we will see significant price decreases from the competition, but that it will impact primarily the new patients coming in. Therefore, we\u2019ll try to hang on to the existing patients for as long as we can. At the same time, there will certain markets like France and Spain that even if you hold a 100% of market share because of reference pricing, we\u2019re going to have a lower price there, no matter what happens in terms of market share. So we\u2019ll be monitoring and discussing that as we get through this year. And the key for us is continuing to have strong growth of Simponi. And as you saw Simponi grew about 40% in the fourth quarter versus prior year fourth quarter, so we are seeing good growth there. I\u2019ll say though that we don't expect the growth of Simponi to offset the decline in Remicade as we\u2019re in 2015. Tim Anderson : Thank you. Ken Frazier : Okay. Thank you, Tim. And Christy, next caller. Operator : Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman : Yes. Can you give us a little bit more color on the animal health it seems to have gotten much stronger? Second, can you talk about the FX impacts on the expense side for this year? You mentioned obviously, a lot of color on the topline. And then just update us on where we\u2019re going to see the Phase 3 data for the C. diff product? Thanks. Ken Frazier : So Rob, do you want to talk about FX and expense for 2015? Rob Davis : Sure. So as you look at foreign currency in the prepared comments as we mentioned, given what we\u2019ve seen really since September of last year the significant strengthening of U.S. dollar versus pretty much all currencies, we are seeing an impact. And as we said in our prepared comments, we see $0.27 of potential FX impact built into our assumptions. As we look at how this flows through the P&L, we do get some natural hedge ability through our numbers and we are hedging actively in the marketplace, but we can only offset a small percentage of the impact. And in fact, I would call more blunting of impact than ability to mitigate it. As we look at the flow through from sales to EPS, you will see a flow through at a slightly greater rate due to the fact that we do have more expenses in U.S. dollar driven primarily due to our R&D expenses in United States and our headquarter expenses relative to the percentage of our revenue. So that\u2019s all kind of the dynamic of what\u2019s playing through in the numbers you\u2019re seeing. But as I mentioned in the prepared comments, if you exclude FX from an earnings perspective, we actually grew, we\u2019ll be growing from 2014 to 2015. Adam Schechter : So on Animal Health, you can see the fourth quarter showed very strong performance on our Animal Health unit and overall 2014 is a very strong year. And the good news is that it is driven by strength across all regions and all species. And in particular, on depending on companion animals, it was really supported as we said by the launch of BRAVECTO which is underway all over the world. And this year, we\u2019re looking forward to mid-single digit growth in 2015. We\u2019ve also said that we will continue to look for opportunities to augment our Animal Health business in ways they create overall value for our shareholders. So we\u2019re very excited by that business. It is performing very well. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : It might we worth adding that recall that we\u2019ve now lapped the ZILMAX impacts. So part of what you\u2019re seeing in the strengthening quarter-on-quarter, our fourth quarter this year versus fourth quarter last year is in fact, the fact that ZILMAX is now added at compare. Ken Frazier : Great. Okay. Thank you, Mark for the questions and Christy, next caller. Operator : Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks for the question. Can you hear me okay? Joseph Romanelli : Yeah. We hear you Seamus. Seamus Fernandez : Okay. Great. So just first off, I wanted to get a little bit of color on the tax rate and the significant drop in the tax rate. Rob, can you discuss a little color on what the changes are there particularly, in the context of that no R&D credit actually be incorporated into that number? And then the second question is for Roger. Roger, can you help me understand a little bit more the differentiation about -- between the test and the Biomarker -- the potential availability of Biomarker competitor just received break through designation on the basis of PD-L1 status. So I\u2019m just wondering will Merck or would you expect Merck to have their diagnostics available as a Dako diagnostics available within the context of the lung cancer filing? And then also would it be available at launch. I think there is a lot of confusion amongst the investors as to the realities of the PD-L1 Biomarker test? Thanks. Joseph Romanelli : Okay. So Rob. Rob Davis : Yeah. So good morning. I\u2019ll answer the first question around tax. There are really several things contributing to the decrease on our tax rate year-over-year. First, the divestiture of the consumer care business is expected to benefit our 2015 tax rate given the fact that the majority of the U.S. consumer care business was a U.S. based business and that more than offsets the fact that there is a slight impact and then from a negative perspective to the acquisition of Cubist. So net of acquisitions and divestitures, we actually see a benefit flowing through our tax rate. And then outside of these factors, we do have favorable product in geographic mix year-on-year. We have some time items. I don\u2019t want to get into them, but flowing through. And then probably most importantly, we have and continue to look for specific strategies to actively manage the tax rate going forward. And well I don\u2019t want to give longer term guidance clearly that is something we are very focused on. And we\u2019ll continue to see as an important contributor. Joseph Romanelli : Roger. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : And Seamus, just on the PD-L1 biomarker. So first with respect to what is actually good for, in non-small cell lung cancer. There is no doubt that there is a correlation between PD-L1 expression and the pretreatment specimens and response rate progression free survival that we measure after treatment. So we will in fact have the Dako associated PD-L1 antibody test for immunohistochemistry available for filing and available for you slip the drug because that is an important aspect of treating patients. On the other hand, it is important to recognize that PD-L1 is not an absolute predictor of responsiveness that is to say that there are PD-L1 negative patients who never less respond to therapy. So the issue will be, how to capture in labeling language the way in which to use this test. It\u2019s not an absolutely predictive biomarker, but it is an important indicator of prognosis with respect to response. Ken Frazier : Okay. Great. Thank you, Seamus. And Christy next caller? Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the clarity. Several, but very short, one on JANUVIA item, what -- in the U.S. in 2014, would you mind giving us the volume versus price component particularly curious about price what happened to your net price in 2014? And then on the CETP, Roger, you mentioned that your expectation is that\u2019s going to go to final analysis, I just want to be clear. So you are basically telling us that you just don\u2019t expect that to be stopped early. And any expansion on that corner would we be appreciated? And then on TECOS, if I may you mentioned ADA that you\u2019ll have the data, but should investors expect that topline release before that yes or no? Thanks a lot. Adam Schechter : So hi Mark, this is Adam. With the regards to JANUVIA in the U.S., there was some positive impact from price, but it\u2019s mostly from volume. And if you look at TRX volume and you look at whether it\u2019s a current week, or rolling 12 weeks, you are seeing saying anywhere from a 6% to 7% increase for same week or same rolling 12-week time period in the prior year. So a little bit from price, but mostly volume. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Yeah. And Mark, it\u2019s Roger. And on CETP, yes, I think it\u2019s very unlikely that the study would be stopped early. It is important in general to the executive committee of the study I think speaking for those groups that are involved, Oxford and TIMI. They are extremely anxious to have a definitive answer with respect to the question of whether HDL elevation of the kind that you achieve anacetrapib through CETP inhibition, actually has a meaningful active or better affect on cardiovascular outcomes when used in combination with -- when used as a treatment for cardiovascular risk. And keep in mind, again, as you know well, Mark, that anacetrapib lower LDL cholesterol dramatically. So my comments were meant to say that since we know that LDL cholesterol-lowering is itself associated with a favorable outcome, one expects a favorable outcome. The question that\u2019s being asked is, can we do still more through CETP inhibition? I think we'll go to the end trying to find that out. Of course, we are all looking very carefully at the safety, all along the way and that could be a reason to stop the study. But on efficacy, I think it\u2019s very unlikely to stop at an interim. I think it will go to completion. And then with respect to TECOS, we\u2019d just have to see what the data look like. The study is being, of course run by Independent Executive Committee, Duke Center is coordinating it. They are going to pull together the data. They believe that they're going to be able to pull that together in time for presentation at the ATA Meetings. And depending on what we see, I mean that will decide how that's announced to you and to the public at large. Mark Schoenebaum : Thanks. Ken Frazier : Thank Mark. Appreciate it. And, Christy, next caller? Operator : Your next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust. John Boris : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So the first question has to do with some of the commentary, Adam, you gave on Remicade. I think you've indicated it. France has been, there has been some reference pricing. What is your -- across the major European countries, what\u2019s your assumption about the price compression across the major European countries in your plan for that franchise? And then the second question on your HIV strategy, Roger, ISENTRESS and maybe in combinations, secured approval on it. Can you talk about doravirine product profile, timing for completion of phase 3 trials and how that fits into a more broader combination strategy with the other assets that you have within the HIV portfolio? Joseph Romanelli : Okay. Adam? Adam Schechter : Yes. So -- hi, John. So, first one with regard to Remicade and it\u2019s hard to say because we\u2019ve never had a product of this magnitude. We\u2019ve got biosimilar competition in major European markets and it's hard to predict based on what happened in the smaller markets as to exactly what will happen in large markets. What we are assuming is that we can maintain a large number of the currently treated patients and we\u2019ll see the most pressure in new patients coming into the markets. The immediate mandatory price reductions, there's really four or five markers where that occurs is simply France, Spain, Austria and Belgium. And those are markets that it\u2019s going to depend on what the biosimilar do in other parts of Europe in terms of competition and what they do discount versus how they try to compete for the business in certain other markets. So what we've assumed is that we keep the majority of patients. There will be some pricing pressure. If you look at the overall franchise, we think that it will decline versus the prior year because the growth in Simponi, which will remain strong, will not offset the pressure that we\u2019ll see on the Remicade and the price erosion. But it\u2019s just too early to know exactly what could happen. We\u2019ve seen discounts so far of approximately 30%, but then you see what happened in Norway, which was more steep than that. So, we\u2019ll have to see where they go and we\u2019ll report over time what we see in the marketplace. Joseph Romanelli : Okay. Roger? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : And, John, with respect to HIV strategy, without going into an enormous amount of detail and totality of it, as you know, ISENTRESS is an extremely important platform for therapy and as the data that we described last year, from the advanced studies that demonstrate that moving ISENTRESS to once-daily platform obviously is something that is important to do. MK-1439, Doravirine, is intended ultimately if it reaches its objectives to replace efavirenz which is another platform. And the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor category, what we know is that this is an extremely important aspect of combination therapy. And yet, there are some real concerns about the ability of patients to adhere to efavirenz because of adverse experiences. 1439 has very favorable properties. Doravirine has very favorable properties. And we\u2019re expecting to see, we are within phase 3 now for that study. We are expecting to see our data in the 2016, late 2016 timeframe. And based on what those data show us then we will be in a he position to put that molecule in combination with the other programs that we have including ISENTRESS. So that\u2019s an aspect. But there are many, many aspects of the combination therapy that gives you a sense where we think we are, where we think we are right now. John Boris : Thanks. Ken Frazier : Okay. Great. Thanks. And Christie, next caller? Operator : Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jay Olson : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Jay Olson on behalf of Jami. A couple questions for Roger. The first question is about Hep C from regulatory perspective. With the recent approvals of oral Hep C regimens, does it change the way you plan to run your phase 3 program? And specifically, will you include the new standard of care as an active comparator in your phase 3 studies? And then second, can you update us on the development plans for MK-4166? When should we expect to see clinical data and when should we look for new studies to be posted on clinicaltrials.gov? Thank you. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Okay. First of all, for the Hep C program, our phase 3 studies, the first wave of phase 3 studies that support registration are essentially complete. So those data are being prepared and our expectation is that we are going to be able to file the Hep C program in the first half of this year that\u2019s what we\u2019ve said. And so there is really no change to those programs that we can engineer at this point. The studies are done and off course, those studies were studies that we designed, I\u2019m following lots of discussions with the FDA. So that\u2019s kind of where we are with respect to those. And we are looking for having the opportunity to describe those data, two year and the data will be presented in significant part at EASL. With respect to 4166, which others know is our GIRT agonist program, which is one of the combination programs in our immuno-oncology program. It\u2019s in Phase 1 has been since the middle of last year. Data are accruing and we hope to have the opportunity to share those data with you in -- not just in future. Ken Frazier : Great. Thank you, Jay. And Christy next calls. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America. Colin Bristow : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just a few quick ones, on odanacatib, can you give us an update on the progress towards tool regulatory submission, on the business development front? Can you just give an update on your strategy with respect to therapies of areas of interest and optimal deal size and whether any of this has been impacted at all by the recent high profile pricing headline? And then finally on the animal health business, are there any specific internal reviews scheduled with regard the potential divestiture of this unit or this more of an ongoing fluid price? Thanks. Adam Schechter : So with respect to refining the overall portfolio not with respect to animal health specifically, we continue to evaluate our strategy and our opportunity to create greater value for shareholders and for customers. I have said very clearly that, we see animal health as a great business. We are very interested in that business. We\u2019re looking to augment that business. From a business development standpoint, first of all, we do remain committed to business development as a way of augmenting our pipeline with programs that, as Roger said, provide unambiguous promotable advantage and while we have a significant number of deals last year, including Cubist, Idenix and OncoEthix. In 2015, we will also pursue the right kind of deals, which for us are bolt-on opportunities that will either drive our pipeline, which of course, is the most important thing to our future growth or we might pursue additional commercial assets, if we believe that we have the ability in our portfolio to maximize with our reach, our expertise and our fit, what those molecules can do. So I would say we\u2019ll continue to look for value-added bolt-on opportunities and I\u2019ll remind that we believe we have the right balance sheet to continue to do this. Ken Frazier : Great. Roger? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : And with respect to, Colin, with respect to odanacatib, as we\u2019ve said, as we showed at the last year's meetings, odanacatib has a very impressive affects in terms of reducing the risk vertebral, nonvertebral and hip fractures, and there is a particularly strong effect in reducing the risk of clinical vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The problem in our data set was that there were some inconsistencies with respect to MACE events. And we decided after looking at that and after discussions with FDA that we would re-adjudicate all of those events. So we're in the process of doing that, re-adjudication is going forward. FDA is participated in the design of that process and we\u2019re working through it as soon as those data are complete .We\u2019ll pull it all together and we\u2019ll have the opportunity to file, which we expect to do by the end of the year. Joseph Romanelli : Great. Thank you, Colin, and Colin, congratulations on the arrival of your first baby, your daughter few weeks ago. Colin Bristow : Thank you. Ken Frazier : Christy, next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you. First a follow-up on pembrolizumab in lung and the filing around midyear, it would seem that the data available in the PD-1 negative population is too limited to support a filing in that population, I'm wondering if you disagree? Secondly, to clarify on your comments on the REVEAL trial, are you saying that it won't stop because the DSMB wants a definitive answer and not because there won\u2019t be a reduction in the event rate at the interim, so there could be a reduction in the event rate at the interim, but it won't stop because a definitive answers sort? That\u2019s the second question. And then lastly, Glaxo recently released some very strong topline results from their Zoster vaccine? Two questions, if the results hold up and the full data is released what will be your commercial response? And it would seem logical to meet that Merck will do a study of ZOSTAVAX given in a two dose regimen? Are you contemplating that study? Thank you. Ken Frazier : So, Roger? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Yeah. So, Steve, with respect to PD-L1 in lung, we actually we have a very large data set, we\u2019ve described through our presentations also on clinicaltrials.gov, more than nearly 600 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, included in that a lot of individuals who have low PD-L1 expression. But let me point out, it is a continued of the PD-1 expression. So the issue really is when you looking at it with our immuno-histochemistry test, what is the cut point that you use. And there are patients who are absolutely completely negative. We can find a single cell seemingly that\u2019s PD-L1 expressing, of course, that's based on a very small biopsy sample, you don't know what would happen if you look to another sample or there could be population of cells that are expressing there. And then there are others which seemingly every cell is expressing and then the vast bulk of individuals who are somewhere in the middle. And so the question is, what is a PD-L1 positive patient, we obviously, haven\u2019t approach to that, so we have develop through series of statistical analysis, but that something that clearly we have to be reviewed with the agency as we go forward. With respect to REVEAL, I am very confident for the reasons that I mentioned that there will be a favorable effect of anacetrapib in terms cardiovascular risk. It has very impressive effects on LDL cholesterol and that should be associated with the lowering risk, but that isn\u2019t the question really that\u2019s addressed in the trial. The trial is trying to address the question of whether HDL elevation known for decades as associated with improve cardiovascular outcomes has meaningful effects. And for this reason the trial is structured in such a way that as its typical for such trials, but its unlikely that DSMB is going to call the study, unless there is just an extraordinary favorable result. So that\u2019s my expectation and\u2026 Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Yeah. Steve, with regard to ZOSTAVAX, so first, when you think about the GSK product, there is still a lot more we need to learn beyond the limited Phase 3 efficacy data that was available in the press release. So we are looking forward to the data being published and available, so we can learn a lot more about that vaccine. But if you look at ZOSTAVAX specifically, there are lots of attributes that customers really value. First of all, the single dose vaccine has established track record of safety and efficacy in both clinical trials, but also in real world evidence studyings. And we have already distributed over 20 million doses across 25 markets. There is still a lot of unvaccinated patients in the U.S. alone that can benefit from it. And as you can see in the marketplace we have increased our direct-to-consumer advertising. We are doing a lot to try to treat as many patients as possible in the short-term. Adam Schechter : To be blunt, we are trying to get patients to originate to get a single dose vaccine. And we think that that is something that we continue to do, getting people to originate twice to get a double shot is probably a little bit more challenging. Ken Frazier : Great. Thanks, Steve, and Christy, next caller. Operator : Your next question comes from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Tony Butler : Yes. Good morning. Thanks very much. I will be brief and it\u2019s around OpEx. Adam, you have made some comments around the reduction in SG&A and some modest increase in R&D? But was SIVEXTRO launching in Europe, ZERBAXA in U.S. and some others. The question is, are you really providing sufficient support to those new launches? Second, likewise, from an R&D perspective, with TECOS indiscernible 2.46] rolling off, the question is, I might have thought much like 2014, R&D expense would be flat to down, yet there up is at more related to increased dollar spend for KEYTRUDA or what? Then third, again, on CTP, anacetrapib, Roger, forgive me if you actually stated this but is your intention to put out a press release will it be at the end of the quarter or part of a quarter call would you state the trial has continued the DSMB met, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you. Ken Frazier : Adam? Adam Schechter : Hi, Tony. I will start with regard to operational excellence. It first starts off with focus and what you have seen is we have really put our resources behind the four focused areas that I\u2019ve talked about before. And although, total SG&A had come down last, what you saw is we increase our spend in diabetes and we built a oncology business unit to launch KEYTRUDA and we fully allocate resources to there. We look at every launch as a very important opportunity and we intent to fund those launches to be successful and we will cut another areas, but we are not going to cut an areas that are key priority growth areas for us, in particular we think about diabetes, hospital, acute care, vaccines and oncology. But also other launches that are even outside of those areas, we are going to fund those and we are going to resource those for a success. So it really does come down to, where else we reduce expenses and it\u2019s going to be outside of those key growth areas. Ken Frazier : So, Roger, do you want to cover on R&D or Rob. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Broadly speaking for R&D recognized magnitude of the clinical trial costs associated with moving forward with the totality of the KEYTRUDA program and all of the other programs that we are pursuing. That said, I believe, firmly, we have delivered what it means and we will do everything we can to prioritized those investments. This is something that Adam and I do together and thinking about how to develop our portfolios and we are quite disciplined about that. We do expect that because of the profound opportunities of KEYTRUDA, there will be an increase in expenses. But we will -- we are going to manage that very carefully. And with respect to anacetrapib, the trial will continue, there will not be a reason to announce that the trial was continuing. If something happens, of course, we will let you know about it. But in general, I think, we should expect that you'll hear about the trial when we obtain the results. Rob Davis : And Tony, this is Rob. I just might add that I do think and agree with Adam, we are adequately investing where we need to invest for new products. I think the fact that we\u2019re growing the R&D spend is more a statement of the success of our programs and our excitement on our pipeline because to Roger\u2019s point, we\u2019re very disciplined. And I think that shows in the fact that overall, we are still expecting to lower OpEx in 2015 versus 2014 versus focus. So it is, I think, a good story of focus and discipline. Tony Butler : Thank you. Ken Frazier : Great. Thank you, Tony. And Christy, I think we have time for two more callers. Operator : Sure. Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thanks. First, Roger on anacetrapib, can you talk how specifically the study leaders in your cells would attribute benefit to LDL lowering versus HDL raising at the end of the study? Secondly for Adam, do you have any recent market share data on how KEYTRUDA is faring versus Optivo in the label indication? And perhaps, how you\u2019re trying to differentiate your molecule? And how you might try to differentiate in lung? And lastly post IMPROVE-IT, are there any updated plans for the LIPTRUZET product? And are you thinking OTC on ZETIA at all? Thanks. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Okay. On anacetrapib, Gregg, there is no way to assign benefit to any particular mechanism, except to say that there is an awfully good nomogram that correlates LDL cholesterol lowering with the degree of reduction in major cardiovascular events. And that nomogram is supported by all set of studies with different agents now, particularly in line of IMPROVE-IT. So you have a general feel for the magnitude that you're expecting. The question is do you see something that\u2019s above and beyond that. I think that what\u2019s critical in the study of anacetrapib is to get a very, very hard number and to be really comfortable with the magnitude of the treatment effect and we\u2019ll see that when the study completes. Gregg Gilbert : Okay. Ken Frazier : And Gregg, with regard to KEYTRUDA, there is really no market share data at this point in time. It still very early but a couple of things to think about. First of all, we noted that in December, we have about 2,000 patients and most of those are -- perhaps majority of those are on the approved indications. So the math, how many patients are out there, we think, we\u2019ve done a very good job in terms of the label indication getting a lot of patients already on KEYTRUDA. But I think the key thing is that this marketplace has room for multiple competitors and this is going to play out over years. It\u2019s not going to play out over days or weeks or months. And as I think about it, I think about this market place almost like the anti-TNFs where you have multiple players, some are strong in one indication and then another could be stronger in the different indication. We\u2019re going to have to see how combination plays out over years. But what we\u2019re doing is we're building our oncology business unit to really maximize the potential of KEYTRUDA over the long term. And Roger, in the past, has talked about the numerous studies that we have underway as monotherapy, the number of cancer types that we\u2019re studying. And we believe that the totality of the data will allow us to really be able to be successful for KEYTRUDA over time. With regard to LIPTRUZET, I\u2019ll broaden it to how do we think about VYTORIN, ZETIA and the overall ZETIA franchise. We have to wait for the information to be in the label in the U.S. before our representatives can begin to promote the product and that hasn\u2019t occurred yet but once it does occur, we\u2019ll actively promote the data into label. We\u2019re having very good comments from cardiologist and physicians about the trial but we are going to wait before we can promote it into label on the U.S. The good news is outside the U.S., the patent in Europe goes past 2016. And in Japan, it goes into 2019. So in other markets around the world, we have a longer time in order for us to actually be successful in introducing the improvement data to physicians in those countries. Ken Frazier : Great. Thanks, Greg. And, Christy, our last call? Operator : Sure. Your final question comes from Chris Schott of J.P. Morgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple quick ones here. First, coming back to HCV, I guess just elaborating a little bit more. Do you see access as a challenge in 2016, given some of the exclusive contracts that are currently being signed by some of your competitors and should we think about another step-down in price for the category as you enter the market? Second one was on KEYTRUDA beyond the lung filing. What\u2019s the next tumor type we should be watching in terms of a potential filing? And then finally, as you adjust to go with the broader bio portfolio at Merck, when could we see additional Merck developed bio agents enter the clinic and what mechanisms are you most excited about when you think about your pre-clinical portfolio? Thanks so much. Ken Frazier : Adam? Adam Schechter : So, first, with regard to HCV and so we don\u2019t know the exact language in the contracts that competitors have signed. So, I will put that aside not knowing the exact wording the contracts. But in general, we\u2019ve had very-very good success with managed care access across multiple different therapeutic area, multiple different specialty classes where there is intense competitors and we believe that we will be able to get good access once we launch the product. I don\u2019t want to discuss our contracting or pricing strategy but we are going to make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace in order to get access. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : And, Chris, with regard to KEYTRUDA filings, as we\u2019ve discussed before beyond melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Last year, we had the opportunity to present data from five additional tumor types in which, response rates really suggest that registration enabling studies to proceed and we are pursuing all of those. So that includes, of course head and neck cancer, includes gastric cancer, includes bladder cancer, triple negative breast cancer and Hodgkin's Lymphoma data. And we have quite strong, quite provocative data in all those areas that we\u2019ve had chance to share with you. We\u2019ve initiated studies in many of those cases and depending on upon what those results look like, that would provide the basis potentially for filings going forward. We\u2019ll have a lot more to say about that but those are the areas which are most advanced right now and I\u2019ll look at clinicaltrials.gov. We will reveal that in particular, colorectal, head neck cancer and other cancers. And then with respect to other immuno-oncology assets, of course we have the GITR asset, we\u2019ve already talked about and we\u2019ve discussed LAG-3, which will be coming forward. We are very interested in the set of cell surface molecules that are both stimulatory and antagonistic with respect to immune regulation and we have developed internally derived antibodies against a whole cluster of those. You are going to have a chance of seeing a number of them coming forward in this calendar year. Joseph Romanelli : Okay. Thanks, Roger. Ken? Ken Frazier : Okay. Let me just summarize, I think we had a solid 2014, with growth in all of our core areas, EPS at the high end of the range. Importantly, six new product approvals in the United States and that innovation, momentum continues in 2015. We will be filing for lung in mid-2015, our HCV filings in the second half of 2015. We are making steady progress in a number of areas within MRL, and we are going to continue to do business development to develop best external collaborations we can. As it relates to 2015 underlying business, our core business again will be growing and again, I stress that, x for x, we are growing EPS mid single digit in 2015. So the underlying portfolio is performing well and the Merck Research Lab\u2019s performing well. So thank you very much for hanging in there with us, for little bit more than extended call. And look forward to talking to you soon. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the call of the Joseph Romanelli, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as the acquisition related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results. There are reconciliation tables available in our press release so you can get a better understanding of the underlying performance. We've also provided tables to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units as well as for products. This can be found in table three of our press release and the reconciliation table I mentioned earlier is in table two of the release. During the call we will be referring to table two for the P&L and table three as it relates to revenue. Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call might be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including item 1A in the 2014 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on Merck.com. With that, this morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone and thank you all for joining our call today. We are off to a very promising start this year in 2015 and we are seeing additional confirmation that Merck's scientific and business strategies together with our focused investments are paying off. In the first quarter, we saw strong topline growth from our core human health therapeutic areas and our Animal Health business. At the same time, our late stage pipeline and the product approvals we gained last year are now coming to fruition with launches like KEYTRUDA, BELSOMRA, and ZERBAXA. It's an exciting time at Merck because we believe that our pipeline will continue to deliver medically important products over the coming months and years. By bringing greater focus and discipline to all aspects of our business, we will continue to transform Merck into a more competitive, more innovative company built on a platform for sustainable future growth. Adam will discuss the quarter's product performance in greater detail later in the call. Looking to the future, what we at Merck find most energizing is the progress we are making across our pipeline, progress evidenced by strong data presented during several recent major medical meetings. For example, last week at AACR, Merck presented KEYTRUDA data in three tumor types. It was both inspiring and encouraging to see and hear the impact KEYTRUDA is having in patients with lung cancer, melanoma and mesothelioma, which is a particularly challenging cancer with limited treatment options. Not surprisingly, the feedback we've received from physicians has been overwhelmingly positive. We also announced new filings for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer and melanoma, which brings us another step closer to reaching more patients with this life-saving medicine. Additionally, we presented new Phase 3 data from our HCV doublet program at EASL last week. We are seeing robust responses to the doublet with significant cure rates across all patient types including hard-to-treat patients. As you know, we also received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for some of these patients who have a clear unmet need. Finally, this week at ECCMID, this past week at ECCMID, we continued to reinforce our long-standing commitment to the global fight against infectious diseases, including antibiotic resistant infections. This is another area where Merck will continue to lead the charge to address an unmet global need. Roger will discuss the progress of our pipeline in greater detail later in the call. Immuno-oncology, hepatitis C and cardiometabolic disease are just a few examples of our most promising late stage programs, programs that are predicated upon what has long defined Merck, our ability to generate innovative, medically important products that address global unmet medical need. In the evolving healthcare environment, commercial success will accrue to those who develop medicines and vaccines that help patients to live healthier and more productive lives and reduce overall healthcare expenditures. We will remain focused on bringing forward the best scientific and medical innovations sourced both internally and externally, because we believe that this is the best path to intrinsic long-term value creation. By capitalizing on the significant and exciting scientific and clinical opportunities that lie ahead, Merck intends to play a major role in transforming healthcare for the benefit of patients, payers and shareholders alike. The advances in immuno-oncology, hepatitis C and anti-infectives I mentioned earlier are just the beginning. There are numerous other examples ranging from chronic and debilitating neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, to urgent and pressing global threats, like Ebola. These remind us both of the immensity of unmet global medical need and the unprecedented opportunity we have to address that need with transformational medicine. It is an exciting time to be at Merck on both the research and commercial fronts. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Adam Schechter. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss the first quarter results for Global Human Health. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. We are off to a strong start in 2015. We continue to drive growth within the core portfolio while entering a phase of important launches. Sales in the first quarter grew 5% reflecting the following : growth in all four core areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology; the integration of the Cubist portfolio; and product divestitures. Now I will review performance of several key products followed by a brief update by region and then commentary on a few of our most important launches. So I will start with JANUVIA. The JANUVIA franchise reached approximately $1.4 billion in sales and grew 10% in the quarter. In the United States, sales grew 4%. Strong performance this quarter was driven by continued focus and investment to defend our 75% market share and to grow the DPP-4 class. As you may recall, TRx volume was declining during the first quarter of last year, also allowing for a favorable comparison. In the international markets, sales grew 17%. Europe grew as a result of market events last year, which led to share gains, particularly in Germany. Emerging markets continued to show strong demand. We are off to a strong start to deliver global growth for JANUVIA in 2015. Next in Hospital and Specialty Care, sales of ISENTRESS grew 6% to approximately $390 million, primarily as a result of tenders in certain emerging markets. In immunology, sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI were approximately $660 million, growing 1%. Continued strong growth in SIMPONI was mostly offset by a 3% decline in REMICADE. All remaining European markets lost patent protection for REMICADE in February. We are still in the early stages of biosimilar competition in core EU markets. But the discounts offered by biosimilars are higher than our original expectations of 30%. Discounts are closer to 45%. However, we have yet to see many of the initial tender results to understand what the net prices may become over time. We continue to maintain the vast majority of patients who are already well controlled on REMICADE. We anticipate that the impact of biosimilar competition, particularly for new patients, will accelerate throughout the year as more tenders occur in the core European markets. In hospital acute care, sales grew to approximately $800 million. Strong double-digit growth from our broad portfolio, coupled with the addition of sales from Cubist products, solidifies our position as a global leader in hospital acute care. With important in line brands and new product launches such as ZERBAXA, we continue to expect that this segment will be a core contributor of growth for Merck. Now turning to the Vaccine business. In the first quarter vaccine sales grew 9% to approximately $1.3 billion. Growth was driven by pediatric vaccines, given the recent public attention to measles, which has now subsided, and also by ZOSTAVAX. Sales of ZOSTAVAX were $175 million in the quarter reflecting growth of 25%. Sales in the United States grew as a result of continued DTC efforts. Globally, we also saw positive contributions from Canada as well as in markets in Asia, which are continuing to launch. Combined sales of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 reached approximately $360 million in the first quarter, a decline of 5%. Growth in the United States, which reflects higher public sector purchases of about $30 million, was more than offset by timing of government purchases in Brazil. In February, the ACIP recommended GARDASIL 9 for routine use in line with the GARDASIL recommendations. Managed care coverage continued to build following the ACIP meeting, and coverage is rapidly approaching that of GARDASIL. Physicians currently are transitioning to this new vaccine that offers increased protection from cervical cancer-causing HPV. Now I will provide some geographic commentary for the quarter. In the United States sales increased 10% excluding Cubist. There was growth across primary care, oncology, vaccines, and hospital acute care. Sales in Europe decreased 5%. Growth from the JANUVIA franchise and SIMPONI was offset by ophthalmology product divestitures and declines in HCV and REMICADE. Japan sales declined 13% as growth in Pneumovax was offset by ophthalmology product divestitures and the biannual price decreases that took effect in April of last year. Emerging markets sales grew 7%, including 16% growth in China. Now I will spend a few moments speaking to several important launches, and I'll start with BELSOMRA. We are pleased with the initial months of the BELSOMRA launch in the United States. As of the end of March, there were about 4000 total weekly prescriptions. To date, we have achieved positive coverage decisions for nearly 50 million commercial lives, and half of those lives required no step edit. Our teams are continuing to drive awareness with this exciting, first-in-class treatment for patients suffering with insomnia. Moving to ZERBAXA, following the acquisition of Cubist in January, we rapidly began working with our new colleagues in the launch of ZERBAXA, a new treatment for certain complicated gram-negative infections. We are just beginning to see formulary additions. As expected in this market, formulary access is critical before use occurs. The growing resistance issue with gram-negative pathogens is driving positive discussions and positive formulary uptake for ZERBAXA. In oncology, we saw strong performance in the continuing launch of KEYTRUDA. Sales reached $83 million in the quarter. We have achieved rapid penetration of the on label indication in advanced melanoma. Additionally, NCCN guidelines recommend reimbursement in the first line treatment of melanoma. Importantly, physicians continue to gain comfort and experience treating patients with KEYTRUDA, a product that will become foundational in the treatment of melanoma and potentially in a number of other cancers. We continue to believe that the immuno-oncology area holds great promise for patients and that it will be a very large and significant market. Lastly, we are excited about the future opportunities we see, particularly with our hepatitis C portfolio. This is a market where we have succeeded in the past, and we are excited for what the launch can mean for patients and for Merck. In summary, Global Human Health is off to a strong start in 2015. We drove growth as a result of strong performance in focused areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology. Furthermore, the integration of Cubist is fortifying our growth platform in hospital acute-care. The strength of our underlying business, our focused commercial strategy and the launch opportunities in our hands position us well for the remainder of 2015 and for future growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Adam, and good morning everyone. As Ken and Adam shared with you, our results this quarter demonstrate our ability to simultaneously grow our businesses and effectively reduce our cost base. We continue to remain focused on transforming our operating model, achieving our cost reduction targets and ensuring we have a leveraged P&L. This morning I will provide some additional detail on the quarter and comment on our outlook for the rest of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. Total company revenues were $9.4 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, which includes a negative five-percentage point impact from foreign exchange. The 5% impact from exchange is net of a 2% hedging benefit we realized in the quarter. Our sales decline reflects approximately $700 million of lower revenue from divestitures, including the sale of our consumer care business to Bayer as well is $379 million in decline in other revenue in the quarter due to the termination of the AstraZeneca JV and the sale of U.S. SAPHRIS rights. The overall top line decline was partially offset by a $208 million increase in revenue from the integration of the Cubist portfolio following the close of the transaction in late January. Excluding these items and the impact of foreign exchange, the underlying base business grew 6% in the quarter. As Adam stated, our sales growth in the pharmaceutical business was driven by growth across our core therapeutic areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, oncology and vaccines. Our animal health business delivered another strong quarter of growth with revenue of $829 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year excluding exchange. The growth this quarter was primarily driven by our companion animal business, reflecting the continued strong launch of BRAVECTO. We're excited about the progress we've made in this first full year of BRAVECTO's launch. Now moving to expenses, gross margin was 76.5% in the quarter, which represents a 240 basis point increase year-over-year driven by product mix, including the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange. We now expect full-year gross margin to be approximately 100 basis points higher versus 2014. Marketing and administrative expenses were $354 million lower in the quarter driven by declines in direct selling costs and net favorability from acquisitions and divestitures. We remain focused on funding opportunities for growth while reducing our overall cost base. Overall, we continue to expect a decline in marketing and administrative expenses compared to 2014. Research and development expenses were $1.7 billion in the quarter, $149 million higher than prior-year, driven primarily by licensing costs incurred in the quarter. We continue to expect a modest increase in R&D expense versus prior-year. We expect total company operating expenses to be lower versus last year and we remain on track to reduce our operating expense by $2.5 billion compared to 2012 by the end of this year. Other income and expense was $69 million of expense in the quarter compared with income in the prior-year primarily due to a nonrecurring gain from the divestiture of Sirna in 2014. Finally, regarding our tax rate, our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 22.4%. We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full-year to be between 22% and 23%. Taken together, we earned $0.85 per share in the first quarter, which reflects strong operational performance as well as $0.06 benefit due to higher equity income from our research investment fund, revenue hedging gains, and other one-time items. This compares to $0.88 per share in the prior-year, which included $0.11 of gains from the sale of U.S. SAPHRIS rights and the divestiture of Sirna. Turning to our outlook for the year, we now expect the strengthening U.S. dollar to have a roughly $2.8 billion impact on our full-year sales results. Despite additional FX pressure, we are maintaining our sales guidance of $38.3 billion to $39.8 billion. Now regarding EPS, we continue to expect FX to have a $0.27 impact in 2015. We anticipate that most of that impact will occur in the remainder of the year. In light of our strong first-quarter performance, tempered by our nonoperational gains this quarter, and the anticipated incremental negative impact of FX we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.48 which reflects an increase from our prior guidance. In summary, we're off to a strong start in 2015. As we continue to focus on execution we are seeing the benefit of our efforts in revenue growth in core products and markets, a lower cost base, and this first wave of innovation and new product launches. Lastly, as I previously mentioned, we remain on track to achieve our cost reduction goals by the end of 2015. Now I will turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : Thanks, Rob. We had a very busy first-quarter in research and development culminating in several important regulatory filings and research presentations. Turning first to KEYTRUDA, our PD-1 directed monoclonal antibody designed to promote activation of pre-existing tumor directed immune responses, we have previously announced that the Data Monitoring Committee recommended early conclusion of our KEYNOTE-006 study, which compared KEYTRUDA to ipilimumab in the first and second line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. Details of this study, including the favorable outcomes observed for response rates, progression free survival, and overall survival were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia last week and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Also presented at the AACR meeting and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were the results of KEYNOTE-001 cohorts including patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with KEYTRUDA following progression after systemic chemotherapy. In these studies we observed that expression of PD-L1, one of the two ligands for PD-1 the target of KEYTRUDA, in greater than 50% of tumor cells was associated with substantially higher response rates than what was seen in patients whose tumors did not express PD-L1. These responses occurred irrespective of the underlying histologic classification of the presenting non-small cell lung cancer. These data were included in our recent submission to the FDA seeking approval for KEYTRUDA in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that has progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy and where EGF receptor or ALK-directed therapy is not indicated. This filing joins another filing based on our earlier KEYNOTE-002 study, which is now under review at the FDA demonstrating that in a randomized comparison KEYTRUDA therapy is superior to conventional chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma as judged by progression-free survival. We expect to file the results of our KEYNOTE-006 study, which I mentioned earlier, by the middle of the year. Data from our melanoma studies is also under review by the Committee on Human Medicinal Products at the European Medicines Agency. I should note that during the first quarter, KEYTRUDA was approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in Canada and Australia, among other jurisdictions. We are particularly gratified that melanoma patients in Australia will now be able to benefit from KEYTRUDA treatment since this is the region of the world with the highest incidence of this life-threatening disease. I also wish to emphasize that although we have studied a range of KEYTRUDA doses in our clinical trials, our data are persuasive that 2-milligrams per kilogram given every three weeks is as efficacious as higher doses across all tumor types studied. Indeed we are advancing a unit dose of 200 milligrams every three weeks, which we hope to show is equally effective. This will simplify dosing for the vast majority of patients for whom KEYTRUDA is an appropriate therapy. Finally, I will mention again that during 2014 we provided data indicating that KEYTRUDA has activity in seven different tumor types : head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer; and we are pursuing registration enabling studies in each of these indications. At the AACR meeting, we presented the first data from our signal detection study called KEYNOTE-028, demonstrating tumor shrinkage in patients with malignant plural mesothelioma following KEYTRUDA administration. This represents an eighth malignancy for which data supporting further potentially registration-enabling studies can be pursued. During the upcoming American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings in June, we will present 33 abstracts, including nine oral presentations describing the activity of KEYTRUDA in different settings, which can potentially be used to sharpen treatment algorithms for malignant disease. In all we now have more than 14,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials aimed at defining the attributes of KEYTRUDA therapy. Also during the first quarter, we completed Phase 3 studies of grazoprevir/elbasvir treatment for patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Some of these data were presented last week at the European Association for the Study of the Liver meetings in Vienna, demonstrating that our doublet regiment produced 95% sustained virologic responses at 12 weeks in patients suffering from genotypes one, four or six infection with hepatitis C virus. In addition, data presented at the meeting showed responses in patients simultaneously infected with immunodeficiency virus or suffering from renal insufficiency including those on hemodialysis. Summarizing across this very large data set, much of which was also published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, we conclude that combined treatment with grazoprevir/elbasvir presented together in a single oral dosage form given once daily permits control of hepatitis C infection in a broad range of patients. I remind you that we have received breakthrough designation for this doublet therapy in the treatment of patients with genotype four infection and for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype one infection in patients receiving hemodialysis, an important subset of the total HCV infected population. We plan to file for approval of this combination with the FDA by midyear. Yesterday we announced the results from our TECOS study in patients with type-two diabetes. This study compared treatment with JANUVIA as a means of maintaining lower levels of glycated hemoglobin, a measure of diabetic control, with alternative standard regimens, and was designed to collect data regarding the cardiovascular safety of JANUVIA treatment as compared to these other regimens. The TECOS study, conducted under the sponsorship of the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit and the Duke Clinical Research Center is the largest one of its type, enrolling almost 15,000 patients from 38 countries and with a median follow-up of more than three years. As I have indicated previously, the study investigators will present their data at the June American Diabetes Association forum in just a few weeks; and hence, I will not describe the results in detail. I will say, however, that the study met its primary endpoint. JANUVIA therapy was non-inferior to treatment with alternative regimens with respect to the composite cardiovascular endpoint. Observed adverse experiences were generally consistent with what has been previously reported in post-approval studies of JANUVIA. I should note that during the month of April, the FDA convened an advisory committee to examine the safety of two other DPP-4 inhibitors for which cardiovascular outcomes data have previously been made available as a result of the SAVOR-TIMI and EXAMINE trials. Of special interest to the FDA and to committee members were results suggesting that DPP-4 inhibitors might be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure. This was an explicit endpoint of the TECOS study, and I can report that there was no imbalance in heart failure hospitalization comparing the JANUVIA treatment arm with the treatment group receiving other therapies designed to reduce hyperglycemia. Beyond TECOS, I will remind you that we are also engaged in a 30,000 patient outcomes study called REVEAL, testing whether anacetrapib, our novel CETP inhibitor, can when added to standard therapy reduce the frequency of major cardiovascular events in patients at significant risk for such events. Earlier this month, we received a proposal from the steering committee of the trial to change the study protocol to include ischemic stroke as a complement of the primary composite endpoint. This proposal is based in part on data that emerged last year from the IMPROVE-IT study which documented a reduced risk of ischemic stroke associated with LDL cholesterol-lowering. With this in mind, in advance of any interim analysis of REVEAL, it was proposed that ischemic stroke, rather than revascularization, would prove to be a more appropriate measurement for the cardiovascular composite endpoint. The letter from the steering committee should not be taken to mean that investigators are aware of any outcomes from the REVEAL trial itself, the study remains blinded. However, given the proposed change in endpoint, they also wish to adjust the timing of the proposed interim analyses. Their proposal must be fully vetted by governance committees and regulatory agencies, and I expect that they will publish the proposed modifications. The steering committee estimates that the first interim analysis with this new protocol would take place towards the end of this year. In the meantime the study is proceeding as planned in a fully blinded fashion. A few final notes on regulatory activity. We've received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding our submission of BRIDION, which is approved in more than 60 countries for the reversal of certain types of neuromuscular blockade during anesthesia. The agency has asked for additional sensitivity analyses regarding the data that we have submitted. We expect to be able to respond to these requests in the very near future. And now, I will turn the call over to Joe. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, thank you, Roger. Darla, I think we are getting ready for the Q&A segment of the call. For callers, I will ask you that you ask only one or two questions so that we can get to as many callers as possible. Darla, can you turn it to the Q&A session? Thanks. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Congratulations on TECOS. I'm not going to ask any questions, I'm imagining you won't say much. But on KEYTRUDA in lung, the debate continues to rage on about the utility of a biomarker and you filed your product. Are you willing to say that you have asked for a label that is specific to high expressers of PD-L1? Or was the data set you submitted really broader than that and you did not explicitly ask for a biomarker limitation? And then you raised guidance for the year on earnings. Is part of that related to hep C? Specifically, what is baked into your 2015 guidance about a potential launch before year-end, or would that not make a difference anyway? And your breakthrough therapy designation was limited in terms of what that status applies to. Can you talk about when the drug does get approved, is it likely to be a broad label? Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : Tim, it's Roger. First of all with respect to KEYTRUDA in lung, of course the entire data set, the totality of our data, has been filed with the FDA. And in those data, as I've said previously, what we know is that patients who have a high proportion of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, experience a higher likelihood of response. And in fact, the response rates for those who are above the 50% representation are really very significant. But that doesn't mean that patients with low or even no visible PD-L1 expression failed to respond, inevitably. There are responses in those patient populations as well, and I would expect that the labeling would want to capture that information to best advise physicians as they make decisions about how to treat their patients. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Maybe I will take the other question with regards to the hepatitis C. I'd just remind you that as we look to file in the first half of 2015, our guidance really has multiple scenarios around how does it plays out, but it's not material this year given the timing of the launch. Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : Finally, Tim, with respect to HCV and our breakthrough designation, the breakthrough designation provides a mechanism whereby we can work closely with the FDA to design studies and our filings because the FDA recognizes, we believe, and the FDA recognizes that our therapy, our HCV therapy, has the potential to provide meaningful and important benefits to an underserved population. However, the data set that we submit is the entire data set, and it is that entire data set that they will review. And that data set, as you know from the EASL meetings, and from what we've published, and from other presentations, spans the entire range of HCV infection. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Roger. Thank you, Tim. And, Darla, our next caller? Operator : It's from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Thomas Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Congrats on the quarter. Just two questions here. First maybe just more broadly on KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer, can you just talk about a little bit more about your product's relative competitive position in this market and how you're thinking about the commercial rollout here? I know you just mentioned your filings with the entire data set, but commercially how do you think about your initial data versus your competitor which has OS data from a controlled study and how that plays out in the market? The second question was on the BACE program in Alzheimer's and just updated thoughts there following the recent Biogen data. I guess be interested in your views if I think about BACE versus plaque-specific antibodies and just how the treatment paradigm in Alzheimer's ultimately shapes up? Thanks very much. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Yeah, hi, Chris. This is Adam. I'll answer the question on the lung cancer market readiness. So we've been building our oncology business unit to make sure we maximize the potential of KEYTRUDA over time. And just like we were ready to launch in melanoma, we see lung cancer as a very significant opportunity for KEYTRUDA, and we will be ready to launch. Of course you'd prefer to have overall survival data to promote, but these data are maturing in our broad clinical program. We've been building our lung cancer capabilities, adding sales representatives and customer facing teams. We've been working with key scientific leaders, and we are just getting ready for the launch. In terms of competitiveness, we feel really good about the data we've shown, and if you look at the value in the PD-L1 diagnostic, I think that can really help identify patients who will have an enhanced likelihood for improved efficacy and benefit most from KEYTRUDA. And when I talk to opinion leaders but also when I've talked to governments, they see this as a way of allowing physicians to potentially have a different conversation with patients depending on their PD-L1 expression, particularly when we can see such a large effect of 45% in the high expressers, but it also allows physicians to prioritize treatment options which they're looking for. Payers around the world, particularly in Europe, have noted their interest in potential health economics and those that can be associated with identifying patients who could benefit most from KEYTRUDA and thinking about algorithms of treatment. So we feel very good about the data we have and our competitive position at this time. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay. Roger? Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : And, Chris, with respect to BACE, as you know, of course, our BACE inhibitor is currently under study in two large Phase 3 trials, one in patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and the other in patients with prodromal disease. The data set from Biogen, which, as you know and as they characterize, is a small data set, is intriguing because it appears to show that there can be a dose response curve for plaque reduction using an antibody directed against Abeta. The data with respect to cognitive improvement, of course, are, as everyone has commented, immature. I think what we would say is to the extent that one believes that actually reducing Abeta and plaque has an effect on cognitive function, we feel very good about our clinical trials. However, the trials are the trials. We wait to see how they develop and we are eager to understand whether we can have an impact on this horrible disease. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Roger, and, Darla, our next caller, please? Operator : It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : ...taking the question. Maybe I could just double down on Tim's question at the risk of annoying you but, Roger, is it your expectation that the FDA will write a label for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer that will allow for broad use irrespective of PD-L1 status in the commercial setting? Yes or no? And then perhaps for Adam, if the answer is yes, how do you think physicians are going to choose between KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO given that at least for a while OPDIVO will be the only one with a \u2013 presumably, the only one with an overall survival benefit actually described in label? And then also, Roger, you mentioned, this is what everyone on Wall Street wants to hear you say so I'll just ask it. I don't know what you'll say, but you mentioned no \"imbalance in hospitalizations for heart failure.\" I assume that that clearly means no statistical difference between the arms. What everyone is asking though in our world is, can you also give us some comfort that there wasn't some sort of numerical difference that just optically is going to frighten us when we see the data? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : Okay. Mark, so first of all, there is no yes or no answer to your question about FDA labeling. The FDA will make its own decision based on the data which you've seen and which we presented. I think that the data with respect to KEYTRUDA in lung cancer speaks for itself and FDA will want to inform physicians of the actual information that's available so that they can make their best judgments, and we'll see how that turns out. I can't predict yes or no what exactly that labeling language will look like. So that's the first answer. With respect to the issue of TECOS, just to take that off the table, again, with respect to heart failure hospitalization the results in the two arms were balanced. They were completely balanced. That's, I think, all you need to know. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : And then, Mark, what I would say with regard to the marketplace, the first thing I'd like to say is that this is a very large market and it's not just looking at KEYTRUDA for one indication. If you look at KEYTRUDA, we're studying it over many, many different indications. I believe that this market can handle several competitors. So I don't think it should be looked at as one company versus the other, I think it should be looked at, these companies, including Merck, versus cancer and trying to change the way the world thinks about treating cancer. If you look specifically at lung, I think that having the data we have is good. I think having high expressers and understanding what the benefit is in those patient types will allow the not only physicians but payers to start to think about the treatment algorithms they want to utilize to best treat patients. But I would look at this class more like the anti-TNFs where you have multiple competitors, they all do very well, they all have strong growth, some do a little bit better in one indication than another indication, but over time there's room for multiple, multiple competitors. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks. I really appreciate it. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Mark. Thanks for the call \u2013 the question, excuse me. Great. Darla, next caller, please? Operator : Is from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Just a follow up, Roger, what gives you confidence that the FDA will approve KEYTRUDA without a survival benefit just given that Bristol has now proven overall survival both squamous, non-squamous in both PD-L1 positive and negative express patients? So just if you could share that \u2013 your level of confidence in that issue. And secondly, when do you plan to file in lung in Europe? And then thirdly a question for you, Rob. I noticed that you highlighted a revenue hedging benefit and based on my math that would seem to be $200 million or about $0.06 to earnings. Is that how we should look at that and is that something that's going to continue for the rest of the year? Thanks. Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : Jami, I have confidence that the data that we have provided to the FDA are registration worthy. We've identified a population of patients for whom we received breakthrough designation. We've had lots of discussions with the FDA. I think we recognize the benefit that inures to these patients from treatment with KEYTRUDA and we'll move forward on that basis. With respect to the European filing, of course, as I mentioned, and as you know, KEYTRUDA's under review in Europe for melanoma and while that review process continues we'll wait and sit back and once we know what that answer is we'll be in a position to file with respect to non-small cell lung cancer. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Jami. With your question on the hedging, it's a little less than the number you quoted but generally you understand it correctly. It flows pretty consistently from the revenue down to earnings and as you look for the rest of the year, obviously it will depend on where currency rates end up. But assuming they continue where they are today, you should expect to see a proportion of benefits similar to what you saw in Q1 for the remainder of the quarters. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Jami. And, Darla, next caller? Operator : It's from Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. First question is if you could give more detail on KEYTRUDA and what's happened so far, number of patients on drug? How's it being used? Mono versus combo? First line, second line, that kind of thing? Second question is on Hep C, can you talk about the potential here that there's some limitations just in the experienced patients just given the data that we saw? And then third just on BRIDION, we keep hearing the same thing on BRIDION, is this ever going to make it through the U.S. FDA? Is there something new that they're bringing up or is this just the same old stuff and we're going to have to go back and do more data or what's happening here? Thanks. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay. So, Adam, do you want to take the KEYTRUDA mix of patients? Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Yeah, absolutely. Good morning, Marc. First of all, what I'd say is we had rapid penetration of our on-label indication, and if you look, we had sales of about $83 million. The U.S. was $66 million of that. Most of the patients that have been treating are on label. So we think about 75% of the patients are in the approved indication. This is where we promote KEYTRUDA. The NCCN coverage takes some time for physicians to become aware of and for them to adapt. I think that that will increase over time, but it's still early. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Roger? Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : And, Marc, with respect to \u2013 you had two questions. First, with regard to our doublet treatment of HCV, and spoke of limitations, I actually think the data are extremely strong, and they are especially strong actually in patients that are difficult to treat who have for a variety of reasons fit into the category where it's difficult to get therapy to result in sustained virologic response. So I actually think the totality of the data set, and it's a very large data set, is really quite strong. I don't see it as limited in that way. With respect to BRIDION, we think our data set well characterizes the hypersensitivity reactions that can occur with BRIDION administration. FDA is eager to get additional information about that study in particular, which they have asked for sensitivity analyses about, and they also intend to scrutinize the data from each individual site. And as soon as we can get that done, I'm hopeful that we and they will agree that BRIDION is appropriate for the U.S. market, but it's important that they have their questions answered, and we're doing everything we can to get those answers to them. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks for the question, Marc. Darla, next caller? Operator : It's from Gregg Gilbert with Bank with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. First for Adam a KEYTRUDA commercial question. In the PD-1 space, so far I assume that the price is the price from the two companies. But my question is about whether you see these products moving into a contracting environment in lung cancer or perhaps not until there are more players or perhaps never in this class? What's your views on that and how it evolves over time? And then for Roger, where do you see the field settling on first-line melanoma treatment, monotherapy PD-1 or combo therapy with ipi [ipilimumab]? Obviously some data out in both of those cases recently. And lastly, Roger, beyond CETP, are there any sweet spots in cardiovascular research that you think make sense for Merck internally or externally given your current portfolio and heritage in the area? Thanks. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Adam? Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Hi, Gregg. The first thing is if you look at KEYTRUDA, the vast majority of formularies have put both products on formulary. And they are looking at this as a way to allow physicians to have choice. In this class, obviously, reimbursement is different, so the way in which you can contract is different than in other classes and how you might think about it. But I'd also say with so many different tumor types being developed, with so much different data by indication being developed, I think that over time there will be multiple products that will continue to be available so physicians can choose which product they want for which indication, which tumor type, and I don't see that necessarily changing right now over time. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Roger? Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : And, Gregg, with respect to therapy for melanoma, just to elevate a little bit, the good news is that more and more profound results are being obtained in patients who previously had no hope of treatment. And the results that we saw with KEYTRUDA monotherapy versus ipilimumab, previously the best available therapy for people with advanced disease, were so impressive that the Data Monitoring Committee had to stop the study early for a difference that emerged very early with respect to overall survival. So that's very good news. The question is can we get beyond what we see with monotherapy in combination therapies and do better yet? And for there, first of all we need to see direct comparisons between the combination of a PD-1 directed therapy plus, let's say, a CTLA-4 directed therapy versus a PD-1 directed therapy alone. We are doing such studies. Bristol-Myers is doing such studies. We'll have an opportunity to see what those kinds of data look like, and that will be important. And beyond that there are other combinations, which may prove to be attractive, and we and others are pursuing those as well. I see a better bright future for this, and I think we're going to continue to make strides. The platform of PD-1 directed therapy is, I believe, foundational for the treatment of this malignancy and for many others, and we're going to see further advances over the next few years; all good news. With respect to cardiovascular disease, obviously we're doing a great deal. One of the things that we have been working on is the soluble guanylate cyclase activators. As a result of our recent interaction, we now have access to Adempas and in addition, we have a set of other compounds which come from Bayer and from us too, which address a whole family of interesting potential indications in that area. So we are doing a lot of work in cardiovascular research, and we're finding (48:38). Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, thank you, Gregg. Darla, our next caller. Operator : It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thank you for taken the questions. Congratulations on the quarter. Roger, do you anticipate having difficulty recruiting for the KEYNOTE-024 study in PD-L1 positive lung cancer patients given what you showed at AACR? If a patient has greater than 50% PD-L1 expression, why would they agree to go on chemo? And then a follow-up for Rob. How much of the gross margin was driven by FX versus product mix? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : Yes, Alex. It is a changing environment and data are coming in very, very rapidly. I think it's important to recognize that these studies are conducted around the world, in a variety of jurisdictions where we are at different stages in terms of the availability of PD-1 directed therapies. As is typical in such cases there are opportunities to do studies directly comparing the therapies that exist locally. There are important questions that are being asked in KEYNOTE-024, and so we are eager to see those studies completed and to be able to present those data. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And then with your question to product gross margin, if you look at the gross margin in the quarter, it grew about 240 basis points. And one of the major impacts was the fact that we had the divestitures of MCC and some of the other products, so the change in product mix. But if you look at it, a little less than half would have been coming from the benefit of FX. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Rob. Thanks, Alex. Darla, our next caller. Operator : It is from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I've had a number of my questions asked and answered already, but I guess I have a few more. First, can you comment on the expected EPS accretion from Cubist in 2015? And then, could you provide a little bit more color, I know that you commented on the hedging benefit, but other revenues stepped up dramatically in the first quarter of 2015 relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Could you provide any more quantification of the hedging benefit? And then, as we look to modeling the second quarter of 2015, how should we model other revenue sequentially versus what you just reported in the first quarter of 2015? Thanks very much. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So if maybe I will take the second question first, and then we can jump into the Cubist question, as well. So if you look at other revenue in the quarter, it's really probably worth unpacking it a little bit because while in some ways it looks like a decline year-on-year, I would have you recall that in the first quarter of last year, we did have the gain from the sale of the U.S. SAPHRIS rights as well as the fact that we do have AstraZeneca joint venture revenues that were in that line that no longer repeat. So in reality, we did see year-on-year an increase of about $250 million in that line. And if you look at it from that perspective, the vast majority of that was FX hedging gains we had in the quarter, as well as we did have the third-party manufacturing sales as a result of the MCC divestiture we still were supplying Bayer, and that sits in that line, and then we had alliance revenue. So those really are what drive the change in other revenue, but the single biggest piece of it, if you look at it year-on-year or frankly sequentially, is going to be the foreign currency hedge gains we had. And then with regard to the Cubist accretion, recall when we gave the guidance on this deal earlier, we said we would expect it to be modestly accretive in 2015, and that continues to be the case. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Dave. And Darla, our next caller? Operator : It's from the line of John Boris with SunTrust Robinson. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks for taking the questions. First one on KEYTRUDA. There certainly has been a lot written in the trade publications, especially from the head of the FDA oncology division; he certainly has put his pen to approving products. We saw CYRAMZA approved in nine weeks, OPDIVO approved materially earlier than anticipated. Just your thoughts on is this a new paradigm out of the FDA, and could we see potentially earlier than expected approval of KEYTRUDA in lung, and if so are you ready commercially to match share of voice within the marketplace? On HCV, just reiteration of your filing timeline there, and then Adam, any comments about Europe and Japan growth dynamics? Certainly it would appear that a lot of the growth is coming from ex-U.S. relative to U.S., but your commercial readiness to potentially launch HCV before the end of the year? And then just lastly, can we anticipate Zilmax back in the model before the end of this year or back in the market? Thanks. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay. You want to start, Roger, with KEYTRUDA and timing, and Adam, go to share of voice? Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, so for KEYTRUDA and the KEYTRUDA review, I just would say that Dr. Pazdur speaks for himself. He is the head of the oncology review division, and he's made plain that he is eager to advance these programs as best he can working with his colleagues. He spoke at the meeting (54:28) directly to this point. We've tried to provide the agency with the information they need to make their decision, but it is their decision. I really can't speculate on timing. With HCV with respect to filing, again, we will file by midyear. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : And then with regard to lung, so we are ready. As soon as we have approval, as soon as the FDA provides that to us we're ready to launch. We've been building our lung capabilities. We've added sales representatives. We already have sales representative selling Emend in many of those offices already, so we've built the customer facing teams, we've begun working on our scientific platform with key scientific leaders. So we are ready as soon as Roger and the team can work with the FDA to get us approval. In terms of HCV, so we've been in this market for a long time, and if you look at our success when we launched our protease inhibitor, we did very well everywhere around the world. And if you look at markets in Europe, our market share was very high, I think higher than most people would have expected. When we no longer promoted our PI in those markets, we kept a commercial presence because we knew at some point we'd be launching again into the marketplace. So we never left the market for HCV in Europe or Japan. In fact, in Japan we continued to promote PI in that market. So we are ready for HCV. We are very excited about that opportunity, and frankly as soon as Roger and the team work with the FDA to get us approval, we'll be off to the races. We think this is a very exciting opportunity for Merck. It's an exciting opportunity for patients, and we are certainly ready. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, John, with your question regarding Zilmax, recall that we voluntarily withdrew that product. Right now we are in the midst of trying to work through an infield study working with our industry partners and given the timing of that we really can't speculate when we'll be back in the market. We're continuing to work through that, but right now for purposes of how we'd look at the year, I would not assume any Zilmax. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, John. Thanks for the call \u2013 questions. And, Darla, next caller? Operator : It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus C. Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks for the questions. Just a couple of quick ones on KEYTRUDA. I know it's short-lived but maybe, Adam, if you can help us with the percent of sales in the community versus academics? And if you can't give us that number maybe you could help us in terms of the increased penetration of physician \u2013 oncology physician practices for the on-label indication? And then separately for the on-label indications, can you give us a sense of where you see the duration of therapy evolving at least in the melanoma setting? And then my last question, as we think forward to your update on anacetrapib, can you just remind us how that sort of fits in terms of what your expectations were in terms of timing previously? What is the anacetrapib update coming toward the end of this year a little bit of a delay implying that events are coming in just a little bit more slowly? Thanks a lot. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Adam? Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Yeah, Seamus, so first of all with regard to KEYTRUDA, if you look at our sales, right now the vast majority of those, we believe greater than 75%, are for the approved indication in melanoma, and if you look at the break out between community-based versus not-community-based physicians, the majority of sales still are from the non-community-based physicians, from the big institutions. But you should know, we are in all the offices of not only the large institutions but the community practices as well and we continue to have a strong presence covering over 90% of the prescriptions of physicians prescribing for melanoma. In terms duration, it's just too early. In this market the data is hard to find, so it's very difficult for us to tell you how long people in the marketplace that are starting a product have continued in taking the product. So it's just very early for us to have that type of data. The data in oncology is a little bit harder to get than in primary care. Seamus C. Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : And just to follow up on that, Seamus. This is Roger. As you know the duration of therapy in our clinical trials is two years because there is no marker that we can follow in responding patients that would tell us that it is essential to maintain the drug in order to keep the response, and that's one of the questions that is continuing to be explored in additional studies across the entire program. And then with respect to anacetrapib, the protocol revision that has been proposed by the steering committee, assuming that it is accepted by governing bodies, will delay by a few months the first interim analysis but it's not going to affect the conduct of the study at all, which is proceeding exactly as planned and is, of course, end-point driven. Seamus C. Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Seamus. And, Darla, I think we have time for one more call. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. On hep C, could you talk about your level of confidence in developing a shorter regimen with one of the triplet combinations? And when will we first see data from that C-CREST trial? And also on hep C, can you talk about how you see the pricing environment evolving in 2016 given the market's going to become increasingly crowded? And then just a quick one on odanacatib, can you provide us an update on this program? Thanks. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay. Roger, do you want to talk a bit about this? Roger M. Perlmutter - Executive Vice President & President, Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, so for the hep C program, the question is, of course, can we \u2013 we have a terrific set of data that we presented with respect to doublet, and we've talked previously about developing a triplet therapy which would be pan-genotypic, shorter duration and could be used irrespective of comorbidity. So we continue to work on that. Our triplet with 3682 is under study in Phase 2. We hope to be able to begin Phase 3 sometime perhaps in the beginning of next year or so. Data from the Phase 2 study should be available sometime around the end of this year. And once those data are available, that will help us to understand what we can do. Of course, we've already previously published data demonstrating that we can use a shorter regiment by using sofosbuvir as the nucleoside inhibitor in combination with the doublet therapy. So we have some confidence that one could do that, but it needs to be explored, of course, with 3682, and that we'll do. With respect to odanacatib, the program continues as we indicated before. We are working to adjudicate the set of adverse events that were scored in the study. It's a large study, and the adjudication process is proceeding in an independent and blinded fashion. We worked with the FDA to create that adjudication process. We hope it will be done soon and then we'll be in a position to file the drug. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : And Colin, in regard to the hepatitis C market, first, it's a very large market. There's more than three million patients in the U.S. alone, and there's more than 100 million patients worldwide, so we think that this will be a very big, a very important market over time. We've seen some of the pricing and contracting that's occurred in the market, but we believe that with our product, and that we're developing a highly-effective, well-tolerated ribavirin-free pan-genotypic regimen that has a minimal treatment duration for a broad variety of patients, that we can be successful in this market. And we believe that despite what's happened in the past with some of the pricing that it'll still be a very big important market for us. So we remain very excited about coming back into the hepatitis C market in the United States but also globally. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Adam. And I'll turn it over to Ken. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Just to close the call, we are seeing steady progress, as you've heard, in our pipeline, and we're also experiencing solid growth in our underlying business. We're pleased with the momentum of the business, and we look forward to speaking with you again. Thanks. Joseph Romanelli - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Merck's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joseph Romanelli : Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2015 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I just want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded those items from our non-GAAP results. There are reconciliation tables available in our press release so that you can get a better understanding of their underlying performance. We've also provided tables to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units as well for products. This can be found in table three of our press release and the reconciliation table as I mentioned earlier are in table two of the release. During the call we will be referring to table two for the P&L and table three as it relates to revenue. Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call might be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including item 1A in the 2014 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. So with that, this morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Kenneth C. Frazier: Thanks Joe. Good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining the call today. Before I discuss our quarterly performance, I want to take a moment to thank Joe Romanelli for ably leading our investor relations efforts for the past two years. Joe is moving on from explaining our numbers to a role in which he will be generating revenue as Managing Director for our business in Taiwan and Hong Kong. We have benefited from Joe's expertise and leadership and he has done an outstanding job. We wish him and his family all the best as they relocate to Asia. Thank you, Joe. I am also pleased that joining the call today is Joe's successor, Terry Locksome [ph]. Terry [ph] comes to Merck with a wealth of experience in financial investor relations and has worked in the pharmaceutical, entertainment and investment banking industries. Welcome to Merck Terry [ph]. We're pleased to have you on our team. This is an exciting time for Merck as we advance our promising pipeline and launched new products in the marketplace. It is also a propitious time for biomedical research generally as we are witnessing the introduction of breakthrough therapies and in some cases cures for some of the most difficult to treat diseases. Merck's late-stage pipeline and ongoing launches reflect scientific and therapeutic progress that will provide significant value to patients in society. Over the past few months I've seen and heard first hand some stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem including patients, payers and government about the critical impact that our current and future medicines and vaccines can have on improving their health and productivity of both individuals and populations. These experiences continue to reinforce my conviction that in the evolving healthcare environment success will accrue to those who development products that not only enable patients to live longer, more productive lives, but that also can help reduce overall healthcare expenditures. By bringing forward these kinds of medical innovations Merck will create sustainable value for society and shareholders. Turning to our second quarter performance we build on the strong momentum achieved earlier in the year by executing well on our focused and disciplined strategy. Global Human Health delivered top line growth in our four core areas, oncology, hospital acute care, diabetes and vaccines. Our animal health business also grew 10% due in part to the strong growth of BRAVECTO. We are investing resources to grow our strongest brand and to support the most promising assets in our pipeline whilst at the same time lower our overall cost base and delivering a leveraged P&L. Merck has acted in many of the most promising areas of science and medicine including oncology, antibiotic resistance, Cryo metabolic disease, hepatitis C and Alzheimer's disease. The progress we continue to make with our pipeline reflects this. We are advancing both our KEYTRUDA and hep C programs, two of our most important assets. As we move into the second half of 2015 our organization is preparing for these exciting opportunities. Last month the FDA accepted our supplemental BLA for KEYTRUDA in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and granted KEYTRUDA priority review. And just this past week the European commission approved KEYTRUDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma in adults, both as a first line therapy and in previously treated patients. Earlier today, we announced that the FDA has accepted under priority review the New Drug Application for our [indiscernible] regimen for the treatment of adult patients infected with hepatitis C. Last week the European Medicines Agency also accepted our application which they will review on an accelerated basis. Roger will discuss our KEYTRUDA and hep C programs in greater detail later in the call. I'm pleased with the progress we've made with our key pipeline assets. I'm also encouraged by our underlying commercial performance which Adam will discuss in more detail shortly. We achieved solid growth in both our human and animal health businesses and in particular in our diabetes franchise where we saw 9% growth. We also continue to make progress with the recent introductions of KEYTRUDA, BELSOMRA, ZERBAXA and GARDASIL 9, each of which provides an important treatment option for unmet medical need. The growth of an established brand like JANUVIA and the successful launch of KEYTRUDA in the competitive melanoma fields are examples of how we are bringing greater discipline focused on execution across our business and especially in those areas where we have the greatest opportunities to grow and to lead. In closing, Merck is positioned to build on the strong momentum we've achieved during the first half of the year. Going forward, we will focus on the best scientific and medical innovations sourced both internally and externally because we believe that is the best path to long-term value creation. By capitalizing on the significant and exciting scientific and critical opportunities that lie ahead, Merck intends to play a major role in transforming healthcare for the benefit of patients, payers and shareholders alike. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter. Adam H. Schechter: Thank you, Ken and good morning everyone. This morning I'll discuss the second quarter results for Global Human Health and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. Our performance in the quarter reflects continued efforts to drive growth within our core business coupled with increasing contributions from new product launches. Sales increased 3% with growth in all of our core focus areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology. Collectively, these core focus areas grew 9% excluding the acquisition of Cubist. I'll start by reviewing the performance of several key products followed by brief update by region and then on several launch products. Starting with the JANUVIA franchise, we delivered our seventh straight quarter of growth. We have steadily increased resources for JANUVIA to drive growth and our results reflect the positive impact of our strategic resource allocation and the strength of the products. In the second quarter the JANUVIA franchise sales reached approximately $1.6 billion dollars and grew 9%. In the United States sales grew 14%. While we continue to drive underlying volume growth of about 4% we had some benefits this quarter from adjustments to rebate accruals. In the international markets sales grew 4%. Volume growth in Europe was a key contributor to performance and emerging markets delivered steady double-digit growth. Also we are pleased that the data presented in the TECOS study at the American Diabetes Association meeting last month, confirmed that JANUVIA did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or hospitalization for heart failure. We're now educating customers on these important results. Sales of ZETIA/VYTORIN declined 8%. In the United States ZETIA was flat offset by declines in VYTORIN. Outside the U.S. sales fell as a result of ZETIA's loss of exclusivity in Canada and prescription has changed in restrictions in France. Next on hospital and specialty care, sales of ISENTRESS decreased 10% to approximately $375 million. We are starting to see the impact of slowing growth of the integrase class and continued competitor dynamics in the U.S. and Europe. We are having a difficult year-over-year comparison versus second quarter of 2014 in the emerging markets due to tenders. In immunology, sales of Remicade and Simponi were approximately $625 million a decline of 1%. Continued growth in Simponi of about 20% was offset by 7% decline in Remicade. As expected, we are seeing additional competition from biosimilars in the first full quarter since loss of exclusivity. We expect declines in Remicade to accelerate in the back half of this year as tenders are implemented in poor markets. In hospital acute care sales grew to approximately $930 million. We drove double-digit growth across our portfolio. As a leader in hospital acute care, we are enthusiastic about diversity and the breadth of our underlying business and the promising launch opportunities that we're executing on today and planning for in the future. Turning to the vaccine business, vaccine sales were about $1.2 billion up 1% versus the prior year. Growth in the Gardasil franchise was offset by decline in sales of RotaTeq due to the timing of public sector purchases in the United States. Combined sales of Gardasil and Gardasil 9 grew 6% to approximately $425 million our contributions from the United States and emerging markets. We continue to transition customers to Gardasil 9 and managed care coverage is now similar to that of Gardasil. Sales of Zostavax were approximately $150 million a decline of 3%. In the U.S. sales declined 8%. We continue to work with customers to help them understand the broad managed care coverage and the process for obtaining reimbursement. Also we'll be launching a new DTC campaign for Zostavax in the United States during the start of flu season. This new campaign will focus on increasing brand awareness and patient activation. Outside of the U.S. Canada drove sales growth. We are continuing to launch Zostavax in more than 25 markets. Now I'll provide some geographic commentary for the quarter. In the United States excluding Cubist sales increased 5% primarily from growth in the JANUVIA franchise, oncology and hospital acute care. In Europe and Canada sales decreased 8%. Growth from the JANUVIA franchise and Simponi was offset by ophthalmology product divestitures, and declines in Remicade and declines in ZETIA and VYTORIN. Japan sales declined 13% primarily from ophthalmology product divestitures and declines in older diversified products. Pneumovax grew on the continued rollout of a national immunization program. Emerging market sales grew 4%. If you exclude divestitures, sales would have grown 6%. China grew 8% this quarter driven by sales increases in hospital acute care. Now I'll provide some updates on a few of our key launches and I'll start with BELSOMRA. We are encouraged by results in early months of the BELSOMRA launch in the United States. Demand for this new medicine is steadily increasing. From an access perspective, BELSOMRA is now covered by commercial payers representing over 100 million lives. Next week, we will begin a branded DTC campaign to enhance consumer awareness. With ZERBAXA, customer feedback in the early launch is positive. Over 300 hospitals have placed ZERBAXA on formulary. Looking ahead we are intensifying our focus on increasing access while at the same time driving greater utilization in hospitals where ZERBAXA is unformulary [ph]. In addition, we saw another strong performance from KEYTRUDA with sales reaching $110 million. In the United States we achieved more than 60% patient share in ipilimumab-refractory melanoma, a testament to our team's strong launch execution. KEYTRUDA is now the number one therapy used to treat melanoma in the U.S. Importantly, as we speak we are launching KEYTRUDA in the EU where the product is approved for use in advanced first and second line melanoma. The deep clinical experience physicians are gaining through KEYTRUDA launch in melanoma is building a solid foundation, particularly in community setting for potential launches in lung cancer and also other cancers. With October 2, PDUFA date our teams are ready for potential launch in patients with advanced squamous and non- squamous non-small lung cancer. Finally, now that our HCV tablet [ph] has priority review with the FDA and accelerated assessment in EU we are very much looking forward to launching this important product next year. In summary, Global Human Health delivered another solid performance in the quarter. We grew through execution in all of our core focus areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, vaccines and oncology. We are gaining traction with key launches that will help to drive future growth. Now, I'll turn the call over to my colleague Rob Davis. Robert M. Davis: Thanks Adam, good morning everyone. As Ken and Adam stated, our results this quarter and for the first half of the year showed that we're executing the focused strategy we first outlined nearly two years ago. We are driving top line growth in core therapeutic areas and delivering our leveraged P&L. This morning I'll provide some additional detail on the quarter and comment on our outlook for the second half of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. Total company revenues were $9.8 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 11% year-over-year while the underlying base business great 3%. This excludes a negative 7 percentage point impact from foreign exchange and a net negative 7 percentage point impact from acquisitions, divestitures and the now ended AstraZeneca JV. I should note that the impact from foreign exchange includes the benefit of approximately $190 million of revenue from our hedging program. Growth overall was primarily driven by all core focus areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, oncology and vaccines in our pharmaceutical business and by the 10% growth in our animal health business. Moving now to expenses, gross margin was 75.4% in the quarter an increase of 280 basis points year-over-year. Lower inventory write-offs and foreign exchange provided the primary benefit in the quarter. Total operating expenses were $463 million lower this quarter, primarily driven by marketing and administrative expenses which declined 15% versus prior year due to the favorable impact to foreign exchange, net favorability from acquisitions and divestitures and lower direct selling costs. Research and development expenses declined 2% as increased spending in the quarter was more than offset by foreign exchange. With our ongoing cost reductions we are on track to meet or exceed the $2.5 billion in savings versus 2012 by the end of this year. Finally our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%. The 180 basis point increase versus the prior year primarily reflects a discrete item recorded this quarter related to an adjustment for differed taxes associated with restructuring activities. Overall, we earned $0.86 per share in the second quarter delivering 1% growth despite meaningful headwinds from foreign exchange and the net negative impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the now ended AstraZeneca JV. Our commitment to expense management coupled with focused investments in key brands continues to produce results. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. Accounting for our performance in the first half of the year we are updating our top line revenue guidance to a range of $38.6 billion to $39.8 billion. While we feel comfortable moving to a midpoint of $39.2 billion for the full year 2015 we feel the range is appropriate due to the potential impact of foreign exchange volatility. Moving into PGM we expect full year gross margin to be approximately 125 basis points higher versus 2014. We continue to expect an overall decrease in operating expenses as lower marketing and administrative expenses are partially offset by modest increase in research and development expense. Altogether we anticipate total operating expenses in the second half of 2015 to be approximately $200 million lower than in the prior year. Regarding our non-GAAP effective tax rate we now expect the full year effective tax rate will be between 23% and 24% as we account for the higher rate in the second quarter. Taking these changes into account and given our strong operational performance in the first half of 2015 we are now increasing our non-GAAP EPS range to $3.45 to $3.55. We are also updating the range for GAAP EPS guidance. As we've discussed over the past year we've been monitoring the situation in Venezuela. Based on is evolving economic conditions and volatility in the country our valuations have led us to take $750 million charge in the second quarter to revalue our net launch of the assets in the country. While we have taken this action we will work with the government to continue to get central medicines into the country and to ensure continued positive view as to our cash flows from our operations. We now expect GAAP EPS to be $1.52 to $1.71 for full year 2015 with the charge related to Venezuela partially offset by the anticipated gain on the previously announced sale of CGRP program which will be accounted for in the third quarter. Finally, touching briefly on capital allocation, we remained focused on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders and have over the last 12 months returned $11 billion via the dividend and share repurchase. Altogether we're encouraged by the growth in our business and the leverage we're delivering to our focus strategy. As we move forward we remain committed to transforming our operating model, achieving our cost reduction targets and ensuring we deliver a leveraged P&L. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter: Thanks Rob. I'll briefly review some of the accomplishments in research and development during the second quarter. First with respect to KEYTRUDA our PD-1 directed monoclonal antibody designed to promote activation of pre-existing tumor directed immune responses we announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for KEYTRUDA in the first and second line setting for patients with advance melanoma. This approval includes data from our Keynote 006 study which compared KEYTRUDA to ipilimumab in the first and second line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. Details of this study including the favorable outcomes observed for response rates, progression free survival and overall survival were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. They were also incorporated into regulatory approval of KEYTRUDA in Australia. We have filed the Keynote 006 data as a supplemental BLA with the FDA and have also filed an SBLA for our Keynote 002 study where therapy with KEYTRUDA proved superior to traditional chemotherapy with respect to both response rate and progression free survival. During the quarter the FDA granted priority review to our supplemental license application for the use of KEYTRUDA in patients with advanced treatment refractory, non-small cell lung cancer where EGF receptor or ALK-directed therapy is not indicated. Data supporting this application also published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that expression of PD-L1 one or two ligands were PD-1 the target KEYTRUDA in greater than 50% of tumor cells was associated with substantially higher response rates than were seen in patients whose tumors did not express PD-L1. These responses occurred irrespective of the underlying histologic classification of the presenting non-small cell lung cancer. These data were included in our recent submission to the FDA which has an action date of October 2. We continue to see responses in patients suffering from a broad range of tumor types following treatment with KEYTRUDA. Registration enabling studies are already underway in many of these settings. Data on additional KEYTRUDA response in tumors were presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last month. Among the most interesting presentations selected from more than 30 abstracts describing the activity of KEYTRUDA was a study from Johns Hopkins University demonstrating that responsiveness to KEYTRUDA in patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer was associated with tumor specific deficits in DNA repair mechanisms. These data which also appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine provides support for the view that control of tumor growth following KEYTRUDA administration is in part determined by the frequency of mutations in tumor DNA that could give rise to novel immune targets in the tumor cells. Studies of this type suggest ways in which the efficacy of KEYTRUDA might be further enhanced. Additional studies examining the importance of tumor specific DNA repair deficits indicating KEYTRUDA responsiveness in cancer patients will begin in the very near future. In infectious diseases the committee on human medicinal products of the EMA recommended approval of ZERBAXA our next generation antibiotic targeting resistant gram-negative bacteria for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal or urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis. Once the CHMP decision is ratified by the European Commission which could occur by the end of September, ZERBAXA will become available in all member states of the European Union. I'm also pleased to report that both the EMA and the FDA have accepted our filing for the use of our grazoprevir/elbasvir tablet in patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In Europe our file was granted accelerated assessment for the treatment of infection with hepatitis C virus genotypes 1, 3, 4 and 6. The accelerated assessment was based on the significant unmet medical need that exists in hepatitis C virus infected patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The grazoprevir/elbasvir combination was previously granted breakthrough designation by the FDA and we have now been informed that our file which supports the use of the combination for hepatitis C genotypes 1, 4 and 6 will receive priority review with the PDUFA date of January 28, 2016. Site inspections in support of the U.S. filing have already begun. During this quarter we submitted our complete response file for sugammadex marketed in over 60 countries around the world as BRIDION for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium, drugs that are employed during certain surgical procedures. We've been informed that there will be an FDA advisory committee meeting to review the sugammadex filing on November 06, supporting a PDUFA of December 19. I should also note that we continue to have good discussions with the PMDA in Japan regarding our filing for Omarigliptin, our once weekly DPP-4 inhibitor for the control of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. We anticipate filing for approval of Omarigliptin in the United States before the end of the year. During our first quarter earnings call I provided top line information on the TECOS study which assessed cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving Januvia for glycemia control as compared to those treated with other regimens. Details of the study were presented in June at the American Diabetes Association Annual Meeting and were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. Beyond TECOS, I will remind you that we are also engaged in a 30,000 patient outcome study called REVEAL testing whether anacetrapib, our novel CETP inhibitor can when added to standard therapy reduce the frequency of major cardiovascular events in patients with significant risk for such events. As I mentioned in April the REVEAL steering committee continues to evaluate a change in the study protocol to include ischemic stroke as a component of the primary composite endpoint. Their proposal must be fully vetted by governance committees and regulatory agencies and I expect that they will publish the proposed modifications. The steering committee estimates that the first interim analysis with this new protocol will take place towards the end of this year. In the meantime the study is proceeding as planned. Finally we have continued to make progress in business development. To cite two recent examples, last week we announced an important expansion of our agreement with Ablynx enabling us to select up to 12 additional programs involving nanobodies the product of B lymphocytes in the South American llama. Nanobodies are small single chain antibodies that may be concatenated relatively simply using well described molecular engineering techniques to produce multivalent therapeutic candidates including nanobodies that block multiple immune checkpoint targets simultaneously. In a second related example, today announced the acquisition of cCAM Biotherapeutics an Israeli company pursuing novel immunotherapies for cancer include among their drug candidates the CM 24 a humanized monoclonal antibody in Phase 1 trials for the treatment of advanced malignancy. CM 24 is specific for the CEACAM1 cell adhesion molecule which based on preclinical analyses affects the ability of tumor specific lymphocytes to control the growth of malignant cells. Additional details regarding this acquisition can be found in our press release. In sum, during the second quarter our teams made meaningful progress in developing key new therapies for the treatment of malignancy, hepatitis C virus infection and resistant bacterial infections. I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Joseph Romanelli : Thanks Roger and Darla we'll begin the Q&A segment of our call this morning and if you are a caller if you can limit yourself to one or two questions, that way we can get to as many people in the queue as possible. So Darla we'll take our first caller. Operator : Great. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Thanks very much and I guess I should start by congratulating you Joe. It has been great to work with you and we will miss you and I wanted to offer my congrats to Terry as well, I look forward to working with you again. Joseph Romanelli : Thanks Dave. With respect to my questions, I guess one question on Remicade biosimilar that I'm not clear on is our government is trying to leverage the Remicade biosimilar and push down pricing of other branded anti-TNFs and along those lines do you expect any implications from the NOR-SWITCH study when that report is out? So that's my first question. And then I guess my second question is, could you just walk through what we should focus on in the fall at upcoming cancer conferences on your IO franchise? Thank you. Kenneth C. Frazier: Adam? Adam H. Schechter: Yes, good morning Dave. We forget the biosimilars. Right now we're not seeing a major impact in products outside of Remicade. So for example if you look at Simponi we continue to see good growth for Simponi and we haven\u2019t seen any significant impact to Simponi based upon Remicade being biosimilar. At this point in time we are not seeing a major impact from substitution. As you mentioned there is the study that's being done in Scandinavia. We'll see by the results of that study and over time I believe that there will be additional impact from studies as such but I think it will take time Dave. Kenneth C. Frazier: Great, Roger? Roger M. Perlmutter: Yes, the question was the fall conferences in the fall. Yes, I mean we're going to have a lot of data at AASO [ph] meeting and I expect that we'll have the opportunity to present some data with respect to our triplet therapy which will be quite interesting going forward. And in immuno-oncology there are a variety of oncology meetings at CPS [ph] more meetings are probably going to be the most interesting in Europe. Joseph Romanelli : Okay, thanks Dave. And Darla the next caller? Operator : Is from Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman : Yes, just to continue on the Remicade just curious, can you help us with how pricing is being with the biosimilar? And can you talk about China a little bit? Obviously sales were pretty good there, but we're hearing a lot of slowdown in China, there's a lot of things going on there can you talk about your new product launches relative to what's happening in China and how we should expect your growth, can we grow double-digits for the next couple of years there? And then just lastly on the gross margin, can you just give us the impact that foreign exchange had on the gross margin? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter: Yes so, Marc, this is Adam. Let me just start with the biosimilars. I'll give you some additional context, then I'll briefly talk about China. If you look at what's occurring in the marketplace, we've definitely seen an increased impact in our first full quarters since loss of exclusivity in the second wave in the core European markets. We've seeing mandatory price reductions based upon reference pricing impacts. And as we reported last quarter biosimilar discounts we've seen as high as 45%. However we still maintain about a 95% market share and we are facing mostly the reference pricing is the key issue as we speak right now. Over time we believe that as more new patients come into the market we will lose market share because we've been able to hold on to the vast majority. We've won most tenders for existing patients. So it really is the new patients coming in that over time will begin to lose. So taking all that together we expect that the impacts on loss of exclusivity on the Remicade business for this year will exceed the growth that we're seeing for Simponi. But I will mention as I said before we expect Simponi will continue to grow despite the increased utilization of Remicade biosimilars. If you look at China, we had 8% growth and we saw growth across our hospital acute care business and diversified brands. There is no doubt that we are seeing some macro trends of a slowdown, but I still believe there is significant opportunity there. We have good traction with multiple key products that we have, the products that you would think of, but we're also pursuing innovation and we are looking forward to having NRDL [ph] pricing approval for products like Januvia and Zetia in the future which I think could be growth drivers for us in that market. So despite the macro trends I do believe over time that China can remain an important market for us. Robert M. Davis: Good morning Marc, this is Rob. With regards to your question on the impact of foreign currency and gross margin it accounted for about half of the increase your saw 2013 second quarter versus second quarter 2014. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thank you Marc and Darla, next caller please? Operator : It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Timothy Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions, obviously one of the important controversies with investors is how KEYTRUDA's label will read in the second line lung, I am wondering if you can give us your latest thinking, will it likely be broad meeting and all comers or will it likely be narrow meaning only in PD-L1 positive patients? I know in the past you've said you think the label would probably want to reflect the data in both patient populations, but I don\u2019t really know what that means in terms of the indication per se? And on the same line of questioning, what's the most updated data you have on KEYNOTE-001 in PD-L1 negative patients in terms of the number of patients you have? I think originally that data set was around 40 patients. I think at ASCO I saw that it had grown to about 70 patients that were PD-L1 negative. What's going to be the final number that FDA has in the KEYTRUDA application? Adam H. Schechter: Tim, first of all with respect to the explicit language of the label, you know, I can't comment on what FDA ultimately will decide to do. Obviously the major claims in the study as I indicated relate to response rates in PD-L1 positive patients and that you know, fundamentally is what we'll be focused on, but at the same time as I've said before I don't think that the data that exists in the PD-L1 negative population can be ignored. The exact number of PD-L1 negative patients in the file, I think we'll have to get back to you on that, but you're right it's going to be somewhere close to 100 patients. So as I say it's a considerable number there and there are meaningful responses in that patient population which one would guess that will be reflected in one way or another. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thanks Tim, and Darla, next caller please? Operator : It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. A couple questions, Ken first for you. Just I am wondering if you guys are giving any second thoughts to how you might consider unlocking the value of the diversified brands business? I know last year there were rumors in the press that you were considering bundling that business and selling it and I think you decided not to because of the substantial tax leakage that as you know we're seeing companies come up with all sorts of creative ways to either spin out certain assets, sell assets et cetera, et cetera. So, I am just wondering maybe if you or Rob can comment on what you might be thinking in terms of options for that business because obviously it is having a significant drag on your top line? And then my second question for you Roger is on anacetrapib. If you could comment on the drugs lung, half-life, how much of a disadvantage do you see this, obviously I think the street is basically written your CETP off because of this issue, if you could put that into context for us? Thanks very much. Joseph Romanelli : Ken? Kenneth C. Frazier: Okay, thanks Jami, for the questions. First of all, as we've said before we are really focused on prioritization and as we look across our entire business we continue to challenge ourselves to determine whether specific assets including diversified brands would have more value outside Merck or as part of our business. You've seen us take action and divest certain assets I would say ophthalmology, MCC when we felt that we can do that in a way that is advantageous to the company long-term. So while we are cognizant of the issue that you just raised relative to top line growth we have to look at the difficulty associated with it and what are the vehicles that we could use to do that. So, I can just summarize it by saying that we will look at these mature assets and will focus on the impacts that they have on the cash flow as well as the impact they have growth and we'll try to make the right decision relative to the specific opportunities that we have. Thanks. Joseph Romanelli : Thanks Ken and Roger? Roger M. Perlmutter: Yes, Jami, with respect to anacetrapib, I think the really important issue is the benefit risk ratio. We have a very large as you know, study 30,000 patient study which will go on for quite a long time and we're capturing all the adverse experience data within that patient population. The benefit of reducing major cardiovascular events is significant. It's very meaningful. It can in fact it's certainly a morbidity benefit. It could in fact be a mortality benefit. That has to be then juxtaposed with the adverse experience profile. Because we have so many patients who have been treated for such long time, I think we'll have a very good sense of that and depending upon the magnitude of the benefit that we see the consequence we believe of LDL-cholesterol lowering also HDL raising or could a little lowering, all of those things together will have to be juxtaposed with what the adverse experience profile looks like. Once we have the data I think we'll have a better sense of that. Adam H. Schechter: And Jami, this is Adam, the only thing I would add is, I am sure you remember when we launched the SSSS trial also we launched the [indiscernible] trial in the cholesterol area, I wished we had an outcomes trial at the time of launch for either Zocor or Mevacor, I think would have made such a substantial difference. So I am very excited about the potential opportunity of launching a product with 30,000 patient outcomes trial into an area that we know extraordinarily well, which is the cholesterol lowering market. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thank you Jami, and Darla, next called please? Operator : It's from John Boris with SunTrust. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions and congrats Joe. First question on the oncology franchise for Roger and Adam, can you maybe just articulate, especially in lung when you think you might have an OS benefit? And Adam, for you having or not having that in the label how does that position you relative to your competition most notably after you wove that hazard in the label? And then second question, it looks as though Ken, and this is also for Rob, repatriation seems to be a real possibility this year in order to pay for some highway trust fund funding, you have a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet we estimate at the end of 1Q at about close to $29 billion with 80% to 90% of that offshore. If you do have an opportunity to potentially repatriate that, how are you thinking about deploying that if you are able to bring it back? Thanks. Roger M. Perlmutter: So John, with respect to the 010 study, which is a study that will provide a first look at an overall survival benefit for KEYTRUDA in the non-small cell lung cancer setting, this is a study that compares two doses of KEYTRUDA 2 mg, 10 mg versus conventional chemotherapy, it is a good-sized study and there is the opportunity for an interim analysis which of course is event driven. At the time when sufficient events are accrued then the data monitoring committee will look at that. In principle they could see a benefit that would result in recommendation to modify the study or they could continue the study which is designed to end sometime around the end-of-the-year. So that's those are the times when we potentially would see the overall survival benefit. Kenneth C. Frazier: Yes, and John, let me provide some context and then I'll answer your question directly. You know, first of all I am sure you've seen the IMS data and the May IMS data just came out and KEYTRUDA has more than 80% anti-PD-1 share and in all melanoma patients. In addition to that KEYTRUDA is now the number one treatment in melanoma at a 35% overall patient share. So hopefully you've seen that we are able to do well in the marketplace. With regard to lung, we've built an oncology business unit to maximize KEYTRUDA over the long- term. Just as we were ready to launch melanoma we will be ready to launch in lung, we are ready for that. We think it's a very significant opportunity. Of course we prefer to have overall survival data to promote and as Roger said those data are we are maturing in a broad clinical program, but we have the capabilities now to be successful and I think physicians have seen the overall survival data in melanoma. They've begun to assume that you'll have overall survival data once you have the studies underway. So although we prefer to have it at the time of launch the good news is that as Roger said, we have the studies to show it overtime. Adam H. Schechter: And may be the only other thing to emphasize is if you look at the PD-L1 positive population, so in those individuals the proportion score is about 50%, the response rates are really quite extraordinary. So in treatment na\u00efve patients the response rates were 50%. Those are really quite unprecedented response rates in non-small cell lung cancer. One would expect those to translate into survival data. We'll have a chance to see. Joseph Romanelli : Thank you, Adam, and Roger, and Rob. Robert M. Davis: John, with regard to your question about repatriation, firstly I would say obviously we are very supportive of comprehensive tax reform and I think listening to the dialogue as it's evolving in Wall Street or in Washington, clearly it is something that I think is a possibility. As we look at it, it is important that it is comprehensive, that it does look at a territorial system, that it does consider flat tax and that does look at ways to advantage companies that develop intellectual property in the United States. So all of that is being discussed and we're very supportive of that. As far as the cash, we have offshore and what we would do if we did have a major repatriation, right now I don't want to get into specifics about a strategy. I would just go back to say our overall capital allocation philosophy remains the same. First and foremost we're going to fund the business and then beyond that we'll look to deploy capital towards the developmental opportunities, primarily focused in areas that help to augment our pipeline. I think you've heard some examples of that even this morning on the call from Roger and then clearly we remain committed to our dividend and we'll consider share repurchase. If you look at what we've done over the past, we have deployed meaningful capital back to shareholders and all of that would remain the same. So as we would see that all of that will form a new strategy we think of in using the cash. Joseph Romanelli : Great. Thanks Rob, and thank you John. Darla, next caller please? Operator : It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : Hey guys, I really appreciate you taking the question. I'll start with Adam if I may. Maybe it's early, early days you don\u2019t have a label understood, but post ASCO Dr. Cindy [ph] on the NCCN roughly speaking how many second line patients have you guys treated with KEYTRUDA? And do you anticipate that once fully approved by FDA that second line patients that want to elect for KEYTRUDA will need a biopsy prior, so in other words at the time of initiation of second line therapy they'll need what presumably will be second biopsy. It appears not to be the case with nivolumab because obviously they are not commercial, but what will you get, what Merck gets PD-L1 positive and negative in the label. I am just curious to know whether or not you think physicians are going to want to get a biopsy? And then also Adam, or this is more for Ken and Rob, I suppose, but you've obviously, this is built on Jami's question, you've considered in the past very thoughtfully I think what do with animal health and you elected to keep it, but now the PE arbitrage is substantial again, Zovirax at 30 times, Merck at 17 times, which is just a pretty dramatic opportunity if you were to separate those businesses and liberate value. Is your choice to not do it now have to do with you think that the PE multiple in animal health is not unsustainable or is there some other reason why you wouldn't come back to this and study it hard again? And finally for Roger, I just want to ask is there some confusion around this question, so I apologize, I have asked you this before right, I just want to just to get the truth out there, but the CETP may now come to trial with ongoing, is that trial power to hit on the final analysis assuming only in LDL impact on outcomes or there also need to be some sort of contribution from the raising of the HDL on outcomes under base case assumptions, in order for that trial to hit the endpoint? And then how is enrollment going in the prodromal base trial, we've heard it's slow, just wondering if that's true? Thank you. Joseph Romanelli : All right. Mark Schoenebaum : If you don't want to answer all those questions you can pick and choose, but I feel it's Joe's last call, so I can pick him up a little bit. Adam H. Schechter: So Mark, let me give you some context on KEYTRUDA. So if you look at KEYTRUDA as you know we only promote the product on label. And if you look at the data we have about 85% of the use we believe is in melanoma. Of that 85% we believe about 70% of it is on label, which is with an improved indication. So that gives you a sense of where that is. With regard to the diagnostic testing, diagnostic testing is for two decisions, it's really become a standard and widespread in the treatment of cancer. So those are two ALK, EGFR. So we believe that physicians will do that as a standard practice and we expect that we'll have the availability of the test on the day that we launch lung. So we believe that it will be easy for them to do. They typically are doing it already and we'll make sure it is widely available. Mark Schoenebaum : You think the FDA is going to require that for getting second line KEYTRUDA in lung? Adam H. Schechter: You know, I can't, I really can't speculate Mark, on what the FDA say. I'd just say\u2026 Mark Schoenebaum : Okay, I'll look at the top. Roger M. Perlmutter: Irrespective of what the FDA says Mark, I think it is going to become standard practice that the doctors are going to want to know if they are expressive because it is going to have a very different discussion with the patient if they know that they are expressive or not. You can say your patient based upon your expression on the clinical trials you could have a greater than 50% response that's different than saying you'll have 10% response rate. So I think physicians are going to want that information data irrespective of what the FDA label or not and I also believe that payers are particularly outside the U S. are going to be very interested in having that work done. Mark Schoenebaum : And Adam, just to be clear, you believe the physicians will want to have this second biopsy done at the time of second line standard of care? Adam H. Schechter: I think they will do it as a first biopsy. I think they are going to just want to know it is part of standard of care or beginning as they move forward. Mark Schoenebaum : Okay, thanks. CETP base? Adam H. Schechter: Yes. Mark Schoenebaum : And also the animal health PE arbitrage question? Adam H. Schechter: Yes, but I don\u2019t want to answer that pretty much. Just to be clear, you have asked a question before, but the REVEAL study is powered to see the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect based on the nomogram that associates LDL cholesterol-lowering their productions in major cardiovascular events. So we would see that we believe. And with respect to the base studies prodromal enrolment is always challenging, there is no question and a part of the issue with respect to prodromal enrolment is that there are a lot of people out there who believe they have cognitive impairment, are concerned about their mental functioning. And when you actually image those people a small fraction of them have evidence of plaque and so the screened tell you rate is significant, nevertheless we're making good progress in that study. Mark Schoenebaum : Joe Romanelli should likely be screened for that trial just FYI. Joseph Romanelli : We're not going to screen you though Mark. Mark Schoenebaum : Oh thank you. Congrats on a good quarter. Thank you for the nice discussion. Kenneth C. Frazier: Mark, This is Ken Frazier, I am going to try to take a short on your arbitrage question. Mark Schoenebaum : Okay. Kenneth C. Frazier: I am pleased that you characterized this as an arbitrage question. The fact of the matter is our animal health business grew very strongly this quarter. It continues to grow well. It continues to have a very good pipeline. And so we think about the issue that you put on the table as we did think about ways in which we can create value, but we also look at the business from a long-term perspective. And I would say that while we don\u2019t take anything off the table we always consider changes in the marketplace. I want to come back to what I have always said. We plan to augment our animal health business with addition of BD. We continue to see this business as a key growth driver with healthy margins and a strong market outlook over the long-term. And actually the difference between potential PEs for the animal health business versus the human health business we want to continue to focus on running our business. We're going to continue to focus on what's in our control, which is running the business, getting our products approved, augmenting the pipeline, launching new drugs. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thank you Mark and Darla, next caller please? Operator : It's from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks a lot. I just more down with Mark's questions and congrats Joe. Just quickly, this is more for Roger than anything. Just in terms of the follow up on Tim's questions prospects for a broad level you know versus the filed patient group can you just give us a sense of the importance of KEYNOTE-010 to the initial filing? And then can you may be give us a little bit color on when you expect the KEYNOTE-010 study to read out? I know the primary analysis is in the patient group that's over 50% PD-1 expression which I think many of us would have thought could have stopped in the interim, but it would seem that that the overall patient group would also be very important to fully understand. So is that part of the reason why we continue to wait for KEYNOTE-010? And then lastly on REVEAL with anacetrapib Roger, can you just update us on when we might expect the paper on baseline characteristics? I think it would be interesting to know the baseline LDL in REVEAL particularly in the context of a similar design to [indiscernible] and just additionally on anacetrapib could you comment on some recent genetic findings correlating the risk of developing macular degeneration? I am interested just more if the FDA has requested any sub studies evaluating this risk? Thanks a lot. Roger M. Perlmutter: Okay, lot of questions Seamus. First of all with respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study as you've said I mean there will be the final reasons which we expect some time towards the end of the year, but as I mentioned earlier we have a potential for an interim analysis which is event-driven. So I can't tell you when that interim analysis will take place, but that internal analysis could in principle result in a recommendation through the data, safety mild report that the study be changed or potentially even stopped I suppose depending on the strength of the data. So it could happen sooner than that. The information from that study could in principle then contribute to the initial finding based on the 001 after in particular cohort, but it depends again on at those analyses. With respect to REVEAL the baseline characteristics of patients we have - we will present those baseline characteristics. I don\u2019t have the date exactly of when that would happen. And of course the study is being run by the Oxford Group. So they are the ones who are making decisions about publication of the REVEAL data, so we can get back to you on that. And of course we are well aware of potential association between CETP mutations and macular degeneration, one of the things that we've done is looked very carefully in our patient populations because we are aware of this, we did additional eye exams in our patient populations the data safety moderate report has been looking at that and thus fare we're not aware of any adverse effects, nothing has been called to our attention. Of course irrespective of the strength of the Genetic Association we have to keep in mind that what we are doing is interdicting CETP function quite late in life, individuals who have inherited generic can normally of course have it from the time of conception. So that could have a different impact, but thus far we're not aware of and we're looking at it closely and we're not aware of any impact. Seamus Fernandez : Very helpful, thank you. Joseph Romanelli : Thanks Seamus. And now Darla, next caller please? Operator : It's from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Tony Butler : Yes, thanks very much. Adam I've asked this quarter of you in the past, but just want to get an update as the SG&A year-over-year declines Rob made some references to that, but yet at least you are launching ZERBAXA and KEYTRUDA in melanoma, and it would strike me that the need for additional capital given you are not in oncology in Europe would require a substantial expense, I'd love for you to touch on that? And then Roger lastly just some update if you could on your compound with Plexxikon and its role with PD-1and/or get it would appreciate that? And then finally Joe, all the best on your second tour and welcome back Terry. Adam H. Schechter: So Tony, so we are very much focused on maximizing each and every launch opportunity that we have and when you look at the first hour we spent it is with the launch opportunities in Januvia frankly. And what we've been able to do is make sure that when we see growth we're able to put the money to exact growth. So even though you see SG&A declining overall, if you were to look at oncology or Januvia, you'd see SG&A increasing over the past several years. And if you look at oncology we're already there in Europe with demand and we have the sales force. We've increased that sales force and we're continuing to grow. So I just want to assure you that any time there is a growth opportunity we're making sure that we have the right resources to maximize those opportunities for patients, but also obviously to grow those products. Roger M. Perlmutter: Yes, and just with respect Tony to the combination studies, of course we have a very broad set underway. Nothing really to update you on there except to say that with respect to the Gitter studies the studies began, the Gitter agonist began to in June of last year, we have to progress very slowly because of the fact that is an agonist antibody and some immune stimulator as opposed to something that relieves inhibition or is a disinhibitor like KEYTRUDA. Nevertheless we have processed and moving forward now Phase 1 studies and we have just begun combination studies with our Gitter antibody and KEYTRUDA, so that's moving right along. Tony Butler : Great thanks. Joseph Romanelli : Sure and Darla next caller please? Operator : It's from Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Colin Bristow : Good morning, thanks to take the questions and Joe congrats and now Terry looking forward to working with you. So, just as we think about the hep C opportunity recently one of your peers highlighted the U.S. hep volumes have been trading trending lower than anticipated. And the expectation was approximately 180,000 patients treated per year. Is it in line with your observations and expectations? And I was just curious see this evolving over time. And then secondly on the TECOS trial and Januvia trends just to what extent do you expect TECOS to have a positive impact on Januvia volumes in share. Thanks? Adam H. Schechter: Hi Colin this is Adam. With regard to hepatitis C I still believe that that represents a very significant opportunity for Merck as well as the number of patients that will be treated. You've seen anywhere from 100,000 to 120,000 in patient's had maximum treated in the past. Now you're seeing even 170,000 to 200,000 which is still a significant increase from what was treated in the past even today. It is not uncommon to see warehousing before any drug comes to market. You saw that earlier move before compound came to marker and obviously as you have warehousing you get a big bolus of patients and then it slows down a little bit over time. But I don\u2019t think there is fundamental issue in the overall hit the currency market. I still thinks it remains a very good attractive market and we are very excited about getting into that marketplace as soon as Roger and the team working with the rating agencies can get us in the market. With regard to TECOS obvious we were excited about the result. It is an important area for us diabetes with disproportionate investment area. I think that in general TECOS validated by physicians already were thinking in terms of the favorable tolerability profile of Januvia. With that said, in markets around the world we're able to promote it now. We've begun to promote it and I think that it has very good perception in the marketplace, in other markets like the United States, so we have to wait for it to be in the label before our representatives can actively promote the product. We're looking for it to start getting the data and a label so we can promote it in the future, but obviously are helpful. Joseph Romanelli : Thanks and Darla next caller please? Operator : Is from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : Thanks, a couple of quick ones first Adam on diabetes, what are the implications be in your view as we saw positive outcomes for Lily's SGLT2 inhibitor? Secondly given Merck's history and expertise, are you interested in the lipid disorder space either from a BD or R&D standpoint? And lastly perhaps for Ken and Rob, short of an overhaul of the U.S. tax system, which seems unlikely what is Merck doing to address the tax line longer term as well as maximize access to your ex-U.S. cash, obviously you have returned a lot of cash to shareholders, but you certainly could do more if you made certain corporation decisions? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter: Yes so thanks Gregg. First with regard to SGLT2, in general if you look at the utilization of SGLT2, they are typically after the use of Januvia. So typically it is metformin first add on Januvia and then it is after the add on Januvia. So that's the way they are currently being used. I don\u2019t see a significant change although obviously we are not going to speculate on what the trial results could be for the SGLT2 drugs. So I still remain optimistic about our diabetes franchise. With regard to lipids I'm very excited about the potential opportunity to launch the CETP inhibitor. Lipids is an area that Merck has been involved in for many, many years starting with Mevacor and Zocor and this is an area we know very well. We continue to be there for other reasons with cardiovascular medicines and we'll just see what the results of new REVEAL trial. Robert M. Davis: And Gregg with regards to your question about the tax rate, obviously and again the specific strategy has been safe to say that as we look forward we will continue to look for planning opportunities to bring the rate down and I do believe those opportunities continue to exist. So we are focused on understanding of what our tax rate can be and trying to optimize that position with or without repatriation. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thanks Gregg and Darla next caller please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Great, thanks so much for taking the question, so just one more following up. You talked about TECOS and the impact on Januvia potentially, just on improvement with VYTORIN and ZETIA I would have thought it was not on the label yet that we may have seen some better fit there, but it didn\u2019t seem to have much of an impact yet. So I'm just curious how you are thinking about the benefit from improving the maybe the project maybe for next year after presumably you will have the data and the label simply? And then second just separate topic on Pneumovax, if you can just kind of talk about the implications there with Prevnar having the adult indication have you seen any impact on Pneumovax from the added competition? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter: So Vamil, with regard to improve it obviously we were very pleased with the result of the pivot trial. As you mentioned in the United States we cannot promote that trial until we have a label and we're looking for it to having a label as soon as possible. With regard to us having the marketplace, in the U.S. you've actually seen a flattening of ZETIA and since the announcement of improvement because I think a lot of physicians became aware of the trial through the New England Journal of medicine and reading about it very quickly. So what you haven\u2019t seen is a stem in the decline of VYTORIN in the United States. Once it is in our label our representatives will actively be able to promote it. With that said, as you know in the U.S. the products will be going generic towards the end of next year. I think the greater impact from improvement is to try to help in the future when you start to think about a CETP inhibitor and the ability to get more patients to go and lower LDL cholesterol levels. Outside the U.S. in Europe we see where they are able to promote the product and it does have a positive impact, but at the same time we've lost the exclusivity of ZETIA in Canada which has had a significant impact and we've seen some changes in France in terms of the ability to have guidelines of when these products are utilized. Regarding Pneumovax we have seen increased competition from the ACIP recommendations that now include Prevnar and we've seen it in this quarter and we believe we'll see it in this year. However if you look at the ACIP Pneumovax is still recommended as a second dose after Prevnar. So we believe that over time we'll catch up again because the patients will get the second dose. So the question is how long will this short in term impact occur and when will patients come back to the second dose. And our teams have been working on how to find ways to tell the patients to come back for the second dose. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thank you Adam and Darla I think we have time for one more call. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great, thanks very much Joe, the last question is here, a couple quick ones, maybe Roger can we get your updated view on the role you see for combination therapy as we think about the first line non-small cell lung cancer opportunity? And particularly just interested in your view of chemo, PD-1 combos versus IL-IL combinations and jus maybe also relative to the monotherapy as we think about this playing out next few years? Second question is on the base inhibitor and just updated thoughts on that opportunity in light of the Lily extension study and the updated Biogen data which is still at AIC and what is with that? Thanks so much. Roger M. Perlmutter: Okay Chris, first of all with respect to combination therapy I believed absolutely that we will find over time that while KEYTRUDA is foundational for therapy for a wide set of malignant diseases that there will be ways to optimize that therapy still further. And I think it will be based on molecular characterization of tumors because we want to preserve the most favorable benefit risk profile. So that's one of the reasons why we have so many of these combination studies going on and we are exploring the full set of combinations. You know without going into detail the work which we've done and the work reported by colleagues at Johns Hopkins, really points to the importance of neo antigens in tumor recognition. So one expects the therapies that increase the representation of mutations within tumor that could be as simple as radiation therapy, it can be things that are chemotherapeutic agents that damage DNA. It can be ways of immunizing against tumor antigens. All of those things are things that we're pursuing. There are thousands of potential combinations one could pursue. We're trying to be smart about which one has the highest likelihood of success. So we're also looking at things that we've looked at tumor metabolism, all of those are quite interesting and data from those will become available in not too long a time. So I am expecting that we will move to that, but I again point out how remarkable it is when you look at the response rates to KEYTRUDA monotherapy particularly in selected patient populations they are very impressive. And second with regard to base the data that have been presented with respect to antibodies directed against a beta that's really quite a different mechanism from base inhibition and I go back to sort of bedrock data, there is very impressive genetic data that tells us that individuals who have relatively high activity of beta-secretase are at higher risk for developing dementia in their lives and they will develop it earlier as opposed to those who have lower levels of beta-secretase. And that strongly suggests the most powerful data that we have and it strongly suggests that we can phenocopy that low level of beta-secretase activity we should reduce the risk of dementia. Whether we can do that in an individual in their seventh decade is in fact exactly what we're testing using our base inhibitor in both mild-to-moderate and prodromal studies. I don't think that we can look at the data from an a beta sequestering an antibody directed against a beta and really interpret it in the same way because it's really unclear what those antibodies are doing. We know they cause an inflammatory response and are associated with an adverse effect exactly what they do in terms of delaying the progression if they do that all delaying the progress of either plaque or cognitive impairment. I think more time is needed. Joseph Romanelli : Great, thank you Roger and Ken do you want to\u2026 Kenneth C. Frazier: Thank you. Again thank you Joe for all you've done. This has been another solid quarter for us. Our four therapeutic areas grew 9%, animal health grew 10%, KEYTRUDA launch is progressing ahead of expectations. But the most important things is as we move into the future we're tremendously excited by the opportunities that we have in hep C with KEYTRUDA particularly with non-small cell lung cancer coming up and we'll continue to augment our pipeline as you saw this quarter we did BBDO, like cCAM, Ablynx, the chance to augment our pipeline is there. We are very excited about the transition to the future that's going on inside Merck. So thank you very much for your continuing interest.

At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2015 sales and earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Thank you, Darla, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we've excluded these items from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation of these items in Table 2 of our press release. We've also provided a table to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and products, which can be found in Table 3 of our press release. During the call we may refer to Table 2 for the P&L and Table 3 as it relates to revenue. Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2014 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that cause \u2013 that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call this morning. Before we review our third quarter results, I want to reinforce a few fundamental points about Merck. Our company has had a long history of success in translating scientific discoveries into novel and highly differentiated medicines and vaccines that provide major therapeutic and economic value. Our R&D-focused strategy aims to drive future growth and shareholder value in the same manner. We believe that the evolving characteristics and dynamics of global healthcare increasingly underscore this ability to provide high-value innovation is what will be \u2013 what distinguishes successful companies going forward. This approach is evidenced by our late-stage pipeline and ongoing launches, which reflect scientific and therapeutic progress in some of the world's most challenging area's unmet medical need including cancer, antibiotic resistance, cardiometabolic disease, hepatitis C, and Alzheimer's disease, all areas where we have both near- and longer-term opportunities to create beneficial returns for patients, society, and shareholders. Our broad, global, and balanced portfolio of medicines and vaccines allows us to weather periodic volatility within a particular therapeutic area or region while consistently focusing on the best scientific and medical opportunities. Speaking of focus, we've been investing our resources to grow our strongest brands and to support the most promising assets in our pipeline while, at the same time, lowering our overall cost base and delivering a leveraged P&L. We restored the JANUVIA franchise to growth. We established an oncology business unit and accelerated the development of KEYTRUDA, which was the first anti-PD-1 to market in the U.S. We reinforced our leadership in hospital acute care, specifically in antibiotic resistance, and have continued to drive positive results in vaccines. We are executing well on our strategy, advancing our pipeline in commercial portfolio both internally as well as externally through business development, all while delivering significant capital returns to shareholders. In the third quarter, we reported solid top line performance achieving strong results in our core focus areas, which coupled with thoughtful cost management, translated to bottom line growth. Rob and Adam will provide more detail on our financial, operational, and commercial performance this past quarter. On the R&D front, our research organization continues to make major strides, accomplishing several important milestones this quarter, which Roger will review in detail in a few minutes. Progress in our oncology and hepatitis C programs underscores and exemplifies our ongoing commitment to pursuing science in the areas where we can have the greatest impact while driving long-term growth. On a separate but meaningful note, we were especially proud to mention that, recently, our own William Campbell, Dr. William Campbell, was jointly named the 2015 Nobel Prize winner in Physiology or Medicine for his work in the discovery of MECTIZAN. More than 2 billion free treatments later, the results speak for themselves as river blindness is in the process of being eliminated around the world. As you may know, this honor is rarely bestowed on a scientist whose research was conducted in a company setting. We are delighted for our retired colleague, Dr. Campbell, who is an inspiration for our Merck colleagues around the world. In closing, Merck is well positioned for a solid finish in 2015. Our results for the quarter and year-to-date reflect the company's disciplined focus and investment of resources on the internal and external opportunities that can generate sustainable value for society and shareholders. In doing so, we intend to continue to play a leading role in helping to shape the future of health for populations around the world. And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our performance for the third quarter is evidence of our continued focus on execution. We delivered solid financial results and a leveraged P&L in the quarter as we saw a return to growth as exchanged on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues of $10.1 billion in the quarter decreased 5% versus the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total revenue grew 2% this quarter and grew 4% if you further exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In addition to strong results for Global Human Health, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes, Animal Health grew 7% in the quarter excluding exchange. This growth was driven by an increase in sales of companion animal products, primarily BRAVECTO, as well as new aqua and swine products. As a result of our performance in the first nine months of the year, we are narrowing our revenue guidance range and increasing the midpoint. We now expect full year 2015 revenue to be $39.2 billion to $39.8 billion at current exchange rates. Turning to the other parts of the P&L. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 75.1% in the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by lower inventory write-offs. We remain focused on driving additional productivity through improvements in our operating model as total non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $160 million lower this quarter. Marketing and administrative expense, which declined 7% versus prior year, was partially offset by a modest increase in research and development. We continue to expect full year 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses will be lower than they were in 2014. In addition, we are pleased to report that we have met and will exceed our annual target of $2.5 billion in net savings versus 2012 by the end of this year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%. Given our results year-to-date, we expect the full year rate to be at the lower end of our overall guidance range of 23% to 24%. Taken together, we earned $0.96 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter, delivering 7% growth on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage. This marks our second sequential quarter of year-over-year earnings growth taking into account headwinds from foreign exchange for net acquisitions and divestitures, and is continued proof of our efforts to manage our business and execute on our strategy. Given our continued expectation of strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, we are increasing the top and bottom ends of our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.55 to $3.60. Finally, in addition to investing in our business and looking for opportunities to bolster our pipeline with external innovation, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. To that end, we were able to take advantage of market conditions in the latter half of the quarter and repurchase additional shares opportunistically, nearly doubling the amount of repurchases in the prior quarter. Given these additional repurchases, we now expect to return approximately $4 billion to shareholders via share repurchases in 2015. The third quarter was another demonstration of strong execution. We remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L through our focus on expense management, while also ensuring we make appropriate investments on our broad portfolio of commercial and pipeline opportunities. Now I'll turn the call over to Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Excuse me. This morning I'll discuss the third quarter results for Global Human Health and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. This quarter, we continued to drive growth within our core business while executing on our new product launches. As a result, worldwide Human Health sales increased 6%, driven by sales growth in the United States and emerging markets, partially offset by declines in Europe and Japan. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide sales grew 3%. Our global growth was primarily driven by our diabetes, hospital acute care, and oncology businesses. Beginning with diabetes and our JANUVIA franchise, our results continue to reflect the strength and the importance of these products and our commitment to grow JANUVIA and the DPP-4 class. With nine years on the market, physicians are comfortable with and confident in the efficacy and safety that JANUVIA offers to patients with type 2 diabetes. In the third quarter, JANUVIA franchise sales reached approximately $1.6 billion and grew 17%. In the United States, sales grew 22%. Timing of customer buying significantly benefited the third quarter by approximately $100 million. This will have an adverse impact in the fourth or subsequent quarters. The best way to understand the underlying performance is through TRx trends. Through continued execution of our strategy, we drove underlying volume growth of about 4%. We are encouraged by the volume trends as we head into the fourth quarter and into 2016. In the international markets, which represent nearly half of our diabetes business, JANUVIA franchise sales reached approximately $675 million and grew 12%. We drove double digit growth in Europe and emerging markets, which was partially offset by slight declines in Japan. Diabetes is a progressive disease that affects hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Many patients require more than one medication to treat the disease. We continue to see opportunities to grow JANUVIA as a preferred add-on therapy in global markets. Next, in immunology. Combined sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI were approximately $620 million, a decline of 5%. SIMPONI grew 25% but growth was offset by 13% decline in REMICADE sales. As expected, we continue to see additional competitive impact from biosimilars across Europe. We expect declines in REMICADE will continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter and throughout 2016. In hospital acute care, global sales reached approximately $985 million. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of Cubist, sales grew 7%. We drove growth for BRIDION and our portfolio of antibiotic and antifungal treatments. We continue to see this segment as a growth driver and expect to solidify our position as a global leader in hospital acute care with our emerging pipeline products. Additionally, our teams are preparing to launch BRIDION later this year in the U.S. Turning now to the vaccine business, vaccine sales were approximately $1.6 billion, a decline of 3% versus the prior year. GARDASIL franchise growth was more than offset by declines in PROQUAD due to the timing of sales activity related to the CDC stockpile and continued near-term competitive pressure for PNEUMOVAX. Combined sales of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 grew 7% to approximately $625 million with continued growth in the U.S. GARDASIL 9 accounted for approximately 80% of HBV sales in the U.S. This result is a testament to our team's strong execution in securing managed care access and their ability to transition customers to the new 9-valent vaccine. ZOSTAVAX global sales increased 1% to approximately $180 million. Growth in ex-U.S. markets was partially offset by a slight decline in the U.S. resulting from a delayed start to the flu season. As we've indicated previously, we do see some seasonal fluctuations in ZOSTAVAX sales with increases in vaccination rates when patients visit their doctors or their pharmacists to receive a flu shot. Now that the flu season has begun, we have launched a new DTC campaign to drive future growth. Outside of the U.S., we continue to launch in more than 25 markets and there remains significant opportunity for ZOSTAVAX globally. We remain confident in the proven efficacy and safety that comes from the single dose regimen of ZOSTAVAX. Now I'm excited to share with you some updates from a few of our launch products, and I'll start with KEYTRUDA. We continue to be pleased with our execution of the KEYTRUDA launch. Global sales for KEYTRUDA were approximately $160 million in the third quarter, an increase of 45% compared to the second quarter of this year. Importantly, our strong launch in melanoma has provided physicians with valuable experience using KEYTRUDA, with its durable efficacy results and convenient dosing schedule of every three weeks. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA retains approximately 70% of anti-PD-1 patient share in melanoma. And it's the number one therapy to treat melanoma in the United States across all classes of treatment. Internationally, KEYTRUDA is launching in approximately 40 markets including the EU, with a product that's approved for use in advanced first and second-line melanoma. Our teams are working tirelessly to secure pricing and reimbursement, and recent recommendations from NICE in the UK are helping to secure timely access for patients. Additionally, we are enthusiastic about expanding our launch of KEYTRUDA to patients suffering from lung cancer. In the few weeks since FDA approval, our teams have reached a majority of high-volume prescribers for this important new indication. Early customer feedback is encouraging and we're confident about the uptake of KEYTRUDA over time, as customers build in PD-L1 testing as a common practice in lung cancer diagnosis to inform treatment decisions. We are still in the very early days of the KEYTRUDA launch and life cycle. With approvals in lung cancer and melanoma, and one of the broadest clinical programs in the industry, studying over 30 different tumor types, we are very excited about the promise KEYTRUDA offers to patients suffering from cancer now and in the future. Moving to BELSOMRA, we continue to be encouraged by the early days of the BELSOMRA launch in the U.S. and Japan. In the U.S., we initiated a branded DTC campaign in August and we're already seeing steady demand increases from both new and current customers. Brand awareness continues to increase for both physicians and for patients. Finally, our teams are preparing for the launch of our hepatitis C doublet in the U.S., the EU, and other global markets. Merck has an important legacy in bringing innovative treatments for HCV to the market. We have maintained our global footprint and our relationships in the HCV community. Our teams are ready and they're extremely excited to launch. In summary, Global Human Health delivered another solid quarter. We grew through execution in core areas of diabetes, hospital acute care, and oncology, and we continue to gain momentum with our key new product launches. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Thanks, Adam. The third quarter saw continued progress in late-stage development, especially in our oncology and infectious disease programs, with new results, new regulatory approvals, and new partnerships. First with respect to KEYTRUDA, our PD-1-directed monoclonal antibody designed to promote activation of tumor-directed immune responses, at the end of the quarter, we obtained accelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the salvage setting. This approval was based on the response rate seen in patients with advanced disease whose tumors expressed PD-L1 in 50% or more tumor cells. Accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA required that we have a confirmatory study underway, and this study was called KEYNOTE-010. The final top line results from KEYNOTE-010 study were announced yesterday. Briefly, the KEYNOTE-010 study randomized 1,034 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had failed at least one prior systemic therapy to treatment with either docetaxel, a standard chemotherapeutic agent used in this setting, or to KEYTRUDA. Patients enrolled in this study were quite ill, typically with stage 4 disease and evidence of metastases, including brain metastases in many cases. KEYTRUDA was administered either at the approved dose of 2 milligrams per kilogram given every three weeks or an investigational dose of 10 milligrams per kilogram every three weeks. All patients enrolled in the study had tumors that expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% of cells. However, statistical testing for the primary endpoint was performed first in the population of individuals whose tumors had very high expression of PD-L1, that's equal to or greater than 50% which permitted the subsequent analysis of the entire population, including all of those whose tumors expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% but fewer than 50% of tumor cells. As we announced yesterday, the KEYNOTE-010 results were unambiguous. The administration of KEYTRUDA as compared with docetaxel improved the overall survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of the proportion of cells that expressed PD-L1 as judged by immunohistochemistry. There was no meaningful difference observed between the 2 milligram per kilogram dose of KEYTRUDA, the approved dose, and the investigational 10 milligram per kilogram dose. A result that mirrors what we have previously seen in the melanoma setting. I should emphasize that the KEYNOTE-010 study enrolled patients with both squamous and non-squamous cell histologies in about the ratio that one would expect on the basis of the epidemiology of lung cancer. KEYNOTE-010 is a large multinational randomized controlled clinical trial and, of course, there's a great deal more information relevant to the outcomes of patients treated with KEYTRUDA as compared with docetaxel that can be distilled from the study. We anticipate presenting the results of KEYNOTE-010 at a scientific meeting in the near future and expect to submit the data for review by regulatory authorities before the end of the year. Beyond KEYNOTE-010, we continue to explore the utility of KEYTRUDA therapy and patients with non-small cell lung cancer at an early stage in the evolution of the disease. We have two ongoing first-line studies addressing this issue. Our KEYNOTE-024 study is now fully enrolled and our somewhat larger KEYNOTE-042 study is enrolling well. We have previously shown that KEYTRUDA improves overall survival when used as first-line therapy in patients with advanced melanoma. These data are included in our European label for KEYTRUDA and are currently under review on a priority basis at the FDA. We expect to complete label discussions with the agency regarding both our KEYNOTE-002 and KEYNOTE-006 studies in the fourth quarter. In evaluating KEYTRUDA, we have sought to broaden the impact of this therapy still further by combining with other immune manipulations. Along these lines, we recently announced the expansion of our collaboration with Incyte Pharmaceuticals (sic) [Incyte Corporation] testing whether their IDO1 inhibitor could increase tumor regression in patients simultaneously receiving KEYTRUDA. Early data from this collaboration will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meetings in November. Lastly, I should again note that we have an exceptionally broad program exploring the utility of KEYTRUDA treatment. We have embarked upon registration-enabling studies in more than 10 different tumor types, are exploring the utility of KEYTRUDA treatment in 20 additional cancers, and have evidence of tumor responses in about two dozen different types of malignancies. Earlier today, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan announced the first set of so-called SAKIGAKE products, those given fast-track review status, which included KEYTRUDA for the treatment of advanced unresectable gastric cancer. Clearly, the spectrum of activity of KEYTRUDA appears to be extraordinarily broad. Turning now to infectious diseases, during the third quarter, the European Commission ratified the use of ZERBAXA for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal or urinary tract infection. Also during the quarter, we had the opportunity to present the results from bezlotoxumab, our monoclonal antibody directed against a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile. As we discussed at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a single intravenous administration of bezlotoxumab significantly reduced recurrence of C. difficile infection as compared with standard therapy. We anticipate submitting these data for regulatory review before the end of the year. As we announced last quarter, our combination therapy containing grazoprevir and elbasvir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection is undergoing priority review in the United States with a PDUFA date of January 28 and accelerated assessment in the European Union. Regulatory agencies are making good progress in reviewing our files and we are responding to questions from both FDA and the CHMP. Additional data from our hepatitis C virus program will be presented at the Liver Disease meetings [The Liver Meeting] next month, including the efficacy of grazoprevir/elbasvir in more challenging patient populations, and Phase 2 data from the analysis of our nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, MK-3682, used in combination with grazoprevir/elbasvir and other agents in our antiviral arsenal, including MK-8408, an especially potent NS5A inhibitor. Our program is based on the idea that we can advance an antiviral regimen with broad activity across HCV genotypes, and that can be used in patients irrespective of comorbidities with shorter courses of therapy designed to improve adherence. Using this approach, we are optimistic that substantial control of HCV-imposed liver disease can be achieved for tens of millions of infected patients around the world. During the third quarter we received marketing authorization in Japan for MARIZEV, our once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor generically known as omarigliptin. We continue to assemble data supporting the filing of omarigliptin in the United States, which we plan to complete before the end of the year. In the area of cardiovascular medicine, we are working with our partner Bayer to evaluate data obtained from Phase 2b study of vericiguat in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. We expect to have the opportunity to present these data at upcoming scientific meetings and are considering various options for registration-enabling clinical trials. With respect to anacetrapib, our potent once daily CETP inhibitor, we are obviously aware of the termination of Lilly's Phase 3 study of evacetrapib, another CETP inhibitor, for futility. In a sense, this result increases the importance of our large Phase 3 outcome study called REVEAL. Our IMPROVE-IT data, which became available a year ago, demonstrated that reductions in serum LDL cholesterol levels, whether achieved using statins or using the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, had predictable and similar effects on the risk of major cardiovascular events. Since CETP inhibitors also dramatically reduce serum LDL cholesterol levels, it is now especially important to know whether this biochemical effect is associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Our REVEAL study is explicitly powered to see this effect. Six months ago, we reported that the REVEAL Steering Committee wished to adjust the primary endpoint to substitute ischemic stroke for revascularization, reflecting evidence from IMPROVE-IT where a benefit was observed on the incidence of this more easily adjudicated endpoint. After discussions with regulatory agencies, however, this change was deemed inadvisable. Hence, as of today, the Steering Committee plans to continue along the path originally outlined in the study protocol. There will be an interim analysis before the end of the year. In light of the results obtained with evacetrapib, it is anticipated that a futility component will be included in this analysis. We achieved meaningful progress in many other important programs in the third quarter, including completion of enrollment in our Phase 3 Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease study with Verubecestat, our highly potent BACE inhibitor, completion of enrollment of all 11 of our Phase 3 studies for ertugliflozin, a collaborative effort with Pfizer, to develop a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, and commitment to regulatory filing of two new diabetes programs, omarigliptin in the United States and insulin glargine, which we are pursuing in collaboration with our colleagues at Samsung Bioepis. However, I would like to close by again acknowledging Dr. William C. Campbell who will receive the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research conducted in collaboration with Dr. Satoshi Omura of Japan. Dr. Campbell performed his Nobel Prize-winning work, identifying the parasiticide, ivermectin, here at Merck, where he was employed from 1957 until 1990. Dr. Campbell's steadfast commitment to fundamental research has preserved the sight of millions of people around the globe. People who were otherwise condemned to early blindness from onchocerciasis. My colleagues and I at Merck Research Laboratories, including quite a few who overlapped with Dr. Campbell at our Rahway site, offer our congratulations for this important and well-deserved recognition of his accomplishments. I'll now turn the call back to Teri. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Thanks, Roger. Darla, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. The first one is can you just elaborate a little bit more on your view of JANUVIA and the broader oral diabetes landscape following the recent SGLT2 outcomes data? I guess, do you see incremental pressure to this franchise as that data is reflected on competitor labels? And then maybe as a follow-up to that, can you just update the timelines of your SGLT2 and when you'll have outcomes data? And my second question was on KEYTRUDA in lung and the commercial dynamics based on the recent approval and now the KEYNOTE-010 study. I guess how do you see the dynamics playing out here relative to Bristol, given the label differences between the products and just given the various moving piece of these two products? I'd just like to understand a little bit how you're thinking about the coming quarters on that one. Thanks so much. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Yeah, so this is Adam, Chris. I'll start off by reviewing JANUVIA and I'll give some color on lung. But I'll also ask Roger to jump in on your SGLT2 question. If you look at JANUVIA, we continue to be pleased with the underlying demand in the U.S. where we're seeing about 4% TRx volume growth. And that's been consistent since before EMPA-REG and after EMPA-REG. And if you look at the most recent current week, it's just over 3% still. So we're seeing the underlying volume continue to be strong. If you look at what's occurring in the marketplace and you look at NBRx data, which is like real early data to try to understand the dynamics early in the marketplace, we see switching that's occurring within the SGLT2 class, but we do not see switching occurring across classes at this point in time. We believe that this market is very big. It requires multiple medications for people over time, and we believe that JANUVIA will maintain a very strong add-on position as we go into the future. So we remain optimistic about the promise of JANUVIA into the marketplace. We're not giving 2016 guidance today. As I look at managed care, those decisions have been made for 2016 and I'll say that our formulary position in 2016 remains strong and very similar to what it was in 2015. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, and, Chris, it's Roger. With respect to the timing of SGLT2 results for ertugliflozin, as I indicated, all 11 of our studies are fully enrolled and data will begin to roll out from those studies in 2016. We do have a cardiovascular outcome study. Those studies obviously take a longer period of time. The expectation for those studies is that data will be available around the 2019 timeframe. But of course in light of the results that were obtained by Lilly, BI and the EMPA-REG study, as we look at those results, there's interest in asking the more explicit question of whether ertugliflozin has the same kinds of effects on cardiovascular mortality, which could result in a slight change in the way we conduct our outcome study. And we'll have more commentary on that later, we're reviewing those issues. But that's basically where we stand at this point. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : And then, Chris, with regard to your question on lung for KEYTRUDA, so when we built the oncology business unit, we built it to maximize KEYTRUDA over the long term. And just like you saw, we were ready to launch melanoma, we were just as ready to launch lung. So we think that lung cancer's a very significant opportunity for KEYTRUDA and we think there is room for multiple products with KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO in that market. If you look, we're still early in the launch but we're encouraged by customer feedback and just days after the approval, we got to 100% of our top 150 accounts, and we had over 5,500 customer interactions. And we're confident that the uptake will be good over time as customers build in PD-L1 testing as a common practice. And I think that's probably what your question is getting to with PD-L1 testing versus not testing for lung. And what I'd like to say about that is as you think about diagnostic testing, it's very common today for lung cancer. It's become standard and widespread for HER2, ALK and EGFR. So we believe that it will be standard over time for PD-L1 and it's just going to take time for it to become standard. But our execution by our teams and the partners at Dako was very strong, along with our leading diagnostic centers. And we actually had the companion diagnostic available and accessible for patient sampling day one at the time of launch. So it allows the physicians to really have a different conversation with patients, depending on their PD-L1 expression. And I think that's important when you start to see the differences between low PD-L1 expressers and high PD-L1 expressers. It allows physicians to have better conversations. So as we've said before, this is going to play out over time. Lung is an important indication. We think there's room for multiple drugs. We think PD-L1 testing over time will become increasingly important. And we're confident about KEYTRUDA moving forward. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : And just to emphasize what Adam said, there is no doubt that a PD-L1 expression, while an imperfect biomarker, does have predictive value in the lung cancer setting with respect to responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. And that has been observed. Although we've pioneered those studies, that's been observed by everyone who's looked at this kind of therapy. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Darla, if you can move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Timothy M. Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Going back to KEYTRUDA, do you anticipate that in the U.S. you'll get reimbursed either by Medicare or by private payers in PD-L1 negative patients? The NCCN Compendium came out just in the last couple of days, and it recommends your drug in PD-L1 positive patients. It doesn't specify any cutoff for that positivity. So it's a fair chunk of patients. But I'm wondering from here if you can actually \u2013 if you think you can negotiate with payers such that you'll actually get broad coverage, which would go above and beyond what NCCN recommends or what your label actually recommends. And then another question on hep C. Just talking about commercially how the doublet might kind of play into existing therapies that are out there, can you make any directional comments at all on pricing, for example? My guess is that as a later entrant in the category, you might have to come in at a discount. Ken, I think on certain settings you've implied that that may not happen and that you may not play the price card. But can you talk about how you view the competitive dynamics in that category with your doublets, specifically as you go into 2016? Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Hi, Tim. This is Adam. So I'll start with, obviously, the NCCN Guidelines were just updated. We received the information last Friday evening, and it's done by an outside agency with no input from us. And we did see that they recommended KEYTRUDA side-by-side with nivo as a preferred option in treatment of algorithm for second-line non-small lung. The updates are very recent. We expect that payers will take some time to interpret the guidelines on how they'll reimburse the use of KEYTRUDA. But anecdotally, when we talk to our customers, they are going to follow NCCN. They will not go outside of NCCN. So we think that this is positive. We also think the fact that we now have the new KEYNOTE-010 data will help us in the future as well, because these guidelines were issued Friday night before we even put the top line results out on Monday. So that's where we are with NCCN. What I'd like to do now is give you a sense of hepatitis C. And we know this market, and we know the players, and we know the managed care organizations very, very well. We have a very long legacy in HCV with interferon. And I think you saw our ability to execute with VICTRELIS. And we've had great success in the past. We expect to have success in the future. You see from the Phase 3 data, we believe we have an innovative, broadly competitive regimen, and there may be some advantages in some patient types, particularly CKD patients. And we believe that our data in cirrhotics is particularly strong. So I don't want to give specifics about pricing strategies and contracting strategies, as I'm sure the competition would love to know what we're thinking there. But what I would say to you is that we intend to be serious about coming into this market strong, and we think there's a real opportunity for us. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Actually, I just had some IMAX questions for Teri. Is she there? I've been having trouble getting tickets to the latest Avengers movie and -anyway. Thank you very much for calling on me, and welcome Teri. It's great to have you there. A lot of my questions have been asked. So what I'll do is try to re-ask some to see if I can get better answers and ask some different ones. First, on hep C pricing, Adam. Obviously, you're not \u2013 it's not in shareholders' interests or your interests to tip your hat on this, but the reason people are asking is that AbbVie, weeks before their negotiations with Express Scripts was saying \u2013 Rick Gonzalez was saying things like, we don't think we're going to really be using pricing, Mark. And then they cut price 50%. So I guess when \u2013 I guess I'm just asking you, can you reassure the market that when you think about the hep C pricing, your internal hep C pricing scenarios, that something like a 50% cut, it isn't what you're thinking. It's more incremental. And you don't have to give us that number. Even that I think would relieve a lot of the, perhaps, pressure. And then a question biosimilar REMICADE. I may have missed this. I had to hop off the call for a few minutes. But can you update us on market shares, Pan-European market shares for biosimilar REMICADE and what the average price discount is to branded REMICADE in tender and non-tender markets, or perhaps even both combined? And the last one is for Ken and just big balance sheet, M&A, a lot of targets out there. You guys have been quite inactive since Cubist. I'd like to know if you, now that prices have come down 30% in biotech, if you're revving the engines. Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Okay. So let me give it a start, Mark. And I'll say with hepatitis C, I don't want to give specifics. But all I'll say is when you have what's perceived to be an inferior profile in the marketplace, as I think AbbVie's product was, you may have a different strategy when you have a product that you think is competitive in the marketplace. And we believe that we have a competitive profile to be able to be successful in the marketplace. With regard to biosimilar REMICADE, we're seeing most discounts of 30% to 45%. Maybe a little bit higher in some of the countries where there's been biosimilars for a longer period of time than in Core Europe. If you look at our market share, we have about a 90% market share as we go through the third quarter. That's down from about a 95% market share the prior quarter. And we believe that the pressure will continue because we've been able to hold on to a lot of the existing patients that are well-controlled and physicians don't want to switch. But we're starting to lose more and more new patients, and new patients, as you know, become more of a percent of the total as you go longer over time. So it would be a bit gradual, but it's going to continue to have impact. About 10% to 20% of the business per year is in new patients, just to give you a sense. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Mark. And on business development, let me just be really clear. We are very committed to doing the right kind of deals to create value for our shareholders and that augment our pipeline with programs that, as Roger would say, provide an unambiguous promotable advantage. That's what we've been doing over the past couple of years. You've seen Idenix, Cubist, OncoEthix, cCAM Biotherapeutics, just to name a few. We're also today very confident that we have the right balance sheet to do whatever size deal we need to do, whether it's M&A or licensing. We've been very clear in the past that our preference is for bolt-on deals rather than the large consolidation-type mergers. But the fact of the matter is we will continue to pursue pipeline assets on a selective basis, meaning they have to be really important scientific breakthroughs and they also have to be capable of being acquired at a price that's valuable for our shareholders. And to your point, we have seen values go down over the last few weeks. And we're going to continue to look for those opportunities. So we are committed to it. Don't think if you haven't seen anything in the last couple of quarters that, that reflects any change whatsoever in our perspective. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Thanks. Darla, we'll go on to the next one. Operator : It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Ken, question for you. Just given the increasing pricing debate in the market, I'm just wondering if you can \u2013 I'm interested in your perspective on what you think happens to drug list price versus realized price. I mean clearly we have seen price increases increase over time. But we've also seen the phenomenon of increased rebates and discounts. So just given the increased focus on pricing, given the campaign rhetoric, which doesn't appear to be dying down any time soon, how do you expect the industry to respond to this growing debate? And I'm also surprised that the industry has been so silent given all the headline news. And I know that you have a leadership position within the industry and what your plans are to defend industry practices. And, Roger, for you, just on the anacetrapib interim later this year, I guess, did you say later this year or early next, the interim on futility, are we going to \u2013 if the decision is to continue with the trial, are you going to let us know? Or I mean is no news good news in this case? How should we think about it? Thanks very much. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Why don't we start with pricing? Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So let me start with pricing. Good morning, Jami. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me first remind everybody what I think is the most important thing, which is that we are, at Merck, entering a period of unprecedented advances in human biology, and we have immense opportunities to advance patient care as well as public health. Unfortunately, I think the current discussion around pricing fails to account for the fact this industry is hardly homogeneous. There are a lot of companies, as you know, that purchase drugs, many of them older drugs. They raise the prices to whatever they feel the market will bear while significantly reducing or eliminating investment in R&D. Merck has not been that kind of company. Obviously, we invest in R&D to bring forward important products like KEYTRUDA. But we've also tried to approach pricing from the perspective of value. And I recently had the opportunity to actually meet with the President of the United States in his office and we had this conversation. And I think there's a lot of rhetoric around the industry. As a leader of pharma, I try very hard to distinguish between the innovation-based companies that do take a value approach to pricing, and a few companies that I think are unrepresentative of the entire industry. If you don't see it in the newspapers, recognize that there's a little bit of a filter between what we say and what actually gets reported in the newspapers, but we're going to continue to make that point. And I have to say that I believe that while there's a lot of noise out there, my experience in Washington is that people do recognize that this industry is important, that these innovations are critical to society, that we, for example, need a disease-modifying agent for Alzheimer's. People see what these immuno-oncology drugs are doing and they know that, that's just the beginning of what we can do as an industry. So I think you have to separate a little bit of the rhetoric and the newspaper reports from the fact that I think there's a lot of rationality in public policy. And people recognize that this is an industry that contributes greatly to global society as one of the strongest industries in the U.S. economy. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Thanks, Ken. Roger, do you want to comment on anacetrapib? Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, Jami, in light of the evacetrapib futility results, there will be a futility analysis incorporated into the interim analysis of anacetrapib, which will be conducted before the end of this year. And if \u2013 obviously, if we were to decide that \u2013 if our Steering Committee came back and said that it is futile, obviously, we will announce that. If they don't, then we will announce in the appropriate forum that the study is continuing. I wouldn't overinterpret that, though. I wouldn't look at that and say, oh, well, that means it must be working. What it means is it's not futile. It could work. And so it will be one or the other result. I think it is important to include \u2013 and I've made the point in talking with the Steering Committee members that it is important to include this kind of analysis, because we wouldn't want to be exposing people to the drug if there's no hope of showing a benefit. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Thanks, Roger. Darla, let's move on to the next one, please. Operator : It's from Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. First, you mentioned the diabetes franchise was a little weak in Japan. Can you talk about what's going on there and is that because you have this new product, the once-weekly, that just got approved? Was that having any impact? And how you think that plays out over there? And then second, can you talk about the gross margin a little bit, just the underlying gross margin, what's being impacted by currency, what's going on there and how you're thinking about that? And no one has really asked about expenses. Maybe you can talk about just the underlying numbers. I mean is this a good run rate to be thinking about for how Merck is spending? What are some of the push pulls on spending over the next 12 months? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Sure, Marc. I'll cover the question on diabetes in Japan. Japan remains a very important market. In fact, if you look at DPP-4 inhibitors, it's one of the few markets in the world where DPP-4 inhibitors actually have more patient days of therapy than metformin does or (47:51). So it's always been a fast uptake market for DPP-4 use. And for JANUVIA we have a very high share. So the issue there is it's harder to grow because you can't take share away from (48:03) as much because you already have the leading product in the marketplace. We are launching our once-weekly and we think that could be a very important product. It's under two-week prescription limit right now, but that, over time, will be removed. And we think that, that will help us potentially expand the DPP-4 class even into earlier lines of treatment. Overall, it was down about 2% versus prior year in Japan, so it wasn't a significant decrease versus the prior year. And part of that is also customer timing. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And with regard to your question on gross margin, so if you look at the drivers of gross margin, by far the largest driver was the fact that we had lower inventory write-offs than we've had in the past. So that was the single biggest item. FX was favorable in the quarter in the margin, but again, the bigger driver was inventory write-offs. And also recall that part of why we're seeing a lift in gross margin year-on-year is the fact that with the divestitures we did last year, primarily at MCC, you do get a favorable lift as a result of just the mix of those businesses. If you look from an expense perspective, recall that as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did meet and we are exceeding our target of $2.5 billion of expense reduction relative to our 2012 base. So we've delivered on what we expected to do there. If you look at what's happening on a spend basis, obviously, we are investing in R&D and, in fact, R&D was up a little bit. It was funded by overall reductions across marketing and administrative spend. I don't want to get into specific guidance as you look forward, but to say we continue to be committed to driving a leveraged P&L as we look into the future, balancing the need to drive cost reductions as an ongoing part of the business, really, with a focus more on how do we drive productivity as we invest in the future around key new product launches and, obviously, the R&D pipeline and what we have coming there. So I would say our story is really shifting from absolute cost reduction to productivity and leverage going forward is the way I would look at it. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Thanks, Rob. Darla, let's move on to the next one. Operator : It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good quarter on the KEYTRUDA progress. Just following up on KEYTRUDA, do you anticipate that most of the PD-L1 testing in lung cancer will be done with the diagnostic test that was approved with KEYTRUDA? Or will it depend on which test the lab chooses? Because your label is obviously not restricted. And a follow-up for Roger if I \u2013 apologies if I missed it. But when can we expect data for your next generation immuno-oncology product? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : Yeah, so I'll start off with the question on the testing. I think \u2013 right now, I think a lot of the PD-L1 testing, particularly outside of the large hospitals, institutions, will be done through the approved PD-L1 tests that are available. I do think even today some of the large institutions are doing their own PD-L1 testing. So I think, over time, it's very common for multiple tests to be available in the marketplace for various things like HER2 and so forth and I think that there'll be multiple different tests and the hospital and physicians will choose which ones they use in the future. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, and, Alex, it's Roger. I assume you want clinical data for next generation immuno-oncology products and we have several. But, for example, we have an anti-GITR antibody, which is an agonist antibody immune manipulator. We also have the CEACAM antibody that we acquired. And both of those are in Phase 1 clinical studies, the GITR antibody also in combination with KEYTRUDA. So we'll have the opportunity to see those data in 2016. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Thanks, Roger. Darla, let's move on to the next one. Operator : It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Oh, thanks very much for taking the question. So just a few here. First off, could you guys update us on why the Incyte agreement didn't include lung? Should we assume that lung is excluded from this? Or is that something that may require some additional negotiation going forward? Or is that, should we think of that as still a potential shot on goal for Merck? Second, can you talk a little bit more about the SGLT-2 programs? When might we see data from those? And should we expect a filing in 2016? And if you could, just let us know if that would include the single pill combination or if that would be filed separately, that would be great. And then the last question really is on other indications for KEYTRUDA. You guys have an awful lot of patients in clinical trials and ongoing. Roger, you mentioned the opportunity to potentially see gastric cancer approval of KEYTRUDA in Japan sooner than I think many of us expect. So what other areas should we be thinking about in terms of additional KEYTRUDA filings? Or at least additional data or tumor types where you think Merck has a lead or a potential advantage? Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Right. So, Seamus, first of all, with respect to the insight agreement, we have the bulk of data from the combination of KEYTRUDA with their IDO1 inhibitor in melanoma. And based on those data, you'll have a chance to see some of those data at the Society for Immunotherapy and Cancer meeting, as I mentioned in November. Based on those data, we, together, wanted very much to proceed into a late development. And that's what we're going to do. The agreement that we announced is about that. But it doesn't preclude doing other kinds of studies. And indeed, we have ongoing studies looking at other tumor types. So we'll get more information about that, and that will be helpful. With respect to ertugliflozin, our SGLT-2 inhibitor program with Pfizer, again, all of the Phase 3 programs, all 11, are enrolled. Data will start rolling in. We'll have data in 2016. The filing will include the combination. It's not just by itself. And we do expect \u2013 we will decide on it, the filing, based, of course, on what the data looked like. But certainly we hope that if the data looked good, that we would be able to file the entire package in 2016. And then the last question was other indications for KEYTRUDA. And there again, we have registration-enabling studies going on in more than 10 different tumor types. And an awful lot of new data become available actually on an almost weekly basis because we have so many different studies going on. But I would highlight to you that we have a lot of good data already in head and neck cancer, in bladder cancer. We're developing the drug in triple negative breast cancer. We're dropping the drug in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, as I mentioned. So as you could see, there's a lot going on. And where we see opportunities to pursue an accelerated approval pathway, we're certainly interested in that. But we're also, of course, doing more conventional studies, including studies in which we're looking at the question of whether or not we can identify biomarkers like micro-satellite instability that permit us to gain access to and bring benefit to an awful lot more patients with other tumors. So it's a broad portfolio. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Thanks, Roger. And Darla, I know we're starting to run out of time. We're going to try to squeeze in two more questions if we can keep them short. And then if we have time, we'll try to squeeze in another one. But let's move on to the next one. Operator : It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. I will cut my eight-part question to six. Just kidding. So very quickly, so could you just rephrase what the proposed anacetrapib study change was that \u2013 I think, Roger, you said was rejected by the FDA or something like that? Second, with respect to the base interim look, when is that interim look and does it include a futility analysis? And then third, could you just update us on the timing of GARDASIL safety updates in Japan and the U.K.? Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Roger, you want to start with the question? Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, so, David, with respect to anacetrapib, the critical issue was to change the primary endpoint of the REVEAL study to include ischemic stroke as a component of the composite endpoint rather than revascularization, because ischemic stroke is both a more explicit endpoint to test, and in addition, is something that we know from the IMPROVE-IT study was associated with cholesterol reduction. Regulatory agencies were not comfortable with the idea of changing the primary end point, perhaps not surprisingly. While it is at the sponsors' discretion to do those kinds of things, I think the feeling after the discussions on the part of the steering committee was that, that wouldn't be the way to go forward and we would stick with the primary endpoint as originally constituted. So that program moves forward. And with respect to the base program, we have completed enrollment in the mild to moderate study. I should \u2013 I would expect that study to proceed to completion. So you can anticipate that, that study will proceed to completion. We would hope to have data available in the 2017 timeframe. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : And, David, with regard to GARDASIL, we continue to work with our customers and the government in Japan. We are confident in the efficacy and the safety of the product. And we continue to have active discussions with them and provide them whatever data they would like to have. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : And I think we are almost out of time, but let's try to squeeze in one more really quickly. And then I want to be sensitive to the time given all the other calls going on today. Operator : And your final question comes from John Boris with SunTrust. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the results today. One thing that appeared to be really robust in the quarter were obviously JANUVIA, JANUMET sales relative to how we projected them. It just has to do with realized sales and your contracting strategy in the U.S. Have you recently implemented anything on that in the way you're accounting for discounts and rebates? And are you an able to realize a higher level of net sales as a result of anything that you're doing on the accounting on JANUVIA and JANUMET? And then secondly, on ertugliflozin, can you maybe just outline what you view, aside from developing combo pills, as the key points of differentiation relative to the other competitors? And just any thoughts on how you're designing your outcome study that would be required for that product? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Executive VP & President-Global Human Health : So, John, this is Adam. And I want to make sure I'm really clear about JANUVIA. What I look at first is TRx volume growth. And in the United States, we saw 4% TRx volume growth. But we also saw timing of customer buying patterns that caused about $100 million of increased sales in this quarter, and those will come out in the fourth quarter or subsequent quarters. We had increased price last year in the third quarter. And we saw customers draw down their inventories. This year, in the third quarter, we did not increase price. So we saw inventory levels remain at higher levels. And JANUVIA is just a very big product. And a few days of inventory in one direction or another can impact reported sales significantly. So that's why you saw that difference of $100 million from \u2013 versus the prior year. And then with regard to \u2013 and by the way, there's no change in terms of accounting or the rebates or discounts. Those are all consistent. What you're seeing is this timing of when we took price last year versus this year. That's all. It's just, that's why I say to monitor the volume, and we're very pleased with the volume. We feel good about the volume going into fourth quarter and the volume going into 2016. Teri Loxam - Investor Contact : Roger, you want to comment really quickly on... Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, John, with respect to ertugliflozin, what I've said from the very beginning is when we partnered with Pfizer on the drug, this is a drug that has extremely good pharmaceutical properties, and hence, it can be paired easily. It plays nicely with others. And so the most important attribute of the drug is our ability to formulate it together with JANUVIA and develop it in that context. With respect to the outcome studies, the data that are available from EMPA-REG obviously influence the way we think about those outcome studies. And so we're looking at that carefully to ask the question, what do we need to do to ensure the outcome study provides a satisfactory test of whether ertugliflozin also reduces cardiovascular mortality in the way that was seen in EMPA-REG. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So just in closing, this quarter saw very strong performance from key drugs like JANUVIA and KEYTRUDA. We are looking forward to launching in the hepatitis C space and the lung space, and we feel there's good momentum for the business. Take care. Thank you.",

My name is Darla and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Q4 and Full Year 2015 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam : Thank you Darla and good morning everyone. Welcome to Merck\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Today I\u2019m joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we\u2019ve excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation of these items in Table 2 of our press release. We\u2019ve also provided a table to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and products, which can be found in Table 3 of our press release. Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today\u2019s call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2014 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today\u2019s earnings release on merck.com. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Teri. Good morning. Thank you all for joining the call today. 2015 was a year of considerable progress and execution for Merck. We continued to focus on the most exciting scientific and commercial opportunities in front of us, advancing our pipeline, securing new product approvals and launching expanded indications for key products. I\u2019m pleased that our operating performance across our research and commercial organization including vigorous cost management enabled us to exceed our EPS commitment in 2015. Despite strong currency headwinds, we were able to deliver growth in 2015 and we expect to deliver growth again in 2016. In fact, 2016 represents the first year in several years in which Merck\u2019s new product sales growth driven primarily by ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C product and KEYTRUDA are expected to contribute meaningfully above the impact of the products that are losing exclusivity. To ensure continued progress, it is imperative that we remain focused on three priorities : First, we must innovate across all aspects of our business that we can pursue and deliver the most products in medical breakthroughs; second, we must execute in our labs and in markets around the world to deliver results by prioritizing resources for the highest growth areas, key markets and customers; and finally, we must adapt our culture and business model to evolve as the world changes around us. Specifically this includes driving the success of our key in line brands including JANUVIA, launching new indicators for KEYTRUDA in more tumor types, and launching ZEPATIER which received approval from the FDA just last week. We also anticipate several important pipeline catalysts this year, which Roger will discuss in more detail shortly. Augmenting our pipeline with the best scientific and medical innovations also remains a key priority for us. And we are eager to continue to aggressively seek attractive external opportunities that can further bolster our scientific leadership, while complementing the current assets in our pipeline. In closing, in 2016, we will build upon the strong foundation we established last year. We will continue to invest resources to launch and grow our strongest brands; support the most promising internal assets; enhance our pipeline with the best available external science; and maintain our balanced and differentiated portfolio, all with the goal of delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague Rob Davis. Rob Davis : Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. As Ken referenced, 2015 reflected another solid year of operational performance at Merck. We delivered full year revenues of $39.5 billion, which was in the upper part of our original guidance range, despite a slightly higher than expected foreign exchange impact for the year. In addition, as a result of our continued focus on transforming our business model, we were able to deliver full-year non-GAAP EPS of $3.59, $0.12 higher than the upper end of our original 2015 guidance range. We also returned over $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This strong performance was driven by our continued focus on prioritizing resources to our highest growth areas, and reducing net cost by more than $2.5 billion versus 2012, while investing in key in line brands, including JANUVIA, maximizing launches such as KEYTRUDA, and strategically investing in R&D and business development to drive a pipeline that would deliver long-term results. Now, let me turn to some specifics for the fourth quarter, and my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a leveraged P&L with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom line. Total Company revenues were $10.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, including 7 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, fourth quarter revenues grew 4%. It\u2019s worth mentioning that approximately $110 million of our foreign exchange impact on revenues in the quarter was due to a devaluation of our operations in Venezuela where we began using the Simadi rate in the fourth quarter. Given the current and expected conditions in that market, we anticipate continuing to use the Simadi rate for P&L in 2016. In addition, the solid results for Global Human Health in the quarter, which Adam will discuss in a few minutes, the animal health business also had a good quarter with sales growing 8%, excluding exchange. Sales of companion animal products led by BRAVECTO as well as swine products accounted for the majority of the growth. Turning to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. Full year gross margin increased 150 basis points to 75.4%. Lower discards and foreign exchange drove the overall improvement in margin percent. We continued to manage expenses in Q4 with decreases in both marketing and administrative cost as well as R&D as operational efficiencies more than offset our investments supporting key products and new launches. On a full year basis, we delivered operating expenses in line with our guidance with meaningful savings in marketing and administrative expenses more than offsetting modest increases in R&D. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 21.7%. The quarterly and full year rates reflect the benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit. Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter, delivering 13% growth excluding exchange on the bottom line and significant P&L leverage. Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance and our outlook for 2016. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollars against virtually all other currencies, we anticipate foreign exchange will have a meaningful impact again in 2016. We expect revenues to be $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion using mid-January exchange rates, which reflects an approximately 3 percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, we expect low to mid single-digit revenue growth in 2016 as new product launches more than offset the impact from generic and biosimilar competition. Our guidance range also assumes negligible revenues from Venezuela compared to $625 million in the full year 2015. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.60 to $3.75, which also reflects an approximately 4 percentage-point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates. 2016 EPS growth would be in the mid to high single-digits excluding the impact of exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.96 and $2.23. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes 2016 product gross margin will be roughly flat compared to 2015. In addition, we expect operating expenses to be generally in line with prior year. We will continue to invest in direct selling and promotion to support new product launches while reducing administrative expenses, as we continue to focus our operating model. We remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&L and we will monitor our new launches and key products throughout the year in flex resources as appropriate. Regarding tax, we expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range 21.5% to 22.5%, which includes the benefit from the recently renewed R&D tax credit. Finally, we project average diluted shares outstanding of 2.78 billion for 2016, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year as we continue our share repurchase program. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year of execution. We expect this momentum to continue into 2016 as we further innovate in our labs, invest behind our launches and continue our focus on disciplined resource allocation and continuous productivity to deliver a leveraged P&L and shareholder returns. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam. Adam Schechter : Thank you Rob and good morning everyone. This morning I\u2019ll provide highlights on Global Human Health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. My comments will be on constant currency basis. Total sales reached $34.8 billion in 2015, reflecting growth of 4%. In the fourth quarter, sales reached $9 billion and also grew 4%. Excluding Cubis and divestitures, Human Health sales grew was 2% in 2015. Moving now to product and franchise updates, I\u2019ll start with the JANUVIA franchise. The JANUVIA franchise grew 7% in 2015 driven primarily by volume increases. However, in the fourth quarter, U.S. revenue was impacted by a significant reduction in channel inventory, following buy-in that we saw in the third quarter. It\u2019s important to note that underlying volume maintained growth of about 3% in U.S. in the fourth quarter. Despite increased pricing pressure, we expect to grow the JANUVIA franchise in 2016 ex-exchange. We have maintained a high market share of about 75% in the U.S. and 65% globally. Volume increases in the U.S. and internationally, physician and patient experience with our medicine and macro trends that support a growing market, all reinforced our confidence in JANUVIA. Moving to hospital and specialty care. Our hospital acute care business grew 11% in 2015 excluding Cubis. Sales in the fourth quarter reached more than $600 million and grew 7%. Performance was driven by our antibiotic and antifungal treatments as well as by BRIDION in the international markets. In addition, we are currently launching BRIDION in the U.S. While it\u2019s still early, customer feedback is very positive on this new product that uniquely reverses the neuromuscular block following surgery. We are also excited to be launching ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection in the U.S. and Canada. ZEPATIER offers a competitive profile and high cure rates with 12 weeks of therapy for the vast majority of patients in a one pill once today treatment. ZEPATIER is differentiated versus other options including consistent dosing regardless of cirrhosis status, renal impairment or use of PPIs and other acid-reducing agents. We believe our payor and pricing strategy will maximize ZEPATIER revenue and market share, as well as broaden and accelerate patient access. We\u2019re enthusiastic to be backing this important market and our teams are rapidly deploying to capitalize on this opportunity. Moving to vaccines, the vaccines portfolio grew 3% with sales of $5.7 billion in 2015. In the fourth quarter, sales reached approximately $1.7 billion and grew 5% on strong performance for GARDASIL. GARDASIL growth was aided by timing of public sector purchases in the U.S. of about $50 million and timing of government purchases in Brazil in the fourth quarter. GARDASIL 9 now represents approximately 90% of sales in the U.S. as our teams have executed well on converting customers to 9-valent vaccine. ZOSTAVAX sales declined 11% in the fourth quarter, resulting from a very weak flu season in the U.S. We continued to work to educate customers on the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX and to invest in direct to consumer advertising for this important ramp. Finally, I\u2019d like to spend a few moments commenting on the continued launch of KEYTRUDA. In the fourth quarter, sales were approximately $215 million, driving strong full year sales of more than $560 million. Our performance was driven largely by the refractory melanoma indication in the U.S., as well as ongoing launches in more than 40 markets ex-U.S. In late 2015, we received approval in United States for first line treatment of advanced melanoma regardless of BRAF status. The sales force is launching this indication as we speak. Looking into 2016 and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about the portfolio for KEYTRUDA across markets and across cancer types. We are building a critical foundation for PD-L1 testing in lung cancer as we launch in second line. We believe this will help to set the stage for when our first line indication is achieved. We have now demonstrated overall survival benefits [ph] for KEYTRUDA versus standard of care in both lung cancer and melanoma, which strengthens our belief that KEYTRUDA has a potential to become foundational in the treatment of cancer over time. With more than 200 clinical trials and more than 100 combinations in over 32 tumor types, we see the potential to drive significant growth for KEYTRUDA over the long term. In summary, Global Human Health delivered a solid performance in 2015. In 2016, we\u2019ll continue to prioritize resources focusing on JANUVIA, hospital acute care, vaccines and important product launches including ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA. The strength of our underlying business, the continued execution of our strategy, and the launch opportunities before us position us well for the year ahead. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks Adam. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on our progress in key programs during the fourth quarter and will note opportunities for further advancement in 2016. The fourth quarter was an important one for KEYTRUDA. Our U.S. label was updated to include data from our 006 study in melanoma, demonstrating that KEYTRUDA treatment is superior to ipilimumab, the prior standard of care in the first line treatment of advanced melanoma and is judged by improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival. Data from the 002 study in which KEYTRUDA treatment proved superior as judged by progression-free survival to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy was also added to our label. Hence in United States as in Europe, our KEYTRUDA label documents the superior effect of this treatment for advanced melanoma as compared with other interventions. Also in the fourth quarter, we presented data from our KEYNOTE-010 study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA provides superior overall survival as compared with docetaxel treatment in non-small cell lung cancer in patients with PD-L1 expression of 1% or more. This study was presented at the ESMO Asia meeting, simultaneously published in the Lancet and it\u2019s already been included in NCCN guidelines for lung cancer treatment. These data have also been submitted for review in United States and in Europe. Looking ahead for KEYTRUDA, 2016 promises to be a very exciting year. We\u2019ll see data from our KEYNOTE-024 first line non-small cell lung cancer trial comparing treatment with the range of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens to KEYTRUDA monotherapy by mid-year. Primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Our KEYNOTE-055 study, which evaluates response rates in head and neck cancer following KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients who have failed both platinum agents cetuximab, will also provide important new data. Looking still further ahead, there are multiple opportunities for filings in other tumor types including bladder cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma depending upon the results that we observe. As we have noted, the KEYTRUDA development program is exceptionally broad with registration-enabling studies underway in more than a dozen tumor types. We do view KEYTRUDA as providing a foundation for the next generation treatment of malignant disease. Along these lines, we\u2019re also setting combinations with cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, vaccines and other immunomodulatory agents. In 2015, we gained access to a Phase1 CEACAM directed anti-body program, which complements our internal clinical programs that target GITR, IL-10 and many other access. In all we have more than 100 combination studies underway as Adam mentioned. A few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of IOmet, through which we will gain access to a set of IDO1 and TDO1 small molecule antagonists. We previously presented data in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte suggesting that KEYTRUDA may be fruitfully combined with their IDO1 inhibitor. And a Phase 3 study using this agent will soon begin enrolling patients with melanoma. Our acquisition of IOmet will permit us to explore the utility of IDO1 inhibition much more broadly. Last week, we announced the approval of ZEPATIER in the United States. ZEPATIER was the subject of two breakthrough designations and was evaluated promptly by a priority review. A key strength of ZEPATIER is the fact that it can be used without dose adjustment in patients with chronic renal failure, a group that suffers from increased rates of HCV infection. Going forward in 2016, we expect to complete Phase 2b and initiate Phase 3 studies for new regimens that include MK-3682 uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor and MK-8408, a next generation highly active NS5A inhibitor. These programs emphasize our commitment to complete a care of patients HCV infection where the goal should certainly be to cure as many patients as possible using appropriate and effective regimens. Our 2016 plan includes numerous several approvals and filings. As we have announced previously, bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of Clostridium difficile associated enterocolitis received priority review designation from the FDA with PDUFA date in July. In 2016, we expect to complete our Phase 3 program and our filing for ertugliflozin as both agent and in combination JANUVIA. And we will obtain adjudicated data supporting the filing of odanacatib. We\u2019ll have the opportunity to review Phase 3 data from our inactivated varicella-zoster vaccine in immunocompromised populations and from our Phase 3 program studying letermovir as prophylaxis for Cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplant. In collaboration with our colleagues at Bayer, we will begin a Phase 3 heart failure program for vericiguat based on Phase 2 data that we presented last year. And we also have a chance to see important early clinical data from our collaborations with NGM Pharmaceuticals in metabolic disease and from Moderna in the vaccine space. It will be a busy year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Teri. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Roger. We\u2019re going to be moving on to Q&A. We would like to try to get as many questions as possible this morning. So, I\u2019d ask that you try to hold your questions to one or two each. Thanks. Darla, we can go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple for Roger on KEYTRUDA and lung. So, the first question is for the first line data this year. How much do you think the OS data will be and will that matter to regulators sort of competitive landscape? And then, on the 010 study, how much do you think it will play a role when it comes to -- the overall survival data will play a role when it comes to looking at the PD-L1 minimal expressers when you think about kind of that sort testing as a lever going forward, vis-\u00e0-vis competition with Bristol? Thanks a lot. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Geoff, first of all, with respect to first line, the primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival. In these studies, we do permit crossover. It\u2019s really necessary to do that in these studies. And so, you\u2019re really comparing the early versus late access to KEYTRUDA. That\u2019s understood, progression-free survival is an accepted endpoint. So, I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be with respect to first line. And with respect to the 010 study, not sure exactly what you mean by PD-L1 minimal expressers, and what we showed in the 010 study of course was that there was a treatment effect in the 1% expressers as well as in the high expressers. We have noted that in PD-L1 negative populations with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, it\u2019s not at all clear that there is a benefit that inures to patients who receive PD-1 directed therapy. And that\u2019s true for every agent that\u2019s been studied, not just our own agent. So I think it is important to be looking at PD-L1 expression in order to decide who in fact should be treated with these agents. Adam may have some other thoughts about the PD-L1 expression in the second line. Adam Schechter : The only thing I\u2019d add Geoff is that if you look at reimbursement broadly in the U.S. right now we\u2019re being reimbursed for PD-L1 positive. So, it\u2019s irrespective of its\u2019 1% or above 50% for the vast majority of the plan, so we\u2019re seeing reimbursement already for anybody that shows up as PD-L1 positive. Teri Loxam : Next question please, Darla? Operator : It\u2019s from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Tim Anderson : A question on ZEPATIER, payers and your competitors in the space talk about long-term contracting. Knowing where your net pricing is coming in or at least I think know where it\u2019s coming in and knowing the positioning of the product which has some reasonable attributes, can you just talk about what we should expect in 2016 -- consensus has around 600 million. I know you don\u2019t guide on individual products normally. But give us some guidance here if you can, especially in the context of trying to bump what could be of high prevalence of long-term contracts? Second question on 4-1BB, Pfizer made some positive comments yesterday. One of the products they\u2019ve been setting with is your drug KEYTRUDA. But I am wondering about the longevity of that deal and whether they could kick you to the curb, potentially now that they have their own PD-L1? And then just a very quick question; does KEYNOTE-24 have an interim analysis? Bristol\u2019s first line trial does not. Teri Loxam : Adam, why don\u2019t we start with you on ZEPATIER and then we can move to Roger for the other two? Adam Schechter : Sure, Teri. And let me give you some context, and then I\u2019ll try to answer the question specifically on how we\u2019re thinking about the pricing reimbursement contracting strategy. But first of all, I agree with your comment that we do have a competitive product. And we have high cure rates. And if you look at our clinical trials in GT1 patients, it was 94% to 97%. If you look at GT4 patients, it\u2019s 97% to 100%. So, we start off by showing we have very good efficacy with the product. I also believe we have some important differentiation with the product, right? Our dosing is not affected by the presence of compensated cirrhosis. If you look at the competition, they have to change their dose there. You can use us with any degree of renal impairment. If you look at the competition, particularly in certain patients with renal impairment, they can\u2019t be used there. And also, you don\u2019t have to adjust our dose for acid-reducing agents such as PPI. So, I think those are some things we feel good about in terms of differentiating our product versus the competition in the marketplace. I think what we did was develop a real deliberate and I believe innovative pricing strategy to try to maximize the product and increase the number of appropriate patients treated. But the first thing I want to say is we want to be competitive across all segments, and we want to look at public, private, we want to work with managed care organizations and government agencies et cetera, et cetera. So we plan to be competitive across all segments. And I believe that the strategy that we implemented could accelerate access to patients in certain segments where access frankly has not been as broad to-date, including those patients with medical needs in stage 4 and 5 CKD. So, I\u2019d just say, we don\u2019t give guidance for individual products, but we will provide updates as we go through the year. We\u2019re just launching right now the products not available in the marketplace yet but it will be in a matter of days. And then, I\u2019ll provide updates as we go through the year to give you a sense of where we are. Teri Loxam : Great. And Roger, do you want to address the 4-1BB and KEYNOTE-024 interim? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Right. Tim, so on 4-1BB, just first in context, as you know this is just a huge number of combinations that potentially can be studied. We\u2019re studying 100 and 4-1BB is one of those. The expectation is that we\u2019re going to see a lot of opportunities to combine KEYTRUDA with other drugs; we\u2019re already seeing those and have talked about them. For example, in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, with immunization with TVEC, the oncolytic virus, and of course we\u2019re doing our own studies with other checkpoint inhibitors and other immunogens. We\u2019re very pleased with other collaboration with Pfizer on 4-1BB. I believe that plan is assuming that it\u2019s accepted to be able to present some of those data at ASCO. And our expectation is that if it turns out that there is a good opportunity there that we\u2019ll continue to collaborate. So, I\u2019m not really terribly concerned about not being able to take advantage of an important opportunity to help patients. With respect to KEYNOTE-024, the study is of course being continuously monitored by data monitoring committee. But importantly, I mean here we are in February, clinicaltrials.gov I think has the end of June. So, we\u2019re getting close to the end of the study anyway. And my expectation is that we\u2019ll have the opportunity to see the data in too long time and can use that as a basis -- potentially assuming the data come up correctly, as a basis for filing. Teri Loxam : Thanks Roger. Next question please? Operator : It\u2019s from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you very much. Ken, the first question is for you. At our CEO conference, probably the last month, you talked about your increasing desire to be more aggressive with M&A, now that you have a strong scientific team on-board, thanks to Roger? Given the fairly significant de-rating of the biotech space since that conference, I would think you are absolutely licking your chops. Can you talk about the M&A landscape? And most importantly, when you think the buyers and sellers start to come together? And then a question for you, Roger -- I think to Roger. It\u2019s again on KEYTRUDA and the first-line study. Can you say the opportunity? How large is the highest PD-L1 expressers in the front-line lung market? And when we will see the study that targets the entire PD-L1 patient population in front-line lung? Thanks very much. Ken Frazier : Thanks Jami. Let me start by just reiterating what I said before. The business development remains a critical part of our strategy because we need to pay both our internal growth with the best external innovation opportunities and we\u2019re looking to augment our Phase 2 as well as our early stage pipeline with these kinds of partnerships and collaborations and bolt-on acquisition. As it relates to re-rating of the biotech industry, of course we\u2019re very focused on value creating opportunities. Our team has looked at this very carefully and we are very active in looking for opportunities in oncology and other therapeutic areas where we can build our pipeline. So, I can just assure you that we paid attention to what\u2019s happened in the marketplace and we are looking very actively to reach the right kinds of deals whether they\u2019re M&A or partnership with collaborations to advance on pipeline. Jami Rubin : Great. Roger, do you want to\u2026 Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Jami, on the first-line opportunity size, just to remind you and everyone that our approach has been to ask the question of whether or not we can identify populations that would benefit especially from the treatment of KEYTRUDA. And we chose to use the PD-L1 expression as a marker for that. It\u2019s turned out that that is a marker. And the reason of course is not because specifically the PD-L1 is the counter ligand for PD-1, but rather because PD-L1 is a marker for the presence of an immune response and that PD-L1, as a result is telling us that there already is the pre-existing immune response that can be enhanced by the addition of KEYTRUDA. The 024 study looks at those that are PD-L1 high. And what we\u2019ve done in all of our studies is that we have looked at the PD-L1 high, those with the proportion scores above 50% and then looked at those that are expressing PD-L1 above 1% and also looked at that those that appeared not to be expressing PD-L1 as we move across the line. So for example and we published in the New England Journal that there was in general, in general terms in the 001 study in melanoma, in general that those patients who are expressing more PD-L1 had better responses. We similarly published data in 010-study recently, showing that responses were better in the highest in the PD-L1 expressers, again reflecting immune status. The 024 study looks at those that have the highest PD-L1 expression with about 25% of the first-line patient population. The 042 study will go on and look at patients who have the 1% cut point. And we\u2019ll begin to see the data across the entire first-line. So, we\u2019ll have an opportunity to look at that. Frankly, from a biological perspective, I really can\u2019t understand why would be any difference in the first-line population from what we\u2019ve previously shown in other tumor populations because again PD-L1 is a expression reflection of immune activity. Teri Loxam : Thanks Roger. Next question please, Darla. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here, first, can you elaborate on JANUVIA sales in the quarter? I guess how much the destocking impact results? And maybe more broadly, just latest thoughts on the SGLT2 impact on DPP-4 classes, as you talk about growing JANUVIA in 2016? And then a follow-up on HCV, can you just comment specifically on how much you see price driving share and broader adoption of these agents in the space? I think just a lot of focus on how the price dynamics play out here, no specific comments but just generally speaking, do you see price as a lever that is relevant [ph] to the space going forward for you guys? Thanks. Adam Schechter : Hi Chris, this is Adam. Let me start with the JANUVIA franchise. So, I think it\u2019s important to give some additional context. So, I want to start by saying we\u2019re really pleased that JANUVIA grew 7% in 2015. And if you look at our underlying performance in fourth quarter, it was similar to the other quarters in the year. What you saw on fourth quarter was volume growth in the U.S. of about 3%, which was about the same as what you saw the quarter before and so forth. What happened was there was significant channel reductions that followed the third quarter buy-in which I noted on the last call was more than $100 million. And as you may recall, last quarter the U.S. grew 22% for JANUVIA and that\u2019s why I noted that there was buy-in and we would expect to see buy out. So when you look at fourth quarter, I would look at the underlying performance, which remains similar to the other quarters. And I think we have a good year with JANUVIA, showing 7% growth versus prior. When you look at 2016, despite increasing pricing pressure that we\u2019ll see in the United States and the biannual price declines that you see in Japan, we expect to grow the franchise globally when you exclude exchange. And what that means with regard to EMPA-REG, we don\u2019t see a significant impact in 2016. In fact, if you look at the earliest data that you can look at, we\u2019re seeing market share shifts within the SGLT2 class but we\u2019re not seeing shifts between classes, between DPP-4s and SGLT2s. We\u2019ll continue to monitor that closely. We\u2019ll see when there is label changes or if there is potential guideline changes. But at this point in time, we feel confident that there should not be a significant impact in 2016 from the SGLT2 class. So, let me answer your question on ZEPATIER. And I already stated that we think that we have a competitive product profile and that\u2019s where it all starts. You have to have a competitive product profile to be successful in the marketplace. Our efficacy is good. We think we have strong differentiation versus the competitors. So, price is always a lever that you can choose to utilize, but you don\u2019t necessarily have to utilize it nearly as much when you have a differentiated product that you think you can bring to market. So, we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on ZEPATIER, as we move forward. But we\u2019re going to do everything we can to optimize or maximize that brand. Teri Loxam : Thanks Adam. Darla, let\u2019s go to the next question please. Operator : It\u2019s from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : First for Rob. It looks like you\u2019re guiding to a currency effect on the bottom line that\u2019s more extreme than the top line \u201816. So, can you just help us understand that relationship for \u201816 and for Merck in general, and comment on what share count you\u2019re factoring in to guidance for the year? And then for Ken, going back to the aggressive deal strategy described. What are your latest thoughts on, on deals like the Cubis deal and whether those are the kinds of deals you\u2019re looking as sprinkle in [ph] as well? It sounds like you have a scientific and pipeline focus, but what about deals that sort of leverage or build out certain commercial verticals you have and whether you do those deals again? Thanks. Rob Davis : This is Rob. Good morning, Gregg. So, on your question, we are seeing a little bit more pressure to earnings when we earn sales from foreign currency. The biggest single driver of that is really how our hedging is flowing through on a year-on-year basis. Recall that in 2015, we flagged in prior quarters that we have received a meaningful benefit from hedge gains, as a result of the positions we took. And that benefit declined as you look from \u201815 into \u201816, assuming constant rates basically because of the fact that why those hedges are in place and the gains on them are smaller. So that impact does cause a little bit more of the leveraging effect you\u2019re seeing between the top and the bottom line. Other than that, we generally see a proportional move between sales and earnings, but that\u2019s the biggest single driver. And then to your question of what we\u2019re looking out from a share count, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re assuming 2.78 billion shares as an average for 2016, which is a reduction from where we were in \u201815. Ken Frazier : And Gregg, thanks for the question on M&A. Let me start by saying that the Cubis deal actually has been a good deal for us, as you can see from this year\u2019s results. It also positions us well in the antibiotic space, a space that\u2019s a priority space for us going forward from that standpoint. But I also want to reiterate what I\u2019ve said, which is our main focus going forward will be to augment our Phase 2 in early stage pipeline. So, our focus is on getting the best external science because we believe that\u2019s how we could drive the greatest long term value. So, I would say going forward, our main focus will be more on those kinds of scientific acquisition deals than on things that augment necessarily our commercial table. Teri Loxam : Thanks Ken. Let\u2019s go to next question please Darla. Operator : It\u2019s from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez : So, just a couple of quick questions. Ken, as I just listened to your comments, one of the things that I am trying to better understand is, can you give us a little bit of the history of stage 2 and earlier stage deals where Merck has successfully brought forward a product like that into development? When I look at the deal history, Schering-Plough is really one of the acquisitions that was quite successful with regard to gaining access to KEYTRUDA, having your base inhibitor advance forward. Can you just help me understand why the smaller acquisitions are really a way to go? Obviously you guys -- and identified those assets, but it actually came from a larger deal and was clearly value generating. And then separately for Roger. Roger, where I\u2019m a little perplexed on the timing, if I look at the development of the front-line lung situation, it seems like studies that finished faster in immuno-oncology consistently show a less robust results. So, can you help me understand how the KEYNOTE-024 study has an opportunity to successfully complete earlier than expected and before some of the other competitor studies that are out there? And then my final question just for Adam. When you look at -- I think you guys have been really respectful, basically not saying that you\u2019re going to win, but that you will have a foundational product in KEYTRUDA. When other competitors claim and they\u2019re going to win particularly from a third or fourth or fifth position, how likely is it given what you\u2019ve seen historically that that is a realistic possibility, particularly in a space were new standards-of-care are being created? Thanks. Ken Frazier : Let me first start with your first question Seamus, which is sort of a perspective on how early stage deals have created value for Merck. And I will start by saying that at Merck we\u2019ve always been focused on being a company that tries to develop really strong insight to human biology, and that has helped us to find things earlier on that have actually become important. So, some examples are FOSAMAX, which was licensed in or COZAAR. In my own experience when I was on the legal side, the work that we did to get access to the DPP-4 technology through a German company called Probiodrug, when those deals were done, people don\u2019t necessarily sit up and take notice of that, but JANUVIA was the result of that deal, which was done a number of years ago. And so what we have found in the past is the best way for us to create value is do those insights early on that allow us to acquire the kinds of things that you heard Roger talk about NGM and Moderna. Our goal is to find those kinds of things before there is a bidding war to apply our scientific knowhow, our development knowhow, our molecular -- I\u2019m sorry our medicinal chemistry knowhow and to bring forward the kinds of molecules like sitagliptin that can actually be pretty important contributions to human health. Adam Schechter : So with regard to KEYTRUDA, I\u2019ll answer your question next. I\u2019ve always said that I believe that this market is going to be a very large market and that there is room for multiple competitors. I also believe that there will be certain competitors that do really well in one tumor type and another competitor might get it in a different tumor type first. And therefore you\u2019ll see differences based upon tumor type. It\u2019s not too different if you look at the anti-TNF field where you have multiple products, one might be better in GI, the other might do better in rheumatoid arthritis but they all tend to do very well and grow very fast. At the same time, I believe building a wall of data is important. And when you look at the size and the magnitude of our clinical trials and when you look at the number of tumor types that we\u2019re studying, I think we\u2019re going to be in a very good position over the long-term. And it\u2019s hard to think about late entrants coming in and having a strong position, once you have that wall of data built. So, I think the strategy that we put in place is the right strategy over time. And I think over time, you\u2019ll see us in a leadership position. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Seamus, I\u2019m not sure exactly what you mean by faster studies giving less robust results. Just to outline again what our strategy with respect to -- broadly with respect to these tumor types, as I mentioned in response to Jami Rubin\u2019s question is that we\u2019ve gone in said let\u2019s look at the patient populations in which we expect to see the best results and those are the PD-L1 highs in the current formulations. It\u2019s not the only biomarker that we have; in fact we\u2019ve evolved other better biomarkers we believe, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s useful. In those patient populations because higher percentage of the treated patients in principal should respond, the result will be faster, but it shouldn\u2019t be less robust. In fact, in many cases, it would be more robust simply in terms of the efficacy window. So that\u2019s the basis for why the 024 study which is reading out in mid-year has a good chance of succeeding. We don\u2019t know what the data are, but we\u2019re eager to see the data and PFS. And thereafter, the populations will broaden through 042 and through a whole variety of other studies that we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the general strategy. And I think it\u2019s a good one, because it focuses on those patients who need these therapies most. Teri Loxam : Thanks Roger. Next question please Darla. Operator : It\u2019s from Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Couple of questions, please. First Roger, some of your competitors are beginning to make investments in cancer antigen vaccine platforms to address the nonimmunogenic tumor subsets which are obviously sizable. I am unaware that Merck has such a collaboration right now. Obviously it involves logistical complexities [indiscernible] off the shelf solution might share a point. I\u2019m interested in your appetite moving to that strategy? And then second question for Ken, obviously pharma has been positioned as a rogue [ph] industry in light of the pricing issues within the U.S. To what extent do you think some of the negative attention on reimbursements spill over into other areas? I noticed an uptick in investigations from the DoJ, the SEC the HHS. Do you see any additional risk there for the industry as a functional scrutiny, almost certainly driven by political focus? Thank you. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Andrew with respect to neoantigen vaccine strategies, again this is -- conceptually the idea is okay, we\u2019ve introduced checkpoint inhibitors now and we can get good responses in a significant percentage of patients, but in a large number of patients, on more than half, we actually don\u2019t see a response. So, why don\u2019t we see a response in those patients? And one possibility certainly is that there isn\u2019t enough pre-existing immune response. And if we could stimulate that through as you say in neoantigen vaccine, things might go better. We\u2019re interested in those kinds of strategies. We of course have used other vaccination strategies. I point out again the oncolytic virus strategy which appears to have some traction. And we are looking at the question of whether or not it\u2019s possible to use neoantigens. And one of the issues is as I am sure you realized that introducing bespoke therapy where each patient receives neoantigen cocktail will be very challenging from an industry perspective. So, we\u2019re looking for those situations where there might be groups of neoantigen s that could be used and would but able to improve responses in a large set of patients. Ken Frazier : With respect to the political and regulatory and legal issues around pricing pressures, obviously the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients is a significant one; it\u2019s the challenge that we have in the society. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that that debate is being amplified and in some ways distorted by some of the political rhetoric, especially having to do with the presidential election cycle. So from a pharma standpoint, as Chairman of pharma, we continue to work, educate constituents in Washington DC and around the country on how pharmaceuticals actually help reduce cost in the overall healthcare system as well as the impact that they have on individuals as well. Now, reality of the world is as we\u2019ve seen when there are these headlines, you tend to get congressional hearing and you tend to have state attorneys generals writing letters and things of that nature. And I take those things very seriously but I also think that the most important thing that we can do as an industry is to continue to price our products consistent with the value that they provide to our customers and to continue to try to educate again people about the long-term positive impact that appropriate use of pharmaceuticals has on overall healthcare costs. Tori Loxam : Thanks Ken. Next question please. Operator : It\u2019s from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Tony Butler : A couple of brief questions for Roger, one is, interesting BD solution with IOmet, given some early data that you presented at CTSI on melanoma. But the real question is do you actually have data in house that an IDO and/or keto inhibitor in combination with KEYTRUDA would have utility in tumors outside of melanoma? Second question is around GITR, what we see KEYTRUDA, GITR combos this calendar year at clinical meeting. Ad forgive me Teri. But Adam quickly on REMICADE non-U.S., do you actually have countries which are actively switching patients onto the biosimilar today, or is that simply a new patients who go on an anti-TNF inhibitor? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Tony, so with respect to the question of whether IDO1 inhibitor data exists outside of melanoma, we have a lot of data that we generated in combination with Incyte. In order to really know whether you have evidence for combined efficacy, you\u2019d have to have detailed really comparisons between monotherapy versus combination therapy. And those kinds of data don\u2019t exist really anywhere. Those really have to be done in robust Phase 2 or certainly Phase 3 studies. And we\u2019re moving forward with that. But we\u2019re interested in pursuing the field in more detail. And in order to do that, we really need to have access to a whole range of different compounds. And that\u2019s really what drove the IOmet deal. We\u2019re pleased with our interaction with Incyte but we need to be able to look at a broader range of starting materials. And for the GITR data, we are doing combination studies right now, GITR in combination with KEYTRUDA. Depending on who enrolment goes and how much data we have, we hope to be able to present some of that data this year. Adam Schechter : With regard to the question on REMICADE, if you look at share by volume, we had about 85% share in the fourth quarter. That came down from about 90% share that we had the quarter before. So, we\u2019re definitely seeing biosimilar business wins for new patients. And the percent of new patient is going to only grow over time. So right now about 10% to 20% of the business per year is new patients. We are seeing substitution of existing patients in some smaller markets, such as the Nordics. At this point in time, we\u2019re not seeing it in the larger markets. But we continue to anticipate that the impacts of biosimilars is going to accelerate as we go into 2016, as there is more and more new patients coming into the market and they become a larger percent of the sales. Teri Loxam : Next question please Darla. Operator : It\u2019s from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Roger, on the KEYTRUDA 024 first line study and forgive my ignorance on this. But can you provide the rational why PFS was selected as a primary endpoint given that it has not been a reliable endpoint with anti-PD1s in general? Basically I\u2019m trying to assess the risk for this trial. Could we see a situation where PFS is not significant, but overall survival is eventually significant, which would actually be similar to what we\u2019ve seen in more advanced setting? And the follow-up for Rob. What\u2019s driving the 14% FX headwind in animal health? Obviously it\u2019s more significant than what you\u2019re experiencing overall and that\u2019s solid [ph] operational growth. Is this mostly Venezuela and when can we expect this to moderate? Thank you. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Alex, it\u2019s Roger. On the PFS endpoint, if you look at the 010 study, I think that\u2019s a good model for you to look at, because you look at overall survival and you look at PFS. The PFS hazard ratio is really excellent. And you can see the progression free survival for both doses and for PD-L1 high as well as PD-L1 1% populations. So again, I don\u2019t really see why first-line should look any different from second-line in that kind of setting and we should therefore be able to see a PFS signal. And you can do the power calculations based on the hazard ratio of less than 0.6 that we saw in that study. So that looks pretty good. And if you can\u2019t know until you do the study but that\u2019s really what it all look like, I think. Teri Loxam : Next question please. Sorry. Rob Davis : Alex, the other part of your question on the animal health. The reason you see a higher FX impact in animal health is predominantly due to the fact that the sales of animal health relative to our human health business are even more weighted outside of United States, pretty significantly outside of United States. So, it\u2019s really just a proportion of the sales coming from markets exposed to currency more than anything else. Venezuela did have a nominal impact on animal health, but it\u2019s not the driver, it\u2019s just general trends across all currencies. Teri Loxam : Thanks. Next question? Operator : It\u2019s from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : So, with respect to hepatitis C, could you please talk a little bit more about your list pricing decision relative to the competition and how the market should think about discounting? Obviously there is a lot of speculation, so it would be good for you to help frame these topics, so that people understand your perspective on the list pricing and discounting? And then second, with respect to odanacatib, investor expectations are very low for this drug. Roger, I was just hoping that you could share your level of enthusiasm for this drug to be approved and have a successful launch? Thank you. Adam Schechter : Hi Dave, this is Adam. So, let me start with ZEPATIER. I always think it\u2019s important to remind everyone that we have a competitive product profile and it all starts with having a competitive product profile. And I think we potentially even have some areas of differentiation that could be important. In addition to that, I think we\u2019ve developed a great pricing strategy that\u2019s going to help ZEPATIER be successful in the marketplace. What we did was we priced our list price to be competitive where the market\u2019s current net prices are. And our list price makes us competitive across all segments. And I think it could potentially help I think some currently underserved segments. I think also lower list prices could potentially have a positive impact on out-of-pocket medication costs for some patients. There is some patients in part D, where the list price does matter in terms of the out-of-pocket cost. And I think it could be beneficial for us there. I wouldn\u2019t read into our discounting strategy based upon our initial pricing strategy. What we intend to do is to compete in all segments of the market and to have an appropriate discounting strategy that allows us to have access. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : And Dave, it\u2019s Roger on odanacatib. Back in May of 2014, I talked about odanacatib because we had the early results memo available for the Phase 3 study and noted that odanacatib had hit the three critical endpoints in osteoporosis process, namely reduced vertebral fractures, non-vertebral fractures and it reduced factures at hip. And I said at the time that the benefit risk profile for odanacatib appeared favorable. And so, it\u2019s a novel oral therapy that does what it\u2019s supposed to do in terms of reducing fractures. Actually quite dramatically, quite impressively in terms of clinical vertebral fractures, it\u2019s really the best that I\u2019ve seen and I\u2019ve been doing this for a while. So it looks really quite good. One of the things that we pointed out when we presented these data at the end of 2014 was that there was a larger than usual discrepancy in adverse experience reporting for investigators versus central review. And in order to resolve that problem, we undertook an adjudication process. And adjudication process has taken much longer than we imagined. We worked with FDA to find that process and we\u2019ve worked with an external organization to go through it; it took all of last year. We are nearly done. We want to get these data in and have the opportunity to file it. But I don\u2019t think there is any question that odanacatib does what it\u2019s supposed to do, we just want to see those data pull together. Teri Loxam : Thanks Roger. Darla, we\u2019re going to try to get in two really quick ones, if we can. Operator : Your next question come is from Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : I wanted to talk a little bit about your BELSOMRA launch. Scripts are doing fine; we are curious about the performance though above and below your expectations at this point. And really quick, is there anything in the pipeline that investors are ignoring? Adam Schechter : With regard to BELSOMRA, I think we started off with a really good launch and we had nice growth. It has flattened a little bit. We ran direct to consumer advertising and we saw an increase again in TRx volume. We\u2019ve since seen it flatten a bit and we\u2019re working right now on augmenting our digital capabilities and our online capabilities. At the same time, we\u2019re working with physicians to understand that 10 milligrams which is the start dose isn\u2019t effective that they should titrate the patient to 20 milligrams. So, I would say that we were off to a good start. I am not pleased it\u2019s currently flat at this point in time, but we\u2019re working on that. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : And Mark with respect to the pipeline, your colleagues are always telling me that based on our current share price, it appears that the pipeline is being completely ignored because there is almost no value that is ascribed to it. And it surprises them that here we have a really major effort in Alzheimer\u2019s for example and don\u2019t get an enormous amount of credit for that. When you check through all of those Phase 3 opportunities, some of which I mentioned that are coming forward as well as the large number of Phase 2 programs in the early space, and I could go through them one after another. I think we\u2019ve got an enormous opportunity here and would love to have the opportunity to talk about in more detail. Teri Loxan : Thanks Roger. I think unfortunately we\u2019re out of time. So, I am going to just turn it over to Ken for some final comments. Ken Frazier : Okay. Well, again thank you for joining us this morning. We\u2019re pleased with the growth that we saw through continued execution in our key areas including, diabetes. We\u2019re looking forward to additional growth. I think if you look at our 2016 guidance ex-FX, you see we expect to grow low to mid single digits. I think it\u2019s important to look at our EPS also. We continue to be very vigorous in our cost reductions and we are able to provide guidance here that again will allow us ex-FX to grow mid to high single digits. So we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re back in a growth mode. And we\u2019re very excited to have opportunities to launch important products like ZEPATIER and KEYTRUDA. So, thank you for your attention this morning. We look forward to talking to you in the future. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Merck's Q1 2016 sales and earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2016 conference call. Today I'm joined by : Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out a couple of items. First, you will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation of these items in Table 2 of our press release. We've also provided a table to help you understand the sales results in the quarter for the business units and products, which can be found on Table 3 of our press release. Second, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current belief of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2015 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on Merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Teri. Good morning. Thank you all for joining the call today. We're off to a good start this year with our first quarter performance. Our KEYTRUDA program expanded as we continued to launch this important cancer medicine around the world. Also in the first quarter, we launched our new hepatitis C medicine, ZEPATIER. In addition to the ongoing product launches, our key inline brands performed well, particularly JANUVIA, which continues to command predominant share within the DPP-4 class. Adam will provide context on this shortly. We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. To do so, we will stay true to our goal of becoming the premier research intensive global biopharmaceutical company, bringing forward medically important products that address many of the world's greatest health needs. And above all, it is critical that we do this in a sustainable manner that enables us to continuously reinvest in R&D. Business development remains one of our most important priorities, and we are very actively engaged in finding the best external innovation that will help grow our portfolio and pipeline. We are confident that our scientific discernment coupled with financial discipline will allow us to identify and acquire the right assets at the right valuation to create long-term value for shareholders, consistent with our innovation strategy. Before I conclude, let me also emphasize that we are fully engaged in the challenging policy environment that our industry experiences now. We are actively addressing the key policy issues that can have an impact on our ability to fund the discovery and development of the next generation of innovative and differentiated medicines and vaccines, most notably pricing and tax reform in the United States. We are engaging key stakeholders in the healthcare environment to seek constructive solutions and to ensure that they understand the therapeutic and economic value Merck's products and business operations provide. In closing, we remain committed to our innovation strategy and our focus on advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline, both through internal and external means, as well as driving marketplace success with our launches and key inline brands. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the first quarter reflects our focus on execution and continued productivity improvements. We again delivered P&L leverage, with growth excluding exchange on both the top and bottom lines. Total company revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1% year over year. Excluding the impact of exchange, first quarter revenues grew 3%, driven by both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses. Venezuela negatively impacted Q1 revenues by approximately $240 million, reflecting the reduction of our operations in the country. As a reminder, we recorded $625 million of sales in Venezuela in 2015, which were more weighted to the first half of the year, so the year-over-year impact will be greatest in the first two quarters of this year. Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 77% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015. Lower discards were the biggest driver of the year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $3.9 billion was 3% lower year over year, but roughly flat excluding foreign exchange favorability. Higher promotional spend behind our new products drove a slight increase in marketing and administrative, while lower licensing expenses contributed to a decline in research and development. Taken together, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter, delivering 10% growth excluding exchange, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering a leveraged P&L. Turning now to our outlook for the rest of the year, we are narrowing and raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2016. While we are experiencing more favorable exchange rates versus our original guidance, we are facing a few headwinds, in particular, the entry of generic NASONEX in the United States earlier than originally assumed, which we expect will partially offset the exchange rate favorability this year. We now expect full-year 2016 revenues to be between $39 billion and $40.2 billion. This reflects an approximately 2% negative impact in foreign currency at mid-April rates. We continue to expect our non-GAAP 2016 product gross margin and operating expenses to be roughly in line with 2015, and we still anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate for the full year to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. In terms of our 2016 EPS outlook, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $3.65 to $3.77. This reflects an approximately two percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates. To summarize, we demonstrated strong performance, leveraging top line growth to deliver 10% growth in non-GAAP EPS excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We benefited from the contribution of new product launches while continuing to sustain growth in our key franchises and driving operational improvements across the company. With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the Global Human Health performance for the first quarter, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. We are off to a solid start to the year. Total Human Health sales reached $8.1 billion, growing 2%. And we drove growth across our core areas of diabetes, vaccines, hospital specialty care, and oncology. What I'll do now is highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with primary care. The JANUVIA franchise had a strong quarter, growing 4% globally. In the United States, sales grew 9%, driven primarily by volume increases and some benefit from customer buying patterns. Outside of the U.S., we saw strong growth in Europe and Japan, offset by emerging markets, which was impacted by Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, JANUVIA franchise sales grew 5% outside of the U.S. First quarter results for JANUVIA demonstrate that we can continue to grow volume and maintain strong market share of about 75% in the United States and 65% globally. We continue to expect global JANUVIA franchise growth ex-exchange in 2016. Now I'll move on to our vaccine business. Sales of our vaccine portfolio grew 1% and reached about $1.3 billion, on steady growth from GARDASIL and pediatric vaccines, partially offset by declines in our adult shingles vaccine, ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX sales declined in the first quarter, resulting from a weaker flu season in the U.S., which means that less people go to get vaccinated in general, but also the recent changes to ACIP [Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices] recommendations for pneumococcal vaccines. We are actively working with customers to help them navigate the reimbursement for ZOSTAVAX, and expect this to be less of a hurdle over time. Global GARDASIL franchise sales grew this quarter, on continued strength from GARDASIL 9 launch in the U.S. We are encouraged by the recent CDC publication that reported a significant decrease in vaccine-type HPV prevalence since the introduction of HPV vaccination in the United States. The reduction was 64% in females age 14 to 19 and 34% in females age 20 to 24. If you consider that this report shows an impact only through 2012 and does not yet include males, it becomes apparent that we really can make a difference to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in the United States. Next in hospital and specialty care, our acute care portfolio performed well in the quarter on steady growth from antibiotics, antifungals, and BRIDION. We are also pleased to be adding to our specialty care business with the launch of ZEPATIER. Sales in the first quarter were $50 million. While we're still early in the launch, we are seeing positive signs that ZEPATIER will play an important role in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Our team is working to secure access for ZEPATIER, with conversations currently ongoing with many different public and private payers. The addition of ZEPATIER to the formulary at the Veterans Administration and with other customers reinforces our belief that our payer and our pricing strategy will maximize revenue and market share, and it will also broaden and accelerate patient access. Customers value ZEPATIER's profile, which offers high cure rates across a diverse group of patients, and we continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunity for ZEPATIER. Finally in oncology, we see significant potential for KEYTRUDA, which positions us as a global leader in immuno-oncology. In the first quarter, sales reached approximately $250 million, and they continue to be driven by our melanoma indications as well as early traction in the U.S. in lung cancer. We are working to integrate PD-L1 testing as part of the routine treatment of lung cancer by continuing to demonstrate the value testing brings to physicians, to payers, and to patients. Testing rates in the United States continue to increase, which is important not only for our second-line indication, but we believe also for when we have a first-line indication. We also see very strong performance outside of the U.S., which represented nearly half of first quarter KEYTRUDA sales. We are launching in melanoma in approximately 50 markets globally, and in some markets we are the market leader despite being second to launch. Given the strong survival results we've demonstrated in melanoma and second-line lung cancer, the early data we've seen in more than 20 cancer types, as well as the breadth and the depth of KEYTRUDA's development program, we remain confident that KEYTRUDA will become foundational to the treatment of cancer over time. In closing, we're off to a good start in 2016. This year we'll have to offset generic penetration of products including NASONEX and CUBICIN. However, our investments in JANUVIA, in KEYTRUDA, and in ZEPATIER and other core areas are delivering results and positioning us for future growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Thanks, Adam. The momentum that our clinical development and regulatory groups established last year continues in 2016. I'll briefly review the highlights of the first quarter. As has already been mentioned, beginning in January we obtained regulatory approval for ZEPATIER in Canada, the United States, and Switzerland. In speaking with hepatologists and infectious disease specialists, there's general enthusiasm for the high cure rates observed with ZEPATIER and the ability to use ZEPATIER in patients with compromised renal function, including patients undergoing hemodialysis. Public health organizations are increasingly embracing a goal of large-scale elimination of hepatitis C infection. And we have been developing data, some of which we presented at the Liver meetings in Barcelona last month, documenting the ability of ZEPATIER to assist in this process, including in very difficult to treat patients who suffer from opioid addiction. As Adam indicated, we have successfully launched ZEPATIER in the United States and are seeking approval in many markets around the world. In the course of our European review for ZEPATIER, the European Medicines Agency cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues largely related to inadequate record keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management systems. We're working assiduously with regulators to resolve these issues. I should note that we do not believe that the problems identified at our third-party manufacturer affect the safety, efficacy, or quality specifications of the product, and we do not believe that these problems will affect the supply to the U.S. market. Nevertheless, we take all matters related to good manufacturing practices very seriously, and we're working with regulatory agencies and the manufacturer to resolve these issues as expeditiously as possible. We continue to believe that EU approval can be achieved according to the midyear timeline that we previously disclosed. However, our European launch will be delayed until the fourth quarter or perhaps until the end of the first quarter of 2017, depending on how quickly these matters can be resolved. While the registration process with ZEPATIER continues, we are also completing Phase 2b studies of MK-3682, our uridinal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, when used in combination with ZEPATIER or in combination with another advanced NS5A inhibitor, MK-8408. Data from these studies which will emerge over the next few months will permit definitive selection of the appropriate registration-enabling regimens that will provide additional options for the estimated 150 million people around the world who are infected with the hepatitis C virus. During the first quarter, our studies of KEYTRUDA also advanced significantly. In April, we announced that the FDA has accepted our filing on a Priority Review basis for the use of KEYTRUDA in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer following platinum-based chemotherapy, with a PDUFA date in early August. This filing makes use of the unit dosing of 200 milligrams every three weeks. We have shown that this dose yields exposures comparable to those observed using weight-based dosing, and unit dosing obviously relieves providers of the responsibility of calculating patient-specific dose volumes. Our head and neck cancer filing is reinforced by an exceptionally broad array of ongoing studies in this disease, including a controlled second-line study, the KEYNOTE-040 study, and our first-line study, KEYNOTE-048, which will provide data in 2017. We're also testing the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with irradiation, with radiation plus chemotherapy with the TVEC oncolytic virus in collaboration with our colleagues at Amgen, and with an IDO1 inhibitor in collaboration with our colleagues at Incyte. A substantial amount of important new data from our KEYTRUDA program will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings next month, including results in head and neck cancer patients who have failed both platinum and rituximab therapy, and the long-term survival data in melanoma patients from our original KEYNOTE-001 study. Also in April, we announced that the FDA granted a fourth Breakthrough Designation for KEYTRUDA in the treatment of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. As Margaret Shipp and colleagues from the Dana Farber Cancer Research Center showed in a paper published last month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, amplification of the chromosomal locus, including both PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands, is very common in Hodgkin's lymphoma, and may represent a critical factor in the malignant transformation of Reed-Sternberg cells, the characteristic cell type in this cancer. This observation may help to explain why the very high response rates following KEYTRUDA treatment in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients are observed. Meanwhile, we continue to pursue registration for KEYTRUDA in second-line lung cancer in Europe, and our KEYNOTE-010 study which will improve understanding of how best to use KEYTRUDA in this disease, is under review in the United States. You will recall that in the KEYNOTE-010 trial, KEYTRUDA treatment meaningfully improved overall survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in any histology where tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker in 1% or more of tumor cells as compared to what can be achieved using conventional docetaxel chemotherapy. Our first-line study of KEYTRUDA, KEYNOTE-024, comparing KEYTRUDA treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 strongly positive tumors, remains on track to deliver data at midyear. Finally, progress continues across a broad range of other programs. Bezlotoxumab, our therapy designed to reduce recurrences of C. difficile associated enterocolitis, achieved Priority Review designation from the FDA, with a PDUFA date in July. The FDA will hold an Advisory Committee meeting to review the bezlotoxumab filing on June 9, and our file is also under review in the European Union. Clinical data are beginning to emerge for ertugliflozin which will support our comprehensive filing for this new molecular entity as both a single agent and in combination with JANUVIA or metformin by the end of the year. Separately, the long-awaited adjudication of our Phase 3 odanacatib data is now almost complete. With these data in hand, we will at last be in a position to assemble regulatory dossiers supporting the registration of this important once-weekly treatment for osteoporosis. And among the many programs for which considerable interest is expressed when I meet with external clinicians and scientists is our Phase 3 trial setting letermovir as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus activation in patients receiving bone marrow transplants. We expect to have data in house from this study by the end of the third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Teri. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Roger. Darla, I think we're ready to go to Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just on ZEPATIER, I wonder if you can go into a little bit more detail about where you are with commercial formularies and what opportunities you have to expand that prior to the cycle next year. And then also on Hep C on next-gen regimens, how much value do you guys place on a shorter four-week regimen in terms of differentiation in the market? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : Hi, Geoff. This is Adam. And I'll start off with the update on ZEPATIER regarding how we're doing in the marketplace. I'll start by saying we really are pleased with the progress that we're making since the launch. We're still early in the launch, but we have been working really hard to secure access. And we have conversations ongoing across all segments, many different customers. Many of them are for access in 2017, but some of those such as the VA we're hoping to have access sometime in 2016. So it's still a little bit too early to give you exact accounts and names of accounts, but I can tell you that we feel good about potential access for 2017, and then we'll see where we end up for 2016, but I do think that there is opportunity there. And then if you look at how we're approaching the marketplace, we really are focusing on having access, and it's important that we have parity with the competitors. So we're spending a lot of time trying to get access at parity across the different segments in the United States so that there's physician and patient choice. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Roger, do you want to answer the... Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : I think with respect to shorter regimens, we'd love to be in a position to provide treatment that would massively shorten the regimen because adherence is a problem in this patient population, and many patients who are infected with hepatitis C lead somewhat chaotic lives. Unfortunately, I think there's really very little data to support the use of an oral direct-acting antiviral regimen at four weeks, and there are reasons to be concerned that that might not be possible. Over time, additional advances in other approaches, which could for example involve long-duration implantable therapies, that sort of thing, could improve that. And there are of course other kinds of intervention, for example, at the transcriptional level, that could help that. But right now, four weeks seems like a reach. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Roger. Darla, can we go on to the next question, please? Operator : It's from Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you so much, a question for Dr. Perlmutter. All companies are analyzing I-O data with the FDA-required Cox stratified proportional hazard statistical test. However, Bristol implies that it analyzes I-O data in a unique way, which emphasizes the non-proportional aspect of the I-O curve. And I guess in support of their view, they have stopped more studies early than any other company. And it's also true that Bristol's studies generally are longer than competitors' studies. Does Merck understand what Bristol is doing? Does Merck believe it is doing the same thing? And if not, how is what Merck is doing different? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Hey, Steve. There's no mystery here really. The mechanisms for statistical analysis of these kinds of studies have been refined over a period of many decades. And while the statistical literature continues to advance in ways that are quite intriguing, the reality is that we have a lot of data based on all of the prior studies that we've done with KEYTRUDA and with OPDIVO, the studies that have been done and published with OPDIVO as well that provide a substantial amount of positive predictive value. So in a Bayesian sense, one can predict outcomes fairly comfortably, and we know therefore we can put that information into our power calculations. We have pretty good understanding of where we're going and when we have to look. Of course, you can get surprises in different tumor types. But I guess one thing to stress is the general consistency of the responses that we've seen across a very large number of tumor types, both with respect to response rates and durability. So we don't find it mysterious. I think the explanation for the early stopping of the Bristol-Myers studies is largely related to the size of the studies more than anything else and there's nothing special about non-proportional analyses. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Roger. Darla, next question, please. Operator : It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. On KEYTRUDA, so obviously you and Bristol will both have first-line data this year in lung and that is in patients that need to be tested for the biomarker. Bristol of course points out that their testing encompasses a much greater proportion of patients than your testing. I'm wondering how you see that playing out commercially. Won't there be an advantage in their favor, the fact that it will be applicable to more patients? Do you think that's going to make a difference? And then what were sales of KEYTRUDA in the quarter in lung, so what proportion of sales were in lung? And then were there any wholesaler shifts or timing impact of purchasing that could have impacted what the results were? If I look at U.S. sales, they were flat versus Q4. Internationally, they continue to ramp. Is that reflective of demand in both geographies, or were there some timing issues? Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : Hi, Tim. This is Adam. So if you look at KEYTRUDA, as we said, we reported about $250 million of sales for the quarter, so we're now trending if you just look at about a $1 billion product just based on where we are today. About half the sales were outside the U.S., half the sales in the U.S. And we continue to see growth in the U.S. There are really not inventory issues to any large degree for this product, frankly. If you look at where sales are coming from, the vast majority of the sales are still coming from melanoma indications. And if you look at that, a lot of it is still coming in second-line, although we see first-line continuing to grow. Internationally, the sales are coming primarily, obviously, from our melanoma indication. As you start to think about lung, we are seeing increases in the number of physicians that are testing patients now. And a lot of those increases are actually coming from patients with first-line lung being tested. So the fact that we continue to encourage testing I believe is only going to help us ultimately when we launch in first-line lung. And then the first thing that you want to do is you want to see who gets to market first, and I think that that always matters. So let's see who gets to market first in first-line lung and that will be an important milestone. Secondarily, as you said, we have to see what the cutoff points are. But in addition to that, even with cutoff points, we also have to see what the guidelines say and how the reimbursement works. So I feel pretty good about where we are today. I feel optimistic about first-line lung. I can tell you I'm thrilled that we're only one of two PD-L1s in the marketplace today, and I think that sets us up for very good growth in the future. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Adam. Darla, next question, please. Operator : It's from Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So maybe just switching to anacetrapib, can you update us on your level of optimism for the CV outcomes study in light of the data we saw for Lilly's evacetrapib? And can you perhaps comment on the baseline HDLs in the involved population at least relative to Lilly's ACCELERATE study, since this is potentially an important consideration for the realization of a treatment effect? Thanks. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Hi, Colin. It's Roger. So my feeling about the anacetrapib study really isn't much changed. We knew, of course, about Lilly's evacetrapib study. It's nice to have the data now in much more detail. The differences between the two studies have been discussed in terms of the patient populations that were enrolled and in terms of the duration of the studies, which the follow-up duration is important since you do expect that as you manipulate lipid profiles, the effects should accrue over time. So that's probably the biggest impact. I think that when we look at this, because of the dramatic lowering in LDL cholesterol, the dramatic increase in HDL cholesterol, the changes in Lp (a), the expectation is that patients who are receiving anacetrapib should do better in terms of major cardiovascular events. That's what we're testing. It's a 30,000-patient study. And we're going to have the data next year and we'll have a chance to look and see. We're approaching the end of the treatment period, and at some point the clouds will part and the sun will shine and we'll have a chance to see what the landscape looks like. At the moment, there's no point in speculating. This study is nearly complete. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Next question, please, Darla? Operator : It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions. Apologies if I missed this, but did the extra calendar days in 1Q benefit the quarter in any way? And, Adam, do you think that PD-L1 testing will be restricted to a specific test by treatment, or do you anticipate that it will basically be at the discretion of the labs and that we will eventually see that the labs basically concentrate towards one that's the preferred one, arguably the more sensitive test? Thank you. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Alex. This is Rob. To your question on the impact of the days of sales, we did see some benefit from that impact in the U.S., but it was largely offset by channel, so it did not materially change our results. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : And with respect to PD-L1 testing, first of all, what we're saying is that PD-L1 testing is not specified in the label of the products for any certain test, so it just says if you have a PD-L1 positive patient in the label. So therefore, it doesn't matter what test the lab uses in order to designate whether the test is PD-L1 positive or not. I don't think that is going to change. I think it will be up to the labs to decide which testing that they use and then how they determine it to be positive or not. I think that there are two other points that are important. First of all, we're already seeing about 30% of patients with lung being tested, and about 70% of those are in first-line. The other thing that's important is that when patients are being tested, if it's positive right now, the vast majority of those patients are going to KEYTRUDA. So therefore, I do think that the testing irrespective of what test they use is occurring more often and actually over time could be helpful. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, a few questions. Ken, first to you, I was intrigued that in your press release you highlighted business development as a high priority. If you'll recall, at our CEO conference back in January, you highlighted your high priority to complete deals, being more aggressive this year, moving up the risk curve. Can you provide a little bit more granularity as to specifically what you're looking for? Clearly, we've seen a major derating of valuations of biotech stocks, yet we haven't really seen any motion or rumors or anything out of Merck. What are you looking for specifically? Are they late-stage assets? Are they early-stage assets? What compelled you to highlight that early on in your press release? That's my first question. And second questions are for you, Roger and Adam, if you want to comment. There's been a lot of focus on this call today on monotherapy. Obviously, we have first-line lung monotherapy. But our expectation is that monotherapy is rapidly going to move to combination therapy. And as you know, oncologists believe that the best way to treat cancer is with cocktail or combination therapy. And clearly, your competitors have all pursued combinations either with I-O or chemo combo. So just you have pursued a monotherapy strategy and are behind the curve on combination. What is your strategy to catch up? And then just as a corollary to that question, the market wisdom is that you have to own a combination to speed them to market. What is your strategy to do that? Thanks very much. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Jami, thanks for the question. Let me start by saying what I was trying to say earlier this year and what I'm saying today are exactly the same thing. We feel it's very important for us to access the best external innovation, and we're very actively engaged with companies that we think have good science. You haven't seen the deals come through quite yet, but that doesn't mean that we're not very, very much engaged in active discussions with those companies. You mentioned the issue around valuation. I think that a lot of those companies are looking at their current stock prices and trying to decide whether those are indicative of where they're going to be in the future. So I think those boards or those management teams are going through the process of letting the new reality, if you will, settle in with them. But from our perspective, I guess what I'm trying to highlight is, first of all, we have a strong balance sheet and we can go after deals across the whole spectrum, early, middle, and late-stage compounds. And we will look for those deals consistent with good science and financial discipline. So we want to be aggressive in going after deals, but we want to do deals that create value for our shareholders. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Right. And, Jami, on the general approach to how one treats cancer, I actually don't agree with your assessment of our strategy, so let me try and reinterpret it a little bit for you. First of all, what I've always said was in order to understand the benefits of combination therapy, you have to understand how monotherapy behaves. And we launched a very broad program in monotherapy with more than 30 different tumor types and many lines of therapy. But we've not shorted the combination studies. If you look on ClinicalTrials.gov right now, about something over 270 studies on ClinicalTrials.gov with KEYTRUDA. I haven't checked today. But more than 100 of those are combination studies. And they include studies that are potentially registration enabling. If you look at the KEYNOTE-189 study, for example, which will be delivering data next year in combination with chemotherapy, in addition to of course a combination with chemotherapy data that we've already presented, there's quite a lot going on in combinations. And we have combinations with radiation therapy, combinations with immunotherapies, combinations with traditional chemotherapies, and combinations with targeted chemotherapies. And in addition, we have in the clinic GITR, LAG-3, IL-10, and cCAM, which are our own Phase 1 programs that provide immuno-oncology molecules that could potentially be used in combination. So in totality, we have a very, very broad combination program, which includes both things that we own and things that either shouldn't be owned because they're in essence generic or that we're doing in collaborations with others. And for example, in the IDO program we're both collaborating with Incyte, and we have our own programs that we own as well, so a lot of work going on in combinations. Our goal absolutely is to identify the very best possible regimens from the many thousands that you and I have discussed previously, the many thousands of regimens that potentially we could employ in treating cancer patients. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : And, Jami, if you think about it, both Roger and myself and our teams work very closely identifying potential combinations and uses. And with regard to having to own them all, I don't think you have to, particularly if they can't be combined into a similar dosage form or have the same type of dosing regimen. And I get asked that all the time in diabetes for many years where people said don't you have to have an insulin and a GLP-1 for JANUVIA to be successful? And we've shown that JANUVIA can be successful even if we don't have some of those combinations. It doesn't mean that we don't want a GLP-1 potentially or other types of diabetes medicines, but we look at those as their own opportunities. At the same time, the reason that we think that the combination of our SGLT2 with JANUVIA can be successful is because you can put them into one tablet with the same dosing regimen. So that's the way we look at the combinations, and I think that our strategy is a good one. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks. Darla, next question, please. Operator : It's from Andrew Baum with Citi. Amalan R. Selvarajah - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Hi, this is Amalan Selvarajah on behalf of Andrew. Thanks for taking the question. I have just one left. How does the pricing and rebate dynamic on your biosimilars work between you and your partners? And more specifically, does Merck have the ultimate decision, or can Samsung advise the list price? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : So this is Adam. And if you look at Europe for the pricing and rebates on biosimilars, it's determined by the Merck team and our European team. And what we've done is we've been very successful competing for patients that are on existing therapy, but we have lost many new patient starts. Hence, you see a decline year over year for REMICADE, and we expect that that decline will continue over time. But what we see right now is that existing patients are able to maintain on therapy in many of the European markets. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Adam. Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes, thanks very much. Roger, back to an earlier comment you made on IDO, I wanted to explore IOmet and the acquisition rationale for that relative to what you had with your partner and where you're going in melanoma. I assume only with IOmet you were thinking about a broader set of tumors. Was that the rationale? And second, Rob, to generic mometasone for NASONEX, how much pressure does that put on your gross margin? And more importantly, because that's a reasonably large product, would your tax rate not actually see a benefit because of the change earlier than you would have expected, or is it just marginal? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Tony, thanks for the question. On IOmet, we have data that we have presented for the IDO1 inhibitor from Incyte in combination with KEYTRUDA that is very suggestive with regard to a treatment effect in melanoma. And one of the good things about it is that the adverse experience profile for the combination of the IDO1 inhibitor along with KEYTRUDA really looks very favorable. With that in mind, we wanted to explore more fully the landscape of IDO1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. We have an opportunity with IOmet to gain access to actually quite a large set of starting materials and new chemistry, which enables us to think about how we would design an optimal molecule that could be used in a whole variety of different tumor types. We have a very good collaborative relationship with Incyte, and we're eager to see those programs advance just as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients. But we think there's some running room as well and an opportunity for us to use our chemical insights potentially to improve treatment regimens in that regard. And that was the driving force behind it. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And with regards to your question about generic NASONEX, if you look at NASONEX, it is a high gross margin product for us, but it does have a fair bit of discounting. So it will be a slight drag in the back part of the year to our gross margin, but it was fully reflected in the guidance we gave on gross margin. And as you look at the tax rate, this really has no meaningful impact to our tax rate to speak of. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Rob. Next question, please, Darla? Operator : It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much. I just had two quick ones here. One, just coming back to business development. I think you used the term bolt-on acquisitions in your release. Can you just help us understand a little bit how large a deal could be and still considered to be a bolt-on for Merck? I guess, for example, would Cubist or something a bit larger have been considered a bolt-on, or should we think about Merck targeting some smaller transactions here? My second question is on ZEPATIER and just the HCV marketplace in general. I think one of your competitors cited some pricing pressures in the space emerging again this year. I guess how do you see the pricing environment evolving over time with three main players in the space? And I guess specifically, should we think about price continuing to erode here over time, where you'll get more access, but we should think about a downward trend on price overall? Thanks very much. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So starting on the business development question, thanks, Chris. When I talk about bolt-on acquisitions, I think I'm not signaling anything specific with respect to the size of the deal any more than I was earlier with the stage of development. We want to find the best assets at the best valuation to help us grow our pipeline going forward. And so I guess what I'm signaling is I'm not focused on a large consolidation type merger such as we've seen in the industry in the past. But I also think that bolt-on acquisitions can be larger than, for example, a Cubist. It depends on what the company brings, what their pipeline brings, what level of scientific innovation they have internally, and how we believe it can complement our portfolio and pipeline going forward. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : And, Chris, this is Adam. As we look at the hepatitis C market, we continue to be optimistic about our potential within the market. I think that price will continue to be under pressure over time in this market. But despite that, I think the lower prices have expanded access to some degree. And I think a good example of that is the VA and the removal of the fibrosis score restrictions. So there will continue to be price pressure in the marketplace. We will continue, as I said before, to try to get parity access. But we have to see where our competition and where the payers go. And the more they try to push for restricted access or exclusive formularies, we have to watch that closely. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Great, thanks. Darla, next question. Operator : It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks. Can you hear me? Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Yes, we can, Seamus. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, great, thanks for the questions, a couple of quick questions. Just, Roger, can you clarify the update on ZEPATIER in the EU with regard to the manufacturing issues that you mentioned? I think I missed a little bit of the facts there. The second question, again, Roger, you mentioned a number of internally developed assets and collaborations. Can you talk a little bit about GITR? We're hearing and seeing a lot of additional companies pursue this target. Enthusiasm amongst thought leaders is building. But there are questions about this target as to whether or not, A), it's an agonist at all, and also how efficiently one can actually develop antibodies to this target. And my last question is for the team overall. In terms of the areas of greatest interest for business development, should we anticipate that your focus is mostly on oncology specifically, or how broadly and what areas are of greatest interest to you on the BD side? Thanks. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Why don't we start with Roger? Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : So, Seamus, just to reiterate that in the course of our European review, the European Medicines Agency cited Merck's third-party manufacturer for issues that were largely related to inadequate record keeping and the need for improvement in their quality management systems. The problems do not affect, we do not believe, the safety, efficacy, or quality specifications of the product, and hence we don't believe the problems will affect the supply to the U.S. market. But we take these good manufacturing practice issues very seriously, and we're working with both regulatory agencies and the contract manufacturer to resolve the issues as expeditiously as possible. Secondly, with respect to GITR, as you know, our program has been in the clinic for quite some time, but we have been advancing it very slowly because of concerns on our part and on the part of regulators too. We share these concerns that an agonist antibody could stimulate a fairly profound immune activation response, and those responses can be difficult to manage. So we're just getting to the point in advancing that program where we believe we're in the therapeutic range. We certainly do have data that our anti-GITR antibody behaves as an agonist. I think one of the issues has to do with cross-linking and which Fc receptors are engaged by the therapy. As you know, we have two GITR antibodies that are in the clinic. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the community, but it will be some time I think before we understand whether to what extent GITR antibodies will be useful. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Seamus, maybe I can just add on the comments around ZEPATIER. I think it's important also to understand. That was fully reflected in our guidance. And in fact, just to give you a little bit more color, as you look at ZEPATIER in particular, thinking about roughly where consensus is now, which ranges bilitates (47:08) around $650 million, we're very comfortable with that and, as I said, was reflected in our guidance. I just want to make sure that we get that out there. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Okay, and do you want to comment on BD, Ken? Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thanks, Seamus. I think as we look at BD, we look at it in two different ways. First of all, obviously we're very eager to build on areas of leadership like immuno-oncology. And you saw us do deals, for example, with cCAM Biotherapeutics. You saw us do the deal earlier with IOmet that we talked about. So we'd like to build on those areas where we already have leadership. But it's also important for us not to be too blinded to the fact that there's important science going on in other areas. And so what we want to look for are significant opportunities to have leading positions in growing areas of therapeutic significance going forward. Obviously, immuno-oncology would be one leading area, but we are also willing to do business development if we think we can get an asset that we can leverage inside our portfolio for leadership positions. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Ken. Darla, let's move on to the next question. Operator : It's from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I wondered if you can just give us an update on your insulin glargine program. We were maybe expecting to see your pivotal data coming up with that program, perhaps a filing later this year. So an update there would be useful. And then we get a lot of commentary from your competitor on how entrenched the use of nivolumab is amongst particular lung cancer oncologists. That would seem to be the case from the commercial data you're giving us in Q1 versus their data. Can you just go through in a bit more detail why you think that isn't going to be a barrier for you in first-line lung cancer given the relatively close potential timing of the launches? And if it is more of a barrier than you think, what could you possibly do to change that? Thank you very much. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Roger, do you want to start with... Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : So with respect to glargine insulin, you'll be seeing data later in the year. We're filed in Europe and going through the process of gaining approval for that MK-1293 molecule. Probably not much more to add, I think, to that. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : And if you look at KEYTRUDA, the first thing I'd say is right now, we're the ones that have to talk about PD-L1 testing for second-line therapy, and we're the ones that are training physicians and getting physicians to understand the utilization of PD-L1 testing. When you think about first-line lung, all competitors will be talking about PD-L1 testing. So I believe that barrier will go away because all of us together will be talking about it. And the other thing that I think is important is if the playing field is equal in lung and all else is close, every three-week dosing is an advantage versus competition. And therefore I think that the dosing for first-line lung patients could end up being an advantage for us if PD-L1 testing is communicated by all companies. But the other thing I want to emphasize, as I've said all along, this is a long-term view of this market. There will be multiple competitors that can do really well in this market. I don't think we should look at any one quarter or short period of time. This market over the next several years with the number of tumor types that we're studying, with the amount of \u2013 how well that we're continuing to develop combination products, we can continue to do really well. The last thing I'll say is that if you look at Europe, in countries in Europe, we actually came to market after competition. And in many markets, including big markets like Germany in melanoma, despite that, we now are the market leader. So I believe it shows our strength outside of the U.S., where I believe PD-L1 testing will be even more relevant and accepted by payers than potentially in the U.S. for second-line. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Adam. Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much, so I have a couple questions. First, with respect to the timing of the upcoming first-line lung readout, Roger, I think you mentioned at the middle of the year. But could you just talk a little bit more about more specifically the timing that you expect and the factors that you are assessing to be able to convey that timing? And then with respect to ASCO, could you just talk a little bit about the chemo combo data that you'll be conveying? Obviously, it will be longer duration data that supports your move into Phase 3 for the chemo combo. If you could, shed some light on that. And then finally with respect to REMICADE biosimilar adoption, obviously REMICADE is an infused drug used by hospitals and clinics. Do you believe that that route of administration and those customers have been more inclined to adopt biosimilars than the marketplace would be for a self-injectable therapy? Thank you. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Roger, do you want to take the first one? Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Right, yes. So let me start with respect to the KEYNOTE-024 study, the first-line study in PD-L1 high patients in lung cancer. Again, it's important to recognize that this is an event-driven trial, and they have about 300 patients that are enrolled in the study. We've powered the study based on a certain number of progression events. Progression-free survival is the primary endpoint. So it's actually just a question of when we hit the event number. From the time we hit the event number to the time we get to database lock involves polling the sites, and there are a variety of questions that have to be answered. And then once the database is locked, the statistical analysis takes relatively little time. So there are no other factors that go into this. We're not in any way manipulating it. We're just waiting until we hit this pre-specified event trigger, which defines the power for the study. And once that's available, then we'll be able to do that. Just with respect to ASCO, since you mentioned it, I didn't have a chance to go into it, but there's going to be a lot of new material presented at ASCO. We have 84 currently abstracts, including 13 oral presentations that will be presented at ASCO. We're going to be discussing data from 20 different tumor types. We'll have additional data that we'll be presenting with respect to chemo combinations, and in particular, the data that comes from the KEYNOTE-021 study, which is combinations with traditional chemotherapy, carbo [carboplatin]/pemetrexed, where overall response rates are really very high, nearly 60%. So there's a lot of information that will be communicated at ASCO. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : And, Dave, with regard to REMICADE biosimilar adoption, I think it has more to do with price differences for new patients and tenders than it does with the way in which the drugs are administered. So I wouldn't expect a very significant difference. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. The one I just have one on the guidance, just to clarify, on the sales side, I believe you said you went from a 3% negative headwind on sales from FX to a 2% negative headwind. So I think there's about a $400 million benefit. But you only raised the guidance, the midpoint of your guidance by about $100 million. So I wondered if you could just confirm that I have the facts straight. And if so, what is it that's bringing down the sales guidance by about $300 million if you take out the impact of the currency moves? And then the second question I have is on Alzheimer's, and I would love to just get Merck's perspective on this. Obviously, there has been a lot of discussion around endpoints with the changes Lilly made recently to their solanezumab study. I know for yours, for your base inhibitor, in prodromal you have CDR [Clinical Dementia Rating] Sum of the Boxes as your primary, I believe, in the prodromal study. In the mild to moderate, you have ADAS-cog and ADCS/ADL as co-primary. So if you could just talk through those endpoints and how you think about the pros and cons of each in the different patient populations, I think that would be helpful just given all the investor interest in that area. Thanks. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Vamil, this is Rob. Good morning. So to your question, you are correct that, as we set original guidance at the beginning of the year, we expected three percentage points of negative impact from foreign currency. Using the mid-April rates, we now expect for the full year an approximately negative two percentage points of impact from foreign currency. And as you look at the guidance we provided, we flowed part of that benefit through in the guidance, but not all of it. And the single largest reason we did not flow all of it is the fact that we face earlier than expected generic entry on NASONEX, which is the largest driver of the number you quoted. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Vamil, it's Roger. With respect to Alzheimer's endpoints, of course there has been a lot of discussion over a long period of time about how to best measure the deterioration that occurs as a result of Alzheimer's-related neuro-degeneration. There are at least two different things to be concerned about. One, of course, is direct measurement of cognitive function by whatever tools one has, typically things like mental status examinations. And the other is the functional capability of individuals who are unfortunately suffering from Alzheimer's. Typically, the agency has asked to see both of those things assessed directly and often as a primary endpoint, as a composite endpoint. In clinical trials, it is possible of course to do that, seriatim and take a single endpoint. Our view with respect to mild to moderate is that the best strategy is to look at both of those aspects of Alzheimer's-related performance, and that's the way we've handled it. We understand Lilly's thinking with respect to their earlier study, and we continue to look at these questions. But at the moment, I think we feel comfortable with where we are with our endpoints. Teri Loxam - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thanks, Roger. Darla. I know we're hitting up against the top of the hour. We're going to try to squeeze in one more question. Operator : And that's from Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Emerging markets, we see the numbers in the press release. Can you give us a little more flavor on what's going on in the different areas, China, Latin America? How is it doing ex-Venezuela? Eastern Europe looked tough. How much of this is currency and how much of this is just underlying stuff? And then can you just comment on omarigliptin? I thought I had read that you're not going to be pursuing this in the U.S. and Europe. If you could, just comment on that. And on JANUVIA, were there any inventory changes? It wasn't clear from your comments. Thanks Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President & President-Global Human Health : So I'll get those quickly. If you exclude Venezuela, sales in emerging markets ex-foreign exchange were up about 5%. And we're seeing good growth in countries like China, where we had about 11% growth outside of foreign exchange. And we're seeing good success in the areas of vaccines, our diabetes franchise, and so forth. Where the pressure was primarily was Venezuela, but obviously there's some turmoil that's happening in some markets, particularly in the Middle East, that have some impact. If you look at emerging markets over time, there has been a slight decline in growth, but we still expect there to be growth as we move forward into the future. With regard to JANUVIA, I said in the U.S. we had 9% growth versus prior year. But the best way to understand that is to look at underlying volume growth, which was about 5% versus prior year. And therefore, we did see some inventory movement of JANUVIA. It's important to note that just like last year the quarters will fluctuate to some degree from one quarter to the next quarter. But overall, across the year, we expect growth for the JANUVIA franchise. And then the last thing I'll say is with regard to omarigliptin, for business reasons we decided not to move forward submitting the applications in the United States or Europe, and it did not result from concerns on efficacy or safety. It was really for business reasons, for two primary reasons. Number one, we have a very high share of JANUVIA in those markets, so a lot of the product would have been cannibalizing our own DPP-4 share. We have a 75% share in the U.S. and a 65% share globally. The second reason is we're excited about launching not just the monotherapy SGLT2 but also the combination of an SGLT2 with JANUVIA, which we would have anticipated would be launched not too far after omarigliptin. And in order to focus more on growing JANUVIA but then also the SGLT2 mono and more specifically the combo with JANUVIA, we felt it was a better place for us to focus. Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D. - Executive Vice President & President-Merck Research Laboratories : And if I could, I'd just say that this was a very hard decision for Adam and me \u2013 we. Omarigliptin has very desirable properties as a once-weekly DPP-4, nearly superimposable over daily JANUVIA. But as Adam indicated, these decisions have to be made by putting our resources against those things that matter most. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, I just want to thank you all for hanging in there with us this morning. We're off to a promising start this year with our growth of 3% ex-FX. I think we also continued to deliver our leveraged P&L with 10% FX on the bottom line, and we are looking forward to data readouts in areas like KEYTRUDA and other areas of our pipeline. So we're very excited and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Merck's Q1 2016 sales and earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over the Ken. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call this morning. Our performance this quarter reflects our continuing progress in advancing our priority products and programs. As we accelerate the launch of KEYTRUDA around the world, our researchers are continuing to study KEYTRUDA with an extensive clinical development program that spans a multitude of cancer types. We're confident that KEYTRUDA will be a key treatment in cancer for many years to come. We also made good strides in the launch of ZEPATIER, our new hepatitis C medicine, during its full first quarter on the market. Our key in-line brands such as JANUVIA, whose sales are still growing nearly 10 years after its initial launch, also significantly contributed to our performance this quarter. We remain committed to our innovation strategy and our mission of delivering important medicines and vaccines that address many of the world's foremost health challenges and global unmet medical needs. Business development continues to be a priority and we are committed to finding the best external science to enrich our pipeline and portfolio. As I've previously outlined, we're taking a disciplined approach both financially and scientifically to identify and acquire opportunities at the right financial valuation. In addition to acquisitions, we also are engaging in scientific and commercial partnerships to pair our best internal innovations with the best external innovation available. As a recent example of our efforts, earlier this year we closed on the acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals which will complement and enhance our primary care pipeline. Last month we began a new scientific collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics to develop personalized cancer vaccine by combining KEYTRUDA with Moderna's vaccine technology. Additionally, we recently announced our intent to acquire Vall\u00e9e of Brazil to fortify our Animal Health business in Latin America. In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well for the second half of the year. Looking forward, we will remain focused on executing on our launches and driving the performance of our strongest brands as well as advancing and augmenting our broad pipeline to deliver a balanced and differentiated portfolio of valuable medicines and vaccines. We believe this strategic focus will create long-term growth for the company and sustainable value for both society and shareholders. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our results in the second quarter reflect continued execution across the organization with our broad portfolio of products contributing to growth both on the top and bottom line. Total company revenues were $9.8 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 3%. Our human health and animal health businesses performed well in the quarter delivering growth despite an approximately $210 million headwinds in sales in Venezuela in the second quarter of 2015. As you'll remember, we scaled back our operations in Venezuela toward the end of last year and therefore recorded negligible sales from the country in the second quarter of this year. Partially offsetting growth in human and animal health this quarter were lower contributions from our revenue hedge program and third-party manufacturing sales versus the prior year. While our revenue hedging program continues to contribute to the top line, it's expected to have a negative impact in each quarter this year on a year-over-year basis. In terms of revenue guidance, we now expect full year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.1 billion including an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July rates. Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7% an increase of 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. Foreign exchange and product mix both contributed to the year-over-year improvement as growth in higher-margin products such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER offset the declines in lower margin products such as REMICADE. On a full year basis, non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be roughly flat versus last year. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion increased 4% year-over-year with lower marketing and administrative expenses and an approximately two percentage point benefit from foreign exchange partially offsetting higher research and development expenses in the quarter. The increase in R&D reflects a $200 million upfront payment to Moderna for our recently announced collaborations on the development of personalized cancer vaccine as well as higher investments in our clinical programs. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating expense for the full year to be generally in line with the prior year. We anticipate incremental spend in R&D will be partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 19% primarily driven by the beneficial impact of orphan drug federal income tax credits for KEYTRUDA reported in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5% which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. Taken together, we earned $0.93 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter delivering 8% growth or 12% excluding exchange and another quarter of P&L leverage. On a GAAP basis we reported $0.43 per share in the quarter. For the full year, we're raising the lower end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance, narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.77 per share. We now expect foreign exchange to have an approximately one percentage point negative impact in mid-July rates. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $1.98 to $2.08 per share for the full year. Altogether, we delivered growth both nominally and excluding exchange on the top and bottom line. We continue to have a number of opportunities in our pipeline with new product launches and with the potential for business development. We remain disciplined in our approach expense management recognizing the need to balance delivering in the short term while making the appropriate investments to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another quarter of growth with sales of $8.7 billion, a growth of 2%. We drove increases in core areas on oncology, diabetes, vaccines and hospital and specialty care which were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and NASONEX. I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'm going to begin with oncology. This is an exciting time for Merck as a leader in immuno-oncology and as we work to make KEYTRUDA foundational to the treatment of cancer. We're launching our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets globally and we are preparing for launches in additional tumors. In the United States, we are maintaining our strong position in melanoma and we're launching a second-line lung cancer. And we are ready \u2013 we are ready to launch imminently in head and neck cancer and we're preparing for the launch in first-line lung cancer. In the second quarter, sales of KEYTRUDA reached approximately $315 million on continued strength in the melanoma indication. In the U.S., we're also seeing increasing sales contributions from progress we're making in second-line lung cancer. Importantly, PD-L1 testing rates continue to increase, with approximately two-thirds of physicians now testing to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from PD-1 directed therapy. This is very important as we prepare for a potential first-line indication, where we recently announced that KEYTRUDA offers an overall survival benefit compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1. Customers are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to treat lung cancer in a first-line setting with KEYTRUDA. We also believe that all of the work that we've been doing to drive testing for second-line use will position us well in first-line when we come to market. With the broad and deep clinical program that continues to grow and continues to generate positive monotherapy and combination data, we remain very excited about the long-term opportunity for KEYTRUDA. Next, in primary care, the JANUVIA franchise grew 2% this quarter. In the United States, we continue to drive TRx growth of 4% to 5%. As you recall, we saw 14% and 22% growth in the second and third quarters of last year, respectively. These tough comparisons had an impact on the year-over-year changes this quarter and will also impact year-over-year changes in the third quarter. But I continue to focus on the underlying TRx volume growth, and it remains strong in the United States. Outside of the U.S., we generated strong growth in Europe and Canada and in emerging markets. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise for the remainder of 2016, and we're pleased with our continued strong access that we expect in 2017. Moving to our Vaccine business. Sales in the Vaccine portfolio reached about $1.3 billion. Growth of 7% came primarily from our pediatric vaccines, which was partially offset by GARDASIL. Overall, GARDASIL sales declined 7%. In the U.S., sales of GARDASIL grew only 2% due to lower CDC buying. Outside of the U.S., sales were impacted by the timing of public-sector purchases in Brazil. We're celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the launch of GARDASIL. Real-world data that was recently published continued to show the benefits of HPV vaccination and we are seeing increased uptake and utilization of our HPV vaccine around the world. Also, influential organizations, including the CDC, ASCO and the WHO have expressed strong support for HPV vaccination. It is worth noting that many markets are moving toward implementing a two-dose regimen of GARDASIL, and there are discussions ongoing in the U.S. as well. We anticipate this change to a two-dose regimen could go into effect in the U.S. by the end of 2016 or early in 2017. Finally, in Hospital Specialty Care, sales grew 3% to $2.1 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launch products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE and ISENTRESS due to competitive pressures that we expect will continue going forward. We are making good progress with the ZEPATIER launch. We're having favorable conversations with payers and we've garnered some early wins in both the public and the private sectors for 2016 and 2017. In the VA, utilization of ZEPATIER is ramping up nicely, and we've also started to see some advancement in Medicare Part D, in managed Medicaid and in commercial segments. Customers see the value that ZEPATIER can offer, with high cure rates in a broad and diverse set of patients. It will take some time for ZEPATIER to ramp up as formularies come online, but we are pleased with the access that we've achieved so far. Finally, BRIDION is growing well on strong global demand and early contributions from the U.S. launch. In the U.S., our teams are rapidly securing formulary access, and initial indicators of use by physicians in the surgical suite are encouraging. In closing, our teams delivered another quarter of solid performance. We have momentum in our four focus areas and strong execution for our key launches. This positions us well for the second half of 2016 and for 2017. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Thanks, Adam. During the second quarter, we made significant progress in gaining registration for important new products and also advanced a number of new programs. On the infectious disease front, in June the FDA antimicrobial advisory committee agreed on a vote of 10 to five with one abstention, that substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of bezlotoxumab, now called ZINPLAVA, in preventing recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients 18 years and older had been presented. Subsequently, the FDA has requested additional information to enable their review of the ZINPLAVA file with the result that a new action date of October 23 has been set. We are working closely with the FDA and its other regulatory agencies to make ZINPLAVA available to patients at risk for recurrent C. difficile infection. Considerable progress has also been made in advancing curative therapies for hepatitis C virus infection, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known as the CHMP, adopted a positive opinion regarding the approval of ZEPATIER for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection noting its high efficacy against HCV genotypes 1 and 4 including in patients with compensated cirrhosis and severe kidney disease. This recommendation has now been ratified by the European commission. I will remind you that ZEPATIER is not cleared by the kidney and can be used in patients irrespective of baseline renal function. As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, we are working to supply the European market. We've made good progress on this front and still expect that we'll be able to launch ZEPATIER in the EU in the fourth quarter or at the latest, in the first quarter of 2017. Reviews in other jurisdictions are also proceeding. Meanwhile, we are continuing to explore additional treatments for the more than 150 million people with hepatitis C virus infection around the world. Progress is made in advancing our triplet regimen incorporating MK-3682, a urodonal nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, along with the protease inhibitor grazoprevir and a novel NS5A inhibitor MK-8408. We now have substantial experience with this combination with more than 1,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials, and results from our extensive Phase 2b program will be available later this year and will be presented at major scientific meetings. Because of the favorable properties of MK-3682, we're also exploring a doublet regimen employing just this polymerase inhibitor along with MK-8408. Together, we believe that these combinations can offer broad efficacy for HCV infected patients irrespective of HCV genotype and in a variety of clinical settings. Lastly, on the infectious disease front, I note that our V920 vaccine to prevent Ebola virus disease received FDA breakthrough designation and prime designation from the EMA, permitting close regulatory interactions to optimize development and facilitate review of this important, potentially life-saving agent. Turning now to oncology, this was an extremely active quarter for KEYTRUDA our PD-1 directed immunotherapy for malignant disease. I have said repeatedly that I expect that KEYTRUDA, by virtue of the spectrum of its activity, will prove to be foundational in future cancer care. At the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last month, we presented data demonstrating the activity of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in 15 different tumor types. We also presented data from multiple studies where KEYTRUDA has been used in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with targeted therapies and with immunotherapies. In all, we now have more than 300 clinical studies underway exploring the activity of KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types. More than 100 of these studies employ KEYTRUDA in combination with other agents. In Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy and whose tumors express the PD-L1 biomarker. We have championed the view that because patient outcomes from the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer are correlated with the extent to which PD-L1 is expressed on the tumor, it is important to assess the status of this biomarker prior to initiating therapy with a PD-1 directed agent. The data supporting our dossier were derived from the KEYNOTE-010 study which showed that KEYTRUDA treatment in populations with 1% or more of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 yielded superior overall survival compared with the results of traditional chemotherapy. These data are also under review by the FDA with an action date of October 24. During the quarter, we also reported topline results of our KEYNOTE-024 study which compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to platinum-based chemotherapy in the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA treatment demonstrated superior progression-free survival and superior overall survival in this setting. A manuscript describing these results has now been accepted for publication and hence, should appear in the near future. We've also begun to work with regulatory agencies to enable supplementary filing of these data to our existing KEYTRUDA labels. Beyond treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, we have pursued accelerated approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The PDUFA date for this review is August 9. Based on our current trial enrollments, we have several additional potential filings for KEYTRUDA over the next 12 to 18 months, including bladder cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer in the setting of microsatellite instability, and relapsed refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, an indication for which we received breakthrough designation from the FDA in the second quarter. Moreover, data continue to provide intriguing evidence of the broad spectrum of KEYTRUDA activity. Earlier this month, for example, Julie Graff and colleagues at the Oregon Health Sciences University published a preliminary report demonstrating meaningful responses in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who had progressed on enzalutamide. As Rob noted, R&D expenses increased this quarter, in large part owing to the establishment of our business partnership with Moderna on the development of novel immunogens with the goal of further improving the efficacy of our immunomodulatory agents, including KEYTRUDA. While we have, through the Moderna investment, as well as our funding of key clinical trials, increased our support for KEYTRUDA in immuno-oncology, we continue to pursue other important new therapies. For example, this week we announced the closing of our acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals, which gives us access to a set of P2X3 receptor antagonists. Their lead program, AF-219, is currently under study in a fully-enrolled Phase 2b trial for the treatment of chronic cough, and is also being investigated in a Phase 2 study for the same indication in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. I look forward to updating you on this and other programs in the coming months. Meanwhile, we continue to support the development of ertugliflozin, both as monotherapy and in combination with JANUVIA. We have presented important Phase 3 data on this program and will submit regulatory dossiers before the end of the year. Also, we expect to receive the adjudicated cardiovascular safety data from odanacatib from our external evaluators in the next few days, which will then be analyzed over the next several weeks. It is my expectation that the U.S. odanacatib file will be submitted in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Teri. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Roger. As we move forward with Q&A, we would like to get in as many questions as possible this morning on the call, so we'd appreciate it if you'd limit yourself to just one question each. Darla, if we can move forward with Q&A, please? Operator : Certainly. Your first question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have a commercial question on the PD-1s. So Bristol's first line trial results coming up, in your opinion, if they hit PFS and possibly OS in all PDL-1 expressors, not just the high expressors, how much of a benefit do you think that gives them commercially? Already they're obviously much more penetrated in lung in the second line setting. They're already getting usage in first line to some degree off-label, and I'm wondering if they were to hit in a broader population, if you think that makes a substantial difference? And can I just clarify the comment about publication timeline for 024? Sounds like, if I heard you right, that's already been accepted. You said that it would be published in the nearer term. I'm assuming that doesn't get published before ESMO, but ESMO would be the likely venue for concurrent publication. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Hello, Tim. It's Roger. Just the manuscript was accepted for publication. I don't have a publication date so I can't really speculate on when it would be published vis-\u00e0-vis ESMO, but we have an accepted manuscript. And I'll let Adam comment on the commercial question. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : So, Tim, I think it's a very important question and I'll walk you through how I think about it. The first thing is, I will be very glad to be first to market. Being first to market for a new indication matters. And I remember when we were first to market with melanoma, people were asking if you have progression-free survival but you don't have overall survival? They come out with overall survival, will it matter? And I kept saying I just want to be first, and as long as we have the studies underway to show that ultimately we can show overall survival, that we should be okay. If you look at first line lung, the first thing I'd say is we're glad to be first. The second thing is, the issue that we have right now with PD-L1 testing in second line, where the competition has all comers, I think that will go away in first line, because everybody will be doing PD-L1 testing. So that obstacle that we face today goes away with first line. The second question will become not only what the indication is but what reimbursement occurs and even today, you start to see reimbursement occurring even where you don't necessarily have the indication and the good news is at the time of the first line launch, we should have data in second line showing a positive results in the PD-L1 plus one positive. So we'll have data in plus one to 50 for second line. So we still have to see how it plays out, but I'm pleased to be first to launch hopefully and then we'll see how the reimbursement works out over time. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Great. Next question, please, Darla? Operator : It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Roger, you've downplayed the chances of achieving an OS benefit in the past and now that you have it, I was hoping that you can put it maybe in clinical context, especially given the crossover. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, Geoff, I don't think I downplayed the possibility. I think it's always the case that it's uncertain what the results of clinical trials will be and their experiments and we don't know the answer in advance. Certainly we're very pleased with the results that we saw in the 024 study. There's meaningful crossover of course as there is now in any such study. And the fact that we achieved overall survival even in the context of meaningful crossover I think gives a sense of how powerful the benefit is. Keep in mind that we had a small amount of first line data that we had obtained in the 001-F cohort so we knew that there was benefit in that setting. And in that sense, it's not surprising to see impressive PFS results. The overall survival obviously was something that we'd hoped for and it's nice to see it come through. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Great. Thanks. Darla, next question? Operator : It's from John Boris with SunTrust. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. On the Bristol and Lilly calls, they indicated that OPDIVO was seeing up to 15% to 20% use in first line lung. Can you comment at all, Adam, about use of KEYTRUDA in first line lung? And then a tangential question to that one for Roger. It would seem that, based on the CheckMate-012 data that an objection that your sales reps might be getting is that has KEYTRUDA been studied in lung cancer across all PD-1 levels with a CTLA-4 type mechanism like a YERVOY. Can you help me understand why a physician would use KEYTRUDA in first line lung or across second line lung if its next step is, and it believes that it needs to go on to an IO-IO combo versus an IO-chemo combo? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Yeah, so, John, with regard to KEYTRUDA, right now in the U.S., about 70% of the use is still melanoma and then there's somewhere between 10% to 15% that we believe is in second line lung and then the rest is amongst a whole host of different uses. So the utilization of first line lung right now is very low. But what's important is we're seeing PD-L1 testing start to occur more and more often. And I mentioned that two-thirds of physicians are now testing. And what we see is when physicians test, they tend to use KEYTRUDA and that's where we see the utilization of KEYTRUDA for lung right now. The good news is the work that we've been doing on testing I think is going to pay off for us as we get the first line indication and the obstacle goes away for second line so I'm very encouraged and excited about the opportunity to launch in first line for sure. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Yeah, and John, it's Roger. The truth of the matter is we really, as I've said, need to understand how well KEYTRUDA works as monotherapy and for that matter, OPDIVO, in order to be able to understand how to proceed with combination therapies. The combination therapy work is all extremely early. We do not have any data that tell us that any combination provides superior overall survival versus monotherapy. Indeed, we have the first data in first line lung that show that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy. And that, again, it needs to be reviewed. But when people have a chance to look at the data, that represents a real sea change in the way people treat lung cancer. Combination chemotherapy has been the mainstay of therapy for decades. So that's going to be a pretty big deal. If you look at response rates, an imperfect indicator of course, the best response rates that we see are the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy like pemetrexed where we reported small number of patients, 71% overall response rate in the lung cancer setting, which is obviously very provocative. With time, I think we'll discover how best to use these agents in combination. Whether that's an immuno-oncology combination with a CTLA-4 directed molecule, with other molecules. We have 10 of them in development on our own, or with chemotherapeutic agents, time will tell. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Roger. Darla, next question please. Operator : It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. I appreciate it. I guess I'll follow up on the last question, Roger, if I may. When I think about the market for immuno-oncology, what I always tell clients is lung is where the money is and if you could really figure out lung, you'll probably figure out the space. The other tumors \u2013 lung is probably bigger than all the other tumors combined. So, I imagine you're very focused on this too. So my question is, specifically, what do you think of the data that Bristol has put up on YERVOY plus nivolumab? And that will be out next year. And what are you doing to hedge against that risk, that that becomes a standard of care? Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Well, Mark, I mean, first of all, lung is not larger than all other tumors combined. I mean, it's an extremely important cancer, but again, I keep trying to point out that we are at a very early point in the evaluation of the use of PD-1 directed therapies in malignant disease. Just again, as an example, the fact that we're seeing prostate cancer responses, remember that previously, it was thought prostate cancer was refractory to PD-1 directed therapy, OPDIVO treatment. There were really no results. That shows you that we're still learning a great deal about how to use this as monotherapy. Combinations, a lot of combinations appear to be showing early signs of signals, whether that's combinations of chemotherapy or combinations in the case of OPDIVO and us as well, with ipilimumab with CTLA-4. Time will tell which is the best combination. If it turned out that ipilimumab was the best combination, then that would be the way to go forward and we obviously have studies using that combination, as do others. Our combination studies with targeted chemotherapies and traditional chemotherapies are also very far along, and that will be extremely interesting. We'll have a chance to see those data relatively soon. We'll finish the first of those sets of studies in the third quarter. So we'll have to see the data very soon. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks, Roger. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks. Darla, next question please. Operator : It's from Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Regarding the upcoming KEYTRUDA PDUFA in head and neck cancer, should we assume approval will be only for third line PD-L1-positive patients, given that that was the population studied? Or should we expect a broader label than that? And how should we think about the size of the opportunity as well? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Well, first of all, with respect to the approval, I cannot comment on what exactly the label will look like except to say that in general, of course, you get the label for the population that you've studied, and that's what we would expect. And so this is the first and it's an accelerated approval in the head and neck cancer setting. There's a lot of additional information that will be coming up from our other studies going forward. In terms of the size of the opportunity, I'll let Adam speak to that. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Hi, Steve. So if you look at head and neck, it's a few thousand patients in the United States. But again, it's not about any one indication. It's about KEYTRUDA becoming the foundational therapy. And when you listen to Roger's introduction and you hear all the different indications and the tumors and combinations that we're studying, it's going to be all those together that we're preparing for every day that's going to make KEYTRUDA a foundational for the treatment of cancer in our view. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks. Darla, let's move on. Operator : It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just switching gears a little bit. Can you elaborate on the ZEPATIER launch thus far? Any surprises that you're seeing? And when we think about market sizing over time for HCV, how do you see the number of patients treated annually trending from here? Do you think overall market volumes can increase or do you think we've hit a peak? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Hi, Chris. This is Adam. So we're six months into the launch of ZEPATIER and we're encouraged by the progress that we're seeing. Obviously, the first thing we're doing is trying to secure access. And as I mentioned, we have early wins, so in Medicare Part D for example, we have United and Express Scripts where they've added us at parity to their Medicare Part D formulary effective July 1. In Medicaid we're making significant progress in not only getting our formulary, but some of those Medicaid formularies have increased the number of patients that they're making eligible for treatment. We're working very closely with our commercial customers and access is progressing. We still have some negotiations that are ongoing as we speak. And as I said, the VA continues to ramp up nicely. So we're encouraged by the access that we're getting and now we have to work to build market share and that's what we're going to focus on as we move forward. In terms of the overall market, it's a large market. There's about 3 million patients in the U.S. that still need to be treated so it's going to be a market that'll be around for a while. We're currently seeing just over 200,000 or so patients per year treated in the U.S. That's a lot more than if you would have gone back five years ago where there was somewhere between 120,000 to 150,000. So we've certainly seen an increase, but that increase I think has maxed out and I think we'll see more of where we are as a steady state as we move forward and really, the size and the pace of the market's going to depend on getting more patients diagnosed and through the system as we move forward. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks. Next question please, Darla. Operator : It's from Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for taking the questions. So on KEYTRUDA in first line, and on Tim's question, just given the lack of PD-L1 testing harmonization and therefore the need to test for the drugs you want to use, if Bristol does show a PFS and OS benefit across a broader PD-L1 expression population, what would drive physicians to test for KEYTRUDA given it would carry a low probability of a positive result? And then just a follow on for KEYTRUDA, could you give some details around the current performance in terms of share in each indication? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Yeah, so let me start. First of all, the label says for KEYTRUDA that it's based upon a PD-L1 test by an FDA-approved test, it doesn't have a specific test assigned to KEYTRUDA versus OPDIVO. So I'm not concerned, and frankly, most of the commercial labs that are measuring PD-L1 and/or the individual institutions that do it themselves are not having designated tests for designated products. So that's not a concern frankly. In addition to that, with first line lung, I believe everybody's going to start to measure PD-L1 right from the start, so even for the competition, I think they're going to be advocating the importance of measuring PD-L1 moving forward. So that obstacle will go away. And then ultimately I believe it's going to come down to the market share that you're able to achieve within the lung segment and therefore I'm very pleased that we'll be the first one to launch. If you look specifically at our share of our business, about 70% of our business is in melanoma, 15% is in lung and then the rest is in all other indications. And then you can kind of extrapolate that if you look at \u2013 we have about, if you look at the dollar sales reported, about 30% of the dollar sales in share right now. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : And, Colin, it's Roger. The blueprint project demonstrated that PD-L1 diagnostic test that's used by Bristol-Myers for OPDIVO and our diagnostic tests are actually very similar in terms of their results and can be used almost interchangeably. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks. Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Oh, thanks for the question. So just a couple of quick ones. Number one, can you just remind us again what the benefit on tax was this quarter? It seems quite a bit lower than I would've anticipated this quarter. The second question is, as it relates to the manuscript that's in place, obviously we don't know the timing, but one would presume that that could impact NCCN guidelines and obviously uptake in the front line setting. So am I thinking about the commercial impact of that publication? And what would be the second publication to sort of validate the effect that obviously you're going to see an overall survival benefit in that patient population? And the last question is, relative to the transcript, obviously you don't want any surprises with the FDA's filing and evaluation so one would presume that the filing, in fact, could be with the agency at this point. Would that be a separate filing per se, or is it possible that that could be incorporated into the existing filing for KEYNOTE-010? We have seen the agency moving that way before, but should we think of this as a separate and distinct filing, or is it possible that it could be incorporated into the KEYNOTE-010 file? Thanks a lot. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Seamus. It's Rob. I'll answer the tax question and then turn it over to Roger. What the benefit relates to is the IRS allows you four orphan drug clinical trials. So if you have a drug that has a validated orphan status from the FDA, the clinical trial expenses related to that drug can be taken as a credit against your tax. That's what we refer to as the orphan drug tax credit. This relates to certain indications within, and stages within malignant melanoma that did receive a designation. I think we got it back in 2013 and then we spent the majority of times since then accumulating the data and validating the expense, and that led to the accrual you saw in the quarter. So that drove the vast bulk of the one-time benefit that we saw in the quarter. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : And, Seamus, it's Roger. With respect to the manuscript, as you say, the first manuscript which describes the results of the 024 study, you asked about what would be the second publication. And there will be a number of publications that will come out of the study. Although it's not an enormous study, there's still a lot of data there. And the first thing is to step through the primary and secondary endpoints and the characteristics of the treatment results. And thereafter, there'll be a lot of color and shading that will be added in other publications. It's important data to get out there. My view, looking at the data, is that they're potentially practice-changing and it's important that there be a chance to review that. Those data of course wouldn't be available for review by NCCN or other agencies until such time as publication takes place. Then you also raised a question about our interaction with regulatory agencies. And all I can say about that is we've done our discussions. We're working closely with regulatory agencies to understand the basis for filing supplements in the context of having multiple reviews. And maybe if I could elevate just a little bit, I would say that the workload for regulatory agencies, given the very large number of studies that we and our competitors are doing in this field, is quite substantial. And how best to manage that workload and evaluate all these new data that are coming in is something I think that FDA and other regulatory agencies are wrestling with. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move on to the next person, please. Operator : It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First, you talk about the advantage of being first, which I agree with in front line lung. But do you expect that there will be off-label use for KEYTRUDA in patients with less than 50% PD-L1 expression? And when are those trials that the all comers, or the over 1% expressors and above, when are they expected to read out? Then I have a question for Ken. On almost every conference call or meeting you've hinted at the desire to do deals, business development, the importance of that to your long-term strategy, yet we really haven't seen much in the way of deals this year. The deals have been relatively small in nature. Is that what the hint is today, that the types of deals you're likely to do are likely to be like the Moderna deals or the smaller deals? Or should we still expect that Merck is likely to announce a major transaction, which is something that I think you signaled earlier in the year? And when you think about the company's outlook over the next five years with a number of LOEs, how important is a large transaction to your growth strategy? Thanks very much. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Yeah, so, Jami, this is Adam. So first of all, being first to market does matter. And as you said, I think it is an advantage. We will only obviously be able to promote it based upon the label that we have, and therefore be in expressors greater than 50%. Whether there's off-label use, we'll have to see what NCCN decides and what individual physicians decide. It wouldn't surprise me if they decide that, but again, it's nothing that we would ever try to encourage or promote. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And on business development, thank you for the question, Jami. What I am signaling is that business development remains a very important priority and we're very actively engaged in trying to find the best scientific innovation. Our main focus is to continue to augment our Phase 2 and early-stage pipeline. We remain very active with new partnerships and collaborations and we're also looking actively for bolt-on acquisitions in key growth areas. Now from our perspective, I think it's important to remember that for us, a bolt-on acquisition is not defined by size. When we talk about a bolt-on, we're focusing more on finding the right assets that can augment our pipeline as compared to doing a large deal just, for example, cross synergies. So all of that being said, we are looking very carefully. We're taking our time and we're being diligent in seeking out the right assets at the right valuation. And I think that's what you should read into this. And I think if you look across what's happened in the industry, there has been a re-rating of certain assets, but those boards and management teams are also taking time to assess what they actually think will happen going forward in their future. So I wouldn't read anything into it other than the deals we've done and the ones that we think can add value, and we'll continue to look at all kinds of deals going forward. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Ken. Darla, can we move on to the next question, please? Operator : From Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes. Excuse me. Good morning. Roger, brief question. In the Julie Graff data, did she actually see responses in prostate cancer patients who were PD-L1 negative, and/or was that what informed you to decide to do three cohorts in the 199 trial? And then briefly, Adam, on ZEPATIER, can you say to date what percentage of sales are government, from government channels versus those from commercial channels, realizing that may change over the next six months? Thanks very much. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : Tony, it's Roger. The Graff data are \u2013 it's a very small study and you're talking about just a handful of responders. It's unknown in each one of these settings whether the PD-L1 biomarker, and this is part of a large set of biomarkers that we look at, whether the PD-L1 biomarker is relevant to that particular tumor type and if it is, whether the relevant index is the tumor proportion score, or more broadly, the combination of both tumor cells and inflammatory cells. So still a lot of work being done in the area of biomarkers and how predictive they are. Stay tuned. I think the important thing to note is that in a tumor type that was previously believed to be refractory, that is where an immune-oncology would provide no benefit, there's clear evidence there could be some. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : And Tony, this is Adam. So we've sold $112 million of ZEPATIER for the quarter and again, we're still early into the launch. I mentioned that we have some Medicare Part D wins that start July 1, so obviously you won't see a lot of sales from those in the quarter. Most of the sales in the quarter came from the VA and some other segments where we had utilization for patients with renal insufficiency. But as we move forward, I would expect that the mix is going to change substantially. And as Medicaid \u2013 I'm sorry. As Medicare Part D commercial ramps up, I think you'll see a very different mix. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Adam. Darla, move on to the next person please. Operator : It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Adam, do you have any comments on REMICADE dynamics and that rate of erosion and how you've chose to play defense there? And maybe you could comment on how that experience so far shapes your view on the potential for biosimilars from an offensive standpoint. And Rob, since we don't have the 10-Q, would you mind providing cash flow from ops and receivables if you have those handy? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Hi, Gregg. This is Adam. With regard to REMICADE, our strategy all along has been to try to hold onto as many existing patients that were currently treated as we can. And I think we've done a very good job with that. Most of our loss of revenue came from reference pricing due to lower prices from the biosimilars. However, we're certainly starting to see that we're not only losing new patients, but there are some countries in Scandinavia, and even some other larger countries, that are beginning to think about substituting therapeutically even existing patients. So I do believe that we're going to continue to see erosion for REMICADE, that the biosimilar impacts, they are accelerating and they're going to continue as we go through the year. As I think about biosimilars in the future, I think the key is going to be what your order entry is into the marketplace and being first or second in the marketplace will matter. Each market molecule's going to be different and we're going to deploy different strategies based upon those markets. You see a different strategy, for example, that you might use in the UK and France versus Germany. And we'll have to be very specific by market how we launch our biosimilar portfolio. At the same time what I'd say is SIMPONI grew 16% ex-exchange. So even though you see an impact on REMICADE, you haven't seen that go over into the other anti-TNFs, and therefore we expect to continue to see good growth from SIMPONI. Robert M. Davis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Gregg, this is Rob. We don't have the specifics for cash flow and the working capital you're asking for this morning. We're still finalizing some of those parts. But in general, we tend to continue to see strong trends in cash flow and continue to see overall working capital improving across inventory and payables. And then on the receivables side, there's a little bit of a swing back. But I think part of that's due to just as we're launching new products, the mix of the receivables on those relative to what we're seeing on the others. But there's nothing new or significant, continuing trends, and you'll see the exact numbers when you see the Q. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Darla. We'll go to the next question, please. Operator : It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. I was hoping, Ken, that you could paint a picture of how you see the next couple of years unfolding. Obviously you don't provide long-term revenue guidance, but you have some big growth drivers in KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER and at the same time, you'll be experiencing the patent expirations of VYTORIN and ZETIA and CUBICIN. And so I guess I'm asking, could you help frame for us how you see the evolution of Merck's revenue base and what other key revenue contributors you see to help offset the patent expiration pressures? Thank you. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, obviously we're not in a position, as you suggested, to give any 2017 guidance yet. But we are actively looking across our portfolio at the best ways, as Rob said, to balance in the near term investments while continuing to drive long-term growth. We do anticipate some headwinds from several LOE's as you suggested ZETIA, VYTORIN, CUBICIN and NASONEX. But we're also pleased that we are maintaining the steady growth of JANUVIA as a foundation to launch these products like KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER. Beyond that, as you know, we have things that are coming out of our pipeline. Roger made reference to building onto our diabetes franchise with ertu [ertugliflozin] as well as odanacatib. Next year we're looking forward to being unblinded with respect to our base inhibitor and anacetrapib. So those would be some of the internal things. And then, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, we continue to look at business development and inorganic growth as an important critical part of our strategy going forward. As I sit here today, obviously I haven't anything new to announce to you. But I just want you to know that we're actively pursuing value-creating, inorganic growth opportunities. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Ken. Darla, we'll move on to the next person, please. Operator : It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. Adam, I know you're well aware of the significant price erosion in the hep C market as a result of increased competition. As you look at the immuno-oncology market, how comfortable are you with long-term price sustainability there as the number treatment options increase over the next few years? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : yeah, so I would look at them as separate and distinct markets and I think the big difference is Medicare Part D versus the way in which the hepatitis C products are reimbursed. So I think there's different dynamics in those two markets. With that said, as you look forward and you think about combinations of potential immunotherapies or combinations with other therapies, we have to find additional ways to think about contracting with customers and working with customers differently than the way in which you do today. It's remarkable when you think about the number of indications that we're studying KEYTRUDA for and we think about how we're building this huge wall of data. It's going to be real hard for followers to match us with the data that we're going to have over time. And we're going to have to find ways to work with payers so that they can really find the right way to ensure the patients that need our monotherapy or our combination therapies in the future have access to it. So we're going to continue to think about the right ways to do pricing and contracting. But I feel pretty confident, as I sit here today, that we'll be able to maintain good contracts and access as we move forward. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Darla. We'll move on. Operator : To Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, morning. Adam, can you talk about the emerging markets broadly, what's going on there with your products? Obviously excluding Venezuela, which we know what is going on. And then secondly, can you talk about the JANUVIA, JANUMET franchise overseas? And just give us a flavor for how those products are doing relative to all the changes going on in the broader diabetes market. Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Yeah. So, first of all, with regard to emerging markets, ex-Venezuela, ex-foreign exchange we grew about 6%. So we continue to have good growth in the emerging markets. And if you look at China, we had 11% growth ex-foreign exchange. So the growth, albeit not as good as it was couple years ago, it continues to be robust. With that said, lumping emerging markets together today is not a good idea because you have very different dynamics in terms of what's occurring in a market like China versus what's occurring in a market like Russia or what's happening in Argentina. So we really do focus market by market what our opportunities for growth are, and then we titrate our expense base in those markets based upon the opportunities. But I do believe that the emerging markets will provide growth going forward and remain an important opportunity for us as we move forward. With regard to JANUVIA outside the U.S., we continue to see good growth in Europe and Canada and that growth is coming from volume. And the volume growth in most of those markets is very strong. I'd say the biggest issue we're facing is the fact that our market share is so high in countries like Germany that it's hard to grow market share so we have to continue to find ways to grow from sulphonylureas and ultimately from metformin. But there's hundreds of millions of patients that need to be treated outside the U.S. If you look at the emerging markets, we have strong double-digit growth of JANUVIA. I think that's going to continue over time. And we really have not gotten NRDL approval for JANUVIA in China yet. So once that's achieved, I think that that represents another opportunity for us for growth of the JANUVIA franchise outside of the U.S. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Adam. Darla, I know we're getting to the top of the hour and there's other calls in this space today. We're going to try to squeeze in one more question. Operator : It's from Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. Pivoting towards HIV, from the data you recently presented, it looks like you have once daily ISENTRESS. Could you talk to both the defensive properties of having that molecule given the erosion of that (57:45) market from Gilead and GSK or (57:49) as we've seen historically? But also can you talk about the potential offensive strategies given you now have a base for a single tablet once-a-day regimen? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Executive Vice President, President-Global Human Health : Yeah, so as you look at our HIV franchise, obviously we've been losing dollar share and volume based upon what's occurring in the competitive set in the marketplace, so we are really glad that we're going to have a q.d. ISENTRESS. And I think it will be very helpful for us. The key is generally speaking we don't give guidance at a product level, but it's unlikely that the introduction of q.d. ISENTRESS is going to be able to return the franchise to growth. I think it's going to enable us to be able to compete better within that marketplace as it exists. But I wouldn't look for very strong growth moving forward based upon that product for the franchise. Roger M. Perlmutter - EVP & President-Merck Research Laboratories : And if I could just say \u2013 it's Roger \u2013 we have quite a number of compounds that we have developed that have been treating properties with respect to HIV therapy that are all in early development. I haven't had a chance to talk about those in an earnings call setting, but will hope to as more data become available. Kenneth C. Frazier - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Let me just close by saying this was a strong quarter. We continue to execute on our innovation-based strategy and we continue to look for the best opportunities for long-term growth with respect to things like KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, but we're also eager to find the best opportunities that will create long-term value for our shareholders both inorganically and organically. Thank you very much. Teri Loxam - Investor Relations Contact : Thanks, Darla. That concludes the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Merck's Q2 2016 sales and earnings conference call.

Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners Operator : Good morning. My name is Darla and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Merck's Q3 2016 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Darla, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's third quarter 2016 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We've also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. I'd like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings including item 1A in the 2015 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements and you can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on Merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the recent ESMO Congress where the latest data were presented from our KEYTRUDA, clinical development program for lung cancer, and simultaneously published in two major scientific journals. Many have noted the significant implications these results may have for the treatment of lung cancer, the deadliest type of cancer in the United States. And just yesterday, the FDA approved KEYTRUDA the only PD-1 therapy for the first line treatment of metastatic lung cancer making it an option for tens of thousands of lung cancer patients in the United States. For the first time in decades, the standard of care may change for lung cancer patients offering them renewed hope. This advancement is what Merck is all about and we are honored to be making a real difference in the fight against cancer. The recent KEYTRUDA achievements are proof of concept, if you will, that our innovation strategy is working. Our sustained investment in medically important R&D has yielded a number of recent approvals in regulatory milestones across the various therapeutic areas in our human health and animal health businesses. Turning now to the results. In the third quarter, we reported a strong performance that reflects growth across several priority programs, including our vaccines portfolio and also KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER which are continuing to launch around the world. We remain confident in the strength of our portfolio from our JANUVIA franchise which is core to our business and continues to maintain its leadership position in the DPP-4 class to BRIDION, which is quickly contributing to our growth, while still in the launch phase here in the United States. Looking ahead, we will continue to follow the science, pursuing the best internal and external scientific opportunities that will enable us to take on some of the world's greatest health challenges. That is why business development remains an important priority in achieving our goals. Our appetite for business development has not changed. We continue to seek the best opportunities and collaborations with the right financial valuation to augment our portfolio and pipeline. In closing, our performance in the quarter positions us well to continue to invest in our business and to deliver a balanced, differentiated portfolio of medicines and vaccines that will generate long-term growth and sustainable value for shareholders and society. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken noted, in the third quarter we delivered solid sales and earnings growth on both a nominal and ex-FX basis. Total company revenues were $10.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, revenue increased 6%. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses contributed 6% and 7% growth respectively, excluding exchange in the quarter and despite an approximately $170 million headwind from sales in Venezuela in the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, we went to the SIMADI rate in the fourth quarter of 2015, so this is the last quarter in which we will face this headwind. I should note that the year-over-year increase in Human Health sales in the third quarter includes an approximately $200 million benefit from the pull-forward of customer purchases from the fourth quarter. These were mainly due to the timing of shipments in Japan in anticipation of an ERP go-live and the timing of CDC vaccine purchases. Taking into account our performance in the first three quarters of 2016 and our expectations through year-end, we are narrowing and raising our full-year revenue guidance to $39.7 billion to $40.2 billion. We continue to anticipate foreign exchange will have an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact on revenue in 2016. Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 75.3%, an increase of 20 basis points. Product mix was the primary driver of the increase versus the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat versus last year with margins in the fourth quarter expected to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we see the mix impact of generic competition for CUBICIN and ZETIA in the U.S. market and declines in FX hedge gains year-on-year which flow 100% to gross margin. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were roughly flat versus the third quarter of 2015 as declines in marketing and administrative expenses largely offset an increase in research and development expenses in the quarter. While we are committed to delivering a leveraged P&L over the long-term, it may be more challenging in the near-term, given the impending loss of market exclusivity for ZETIA and VYTORIN in the U.S. and investments that we need to make to support the growing opportunity for KEYTRUDA. That being said, we remain disciplined and continue to look for opportunities to reallocate resources across the portfolio. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.8% this quarter. We expect the full-year rate to trend to the higher end of our previously communicated range of 21.5% and 22.5% which includes the impact of the R&D tax credit. Taken together, we earned $1.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis, delivering 11% growth versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%. Of the $0.11 increase in non-GAAP EPS this quarter compared to Q3 2015, approximately $0.04 were related to the customer purchases in Japan that I mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.78 this quarter. Given our results in the first nine months of the year, we are also narrowing and raising our full-year non-GAAP EPS range. We now expect to earn $3.71 to $3.78 per share with foreign exchange still expected to have an approximately one percentage point negative impact. On a GAAP basis, we now expect to earn $2.02 to $2.09 per share for the full year. Altogether, our top and bottom-line growth in the quarter, driven by solid operational performance, sets us up for a strong 2016 overall. With that, I will turn the call over to Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights in the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter, and my comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health delivered another strong quarter with sales of $9.4 billion or an increase of 6%. We drove growth across many of our core areas including oncology, vaccines and hospital and specialty care. I'll highlight now a few of our key franchises and product launches and I'll start with oncology. We continued to execute on a launch of KEYTRUDA and we are excited by the long-term potential for this important brand. KEYTRUDA generated $356 million in sales in the third quarter with about half of the sales generated outside of the United States. In the U.S., sales were driven primarily from melanoma where KEYTRUDA continues to be the leading immuno-oncology therapy, as well as from the ongoing launch in second-line lung cancer. In August, we also gained approval for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer and we began to launch that indication immediately. This represents the first new treatment option for these patients in almost a decade. In addition, and very importantly, we are ready to launch in first-line lung cancer where we just received FDA approval for the high PD-L1 expressing patients, those who express PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%. We know from several data sources including our own clinical trials that this patient population represents about 25% to 30% of non-small cell lung cancer patients. In addition, we received expanded labeling for second-line lung cancer based upon our KEYNOTE-010 data. So now, patients that express any level of PD-L1 are eligible for KEYTRUDA in a second-line setting. Based upon these two new patient populations for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer, we have already begun to see an acceleration of testing for PD-L1 at diagnosis. Outside of the United States, we've launched our melanoma indication in more than 50 markets and we continue to see broad adoption of KEYTRUDA as a leading metastatic melanoma treatment. We've also recently gained EMA approval in second-line lung cancer for all PD-L1 positive patients. We're working through the reimbursements process in each country which, as you know, can take some time. But we expect that we'll start to ramp up nicely in Europe once reimbursement comes through. In addition, we're preparing for the upcoming launch of KEYTRUDA in Japan where we recently received an indication for melanoma. While we've already achieved a number of milestones for KEYTRUDA, this is just the beginning. We remain dedicated to establishing KEYTRUDA as the leader in lung cancer. In addition, we are very optimistic about the long-term potential for KEYTRUDA across many different tumor types. Moving now to primary care. The JANUVIA franchise generated sales of almost $1.6 billion this quarter, a 2% decline compared to the same quarter last year. Outside of the United States, we saw strong growth of 9%. This included favorable impact of about $30 million from the timing of customer purchases in Japan, which was offset by an unfavorable impact of roughly the same magnitude from sales in Venezuela. In the U.S., we saw a decline of 10%, which was anticipated given the tough comparison to third quarter of 2015, where we saw a large buy-in. TRx trends remain strong in the United States with growth of 4%, and JANUVIA continues to be the leading DPP-4 treatment of choice in the market. We expect revenue growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year versus fourth quarter of 2015. Formulary discussions for 2017 are nearly complete and we expect similar access in the United States for JANUVIA to what we've had this year. We've seen and expect to continue to see increased pricing pressure in the United States for JANUVIA but we are pleased by the continued strong volume growth, and thus far, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures. We remain confident in our diabetes franchise and we're pleased with our continued strength in this brand globally. Now moving to our vaccine business. We had another strong quarter with sales of $2 billion or 27% growth. The increase was primarily driven by GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines and PNEUMOVAX. GARDASIL sales were $860 million globally, a 38% increase versus last year. In the United States, GARDASIL sales grew 33% driven by the timing of public sector purchases but also higher demand. On October 7, the FDA approved a two-dose regimen for 9 to 14-year-olds, and just last week, ACIP voted to recommend two doses for certain of these patients. This is aligned with the dosing already adopted in some markets outside of the U.S. And it will have a negative impact on sales for GARDASIL moving forward. PNEUMOVAX delivered another strong quarter with 24% growth versus prior year. The United States growth was primarily driven by demand with better follow-through from ACIP recommendations for patients 65 and above to receive PNEUMOVAX one year after Prevnar. Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by Japan. Finally, in hospital and specialty care, sales grew 5% to $2.2 billion. Growth in acute care and contributions from launch products were partially offset by declines in REMICADE. REMICADE sales were down 28% this quarter as tenders and new patient starts increasingly go to biosimilars. We expect the declines in REMICADE to continue given the competitive pressures, but also increased switching. Now moving to ZEPATIER. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in the first year of launch. ZEPATIER's product profile and positioning are resonating well with both healthcare professionals and payers. As we continued to communicate last quarter, we have seen some early wins in both the public and private sectors for 2016 and 2017. This includes priority access in the VA, favorable access within the Medicaid segment and key wins in the Medicare Part D and commercial segments. It is important to note though, that some of our major formulary wins had effective dates of either July 1 of this year or January 1 of next year. So we don't expect to see the full effect of these wins immediately. Given the time it takes from formulary success to getting patients on drug, we're only just beginning to see the impact from those plans that became effective this summer. We are also looking forward to launching ZEPATIER in Japan this quarter where it was recently approved. On the hospital side, we had a stronger-than-expected quarter with CUBICIN as generics only entered the market at the end of the quarter. Now that there are two generics in the market, we experienced a decline for CUBICIN which appears to be similar to fast erosion rates that we've seen for other hospital products once generics launched in the U.S. Finally, BRIDION had another good quarter with almost 50% growth driven by strong demand across ex-U.S. markets as well as a good ramp-up in the U.S. following our launch earlier this year. While Japan is currently our largest market in the world, over time we believe that the U.S. market will become the biggest for BRIDION. In closing, we continue to deliver solid performance across many products. We have good momentum and good execution across our core focus areas. And although we'll have to contend with the ZETIA and VYTORIN patent expiry in fourth quarter of this year into next year, we believe we are well positioned for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Adam. In the third quarter Merck Research Laboratories made substantial progress on multiple fronts, first in the area of infectious disease. Based on our landmark Phase III studies and following the favorable vote of the FDA Antimicrobial Advisory Committee, the FDA approved ZINPLAVA for the reduction of the risk of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients at high risk for such recurrences. I'll remind you that ZINPLAVA is not an antimicrobial agent per se, but contains a monoclonal antibody, bezlotoxumab, which is directed against the toxin made by C. difficile and important in the pathogenesis of C. difficile-mediated disease. Review of the ZINPLAVA file is also proceeding in the EU. Also in the infectious disease area, last week we announced top-line results for our Phase III study testing the ability of letermovir to reduce the risk of cytomegalovirus disease in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplants. These programs are only the most recent of our very broad efforts to improve therapies for infectious diseases including three important Phase III programs : ZERBAXA, for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia; relebactam to broaden the spectrum of our antibiotic, PRIMAXIN; and doravirine, a non-nucleosidal HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with what we believe to be improved characteristics versus currently available therapies. As Adam mentioned, we continue to demonstrate impressive activity for ZEPATIER, our hepatitis C virus therapy, including in patients known to have used intravenous drugs. We're also making progress in advancing our triplet therapy for HCV infection, with presentations describing the efficacy of this combination across genotypes to be presented at the upcoming AASLD meeting. But much of the excitement during the past quarter focused on KEYTRUDA, our PD-1 specific antibody for the treatment of malignant disease. As Ken and Adam mentioned, the FDA has just announced an updated label for KEYTRUDA which includes our KEYNOTE-010 study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA is superior to traditional chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including those patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 in as few as 1% of cells. The revised label also includes our KEYNOTE-024 study which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In brief, KEYNOTE-024 was a randomized active comparator controlled Phase III study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA, when used for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic, non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 and who lack mutations in the EGF receptor or ALK genes, is superior to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy of the type that has been the standard of care in this disease for more than two decades. These data are important because KEYTRUDA treatment, at a fixed dose of 200 milligrams every three weeks, reduced the risk of tumor progression or death by 50% and reduced the overall risk of death by 40%. Moreover, KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with a lower rate of serious adverse effects than was observed in the chemotherapy treatment arm. We believe, as Bruce Johnson suggested in an accompanying editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, that KEYTRUDA will come to represent a new standard of care for appropriate lung cancer patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, a population that represents between 25% to 30% of those presenting with advanced non-small cell lung cancers. Also in the third quarter, we received approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in lung cancer in the European Union, again based on our KEYNOTE-010 data. Review of the KEYNOTE-024 study is ongoing by the Committee for Human Medical Products (sic) [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] for the European Medicines Agency. Beyond these very important results, during the third quarter we also obtained data from our KEYNOTE-021 and cohort G study demonstrating that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with traditional platinum doublet-based chemotherapy to yield objective response rates far superior to what we've seen with chemotherapy alone. In this study, patients with metastatic, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed any level of PD-L1 were enrolled provided they lacked EGF receptor or ALK gene mutations. Progression pre-survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA-containing treatment arm. The results of this study were published simultaneously in Lancet Oncology. While this was a Phase II study in a relatively small cohort, including just 123 patients, the results complement an earlier single-arm study employing the same combination regimen which we presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology in June. Patients in that cohort achieved an objective response rate of 71% and the objective response rate was 55% in cohort G. Hence, there is reason to believe that combinations of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, perhaps acting through an immune activation mechanism, will work in concert with KEYTRUDA to provide superior responses in advanced lung cancer patients in the future. Additional confirmatory studies, including our KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies, are already underway. Finally, last week we announced that the independent data monitoring committee supervising our KEYNOTE-045 study in second-line urothelial cancer involving patients with relapsed or refractory bladder or related uroepithelial cancer, recommended that the study be stopped on the basis of improved overall survival in the KEYTRUDA treatment arm. KEYNOTE-045 is a Phase III, active comparator-controlled, monotherapy study in a very sick patient population; however, the results obtained in this setting mimic results from the first-line KEYNOTE-052 study that we presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting earlier this month, which showed impressive response rates in the treatment of urothelial malignancy. In sum, KEYTRUDA is changing the cancer treatment landscape. Already approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma, second-line non-small cell lung cancer, first-line non-small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck for which we obtained FDA approval in August. We have obtained what we believe to be registration-worthy data in urothelial cancer, have more than 30 registration-appropriate studies underway, have developed data supporting the activity of KEYTRUDA in 22 different malignancies and have more than 360 clinical studies currently underway, including more than 200 combination studies evaluating responses in more than 30 different tumor types. Needless to say, we anticipate additional regulatory filings in the fourth quarter and of course in 2017. Finally, I note that we're making good progress in our diabetes programs. Our insulin glargine filing was accepted for review by the FDA. And with our colleagues at Pfizer, we expect to file for approval of ertugliflozin as monotherapy and as a fixed-dose combination with metformin or with sitagliptin before the end of the year. Now I'll turn the call back to Teri. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Darla, we're going to get onto our Q&A process. Analysts, if you'll please limit your questions to one or two so that we can get as many questions in as possible, that would be appreciated. Darla, over to you. Operator : Thank you. Your first question is from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Couple of questions. On business development, you mentioned it remains an important priority. It's a message you've had throughout the year. Two questions on this. I'm wondering how the news of August 5 had suddenly changed the outlook for KEYTRUDA, might change how you think about M&A. You could argue that doing a bigger deal now runs a risk of disrupting the focus that you'll need on immuno-oncology for example. And kind of related to that, can you give us some idea of the upper limit to deals you might be considering? Is everything on the table? Are you looking more at mid-sized deals or smaller? And then second question is on KEYTRUDA and IDO and the timing for making a possible go, no go decision for Phase III in lung cancer. Is that something that we would learn about maybe in the next six months or so? Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Tim. Ken Frazier here. Let me start on the business development question. So I said that it remains an important priority, and you should know we're actively engaged and looking for ways of augmenting our pipeline. And in so doing, it's important to remember that we are not limited by size or by phase. We're going to continue to look for the best partnerships and collaborations. But fundamentally, we're looking for bolt-on opportunities as a company. Your question about whether or not KEYTRUDA changes our approach to business development, not really. We need to augment our pipeline. We continue to be active in that area. But I would not say that the August 5 news has changed our fundamental approach to business development. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Tim, it's Roger. With respect to IDO1 and decision-making in lung, we continue to pursue the melanoma study with our colleagues at Incyte, and we are very interested in the IDO1 combination. As we develop more data for that, we'll be able to make a decision. And your timeframe is probably about right. I can't say specifically because these are event-driven studies. But sometime I would imagine towards the middle of next year we'd be in a position where we'd be able to make decisions about how much activity we're seeing and whether or not we should proceed in a registration-enabling study using that molecule. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Darla, next question, please. Operator : It's from Colin Bristow, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the quarter. So first on KEYTRUDA in lung, clearly you're going to be a lone and dominant player in first-line for the next 18 months. But how do you view the level of competitive threats from Bristol and Astra's IO-IO combos? And then just what are the combinations you are evaluating which you're most excited about in terms of the potential in the lung setting? And then second on KEYTRUDA's share in second-line lung, can you just talk about how much of a headwind to sales your requirement for PD-L1 testing has been and then what your expectations are for share sales in this setting, given the testing's now going to become standard? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah, so let me start. First of all, we are thrilled to be the first to launch in first line lung. And I give Roger and his team a lot of credit for the design of the trials and the ability for us to actually be the first to have approval there. We are always looking at competition. We are always mindful of competition. And we want to make sure that we do everything we can to get as much utilization, appropriate utilization obviously, for the indication that we have, as quickly as possible and to really cement our product, KEYTRUDA, as foundational in the treatment of first-line lung cancer. With regard to second-line lung, right now we have about a 10% market share of the second-line lung market in the United States. But if you look at patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50, that's where the majority of our market share is. And our market share is much, much higher in that group. With the new data that we have in first-line lung and a new indication, there's no doubt that PD-L1 testing will become standard. We're already seeing very significant increases in PD-L1 testing since the ESMO meeting. So I believe that the barrier of needing to be tested in second line for PD-L1 will be removed to a very large degree. And the fact that we now have an indication for all PD-L1 positive patients in the second-line setting, I believe that we should be a leader in not just first line, but second-line as well over time. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Colin, it's Roger. Standing back from this, I think one has to be impressed by the general efficacy of combinations of KEYTRUDA with other agents. And that's true with respect to PD-1 blockade and other agents pre-clinically, but also clinically. So if you look at combinations, for example, with immune-active agents like T-VEC, there's impressive evidence of activity. There's evidence of activity with other immunologic agents, but there's also, as we've talked about, very impressive combination activity with chemotherapy. And in a way, the 021G results in lung cancer basically put a floor on what to expect from these combinations. At a minimum, you're going to have to see the kinds of response rates and progression-free survival results that we've seen in 021G. Keep in mind, that study, as you know, is just 123 patients and nevertheless a highly significant result with respect to progression-free survival. Over time, we'll see if an overall survival result is obtained there. Of course the crossover is so large in those populations, it may not be possible to see it. But I think that there is reason to believe that KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with a lot of things, and oncologists have a lot of experience using traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. So there's reason to believe that those kinds of combinations will work well. That said, one shouldn't discount other kinds of immunologic combinations, including combinations with CTLA-4 directed agents. We've done those studies and shown that there is activity for those combinations. The question is ultimately what provides the best balance in terms of therapeutic efficacy and safety and tolerability? It's early days. It will take some time to sort that out, but we'll be pursuing all of those things. And we are. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I have a couple related ones. Payer question on first-line lung. So what limitations would you guys expect on both duration or patients below the 50% cut point? Are there lessons to be learned from the second-line experience? And then, Roger, you mention crossover. So, some have talked about the lower rate of crossover for 024 as being a major contributor to the OS benefit. Just want to get your perspective on this with an eye towards the crossover rates that we could see in 189 or 407. Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah, Geoff. So this is Adam. First of all, if you look at payers in first-line lung, we haven't seen any limitations on duration, and I don't think we'll see any limitations. With regard to people below PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50, we'll have to see what happens there. What we've seen in second-line is as long as they're PD-L1 positive that the payers are not pushing back very much on the physicians. So the physicians still have a lot of control if they're PD-L1 positive. I would assume it'll be the same in lung for first-line, but it's obviously early to tell. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Geoff, it's Roger. With respect to crossover, clearly, if you have 100% crossover and it occurs early, then you're simply testing the treatment a few weeks apart, and under those circumstances, it's unlikely you'd be able to demonstrate an overall survival benefit. That said, patients in a chemotherapy-controlled study \u2013 chemotherapy does have effect, and so crossover tends to occur later as a result. And under those circumstances, it will be possible to demonstrate an overall survival effect. It's a fairly complicated set of differential equations one would have to apply to this to understand exactly what the puts and takes are. But my guess is that because the treatment effects seem to be really quite large in the 024 study, my guess is that we'll be able to see those kinds of treatment effects as well in the chemotherapy combinations. Time will tell. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Darla, next question, please. Operator : It's from Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Hello? Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Hi, Andrew. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Good morning. Just following on from the earlier question, could you just update us in relation to your collaboration with NanoString in terms of when this could be an approvable diagnostic that could drive broader usage in patients who may not have the higher expression levels of PD-L1? Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right, Andrew. So the collaboration with NanoString is designed to obtain better, really better diagnostic mechanisms because we know that PD-L1 expression is an imperfect biomarker. That said, the NanoString test does not exclude PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression is an indicator of an inflammatory response because the PD-L1 transcriptional unit is under the control of cytokines like gamma interferon, and wherever there's an immune response, you'll see PD-L1 up-regulation. Much of the NanoString signature involves other genes that are similarly regulated. So it isn't the case that the NanoString test will look totally different from a PD-L1 test. It will just have a better receiver-operator characteristics so that you will have better sensitivity and specificity. So I guess we continue to refine that signature. It's working quite well actually, but it'll take a while before we can actually reduce it in practice. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Next question, please, Darla? Operator : It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I appreciate the comments you made in the prepared remarks about the leverage and it may take time given the investment. Can you just maybe give a little more color? We get a lot of questions on how to think about 2017 versus 2016, and I know you're not ready to give guidance, but just would you expect any degree of margin expansion as we look at this point on how 2017 would look relative to this year? Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah, no. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): If I could just throw one second question in, this is actually, maybe just moving away from KEYTRUDA now. There's a lot of great news there. Just beyond KEYTRUDA and everything you're working on there in oncology, maybe, Roger, if you could just highlight what are the other key pipeline assets that you think people may be overlooking? I know obviously you have the base and the CTP coming out next year, but I think people view those as higher risk. So are there other ones that you could point to that people should keep an eye out to think about diversification beyond KEYTRUDA? Thanks. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah, Vamil. This is Rob. Thanks for the question. Obviously we're not in a position to give guidance for 2017 this morning, but just directionally, as I said in the prepared comments, we're moving into a period where we will have the pressure from ZETIA VYTORIN coming. And that being said, we have the growing opportunity clinically we see with KEYTRUDA, and that's why we made the specific comments we did, which is while we remain committed to leverage long term, we recognize that in specific periods we may not be able to achieve that given the level of investment we need to make in R&D and the cost we've already taken out elsewhere in the organization. So more to come as we get through the next quarter and we give specific guidance. But that was the purpose of the comment I made in the prepared remarks, to highlight what we see as a great opportunity with KEYTRUDA, and we're going to invest behind it appropriately. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Vamil, with respect to key pipeline assets, obviously all the Phase III programs and those that are proceeding through registration investors are aware of. We're very excited about the work that we're doing overall in infectious diseases which includes the antibacterial programs, as I mentioned, relebactam of course pretty interesting, and doravirine in the HIV area. We actually have quite a large HIV program which is pretty exciting, and obviously the HCV program and triplet data are very important. And beyond that, of course, the ertu [ertugliflozin] filing with our colleagues at Pfizer. Given our traditional strength now in diabetes and the opportunity to combine a really very well-behaved SGLT-2 inhibitor with JANUVIA, that can be an important opportunity as well. Nothing there that investors necessarily have missed, but I think important things to pay attention to. Early in the pipeline, there's an awful lot going on, but time doesn't permit me to really review that stuff. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC : Oh, thanks for the questions. So couple of quick ones. First off, can you talk to us a little bit how the PD-L1 testing dynamic is actually shaking out percentage of basically lung cancer patients that are being tested with PD-L1 today? And where do you see that sort of maxing out in the next 12 months or so? And maybe can you give us a little bit of a sense of where you're seeing the majority of that uptake? Is it really starting at the academic hospitals or are the academic hospitals relatively fully penetrated and then the community's going to take a bit longer? Just trying to get a better sense of how the PD-L1 testing dynamic works. And then secondly, how do the tests actually come back, and in what timeframe? Maybe you can just help us understand what information is provided to the physician when they request a PD-L1 test and how that information come backs? And then a last question is biosimilars. Can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about the opportunity for biosimilars for Merck specifically? And how you would encourage investors to think about that? Thanks so much. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay. So let me address the questions on PD-L1 testing. I'll focus first on the U.S. because the dynamics are a little bit different in some other markets in the world. In the United States, about 60% of physicians are testing PD-L1. This was prior to ESMO. We don't have any new data on that percentage after ESMO. At the same time, we estimated that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients were being tested prior to ESMO. I get weekly data, and it's not perfect but you can certainly see a trend break where there's a significant increase in the number of patients that are being tested for PD-L1 right after ESMO data was released. So I expect the numbers I just provided you will increase significantly, but I think it's important to remember that even if you look at EGFR testing, it took a while for that to become standard. And even today, after years, about 80% to 85% of patients are routinely tested. So I think there's probably a ceiling of somewhere between 80% to 85% of PD-L1 testing that'll occur over time. But with that said, it does take a little while to ramp up, albeit it's ramping up faster. If you look at the length of time it takes to be tested, it's about the same as all other testing for lung cancer. So if a physician asks for PD-L1 testing, they can get it back within a week, typically as fast as they can get ALK testing or EGFR testing. So it's very fast. In terms of the way it comes back to physicians, it's not always consistent. Different labs and then academic institutions, they may give it differently, but right now most of them come back with a number that says PD-L1, 55 or 48, as opposed to just a positive or a negative sign, and we think that that's the way it'll probably continue over time. We're seeing it in academic hospitals, but we're also seeing it, much more utilization even outside of those academic centers as well. With regard to biosimilar opportunity, the bottom line is that we think it is a real commercial opportunity. It's not our strategy. Our strategy remains on innovation, but with $40 billion on a global basis of drugs that are biologics going off patent or at least biosimilars being able to enter the market over the next five years, we think there's a real opportunity for us commercially. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Assuming KEYTRUDA and ALIMTA as a combo won't be reimbursed soon, Roger and Adam, based on your interaction with physicians and payers considering the label and compendium listing, how are you expecting patients that are strong expressers, somewhat below 50%, to be treated in the near term \u2013 35%, 40%, 45%, et cetera? And then on diabetes, Adam, can you talk more about the JANUVIA pricing pressure that you're seeing? What's driving it? And how sustained do you think it will be? Thanks. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Well, I would just say, Gregg, that in my discussions, I think people are wondering about those patients who are younger, otherwise healthy patients without significant comorbidities who present with a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer, and far too often when people present with lung cancer, it is already at a quite advanced stage, and the question of how to give those people the greatest possible benefit. Whether they will choose to use chemotherapy combinations, obviously these are approved drugs, I don't know, but certainly I've heard physicians discuss that. They've wanted to discuss that with me and with others. So I think there is some consideration of that kind of issue. I think in the population of individuals who have significant comorbidities, of course the generally more favorable tolerability of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy will drive decision making. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Gregg, with regard to JANUVIA, as I mentioned in my remarks, we expect to still have very good managed care coverage in 2017 that's consistent with what we had in 2016. So we will have good access. The pricing pressure in the United States, it's certainly increased over the last few years, and there's new in-class competitors that have had significant discounts. And every year, the rebates and discounts have increased, and the same time will be true in 2017. But at the same time with our strong position in terms of market share and our ability to grow our demand, in particular TRx volume, we've been able to offset most of the pricing pressures with the increase in demand. So I think that 2017 of course there'll be more pressure than 2016, but we're optimistic as we move into the year. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks. We'll go to the next question. Operator : It's from John Scotti with Evercore ISI. John Scotti - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a couple on KEYTRUDA and one on hep C. So I was wondering if you could characterize a bit more your base case for what you see the ramp is into the first-line. Given the level of PD-L1 testing you're seeing already, should we expect a fast ramp into the 4Q? Is there a warehouse of patients ready to get on therapy? And then given the exclusion criteria in 024, so brain mets [metastases], autoimmune, EGFR, ALK, et cetera, should we think about the real world addressable population of KEYNOTE-024 as perhaps lower than the 25%, 30% of first-line lung that has PD-L1 expression? Or does that number bake into excluded patients? And then quickly, are there any interims built into the Phase III KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 chemo combo studies that have the potential to stop early? So do we have a sense for when those may be? And then briefly on ZEPATIER, can you characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of discounting? And is discounting increasing? And then you mentioned that new formulary position will take into effect in January of next year and I was just wondering if those are parity contracts or are there any exclusive contracts there? Thanks so much. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. So let me start with first-line lung. There are no bolus of patients that we would expect in first line lung. We expect that as patients are newly diagnosed, that's when they would be considered for utilization for KEYTRUDA. So I would not expect a big bolus that would come into the marketplace in fourth quarter. It's going to be new patient by new patient. Over a year in the United States, Japan and the EU there's about 250,000 patients that are new patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and based on everything that we've seen we believe that 25% to 30% is the right number for you to think about as we look at those patients in the marketplace. And then the last thing I'd say is if you look at ZEPATIER, as I mentioned on previous calls, the marketplace had very significant discounting that was occurring. In fact, the pressure on the rebates and discounts before we even launched into the market was very significant. Despite that, we feel like we've gotten good formulary access. We're doing very well in the VA, Medicare Part D, also in some commercial plans, particularly in the regional plans. As we look at 2017, beginning of January, we do have some new contracts, many of them are at parity, but I think there will be one or two that we'll be able to discuss in the not-too-distant future where we will have a preferred position. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, John, it's Roger. With respect to the exclusion criteria in KEYNOTE-024, I don't think you should worry about that too much. Patients with active brain metastases are treated typically with radiation directed towards those metastases as a medical emergency. Those are the same kinds of patients that we enrolled in the study. There weren't really significant exclusion criteria that are different from what appears in routine practice though. The number that we're quoting is pretty much what you should expect. Our studies are aligned with what's been seen epidemiologically. And for KEYNOTE-189, the ClinicalTrials.gov dates are the dates you should probably use. That study, final data entry's listed in September, and that's probably a good time to think about the 189 study. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We'll move onto our next question, please. Operator : It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. Regarding GARDASIL, could you just tell us what the recent price increase was? And how we should think about the potential decline in sales next year, as there's the shift from three doses to two doses for treatment? So specifically how we should think about netting out the positive benefit of the price increase as we think about the reduction of dosing? And then with respect to KEYTRUDA, could you just tell us what the U.S. sales were by indication in the third quarter so we have a sense of the business mix in the third quarter? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah, sure. Dave, let me start with GARDASIL. If you look at GARDASIL, there's a couple things to think about. First of all, we've had price increases similar to the price increases that we've had in the past so that you haven't seen any difference or acceleration per se. But you also have to realize that the 9-valent costs a bit more than the 4-valent. And most of the patients are moving to the 9-valent vaccine. So I'd net the price increase plus the difference in price between those two, the 4-valent and the 9-valent. The thing that is hard for us to understand right now is if you have two doses, will the doses be given in the same year? Or, for example, if a person presents themselves in August before back-to-school, do they get one dose next year in August? But they don't get the second dose until the following year in August. So there's still some things that we're going to have to wait to see in terms of how physicians treat those patients. Some might get the first dose in January, the second dose in July or August. Some might just get August dose, the one, and then the following year be the second dose. So there's certainly going to be an impact. The magnitude right now we can't be certain of. And if you look at the sales by indication, just to give you a rough amount, about 50% to 55% of our sales were melanoma. About 25% or so was in lung, 5% or so was in head and neck cancer. This is for the U.S. specifically, and then the rest was in all other. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions on issues that were already addressed. Again, Adam, in the biomarker testing process, I'm still unclear about something. You said that there's about 60% testing, but is that 60% including PD-1 or is that 60% testing in general for EGFR and ALK? And where are we with \u2013 in front-line, how many docs or how much of that testing is for PD-1? And again, I know we've been trying to get a sense for timeline, but can you elaborate a little bit longer on how long that's going to take for the market to be prepared for a large penetration of KEYTRUDA in front-line just given that PD-1 testing is probably in its early stages? But if you can elaborate on that. And also, Roger, just on the compendia listing issue for KEYNOTE-021 which we learned was rejected, there was a lot of enthusiasm expressed about that at ESMO. What is the process now? Do you have another opportunity to get that on the compendia listing? Or do we need to wait for the full Phase III trials? Thanks very much. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: First \u2013 so Jami, this is Adam. First of all, I want to be clear on the 60% number that I provided. What I said was approximately 60% of U.S. physicians are testing for PD-L1, not that 60% of patients are being tested. So right now if you look at physicians across the U.S. that treat lung cancer, we believe about 60% of them test at least sometimes for PD-L1. We also believe that about 40% of non-small cell lung cancer new patients are being tested for PD-L1. So that should give you a better idea of what's happening prior to ESMO. Since ESMO, I don't have updates to these numbers because it takes time to have these updated, but I do see a very significant increase in the total number of tests that are being ordered for PD-L1. I don't believe that there's any rate-limiting ability of the labs or the institutions to do the testing, so that's not the issue. The question is how quickly will physicians adopt testing for all patients? And the reason I capped that at about 80% to 85% is because even today, for EGFR testing, we see only about 80% to 85% of patients that are treated. So if we're at 40%, the cap is at 80%, the question is how fast do we go from 40% to the 80% or 85%, and that's what we're working on. With regard to a ramp up for lung, there's not going to be a bolus of patients. The 250,000 patients in the top seven markets around the world come in throughout the entire year, and the question will be, as they come in, how quickly will they be put onto KEYTRUDA if they have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50? Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Jami, it's Roger. With respect to compendium listings, the process is completely independent, of course, and it is simply groups of experts who look at available data and make decisions about guidelines, in essence, so there's no real basis for readdressing that question with the KEYNOTE-021G data which they've already looked at. The compendium analysis I would think would be informed by the availability of more data. Now other things could change, but I think what we would expect is that with the availability of KEYNOTE-189 and others, there'll be the opportunity to pursue it, presuming that those data are actually confirmatory, to pursue labeling for that. And that's probably the next thing that happens in that general area. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : It's from John Boris with SunTrust. John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. Just one related to pricing for Ken. Just on Proposition 61, Ken, which will be on the November 8 ballot in California as a proposed statute, just your thoughts on that proposal since it would create possibly a price ceiling on prescription drug cost paid by state programs, predominantly Medicaid. And can you just remind us what percent of your business is in Medicaid? Second question relates to the one asked by Jami. Can we just get an update on where you are on enrollment on KEYNOTE-189 and any thoughts on interim analyses on that program? Thanks. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: So let me start with Proposition 61. So first of all, we don't break out our sales by channel, but I will say as an overall comment, we have very serious concerns about this measure and its potential impact on patients. And that's why we're part of a growing coalition of groups that are actively opposing that ballot measure in California, because we think it will negatively impact millions of California patients. So we're very active in opposing it. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And John, on KEYNOTE-189 as I said, the thing to think about is the ClinicalTrials.gov date of September of next year is about the time one should expect a data readout. We're not anticipating that we'll have anything before then. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. First one here just following up on John's question, more broadly on drug pricing and public scrutiny. Just seems like there's a lot more focus on drug pricing than any time in recent memory, whether it's Prop 61, the EpiPen hearings, et cetera. So maybe just a question for Ken. Just how do you see this playing out for the industry? Are you guys thinking about price differently than in the past? Should we be thinking about a more challenging pricing environment going forward? Would love to just hear your thoughts on that topic. And then a second one just coming back to some of the business development priorities, I know the focus is on bolt-ons, but when we're thinking about larger details specifically, would Merck be willing to take on single program or product risk in a larger deal? As we're thinking about those, if a sizeable component evaluation were tied to one or two core programs, is that something that fits what Merck's looking for? Or should we be thinking about more diversified assets as we think about things that are beyond bolt-ons? Thanks very much. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Let me start with the business development question. I would start by saying that I think we will look at each deal based on its particular merits, and so I don't think there is a way for me to respond to that. I think what our past experience has been is we've tried to look for those deals where we believe we're going to get scientific assets going forward, and if we can get good assets that are in the marketplace now, that's something that we would be willing to do. But I don't think I can say categorically that we wouldn't take the kind of deal that has a concentration in one product versus another. Obviously concentration is one of the factors that you weigh when you think about the risk inherent in the deal. As it relates to pricing, we also are very concerned about the whole issue of pricing and affordability for patients. It's a significant one. It's been amplified in this year's political season. We find it unfortunate that a lot of times the focus is on affordability and pricing rather than the long term benefit that these therapies provide. So from our perspective, we think that going forward we don't think these environmental pricing pressures will ease, and that's why we continue to focus on our strategy of investing in innovative R&D for products like KEYTRUDA because we think those are the kinds of products that will help Merck weather some of the pricing risks and pricing pressures that we will be facing as an industry going forward. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks. We're going to try to squeeze in one last question, Darla. Operator : It's from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners : Yes. Thank you very much. Roger, just a very quick question on 189, 407. As patients move over or change overall therapy, those from chemo onto pembro [pembrolizumab] plus chemo \u2013 and this question I think is really important because there may be a hypothesis around duration, and I'm curious if you think that's possible. That is, the longer we look, we actually don't see \u2013 even if patients cross over, on the other side of that crossover they may not totally separate. And I'm just wondering if you think that's a possibility. Thanks very much for your time, and also congrats on a good roll you're on. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Well thanks, Tony. I do think again as I said, at the limit if the crossover occurs early, I mean, you're just comparing a single chemotherapy regimen to chemotherapy plus KEYTRUDA given earlier lay. If they're only weeks apart, I don't see how, under those circumstances, how overall survival would separate. And of course that's a traditional problem in the development of chemotherapeutic agents and the reason why progression-free survival has been accepted as an endpoint in a variety of different tumor types. On the other hand, chemotherapy is active, and for individuals whose disease is controlled by chemotherapy, then the crossover will inherently occur later. Because we believe that KEYTRUDA provides a more durable benefit to patients with lung cancer, and the data from that are clear across a variety of tumor types, under those circumstances, I would expect separation for overall survival. And as I indicated, it's a fairly complicated set of equations to try and estimate what that's going to look like. I think we probably have to wait for the data. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Let me close by saying this was a very strong quarter for Merck. As we look to the future we're very excited by the launch opportunities that we have in front of us : KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, BRIDION as examples. We think those building on the firm foundation we have with products like JANUVIA and our vaccines give us a great opportunity in the long term. We know that we're facing some headwinds from loss of exclusivity in the next year, but we continue to be confident in our ability to actually invest in some of these high-potential programs going forward. And you should know that we will continue to look for ways to help offset some of the incremental spend that we'll have to make in order to support a product like KEYTRUDA to ensure that this company provides the best short and long term proposition for its shareholders. Thank you very much. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Merck's Q4 full-year 2016 sales and earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Darla, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 conference call. Today I'm joined by : Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Frazier. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. In 2016, we drove growth across many areas of our portfolio, which enabled us to exceed our EPS commitments for the year. Looking forward, we remain confident in the ongoing performance of our key inline franchises and core brands as well as the growing momentum behind our pipeline and major product launches. Business development remains an important priority for us, as we are committed to building on our current portfolio and pipeline. We continue to seek the best scientific opportunities via acquisitions, partnerships, and collaborations at the right financial valuation, with a particular focus on augmenting our early to mid-stage pipeline. As you are all aware, we are operating in a period of significant volatility and uncertainty, including the current political and policy environment in the United States. Merck, however, remains steadfast in our mission to produce biomedical innovations that save and improve lives. We believe our broad and balanced portfolio will enable us to weather these uncertainties and positions us well to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Earlier this week, along with a small group of industry CEOs representing pharma, I participated in an initial meeting with President Trump. We discussed how we can work together on areas of common ground, such as reforming our country's tax code, removing outdated and counterproductive regulations that drive up costs and hinder biomedical progress, and using market forces like competition and choice to make medicines more affordable and accessible to the patients who need them, all with the ultimate goal of stimulating greater innovation and growth on the part of U.S.-based companies. I came away encouraged by the open and constructive dialogue of this first meeting, and we look forward to working with the administration and Congress to develop and advance solutions that will achieve this goal. In closing, we remain committed to investing in R&D and to discovering and developing transformational medicines and vaccines that create significant therapeutic and shareholder value. While planning in the current environment has its challenges, we believe we've put forward reasonable expectations for 2017, which Rob will discuss next in more detail. We will stay focused on driving the performance of our core business, advancing our late-stage pipeline, including expanding the use of KEYTRUDA, our foundational immuno-oncology agent, and executing on our key launch products to maximize long-term growth. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rob. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I will make a few remarks on our full-year and fourth quarter 2016 results as well as provide some commentary on our 2017 guidance. My remarks will focus mainly on our non-GAAP financials. 2016 reflected a year of strong execution and disciplined resource allocation. We delivered full-year revenues of $39.8 billion, which is in the upper end of our original guidance range. This represents top line growth of 1% or 3% excluding the impact of FX, and was driven by new product launches such as KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION, as well as growth in the JANUVIA franchise, vaccines, and our Animal Health business, somewhat offset by generic competition. We were able to reallocate costs from other areas of our portfolio to support these growth drivers, resulting in full-year 2016 operating expenses that were generally flat to 2015, with higher R&D expenses offset by a decline in marketing and administrative expense. As a result, the company delivered a leveraged P&L with full-year non-GAAP EPS of $3.78, exceeding our original 2016 guidance and representing 5% growth over the prior year or 7% excluding the impact of exchange. Now, turning to the fourth quarter, despite significant headwinds in the fourth quarter from generic competition for ZETIA, CUBICIN, and NASONEX in the U.S. and REMICADE in Europe, we were able to deliver sales and EPS that were roughly flat on an ex-exchange basis. Total company revenues of $10.1 billion in the quarter were flat versus prior year excluding a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. Our Human Health business decreased 1% excluding exchange while our Animal Health business grew 7% excluding exchange. Recall that our Human Health sales in the third quarter included an approximately $150 million benefit from the pull forward of customer purchases from the fourth quarter due to the timing of shipments in Japan in anticipation of an ERP go-live. I should also note that fourth quarter KEYTRUDA sales in the U.S. include approximately $40 million of revenue that had previously been deferred. Now that we have sufficient sales and returns history, deferral is no longer necessary and the one-time adjustment was made in the fourth quarter. Looking to the other parts of the P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 74.8%, which was flat year over year. Full-year gross margin increased 30 basis points to 75.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.3 billion were slightly lower versus the fourth quarter of 2015 due to a slight decline in R&D, mainly driven by lower licensing expenses. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3% this quarter, an increase of roughly 7 percentage points year over year, resulting in a full-year tax rate of 22.3%. Recall that the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected the full-year benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit. Taken together, we earned $0.89 per share on a non-GAAP basis, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-GAAP EPS decreased 1%. When looking at the year-over-year comparison, our fourth quarter EPS was also negatively impacted by the pull forward of customer purchases in Japan into the third quarter, which we had said was about a $0.04 EPS favorable impact in Q3. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.42 in the quarter, which includes a $625 million pre-tax charge to settle the worldwide KEYTRUDA patent litigation. Now let's turn to guidance and our outlook for 2017. Launches of KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, as well as strength in our inline brands, including JANUVIA and our vaccines business, largely mitigate the headwinds that we anticipate this year from LOEs on an ex-exchange basis. We expect full-year 2017 revenues to be in the range of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion, which includes an approximately 2% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-January rates. While there are many potential pushes and pulls across our business that our guidance range encompasses, for clarity, we would like to specifically mention that we have included risk-adjusted sales from the potential opportunity for a KEYTRUDA indication based on the KEYNOTE-021G filing. We expect our 2017 product gross margin to moderately increase year over year, despite having to absorb the impact of a 6.5% royalty on our worldwide sales of KEYTRUDA. We expect operating expenses to increase year over year at a low single-digit rate, driven by an increase in R&D spending, coupled with marketing and administrative expenses that are anticipated to be relatively flat. The increase in R&D expense is a reflection of the investments needed to continue to fund KEYTRUDA, along with the rest of our pipeline, at optimal levels to maximize potential long-term growth. We have made a significant effort to look across our portfolio to reallocate resources, and we will continue this discipline and make appropriate trade-off decisions to balance near and long-term results. Regarding tax, we expect the full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. We project average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $2.75 billion (sic) [2.75 billion shares] (10:55) for 2017, reflecting a decrease versus the prior year, as we continue our share repurchase program. Taken together, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be $3.72 to $3.87, which reflects an approximately 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-January rates. Projected 2017 EPS growth would be flat to up 4% excluding the impact of exchange. Despite the significant generic competition we face in 2017, our non-GAAP EPS guidance demonstrates growth at the midpoint versus 2016, and fully absorbs the impact of the KEYTRUDA royalty to BMS. It's also worth noting several items that will make year-over-year comparisons more difficult, especially in the first half of the year. While we are facing rapid erosion of sales from our products that have lost patent exclusivity, we will not get the full benefit of the ramp from new product launches, such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, until the second half of 2017. In addition, the timing of customer purchases for JANUVIA will further contribute to the difficult comparison, particularly in the first quarter. While we expect sales to build over the course of the year, we anticipate operating expenses will be somewhat front-end loaded, driven largely by higher promotional expense for KEYTRUDA and the phasing of clinical spend. In summary, 2016 was another example of our commitment to delivering shareholder value through the prioritization of resources toward innovative products that will contribute to long-term growth. We expect this momentum to continue as we further innovate in our labs and invest behind our launches. We are confident the investments we're making today will realize continued shareholder value in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights of Global Human Health performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2016. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health annual sales reached $35.2 billion and grew 2%. All core areas : oncology, vaccines, diabetes, and hospital and specialty care, contributed to the growth. In the fourth quarter, sales of $8.9 billion declined 1%. We were able to mostly offset the impact from LOEs in the quarter from growth products, from new products including KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, but also from inline products such as JANUVIA and our vaccine franchise. I'll now highlight a few of our product launches in key franchises, and I'll start with oncology. We continued to execute well on the launch of KEYTRUDA globally, and we are confident about the opportunity we see for this important brand. In the fourth quarter, sales were $482 million, driving strong full-year sales of $1.4 billion. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA fourth quarter sales of $311 million were driven by continued strength in melanoma, rapid penetration of head and neck cancer, and the launch of first-line lung. Since our first-line lung approval in late October, we have seen a significant acceleration in PD-L1 testing in non-small-cell lung cancer. Our early data suggests that about two-thirds of new patients are being tested. And the vast majority of first-line patients that are tested and also have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50% are being treated with KEYTRUDA. Outside of the U.S., melanoma continued to be the primary driver of sales of $172 million in the quarter. In addition to the nearly 60 markets in which we have melanoma approvals, launches are underway in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer in more than 50 markets. We're working through the reimbursement process for each country, and we expect a meaningful contribution in 2017 from second-line lung as many of these countries come online. We'll also begin reimbursement discussions on first-line lung as we gain additional approvals outside of the U.S. Of note, we're looking forward to launching in Japan, where we've recently been approved for first-line and second-line lung as well as melanoma. This is only the beginning of opportunity that we see for KEYTRUDA in 2017 and beyond. Similar to melanoma and head and neck cancer, we are committed to building a leadership position in lung. We're moving forward with additional investment to leverage our unimpeded position in first-line lung. And as you may have seen, we've recently initiated a consumer campaign in the United States. We're also looking forward to further broadening the opportunity for KEYTRUDA, with three PDUFA dates upcoming in just the first half of 2017, and we expect even more to come. Now I'll move to primary care. The JANUVIA franchise grew 4% globally in the fourth quarter, driven by strong performance in the U.S., where sales grew 12% due to increased volume and some customer buy-in. TRx trends remained strong in the U.S. with growth of over 3% in the fourth quarter. We've now seen more than 10 consecutive quarters of volume growth in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., sales declined slightly due to the unfavorable impact of customer shipment timing in Japan. For the full year, the franchise generated sales of $6.1 billion or 2% growth. We remain encouraged by the underlying volume trends in the U.S. and around the world for JANUVIA, and we continue to see opportunities to grow our diabetes franchise. We have maintained very good managed care coverage in 2017, though this access comes with higher discounts and rebates, as we said before. Despite this increased pricing pressure, we remain confident in the franchise. Our vaccine business grew 2% in the fourth quarter to $1.7 billion, with the increase primarily driven by PNEUMOVAX and GARDASIL. Full-year sales also grew, increasing 10% to $6.2 billion, with GARDASIL, pediatric vaccines, and PNEUMOVAX all delivering double-digit growth. GARDASIL sales in the fourth quarter grew 9% to $542 million on another strong quarter in the U.S. Sales for the full year increased 14%, as we continued to transition sales to GARDASIL 9 around the world. We expect a rapid transition to the two-dose regimen in 2017, and that will have a negative impact on sales in the U.S. But we are confident in GARDASIL 9 over the long term. In addition, we completed the termination of our vaccine joint venture in Europe in with Sanofi in the fourth quarter, and we have fully integrated our vaccine operations as of January 1. Moving now to hospital and specialty care, sales grew 2% to $8.1 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter sales of $1.9 billion declined 3%, as the decline in REMICADE continued to accelerate and CUBICIN sales were subject to generic competition in the U.S. These declines were partially offset by contributions from launched products, including BRIDION and ZEPATIER. BRIDION had another strong quarter with nearly 50% growth, driven by strong uptake from the launch in the U.S. as well as continued demand in Europe, the emerging markets, and Japan. Surgical trends support the increased use of BRIDION, and we are excited about the opportunity we see for BRIDION in 2017 and beyond. We also continue to be encouraged by the progress made with ZEPATIER in its first year of launch. Sales were $229 million in the quarter. In the U.S., we've continued to gain market share, and we remain focused on driving greater utilization across the public and private plans in which we've gained access. Some of these formulary wins had effective dates of January 1, and they are expected to meaningfully contribute to our results in 2017. Outside of the U.S., we are encouraged by the initial uptake following recent launches in Japan and the EU late in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the reimbursement discussions that are still ongoing across Europe as well as the expansion of reimbursement criteria in several large markets. All together, Global Human Health delivered solid results in 2016. While we'll have to contend to the significant impact in 2017 of revenue from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for several large brands, including ZETIA, VYTORIN, CUBICIN, and NASONEX, we will continue to execute on the opportunities we have in front of us. We are committed to building our leadership position for KEYTRUDA around the world, and we'll continue to prioritize resources behind key franchises like JANUVIA and vaccines. And we will maximize other product launches such as ZEPATIER and BRIDION. This together will position us well for years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Adam. As Ken, Rob, and Adam have outlined, the fourth quarter was an important one for Merck Research Laboratories. Much of the excitement in the fourth quarter resulted from accomplishments in our oncology programs. First, in late October we received FDA approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer in patients whose tumors exhibit greater than 1% of cells expressing PD-L1, as determined using our companion diagnostic. This represents a meaningful broadening of the utility it featured in the second-line setting and was based on results from our KEYNOTE-010 study showing improved survival in patients receiving this therapy as opposed to those who received traditional chemotherapeutic intervention. Follow-up data from KEYNOTE-010 presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [IASLC] meeting in December provided strong evidence for durable KEYTRUDA-induced responses in patients who completed two years of therapy. Dr. Roy Herbst presenting these data noted a doubling of overall survival in KEYTRUDA-treated second-line lung cancer patients as compared with what was achieved using traditional chemotherapy. Also in late October, the FDA approved KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer patients whose tumors contained 50% or more tumor cells expressing PD-L1. This approval was based on our KEYNOTE-024 study, which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] meeting in Copenhagen and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. Compared with traditional platinum doublet therapy, KEYTRUDA treatment in this setting resulted in a 60% improvement in the overall response rate and a 40% reduction in the risk of death. Moreover, KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with a lower rate of serious adverse effects than was observed in the chemotherapy treatment arm. The importance of the KEYNOTE-024 results was highlighted by the recommendation for approval by the European Committee on Human Medicinal Products [CHMP] in mid-December, with subsequent EC ratification just a couple of days ago. KEYTRUDA was also approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare based on the KEYNOTE-010 and KEYNOTE-024 results on December 19. In each of these cases, KEYTRUDA is recommended at unit dosing 200 mg given by intravenous infusion every three weeks, which simplifies patient management. With each passing month, we are learning more about the potential of KEYTRUDA to improve treatment for patients suffering from cancer. Since our last earnings call, we received three new Breakthrough Designations from the FDA for the use of KEYTRUDA to treat malignant disease : first, in patients whose tumors irrespective of histology are found to have evidence of DNA repair defects, as demonstrated by so-called microsatellite instability. Our U.S. filing for this indication was accepted with a PDUFA date of March 8; second, for treatment of urothelial malignancies based on data from our KEYNOTE-045 study; and third, we received Breakthrough Designation for the treatment of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, a relatively rare tumor where KEYTRUDA monotherapy may have a meaningful impact. Finally, we received a Priority Review for our file supporting the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The PDUFA date for this U.S. submission is March 15. Beyond monotherapy, the FDA has also accepted our file supporting the use of a combination of KEYTRUDA with more traditional chemotherapy, as described in our KEYNOTE-021G study. Here, in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer irrespective of PD-L1 expression, the combination of KEYTRUDA with pemetrexed and carboplatin therapy yielded response rates of 55% and a near doubling of progression-free survival. The FDA has granted Priority Review for this filing, with a PDUFA date of May 10. Filings for U.S. supplementary biologics licensing approvals for KEYTRUDA are expanding logarithmically, which together with our worldwide support of filings contributes to the enormous workload that we are experiencing in clinical research and regulatory affairs. I've said before that KEYTRUDA is changing the landscape of cancer treatment, representing a fourth pillar, if you will, beyond surgery, radiation therapy, and traditional chemotherapy that provides hope for further progress in the treatment of malignant disease. We are currently supporting more than 430 studies of KEYTRUDA in various settings, including an ever-larger fraction of combination protocols using novel new modulators as well as traditional chemotherapeutic agents. Beyond oncology, we continue to support very active programs in metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric illness, and the development of improved vaccines. Many of these programs will begin to deliver results in the middle of 2017. The REVEAL study testing whether anacetrapib reduces cardiovascular events in adverse patients already optimally treated with statin therapy should provide data sometime after midyear. At around the same time, we will also see Phase 3 data from verubecestat, our beta-secretase inhibitor, which we hope will delay progression of dementia in patients who already have mild to moderate cognitive impairment. A second Phase 3 study testing the use of verubecestat in patients with prodromal disease is now fully enrolled. I look forward to providing updates on these and other programs as the year progresses. Now I'll turn the call back to Teri. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Darla, we will move on to our Q&A portion of the call. If I could ask the analysts to please limit your questions to just one or two so we can get as many people in as possible, that would be appreciated. Darla, we'll go to Q&A, please. Operator : Your first question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks very much. So I guess I'd like to start just by asking a high-level question. Ken, could you just talk about how the meeting with President Trump concluded and the next steps that you expect from the administration? And then, Roger, most physician experts are skeptical that FDA will approve the KEYTRUDA/chemo combo based upon the small Phase 2 data set with the no overall survival benefit. What do you think the naysayers underappreciate about your chemo combo application and the likely FDA assessment? Thank you. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay, this is Ken Frazier, Dave. Thanks for the question. It's important to recognize that this was a first meeting with President Trump. In this meeting, we got a lot of issues on the table. The President was really clear that his ultimate goal is twofold. One is to create U.S. jobs, and the second one is to ease the cost burden on patients. But he was also quick to say he recognizes the importance of this industry, and he doesn't want to interfere with the incentives in the marketplace for us to continue to take risks and make the kinds of investments that are needed to discover and develop long-term innovation. We also talked, as you know, about reforming taxes, easing regulation, ensuring that we have the right kinds of negotiations around value-based health care. Where we decided to go from there is that we would have regular check-ins after that. We don't have a second meeting today established on his calendar, but we said that we would continue to have regular check-ins to ensure that there was good communication between us and the administration. Obviously, the administration is focused on repealing and replacing the ACA, and they're very early in those thought processes also. And we will continue, along with our colleagues at pharma, to reach out to both the administration and Congress to ensure that our interests are represented and that patients continue to have access to high-quality and affordable health care. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And David, this is Roger. With respect to KEYNOTE-021, it's worth recognizing that the KEYNOTE-021G results confirmed, with respect to response rate, the prior monotherapy study, that is cohort C of KEYNOTE-021, so in essence this is a second study. I think the data stand on their own. The fact that the results we're seeing with respect to response rate and progression-free survival, and at this point, there is no separation in overall survival, is unsurprising in a way because : first of all, follow-up is really quite short, six months; and secondly, because there's a substantial amount of crossover between the two arms. These data represent, to my knowledge, the first controlled data comparing a combination with chemotherapy, and as a result, I think are quite significant. I will not predict how FDA or any regulatory agency will respond to those data, but I do think the results stand on their own. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Next question please, Darla. Operator : It's from Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much, two questions, both on KEYTRUDA. On KEYNOTE-189, do you expect PFS to read out before OS? And if yes, how long after the initial PFS will OS assessment be likely? Roche said yesterday on their call that they could get a simultaneous readout from their chemo combo trials. And the second question is, the FDA put a pembrolizumab study sponsored by NCI [National Cancer Institute] in glioblastoma on hold due to an adverse event. Can you provide more color on what signal they saw? Thank you very much. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right, on KEYNOTE-189, we could get a simultaneous readout. It's really a function of the magnitude of the treatment effect. So I can't speculate on what exactly we're going to see for KEYNOTE-189, but again, it's a comparison that looks at the ability of combination with chemotherapy to have a meaningful treatment effect. And if there is an overall survival benefit of substantial magnitude, we'd see it. Again, I think one should keep in mind that crossover does occur in these studies, and more and more, we will be seeing the impact of crossover. We are in the process of evaluating that, because there are some interesting issues with respect to the sequencing of KEYTRUDA therapy and chemotherapy and the impact that has on results, so there's a lot of information we're going to get out of KEYNOTE-189. With respect to the study on hold that you mentioned, that study actually is not on hold. That's a misstatement in ClinicalTrials.gov, and I believe they're busy correcting it, but it's not on hold. What was seen in the study is, we believe, of course, what you would expect to see in grievously ill patients who have intercranial malignancies. And there's really nothing represented in that study, so nothing to pay attention to really, I think. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Going back to KEYNOTE-189, unless something has changed, my understanding is that PFS is the only primary endpoint for that trial, which makes it unique if true, because all the other I-O combo trials by other companies have PFS and OS as co-primaries, so I'm trying to understand the rationale behind this. Is it so you can put more dedicated alfa (32:33) only to this primary endpoint, or does it say you're worried about the crossover hurting OS potentially or what? And then another question on KEYNOTE-042, so another monotherapy trial, but this time I think it's in all-comers, and I believe you're supposed to have that in early 2018. Might you change the cutoff for the primary analysis to widen it beyond KEYNOTE-024, but not maybe go as low as 1%? I would imagine to keep the momentum going, you don't want have a negative trial on your hands. So how might you might address KEYNOTE-042? And then last question, just on CTLA-4 combo, is that still something you might be considering, or with Bristol's increased caution, could that not be something you pursue? Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay, so first of all, with KEYNOTE-189, not much to add to what I've said previously. Again, we are expecting that there will be a meaningful impact of crossover in all future studies, because of the widespread appreciation of the value of KEYTRUDA therapy, and the desire on the part of physicians and patients, to gain access to that when they have progressive disease. The impact of crossover will depend upon its timing and also the sequencing phenomenon that I mentioned. PFS is a sensible endpoint in that context, and that contributes to our study design. With respect to KEYNOTE-042, you should expect that study to go to completion. We are eager to understand whether the superiority that we demonstrated in KEYNOTE-024 vis-\u00e0-vis traditional doublet chemotherapy applies across the totality of patients, in lung cancer patients beyond those who just have PD-L1 expression in 50% or more of cells. So that study is going on. I have no expectation. In general, we don't change the endpoints of our studies once we've embarked upon them. We think hard about them and we try and get those endpoints right at the beginning. We could in principle do that, but I see no reason to at the present time. And with respect to combinations with immunotherapies, including those directed at CTLA-4, we remain interested in the broadest possible set of combinations that can have beneficial impact to patients, and that includes immunotherapies, not just CTLA-4, but other things as well. My expectation is that with time we will see that treatment regimens are more and more personalized. I do not expect that one size will fit all here and that every cancer patient will receive the same combination, whether it's chemotherapy or immunologic manipulation. My feeling is though that KEYTRUDA will prove to be foundational in these settings because of its very broad impact in a wide variety of different tumor types at different stages of disease, as we've shown. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Rob or Adam, you mentioned including KEYNOTE-021G in the 2017 outlook. Can you speak more qualitatively about your expectations for the MSI indication or for broader monotherapy use beyond the 50% cut point? And then, Ken, you've talked in the past about biz-dev being a priority I think for over a year now. Is there a tipping point to put it into action via, say, valuation expectations from sellers or tax policy or ACA? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Hi, Jeff. This is Adam. So with regard to KEYNOTE-021G, as you know, right now KEYTRUDA is approved first-line use in patients that have PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50%. Assuming that KEYNOTE-021G gets put into the label, we anticipate that that would open up the non-squamous lung market. So we would have patients that are negative on PD-L1 all the way from PD-L1 of 1% up through greater than 50%. So it certainly would open up the rest of the market. The way I would think about it, though, is that from what we can tell, physicians will be much more apt to use the combination in patients that they deem to be relatively healthy. They're going to evaluate it patient by patient and see where they believe that the combination of the two would outweigh potential side effects and so forth. So I think initially, it will be used in patients that are relatively healthy and those where they would be thinking about using ALIMTA anyway. After that, we believe that it will go into patients that are relatively healthy where they're not necessarily thinking about ALIMTA but they might start to use ALIMTA in combination with KEYTRUDA to treat those patients and get better results. And then lastly, over time, we think that even in patients that are less healthy, they'll probably, after having a lot of exposure to the combination, begin to use it in those patients as well. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Before I go (37:51) Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yes, so thanks for the question. I'll start by saying that valuations have come down, and that has caused us to continue to look very hard at various options that we have across the marketplace. I would say you shouldn't infer from the fact that you haven't seen a deal that we're not making every effort to try to do the right kind of deal for our shareholders in the long run. We still have to find a willing seller and we still have to find a price where we think we can actually create value, and that's generally the issue that we've actually encountered up until now. I would also say with respect to your question about exogenous factors like tax policy and ACA that we feel like we have the firepower now in terms of a strong balance sheet to do the kinds of deals that we need to do across the entire spectrum of opportunities and assets. So I would just say we keep reminding you that BD is important to us because we want you to know that we're being very diligent and looking for the right deal at the right valuation. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Ken. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hi, guys. Teri, I have a question with two parts and one sub-part. I was just wondering, they're very simple. Roger, can you just remind us what your development strategy is in the squamous lung cancer setting for front-line? And then number two, I'd love to hear, Roger, your thoughts on ALIMTA versus ABRAXANE in particular, but just other chemos. Do you think the chemo is ultimately \u2013 the choice of chemo is going to matter very much? And then the impact of the solanezumab failure on your thinking about the A-beta hypothesis, you've been very \u2013 you made some very interesting statements. You thought a lot about this, the A-beta hypothesis and made some memorable statements. I was just wondering what you think the solanezumab trial date is. And also thanks to Teri and the team for all the help that she gave my team while I was out. Thank you. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right, so a number of questions, Mark. Thanks for that. First of all, we do have a squamous front-line study which will be coming out and we expect sometime in 2018, the first part of 2018, KEYNOTE-407. And our expectation is that we'll be able to demonstrate the same kind of effect in first-line with squamous, but time will tell. As far as chemo combinations are concerned, it is early days. If you look at the KEYNOTE-021 program, you can see that there were improvements in response rates in a variety of different settings in combinations with different therapies. And of course, our colleagues at Roche have demonstrated combination results with chemotherapy using their PD-L1 antibody. So I think that over time we're going to find out that there are probably a lot of things that work in combinations fairly well. Certainly pre-clinically that's what we see, combinations with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immune manipulations, a variety of kinds including vaccinations, oncolytic viruses, and then of course our recent interesting data that we have in combination IDO1 antagonists with our colleagues at Incyte. So all of that suggests that there are going to be many different combinations and there will be quite a lot of customization over time. And as I say, I don't think that one size will fit all in that regard. And finally with respect to the results from Lilly, the disappointing results with solanezumab, again, I don't think that that speaks specifically to the validity of the A-beta hypothesis or the general hypothesis that processing of amyloid precursor protein into potentially toxic peptides contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia and other dementias. I think the genetic data are very clear that in general one associates an increase in processing as a result of which alleles one inherits, whether the precursor protein itself or of the beta secretase. One associates increased processing with a higher likelihood of progressing to dementing illness during life. The question is if we block that, if we phenocopy a reduction of beta secretase activity, will that reduce progress of dementing illness or the likelihood of becoming demented, and how early do we have to do that? And of course, that's what we're testing with our beta secretase inhibitor, verubecestat, which is an excellent beta secretase inhibitor. We can dramatically reduce beta secretase activity and reduce the levels of A-beta peptides and cerebrospinal fluid. The question is are we getting in early enough, and time will tell. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks. We'll move on to the next speaker, Darla. Operator : It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA): Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. So I just had a couple here. One, you talked a little bit about the BACE and the CHMP data you'll have later this year. Are there any other data readouts that you'd highlight as being important from the pipeline perspective? Maybe people are underappreciating beyond BACE and CTP and I guess beyond KEYNOTE-189, which has also been discussed here. And then my second one, if you could just maybe provide a little bit more of a breakdown in terms of the percentage of KEYTRUDA sales in the fourth quarter that came from each of the different indications, especially in the U.S., as you gain more of the lung impact so far? Thank you. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: So let me start with the KEYTRUDA numbers. And again, the data is not perfect, but I'll give you a rough estimate. The total sales were $483 million globally. The U.S. was $311 million. Rest of the world was $172 million. A rough estimate for the U.S. is that about 40% of sales were melanoma. About 30% of the sales were in lung cancer, about 15% in head and neck, and then 15% in all other categories. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right. So, Vamil, there's a lot of data coming out over the next year. And of course, there's a very substantial amount of KEYTRUDA data that we'll be seeing, which we've already mentioned, that relates to the enormous breadth of indications. That's the first thing. The second thing, of course, as we talked about already, is we're going to be seeing data from the REVEAL study and from BACE. Beyond that, of course, you're going to be seeing additional data from our ertugliflozin data that is in diabetes, Type 2 diabetes. We have a lot of data in the HIV setting and generally in infectious diseases. So both doravirine Phase 3 data, which should be presented relatively early in 2017. And we're going to be seeing a lot more information coming from as well the letermovir CMV data that you'll have a chance to look at, which could be quite important. And finally, there's data from our acquisition of Afferent in the chronic cough setting. This is our P2X3 antagonist, and that could be quite interesting. And you'll have a chance to see some of those Phase 2b data as well. So a lot of data coming out in 2017. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay, we'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, just a question maybe for you, Adam, on what you expect for the uptake of chemo combo. Assuming you get approval, which we are, how do you see the uptake of KEYTRUDA/ALIMTA given that this trial was a limited trial, only 60 patients in the KEYTRUDA arm, KEYTRUDA/chemo arm? We don't yet have overall survival. The reason I'm asking the question is that your own KEYNOTE-189 will be reporting out just a few months later. I don't recall how many patients are in the KEYTRUDA/chemo arm. But also the Roche trial with about 1,100 patients or 400 in each arm with PFS and potentially OS will be reporting out, again, a few months later. Do you expect physicians to wait for the larger Phase 3 clinical trials, or is your expectation that there is so much pent-up demand that you would expect a strong uptake? And then secondly, there are still so many questions that the key debates have yet to be resolved. I think market expectations on I-O/I-O have changed, but we really haven't seen data yet. How are you thinking about KEYTRUDA front-line lung and the competitive dynamic in 2018 and 2019, when presumably others will be on the market? Thanks. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Hi, Jami. So, first of all, when you think about KEYNOTE-021G, it certainly opens up the entire market for first-line for non-squamous patients. And once it's in the label, I think physicians will tend to use the product. Our representatives will be able to promote it appropriately. They'll be able to talk about the data and the information. And typically, the physicians will follow the label on something as important as first-line lung cancer, where people don't have great alternatives. I think that we will be able to see physicians begin to use it as soon as we have the data in the label. With regard to progression-free survival versus overall survival, remember, we launched melanoma with progression-free survival, and we were able to get very rapid uptake there. And I think physicians understand that having that in your label is going to make a difference. So I do believe that it will give us a lead in first-line lung for sure, once the data are available. And obviously, once the second study is out there, then I think it's even going to help us further into the future. As I start to think about I-O/I-O combinations, I'm glad that we're doing those trials, because we don't have all the information that we need to figure out exactly where the future is going to take us. But the good news is, we're off to a great start. Hopefully, we'll get KEYNOTE-021G in the label, which will give us even a further head start in first-line lung. Physicians will become very comfortable using KEYTRUDA as the drug of choice in first-line lung where it's approved. And then over time, I think we'll have a very solid position in the trials that Roger and his team are looking at across I-O/I-O combinations will only be helpful as we learn more. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great, we'll move on to the next question please, Darla. Operator : It's from Tony Butler with Guggenheim. Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes, thanks very much, two questions. One for you, Rob, on the operating expenses of some modest increase, or expectations for some modest increase in 2017. I'm struck by the notion that, even in the midst of VYTORIN and ZETIA's LOEs, where that, I would argue, free up some capital, you are still going to grow op expenses. But moreover, is that simply dependent upon what might occur with KEYNOTE-021G midyear? Is it dependent upon that approval or not? And second, Roger, back to the notion of types of chemo that one might utilize with pembrolizumab, I was struck in ClinicalTrials.gov of your own CDK inhibitor. I think it's MK-7965 in conjunction with pembro, I guess in malignancies in the KEYNOTE-155 trial, but it may have utility in others, and just your thoughts around different mechanisms, more specific mechanisms, than simply something like ALIMTA or paclitaxel. Thanks for your time. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Tony, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. As we look at this, I think this really goes back to something we started talking about even back in the third quarter, as we started giving some indications of what we saw coming into 2017. Clearly, we recognize the need to pivot and try to manage expense in the year of patent expiries. However, we also recognize, and frankly feel good about, the fact that we have such a strong opportunity with KEYTRUDA that to try to pull back on some of those important clinical studies \u2013 as you know, we have over 420 studies underway for a product that clearly is starting to show it can be a leader in the space, only to manage for the short term, we felt, was not the right decision. So we made a decision to still invest in R&D. That's why R&D is actually growing. We are holding SG&A relatively flat. And I think that's also important because, on the back of what's coming with KEYTRUDA in first-line lung cancer and across the other indications it has, we want to make sure we're also investing for a successful global launch of those products. As far as to the specific question of, is this dependent on KEYNOTE-021G, the answer is no. Obviously, we will adapt our spend depending on what we see happening throughout the year, but there's not a specific trigger tied to KEYNOTE-021G. And I would point out that we will remain disciplined and continue to make the right decisions and resource allocations so that we can ultimately, in the long term, get back to a leveraged P&L. I think we're in a unique situation where we have such an opportunity, we don't want to lose it. We're going to invest behind it, but we're going to do so in a disciplined way. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Tony, it's Roger. So I think the general logic of this is that, if we want to improve responses to KEYTRUDA, we need to recruit more immune cells and lower the barrier to activation of those cells. That's the general logic. When you look at indices of responsiveness to KEYTRUDA, there are two things that clearly contribute, as has been reported by us and by others. First of all is mutational burden, so the representation of things that, in principle, immune cells could recognize. And the second is the pre-existing immune response, usually judged by something like PD-L1 expression or gamma-interferon or something like that. The combination with chemotherapy can improve immune responses just by releasing a lot of material from cell death, and in essence, cross-priming immune systems, so it can do that. It can improve responses through mutagenesis, or it can more generally change the inflammatory milieu. All of those things are possible, and the different chemotherapeutic agents can do those different things. So as we learn more about each patient and what the problem is that is required to achieve a better immune response, we should be able to harness those things better. Maybe the answer is to increase mutagenesis in a particular patient, and maybe radiation therapy is the best thing to use. Maybe, on the other hand, it's really a matter of tumor lysis to present more antigen, in which case, for example, directly cytotoxic drugs or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors might be good. So a whole variety of things to explore, and we're trying to do that in a sensible and scientific way. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks. We'll move on to the next question. We're going to try to squeeze in a couple more here. Operator : The next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks, and congratulations on a strong 2016 and all the progress with KEYTRUDA, a couple for Roger on the BACE inhibitor and the EPOCH study in Alzheimer's. Does the design and the statistical plan account for some of the potential limitations, such as not screening patients for beta amyloid and also including moderate patients? Also, to what extent \u2013 can you give us an approximate breakdown of what we should expect in terms of mild and moderate patients in that study? And will you be looking at activity in those patients in a prospective manner as an endpoint as opposed to the ad hoc analyses that we often see? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right, Alex. So with respect to the first study, you're right. There was no imaging done for amyloid in the first study, in part because at the time of the start of the study that was not so easy to do. We did, however, try and pay attention to the representation of APOE subsets by stratification, which will improve the representation of individuals who likely have amyloid-enhanced Alzheimer's by the traditional definition. In terms of the study itself, measuring the progression of cognitive improvement, it's a fairly traditional set of measures. And roughly speaking, the representation of mild versus moderate is about 50 :50. So we're eager to see the results. We will do a lot of subset analyses no matter what. And we are in a position, I think, because of the size of the study and the care with which the study was conducted, to get a lot of information. Fingers crossed, we're hopeful that we'll actually see a positive result. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Next question, please. Operator : It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. First for Ken, you and your colleagues seemed quite constructive post the meeting with the President. I just want to make sure you're confident post the meeting, that there's not a proposal in the works to create some sort of bidding or direct negotiation process. I just want to make sure there's not a false sense of security building here. I'm not sure to what degree that came up, but perhaps you could go beyond just what you learned at the meeting on that front. And secondly for Rob on gross margin, is KEYTRUDA gross margin still well above the corporate average even after that new royalty burden? And is there anything else you'd like us to understand about product-specific gross margin as we think about the evolution of your gross margin this year and longer term as we model revenues for the different products? Thanks. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: I'll start with the question you asked. So obviously, we can't say what people in the Trump administration are thinking beyond what we heard in that meeting. And what we heard in that meeting I think gives us a lot of confidence that the Trump administration does understand the challenges associated with research-based pharmaceutical industry growth going forward. What I heard from Mr. Trump was a concern less around the cost of drugs in the aggregate but more around how patients need to be able to afford their co-pays and things of that nature. So since that was the discussion in the meeting, we were thinking about okay, we know that under the Part D benefit it's coming way under what was forecast. We know that substantial discounts are being negotiated by large players in the system. The question becomes how do we get some of that value to come to individual patients at the counter. The discussion went in that direction, and I think that's a legitimate issue for American patients. And we want to see how we can harness the private markets to actually help patients afford their medicines more on an individual basis. But we did not have a conversation in there that leads me to believe that they think the solution to that problem is secretarial negotiations. Now there will be politics around that. We know that there will be bills that are introduced in Congress calling for that. But the fact of the matter is I think that that is not perceived to be the solution to the problem. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: And with your question on gross margin, yes, KEYTRUDA's gross margin, even with the royalty, is above, well above the corporate gross margin. And as we look at the mix of headwinds and tailwinds that drive gross margin going forward, growth in KEYTRUDA is clearly one of the larger tailwinds for our overall gross margin into the future, even with the royalty included. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Darla, unfortunately I think we're almost out of time here. Ken's got a few final words. But for any analyst that didn't get on the call with questions, the IR team is around throughout the day to answer those questions, and I'll let Ken finish off. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: So I want to thank you all for being here this morning. If I could leave just one comment, we are extremely confident going into the future. I think you can see from our guidance that we are actually implying EPS growth despite headwinds in loss of exclusivity and FX and the other challenges we face. We're looking forward to our progress at first-line lung, to the KEYNOTE-021G filing and things of that nature, and I think we look forward to having tremendous opportunities going forward. So thank you very much. Operator : This concludes Merck's Q4 and full-year 2016 sales and earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Todd James, Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication at Acceleron. Please go ahead, Sir. Todd James : Thanks, and welcome, everyone, to Acceleron's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, are available on the investor's media page of the corporate website at www.acceleronpharma.com. In addition to our financial and operational results, we'll be reviewing highlights from our luspatercept Phase 2 presentation from the 14th International Symposium on MDS that took place over the weekend in Valencia, Spain. The full conference presentation is available in the science section of our website. Joining me in the room today are Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer; Matthew Sherman, our Chief Medical Officer; Kevin McLaughlin, our Chief Financial Officer and Chris Rovaldi, Senior Vice President, Operations and Program Management. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans and research activities. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent Form 10-K on file with the SEC. I would now like to return call over to Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer. Habib Dable : Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. It's clearly an exciting time at Acceleron with recently provided program updates over the past few weeks and additional updates announced this morning. Based on faster than expected rates of patient requirement in the MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase 3 studies year-to-date at Celgene. Our luspatercept collaboration partner recently announced that we expect full patient enrollment to be achieved this quarter versus our previous guidance of the second half of 2017. This should now put us in the position to report top line results from the Phase 3 trials by the middle of 2018. We at Celgene also announced that we plan to initiate a new Phase 3 trial with luspatercept and first-line lower risk MDS patient in early 2018. This decision is supported by results presented over the weekend at the MDS Symposium that Matt will be discussing later on this call. For the ACE-083 program, we announced plans to initiate a second Phase 2 trial in neurological disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT that causes muscle weakness in specific muscles. We expect this two part Phase 2 study to begin in the middle of this year with the part one dose escalation results available in 2018. Our team recently hosted an educational webinar to discuss the background on CMT and our Phase 2 trial design. We were joined by a leading neuromuscular expert, Dr. David Walk [ph], Associate Professor of Neurology and Director of the ALS and CMC Centers of Excellence at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. A reply of this event is available in the events and presentation section of the investor's media page on our corporate website. While we are working on ACE-083 trial start-up activities in CMT, enrollment and treatment are ongoing in the part one dose escalation stage of our Phase 2 trial in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy or FSHD. I'll now turn the call over to Matthew Sherman, our Chief Medical Officer, to review highlights from our luspatercept two presentations at the MDS from this past weekend. Matthew Sherman : Thanks Hadib, hi, everyone. Our team just returned from a 14th International Symposium on MDS that was held in Valencia, Spain, from May 3 through May 6. There were two clinical luspatercept presentation at the conference. We had a Phase 2 PACE study update that was presented by Uwe Platzbecker from Dresden Germany, one of our principal investigators for the study. We also highlighted the poster presentation that discussed the Pk/Pd response relationship of luspatercept in MDS patients. The Phase 2 trial presentation focused on the lower risk MDS expansion cohort patients not eligible for our ongoing MEDALIST Phase 3 study. The new expansion cohort patients include erythropoiesis stimulating agent or ESA na\u00efve patients where ring sideroblast positive with baseline erthyropoetin levels below 200 and ring sideroblast negative patients with any baseline EPO level regardless of VSA experience. We refer to patients with these baseline features as first-line lower risk MDS patients. Before going into our data, I would like to provide some context by outlining results from two ESA Phase 3 studies presented in 2016. On the left side of the slide, we are showing the darbepoetin alpha Phase 3 study, primary outcome measure, the International Working Group's Hematologic Improvement in the response or IWG HI-E which is at least a 1.5 gram per deciliter increase in hemoglobin sustained for eight weeks. In this 147 patient Phase 3 trial, 14.7% or 11 out of 75 patients in the active arm net the primary endpoint. All 11 responders had baseline EPO levels below 100 and there were zero responders above 100 EPO levels of baseline. Only one of the 11 responders had a baseline transfusion burden. 27 out of 28 patients entered the study with a baseline transfusion burden do not meet the primary endpoint response. On the right side of the slide, we are viewing the Epoetin Alpha Phase 3 primary endpoint analysis. This study also used the IWG HI-E response criteria as the primary endpoint. In this 130 patient Phase 3 trial, 31.8% or 27 out of 85 patients in the active arm meet the primary endpoint. This study stratified responders by baseline EPO levels above or below 200 with all 27 responders having baseline EPO levels below 200 and zero responders above 200. These results led to Epoetin Alpha recent approval in France for the subset of lower risk patients with baseline EPO levels under 200. It is also important to note the low placebo response rates in each of these studies. On this slide we've broken down response rates in our luspatercept Phase 2 by ESA exposure with patients either having received prior ESA treatment or never received an ESA and are ESA na\u00efve. When looking at the IWG HI-E response criteria, 51% of ESA na\u00efve patients treated with luspatercept achieved this clinically meaningful response criteria; this is the similar response rate to patients who have had prior ESA treatment. On the right side of the slide, we are evaluating red blood cell or RBC transfusion dependence response which is derived as a period greater than or equal to eight weeks without receiving transfusions. 48% of ESA na\u00efve patients treat with luspatercept achieved transfusion independence while 33% of prior ESA treated patients also achievement transfusion independence. The swimling [ph] chart on this slide shows patient response by duration of RBC transfusion independence for ESA na\u00efve patients receiving luspatercept treatment. Each line represents a patient's treatment period. A solid blue section of the line identifies the transfusion-free period of at least eight weeks. RBC transfusion events are shown with red dots for each patient. The right facing arrows at the end of some of the lines means that treatment is still ongoing. The median duration of transfusion independence is 8.7 months with a range of two to 27 months. On this slide we are looking at luspatercept response rates in RS negative patients regardless of ESA experience stratified by baseline EPO levels. In the RS negative patients, 6 of the 14 are 43% of patients achieved the HI-E response; and 4 out of 7 or 57% achieved RBC transfusion independence. At baseline EPO levels above 500, RS negative patient response rates dropped significantly. Let me summarize the key takeaways from our Phase 2 update. We achieved high response rates in the lower risk EPO level bans where physicians currently use ESAs off-label, including both RS positive and negative patients. These results compare favorably through historical rates of response with ESA treatment. More specifically in RS negative patients, response rates are high in patients based on EPO levels below 500. Luspatercept was generally well tolerated for patients on treatment upto and now exceeding 24 months of drug exposure. These updated Phase 2 results support the decision to expand luspatercept's clinical development into a first-line lower risk MDS Phase 3 trial in early 2018. I will now turn the call over to Kevin McLaughlin, our Chief Financial Officer, to run through the financials for the quarter. Kevin McLaughlin : Thanks, Matt. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of March 31, 2017 were $213.2 million. This compares to December 31, 2016 cash, cash equivalents and investments of $234.4 million. As a reminder, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the second half of 2019. Collaboration revenue for the first quarter was $3.7 million, the revenue is all from our Celgene partnership and is primarily due to cost sharing revenue of $3.6 million related to expenses incurred by the company in support of our partnered programs. Total cost and expenses for the first quarter were $29.5 million, this includes R&D expenses of $21.7 million and G&A expenses of $7.8 million. Other income net for the first quarter was $500,000, primarily due to interest income. The company posted a net loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $25.4 million. I will now turn the presentation back over to Habib for final remarks. Habib Dable : Thanks Kevin. So looking ahead we expect several key milestones over the next 12 to 18 months. For luspatercept program, we expect to complete enrollment in both, the MEDALIST Phase 3 trial in MDS and the BELIEVE Phase 3 trial in beta-thalassemia in the second quarter of 2017. In addition to our ongoing Phase 3 studies, we plan on initiating three clinical trials with luspatercept. In early 2018, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 trial and first-line lower risk MDS patients. Phase 3 trials in myelofibrosis and in non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia are planned to begin by year-end and we're also expecting to report additional Phase 2 study results at medical conferences throughout the year. I would like to note that given the Phase 2 MDS update this last weekend at the MDS Symposium, our MDS presentation at E-HI [ph] next month will be about a two month update. We look forward to providing a larger update at ASH [ph] in December. Turning to ACE-083, we anticipate having initial data from the Part 1 dose escalation arm of the Phase 2 FSHD trial by late 2017. This update will include results from dose cohort 1. Our trial and CMC will start mid-year with Part 1 results expected in 2018. Moving to dalantercept in RCC [ph], based on recently reaching this 82nd PFS event which is the prespecified number event determining results for the primary endpoint, we now expect to report topline results on the primary outcome measure of progression free survival this quarter. We also continue working towards initiating a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study of ACE-2494. Finally, given all of our recent progress in the clinic, we now plan to host a research and development day later this year to discuss our ongoing preclinical research and provide additional details for some of our planned clinical trials. Stay tuned for further event details over the next few months. And with that, I will open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much and congratulations on the results in ESA na\u00efve and low-risk MDS, very interesting. First, I don't know if you could give us a sense of what proportion of low-risk MDS patients have baseline EPO less than 500; just to help us in sort to mentioning this opportunity. And secondly, the summer plots that you presented for the patients who are transfusion independent for eight weeks have a concentration of transfusions when patients fail, they seem to be repeated transfusion; so wondering is that to be expected and do you believe that there is any loss of activity of the drug with prolonged exposure or are you seeing any neutralizing antibodies to the drug [indiscernible] and activating it? I mean my last question is a does [ph] question which is, you use -- appear to be using wide-based dosing but would you envisage ultimately having standardized dosing and would dosing differ between the low risk and ESA na\u00efve and the ESA experienced populations? Thanks. Apologies for all the questions. Habib Dable : Thanks, Geoff. So with the details of the study, I will hand it over to Matt, and then I'll follow up with that in terms of the population in terms of the percentages. Matthew Sherman : Hi Geoffrey, this is Matt. So let me take the second question you're asking, which related to win-win class and the transfusion seen sometimes in patients after they'd have a prolonged period of transfusion dependence. As you know, the average age of onset of MDS patients is that 70 years in our study, the median age was 72 years in patients are often to the Phase 2 trial. So the disease in the elderly many patients have co morbidities. And so if you look out over several years in these patient's history has often-other medical illnesses of problems that arise.  So might be related to a periods of infection for example, when patient might have -- have a bacterial oral affection they're sick they need a boost in transfusions a period of time. More specifically for one of our patients there was a period of GI bleeding, that was unrelated to the drug that occurred to another issue and that requires some transfusions as well. So it is those kinds of events that account for these small bursts of transfusion, we've not seen any drop off of the efficacy of the drug though over time. Geoffrey Porges : Great, thanks. Habib Dable : And then in terms of weight based dosing question, I think we\u2019re very comfortable with the Pk/Pd modeling that we've done for this protein to show that the efficacy that we're seeing does require weight base dosing, so there's no plan to do flat in the near future must have or so. Kevin McLaughlin : And then, Geoff, regarding your question regarding the percentages patient below EPOS 500, we estimated the majority of those patients that will be from zero to 500 probably somewhere around 70% to 80%. Geoffrey Porges : Right, thanks very much for all the answers, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter Gould : Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions. I guess first one on the frontline MDS study, the language being used there fairly broad in first-line treatment, somewhat delicate given the partnership with Celgene but can you definitively answer will there be RS negative patient enrolled in that study? And should we expect any sort of cut off of based on EPO level and in terms of inclusion criteria. And then secondly, just any comment on the duration you've seen so far in the RS negative segment relative to what we see in RS-positive segment. Thank you. Matthew Sherman : Hi Carter, this is Matt. So yes, right now describing the frontline study because I think really it builds on the excitement that we've seen in this, yes they may be of population, there's -- there is tremendous enthusiasm that came out of the -- the Symposium meeting in Valencia just over last week and this weekend. Highlighting which covers up as one of the leading drug now and phase three development, living into the frontline setting sets us up for going head-to-head to and ESA therapy. The data that we generated ratios with very roust rates we are seeing with patients in baseline EPO levels within 500, which is the majority of patients. ESA-naive population both importantly both are as positive in ours negative patients. The duration of responses although it's still early days, there is not sure that there's a significant difference between those two populations.  So if you move forward with this program, there will be more details forthcoming, those will be able to update folks on the specifics of the status line and collaboration with Celgene now towards later this year as -- as we have the details so to discuss. Carter Gould : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Berens with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Berens : Hi guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. My question on efficacy of the RS-negative population have been answered but I have a couple questions on the safety. You mentioned in the press release that there were several occasions of anxiety that were classified grade three and drug related. Can you give us some color on that that, and is there any mechanism that could suggest this is related to something the drug is doing. Thanks. Matthew Sherman : Hi Andrew, again this is Matt. So safety profile that this drug actually been very, very well tolerated over the multiple years now that it's been in our many years now been in development. So the small numbers of related great three adverse events that we admitted, have not been anything that we can say specifically related to the mechanism of the drug. Then again the currents of those generally have been very low frequency. Andrew Berens : Okay, but was there a reason that the investigator determine on the drug related, I think that's what the [indiscernible]? Matthew Sherman : Yes, I mean that this is again always in the eyes of the investigators understanding of the patient, that generally the temporal relationship of the event to the administration of the drug but it's -- it's and it's much more of an art than a science. And there really requires a randomized control trial to -- to delineate whether or not any of these really have an increased frequency. And treatment population versus the control population. They have to know not -- not reach the level of being a serious adverse event, so they were generally more -- more tolerated by patients. Andrew Berens : Okay. Is that something that is those two pro-fusion cited beyond this patient population. Matthew Sherman : Yes, certainly given the elderly population they have a number of co morbidities as well too so. Now with cardiovascular disease being a primary issue among these patients could have that active, cardiovascular disease such as the recent MRI but they certainly have had -- many of them have had long standing history so hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, [indiscernible]; altogether not a surprise that there would be the currents of other adverse events just over the concourse of patient participation into a multi-year clinical trial. Andrew Berens : Okay, thanks a lot, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young : Hey guys, thanks for taking our questions. Maybe just one if you had any kind of hypothesis on why they are as negative and hyper baseline didn't exhibit response, just anything kind of that you're hypothesizing in there and then I just wondered as relating to the -- two luspatercept which can roll faster than expectation. Was it consist of dynamic that kind of that -- the traffic and minimum awareness of physicians or kind of what drove your faster timeline enrollment? Thanks. Matthew Sherman : Hi Alethia, this is Matt. So for the first question regarding to the lack of response in patients with high baseline EPO level, I think that really does reflect the stage of their disease, those -- those with patients who really bone marrow, almost consider to be burned out marrow, they've been flocked significantly with their own endogenous EPO levels in there -- they've tried to overcome the ineffective erythropoiesis to the point where it's pretty much exhaustion of the marrow. So that setting luspatercept has had limited activity as does ESA and certainly as does any other therapy trying to increase red blood cells. So not necessarily surprised more reflection of the advanced nature of those patients disease. Regarding the -- accelerated enrollment of -- rapid enrollment of the Phase 3 trial, again I think it really reflects just the building enthusiasm momentum with opportunity for luspatercept patient opportunity, also reflect those other very limited options for these patients. So together that really drove a much more rapid uptake of -- of participation, and recognizing even with the randomized control placebo controlled trial, which sometimes limitations to enrollment many patients obviously recognizing may not want to be on the placebo age but given the lack of opportunities and the excitement building for luspatercept, we were thrilled with -- with the enrollment. Alethia Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Mike King with JMP Securities. Mike King : Good morning guys, thanks for taking my question and let me also add my congrats on the data that you presented over the weekend. I was wondering you started keep drawing down on this RS-negative population, but I'm just wondering if -- I understand Matt your explanation for one of them may not be responding to luspatercept in the setting, I just want to -- is there any read through perhaps to myelofibrosis, it's not quite the same situation but you do have an exhausted marrow in NMS [ph] but you've still seen some pretty interesting responses there, so I am just wondering how we reconcile those two findings. Matthew Sherman : Hi Mike, so yes, first in regards to your question what I think you're referring to is not a RS-negative patient, RS-negative patient with high EPO level. Mike King : Yes. Matthew Sherman : And that context thinking about marrow, I think it is very different situation though in the myelofibrosis, in the myelofibrosis patients their marrows aren't actually highly reactive marrows accounts with the fibrotic nature in -- in their in their marrow. So they as we showed last year you're -- you're quite familiar with the data that we presented with [indiscernible], you know, high degree of erythropoietin response in patients who had really advanced and that that was the investigator initiated trial that was done by surgical for cellstack at MD Anderson. And on that basis, certainly moving ahead to initiate the Phase 2 trial of luspatercept in patients with myelofibrosis, so still I believe there's a high degree of enthusiasm optimism right now to be working with NMF [ph] patience, very distinct disease than MDS. Mike King : Thank you for taking the question. All the others I pondered where answered, so thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from a line of Christopher Marai from Nomura. Christopher Marai : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. Maybe will take it over to a [indiscernible] I am just wondering if we could further elaborate perhaps on the addition of CMT muscle weakness is really a -- is really an issue for some of these patience and do you expect that the volume enhancement that you are going to see [indiscernible] with muscle weakness. And perhaps you can point to data that might suggest your approach is differentiated in that respect to other myelofibrosis? Thank you. Habib Dable : Hi Chris, let me answer the question about them the -- the role of ACE-083 and CMT and make a comparison to FSHD as well too. So these are two neuromuscular diseases that we targeted now for Phase 2 trials to investigate the role of ACE-083, ACE-083 first is a broader acting agent in just a myostat inhibitor; so as we discussed inhibits multiple negative ligands they can regulate muscle growth and functions. But these six diseases are distinct I think there is two pronged approach to the important ones to recognize from an FSH dystrophy there is an impairment in the muscle itself it is a muscle dystrophy. So our expectations to increase muscle strength in that setting, in CMP the muscles impact is just the innovation for the nerve to the muscle that isn't here. So the muscle itself is relatively healthy into undergoes atrophy after no prolonged period of this innovation. So that's setting again increasing the volume, the strength, the function of the existing muscle to help those patients overcome their impairment. We had a webinar a month and a half ago, about the study, I think it's really informative for folks to actually try to listen to some of the details that were preserved by Dr. David Walk [ph] but these are patients were pretty troubled by their -- by their illness the foot drop presenting with a high step gate [ph] leading to trips and falls in these patients, without any therapeutic available for these patients other than just the orthopedic bracing of their -- of their ankle there's quite incoherent in their mobility.  So the ability of FSHD to increase strength I expect will be very significant benefit, for these patients. I guess I should also mention the ongoing pre-clinical [ph] work that we've done as well have supported the role of the ACE-083 to increase muscle function across a wide number of preclinical models and different neurological diseases, so again that adds to the evidence from the potential benefit for the agent in these Phase 2 trials. Christopher Marai : So just to be clear you expect not only you'll see the volume on enhancement with your myostat inhibition but also an increasing in strength? Habib Dable : Exactly, so the trials in designing two part trials, there's an open label there somewhere both trials are similar in designing, first an open label part of the trial which has a small dose escalation opponent and in that part we're going to be focusing primarily on muscle volume, the primary activity as we demonstrated on healthy volunteers, and in part two randomized and placebo-controlled and in that setting not only muscle volume will be evaluated, but also muscle strength using fixed stress testing and hands on a monetary testing and a number of functional outcome measures. I think as the as the trials will move along will spend a little more time talking on the important of these outcome measures. These include things such as a six minute walk test you are familiar with that, but also the 10 meter walk run of [indiscernible] test, activity measures of the upper extremities called pull test which is performance of the upper limbs and basically in the CMP population, a test called the burden balance test.  And this is a 14 component test. Looking at patients ability to have -- have a good balance either by standing or sitting on one foot, turning in 360 degrees. So really quite sophisticated testing of their muscle function. Furthermore, both of these studies we're actually looking at that the patient gate, so we are using highly sophisticated gate analyses to measure their ability to -- to improve their emulation. So I think I will excited to see the state as a -- as a young fold [ph] the over the next year. Christopher Marai : Okay thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Citi. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, thank you so much for taking my question, and then congratulations on the data presented over the weekend. So for the ESA-naive I know you said you're going to talk about details later, I was just curious since you've presented both HIV and transfusion dependent data could you talk about what the potential primary point could be and also for myelofibrosis, just wondering when we can hear more about the trial design mainly but what patient population you wish to target, thank you so much. Matthew Sherman : Again, this is Matt answering the question. So good questions but I don't think I have a lot of information right now to share with you, as we get further along with this specifics of the design for the command study in the first line MDS patient population to be able to talk specifically, my end point would be and the specifics of the patient population, I know people would want to look forward to the specific eligibility criteria that we certainly shown the -- the range of activity we've seen in the lower Phase [ph] level of patience and ESA-Naive population as well too, but I think that that's as far as we can talk about the specifics today, but stay tuned later in this year.  In terms of myelofibrosis, I think it's really similar as we get a little closer, get a little bit more keyed up to be giving a Phase 3 trial, I think together with our partners Celgene will be able to align the -- the eligibility criteria in the specific end point and the study population for the MF study as well too. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great thank you. Can I sneak in just one more question about the launch itself; just wondering how we will receive the data, is there any likelihood of the data at ASCO or do you expected press release the data now that it's been advanced from second half to the second quarter? Matthew Sherman : Yes. So I can start to let people know where we are with that study if I can jump in about how the data will be released too, but we did talk about we -- we reached our 82nd PSFGN [ph] as that was prospectively prescribed in the study designed to do the analysis for the top line results, to show the effect of luspatercept combination with exutinib [ph] versus single agent exutinib [ph] plus placebo. We've met a second event and we also completed the enrollment of 130 patients, so just now doing the analysis. And we can talk about that when we have the data presented. Unidentified Analyst : Sure. Habib Dable : So we are at database analysis now, we've already passed through the late breaker time period for [indiscernible]; so you could expect that would just be a press release from us outlining the top line results. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Whitney Ijem from JP Morgan. Whitney Ijem : Thank you for taking the question. I guess one quick one for me and just on ACE-083 and FSHD data later this year how do you tend to communicate that and to last question should we expect that press release or medical commenter or that in [indiscernible] event, how should we be thinking about that. Todd James : Hey Whitney, it is Todd. Yes they're multiple muscle conferences in the second half of the year but most likely we will just end up giving out a top line press release on dose cohort 1, late in the year and then you could expect further details from that potentially at the muscular dystrophy association conference in March or one of the muscle conferences early in 2018 for dose cohort 1. Whitney Ijem : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from a line of Ed White with FBR & Company. Edward White : Hi guys thanks for taking my question, I think there most my questions have been asked, so I'll just ask on the luspatercept Phase 2 data I the first line lower risk MDS patients, are you going to have continue following patients and provide an update on expansion studies every six months like you're doing with the earlier study -- Phase 2 study. Habib Dable : Hi Ed, thanks for the question, so yes that was actually exactly the plan just put into context when we did the first part of the Phase 2 study we had a total of 58 patients from the first part through the first extension cohort. The second extension cohort including RS-negative patients was probably 50 additional patient, 31 of those patients were available for this update at the Symposium meeting. So we anticipate approximately 24 patients that we will have data so -- there will be [indiscernible] obviously for 2017 to include the remaining patients who are enrolled, as well as showing the extension; you know, the durability of activity on these patients as we have done over surplus years for the first cohort of patients. Edward White : Okay, great. Thanks, that's all I have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Choi with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Jason on for Paul. Let me also extend my congratulations for the data. Just a few quick questions, I know we've revisited the EPO question but you know, with regards to response, does that mean that if the patient has kind of higher and higher base line levels of EPO there is less of an effect? Or is it kind of just the step-wise function where around 400/500 -- the efficacy goes away? And then, just regards to your [indiscernible] products, kind of curious, there are couple of patients who -- it looks like are continuing therapy even though they had a robust response, if you could just shed a little light onto that, you know, why -- why patient might have discontinued? Thanks so much. Habib Dable : Hi Jason, so -- yes, in regard to your first question about EPO level; it's really tends -- it tends to be more of a drop-off, so when we showed the data with various cuts of baseline EPO levels, less than 200 and then the grouping between 200 and 500; you know, there was very little difference in the response rate for the HI-E response; over 63% of less than 200 versus 53% for the 200 to 500 baseline EPO population. Greater than 500 though it did drop down to 27%, so it's that cut-off of 500 that -- less [indiscernible]; you know, we've seen this drop-off inactivity. Yes, Phase really are much more active though in a much lower range there and as we highlighted the Phase 3 trials for Darbepoetin and Epoetin, you know, there the activity is very much limited to baseline EPO levels, less than 100 or perhaps upto 200 but really not even indicative for patients between 200 and 500 grams [ph], so we have -- I think a clear benefit in that patient population. In terms of [indiscernible], you know, there are patients who dropout for various reasons, sometimes -- you know, I don't want to really go into the details where the patients plot [ph] but sometimes it's obviously just due to social reasons for patients participating in the clinical trials, travelling, again these are older populations sort of coming in with a frequency of visits and trying to make that trip. It was I think in Germany, you know, CARE for MDS patients is lot more centralized as many of these patients travelling 50, 60, 100 kilometers to get to their clinic for treatment, so part of that I think, you know, it has an impact on the patients involvement in the trial overtime. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike King with JMP Securities. Mike, your line is open, could you check the mute button please. Mike King : Sorry about that, can you hear me now? Operator : Yes, sir. Please go ahead. Mike King : My apologies. Just wanted to -- sorry, again, [indiscernible] in front of efficacy you guys have seen buy just curious Matt, it's just been the answer of the previous question, you talked about sort of social reason for patient withdrawing from the trial; I'm just wondering is there for patients who stop responding, is there a biological underpinning to that? Do they stop making colony forming units or is it more about patient decision to -- you know, I've been response and I feel good about that, I can move on. I'm just wondering if we can ascribe different reasons for why patients didn't continue on the trial? Matthew Sherman : Hi Mike. So they said several of them were just for social reasons for the patients willing to participate in the co-trials such as this and given their age. You know, sometimes it was disease progression; you know, these patients do have progressing unrelated to -- well, they can maintain their anemia but -- I'm sorry, their hematologic response to luspatercept but they can have progression of other underlying MDS. So there is other reasons obviously for these patients coming off study; but this is -- you know, this didn't seem untoward compared to other studies that we've looked at in terms of patients discontinuing. Mike King : Alright, okay. Matthew Sherman : I mean as a physician who has treated MDS in the past too, I think this kind of activities is fairly impressive activity and I think that was reflected by the enthusiasm that both the investigators from the trial, as well as from the general MBS community appreciate it at the MDS Symposium Conference given the very limited options that these patients have. It was clearly very enthusiastic reception for the data at the meeting in Valencia. Mike King : Alright, thank you. Matthew Sherman : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Acceleron management for any closing comments. Habib Dable : Yes, thank you, operator. So obviously an awful lot of interest and excitement over the recent data announcement. So I thank you all for your questions and I do look forward to meeting with you at some future investor conferences and medical meetings as we head into December month and wishing you all a great day. Thanks everybody. Operator : Thank you.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Todd James, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communication at Acceleron. Please go ahead. Todd James : Thanks, Candice, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2017 earnings call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today\u2019s webcast, are available on the investor\u2019s and media page of the corporate website at www.acceleronpharma.com. Joining me for the call today are Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer; Matthew Sherman, our Chief Medical Officer; and Kevin McLaughlin, our Chief Financial Officer. Our goal this afternoon is to provide an overview of the quarter, review updated financial results and outline our key priorities for the remainder of 2017. After that, we look forward to answering your questions. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to the regulatory and product development plans and research activities. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent Form 10-K on file with the SEC. I would now like to turn call over to Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer. Habib Dable : Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This is a truly exciting time at Acceleron with a number of late and mid-stage trials ongoing and several new trials planned to start in the near future. We\u2019re making meaningful progress in advancing luspatercept, our lead product candidate, as well as our wholly-owned ACE-083 muscle program. We\u2019ve also been extremely focused on evaluating our ongoing preclinical discovery and research efforts. We\u2019ve been working across our organization to identify key areas of prioritization based on TGF-beta protein superfamilies diverse human biology in an effort to focus our research and optimize our core capabilities to target new areas of high unmet patient need. But first, I\u2019d like to focus on luspatercept and provide an update on how the program is progressing and where we see it headed. As you know, we\u2019re developing luspatercept, along with our partner Celgene for the treatment of anemia in two important disease areas; Myelodysplastic Syndromes or MDS and beta-thalassemia. We recently announced the completion of full enrollment for the MEDALIST Phase 3 trial in MDS and the BELIEVE Phase 3 trial in beta-thalassemia. Throughout the recruitment process, we observed strong interest in the trial from physicians and patients and original enrollment goals were more than exceeded. Today, there are 229 MDS patients in total in the MEDALIST trial versus the original target of 210, and 336-beta-thalassemia patients in the BELIEVE trial well over the targeted 300. The rapid pace of enrollment further supports our excitement for the luspatercept program and reflects the clear need for new and effective therapies in both of these patient populations. To put this into perspective, in less than 18 months, over 560 patients and over 140 clinical sites across multiple countries have been enrolled in these two Phase 3 luspatercept studies. This is truly impressive and we see tremendous opportunity to dramatically improve patient\u2019s life in new disease areas, as well the opportunity to expand into other indications in which luspatercept to be a very important treatment option. We anticipate reporting top line results for both Phase 3 studies in mid-2018. We recently presented updated results from our ongoing Phase 2 studies with luspatercept at the International Symposium on MDS in early May and at the EHA Congress in late June. Results show that luspatercept continue to demonstrate meaningful responses in both MDS and beta-thalassemia with many patients remaining on study drug for two years or longer. Starting with MDS, overall, we saw positive responses on a broad set of lower risk patients, regardless of previous exposure ESAs. Baseline erthyropoetin levels are ring sideroblast status. Among the presentation highlights, the lower risk MDS patients demonstrated notable increases in hemoglobin lasting for up to 26 months, decreases in transfusion burden and had a high rate of transfusion independence. In patients with baseline EPO levels of less than or equal to 500 RS per liter. Transfusion independent or erythroid response rates for IWG HI-E criteria were meaningful for both the RS positive and RS negative groups. Specifically, eight out of the 16 RS negative patients are 50% achieved a clinically meaningful risk to erythroidresponse. Turning to beta-thalassemia for transfusion dependent patients. A 12-week fixed interval analysis was conducted to review transfusion reduction during weeks 13 to 24 and weeks 37 to 48, when compared to the baseline 12-week pretreatment period in order to evaluate durability of response. As a reminder, the ongoing BELIEVE Phase 3 trial will use this 12-week fixed interval analysis for evaluating the proportion of patients achieving, at least, 33% reduction in transfusion burden. 50% or 12 of 24 patients achieved a reduction in transfusion burden at, at least, 33% in the fixed 12-week interval from weeks 13 to 24, as compared to baseline. When we extend the fixed 12-week interval analysis out two weeks 37 to 48, only one of these 12 patients fall below the 33% reduction in red blood cell transfusion burden compared to the earlier interval. We also saw sustained increases in hemoglobin levels in non-transfusion-dependent patients for up to 24 months with several still on treatment. We now have accumulated over 2,000 months of luspatercept patient experience across our Phase 2 trials to-date. Luspatercept\u2019s safety and tolerability remains a key highlight of the program with many patients now on treatment for at least two years. Based on these consistent and encouraging results, we see a valuable opportunity to expand into first-line lower risk MDS patient segment. And we and Celgene plan to initiate a new Phase 3 trial luspatercept called COMMANDS. We also recently initiated a new Phase 2 trial in patients with myelofibrosis who have anemia and we are planning to initiate a Phase 2 trial in a non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia called BEYOND. Turning to ACE-083, our wholly-owned locally-acting muscle program. We are very excited about its potential to be a transformative therapy in patients who experience focal muscle loss. Enrollment in treatment are ongoing in the Part 1 dose-escalation Phase of our two Part Phase 2 trial in facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy or FSHD. We also recently reported that the first patient has been treated in Part 1 of our two Part Phase 2 study in Charcot-Marie-Tooth or CMT, one of the most prevalent forms of heritable motor and sensory neuropathy. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin McLaughlin, our Chief Financial Officer to run through the financials for the quarter. Kevin McLaughlin : Thanks, Habib. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of June 30, 2017 were $194 million. This compares to December 31, 2016 cash, cash equivalents and investments of $234.4 million. As a reminder, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the second-half of 2017. Collaboration revenue for the second quarter was $3.1 million. The revenue is entirely from our Celgene partnership and is primarily due to cost-sharing revenue of $2.9 million related to expenses incurred by the company in support of our partnered programs. Total costs and expenses for the second quarter were $33 million. This includes R&D expenses of $21.6 million and G&A expenses of $11.4 million. G&A expense includes a $3.6 million one-time non-cash charge, due to a modification of a former executive officer\u2019s equity awards in connection with his change in employment status announced in May 2017. The company posted a net loss for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017 of $29.7 million. I will now turn the presentation back over to Habib for final remarks. Kevin McLaughlin : Thanks, Kevin. I\u2019d now like to quickly summarize our priorities for the remainder of this year and beyond. Regarding luspatercept with full enrollment achieved in both Phase 3 trials, we are in a position to report top line results for MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials in mid-2018. We also look forward to three new trials. We and Celgene plan to initiate the COMMANDS Phase 3 trial in first-line, lower-risk MDS in early 2018. We also plan to enroll our first patient in the recently initiated Phase 2 myelofibrosis trial and initiate the BEYOND Phase 2 trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia by year-end 2017. Looking at ACE-083, we anticipate initial data from the Part 1 dose-escalation arm of the Phase 2 FSHD trial in late 2017. This update will include results from dose cohort 1 and we expect data from all of dose cohorts in 2018. We continue to advance the Phase 2 CMT trial with Part 1 dose-escalation results expected by year-end 2018. And we also plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial with ACE-2494, our systemic musculoskeletal program later this year. Finally, we\u2019ll be hosting a Research and Development Day on September the 19, in New York City to discuss our long-term vision and growth strategy. We look forward to discussing our ongoing preclinical research and all of our recent progress in the clinic with luspatercept and our muscle program at R&D Day, where we will include presentations from our senior management team, as well as key opinion leaders and industry experts. We hope you can join us live in New York or via the webcast. Please reach out to Todd and Candice at the e-mail address of investor@acceleronpharma.com for additional details. And with that, I\u2019ll open up the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Geoff Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open. Geoffrey Porges : Thanks very much and congratulations on all the progress on the new trials. A couple of questions, Habib, if I may. First, on ACE-083, what should we be expecting from that first cohort towards the end of the year? And most importantly, at what top point do you think you\u2019ll get validation of the functional endpoint that you\u2019re using? Will those results include that functional endpoint, or will they just be about specific muscle contraction and muscle bulk? And secondly, I had a question on the new trials for luspatercept. Could you talk a little bit about how you view the value proposition of luspatercept in those patients who, for example, a non-transfusion-dependent beta thal, or low-risk MDS, where in certain context you\u2019re competing either with EPO or with no treatment. And it might be harder to justify the sort of pricing that you\u2019ve talked about in the past for those more refractory patients that you studied in MEDALIST and BELIEVE? Habib Dable : Yes, okay. Thanks, Geoff. So first of all, I\u2019ll kick off with your second question regarding luspatercept and give you my perspectives, shed a little bit of light on ACE-083 and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Matt, who can provide a little bit more details in terms of specifically what we\u2019re going to be measuring in the first cohort versus \u2013 and maybe more in the first part of the study more importantly versus the second part. Geoffrey Porges : Okay. Habib Dable : So with respect, yes, so with respect to the luspatercept just specifically in new indications that we\u2019re looking at, for example, if we look at the first-line settings in MDS where we would be competing with ESAs, and really when you talk about the competition in ESAs, we\u2019re really predominately talking about the lower-risk first-line setting in MDS, whereby in beta-thalassemia, for example, ESAs are just really rarely, if at all, used in that setting. Geoffrey Porges : Yes. Habib Dable : So when we think about specifically now and targeting your question in that specific group, as you know, and I think we talked about this in the past, some of the internal assessments that we\u2019ve done in terms of some of the claims data, et cetera, we estimate that ESAs in the setting are used off-label, approximately $500 million to $600 million a year in the U.S. alone. And you could argue that, if indeed, and we haven\u2019t concluded this yet, and we plan to share more on this as the year progresses that if we were to go head-to-head improved superiority in this setting against ESAs, the risk of being step edited if you want or the risk of being pulled into that pricing challenge within ESA becomes a lot less. And I think what we\u2019re saying to ourselves here is that, we really want to differentiate ourselves from the ESAs in the class, and potentially go head-to-head with them in a superiority study. And I would believe that, in that scenario where you\u2019re on-label versus off-label and superior, you\u2019ve got a differentiated profile, which should be able to justify the value that we\u2019re bringing to the table. With respect to your second question really regarding specifically with respect to ACE-083 in a different cohorts. So we\u2019ve got three dosing cohorts in Part 1 of the study, Geoff, and that\u2019s really a dose-escalation cohort looking at 150, 200, and 250 milligram. And predominantly, we\u2019re going to be using MRI and muscle growth to be able to inform us in terms of whether or not we should be moving on to the higher doses or not. That said, I think the subject to your question is the most important part and that\u2019s really, if you\u2019re going to have a drug in this space, you need to demonstrate strength and function. And that\u2019s really what Part 2 of the study is designed for, where we would be recruiting 40 new patients. It would be a placebo-controlled study and we would clearly be looking at strength and function endpoints in that. Matt, though, if you\u2019d like to shed a little bit more color though in terms of the first part and three cohorts BEYOND simply looking at muscle growth as to whether or not and how much, if any information would be gaining BEYOND simple muscle growth. Matthew Sherman : Sure. So, hi, Geoff, this is Matt. So, yes. Geoffrey Porges : Hi, Matt. Matthew Sherman : To expand on Habib\u2019s answer. So for Part 1 of the study, which is a three-dose cohort and it is open-label escalating, we will have data for the first cohort of 100 milligram cohort, I\u2019m sorry, 150 milligram cohort at the end of this year, which we\u2019re primarily focused on the muscle volume by MRI. But we\u2019re also following patients for both increases in strength testing and importantly increases in functional testing. Examples of functional testing include time walking tests for patients whose lower extremities are affected, for patients whose biceps are affected that were locally injecting, here\u2019s performance of the upper limb testing, which is a measure of strength as well in the upper bicep. So we will have those data for the first cohort by the end of this year help us and inform us, as we continue to escalate to the second and the third cohort for patients. Geoffrey Porges : Terrific. Thanks very much, Matt. That \u2013 so we\u2019ll see that at the end of this year that I just want to make that clear. Matthew Sherman : Yes, we will. Geoffrey Porges : Terrific. Thank you. I appreciate. Habib Dable : Geoff, I think you had one more question Part, at least, to the earlier question regarding NTD and beta cell. And although, we would not be looking at ESAs directly there, I think, what\u2019s more important here is the value proposition that we would be bringing to the table. In that, many of these patients still \u2013 with the increased levels or the decrease of hemoglobin have a lot of different symptoms. And as you know, we talked about this before simply being symptomatic is enough to make these patient feel pretty miserable. And if you look at the IWG guidelines and if you look at the ability to have clinically meaningful responses with these patient, the unmet need is still pretty high. And we\u2019re really trying to target that specifically as well. Geoffrey Porges : Great. Thanks very much for the answers, I appreciate it. Habib Dable : Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Gould of UBS. Your line is now open. Carter Gould : Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on the progress. First question, would you be willing to give any quantitative details on enrollment in the FSHD studies like this cohort one fully enrolled? And then secondly, just trying to get some additional color on how we should be thinking about internal versus external programs? On one hand, you\u2019re going to have an Analyst Day, that\u2019s going to focus on the pipeline. On the other hand, there\u2019s some new language in the queue around acquiring or in-licensing external assets, you\u2019re also looking to hire a BD person. So just trying to understand how you\u2019re prioritizing in-house versus external assets? Thank you. Habib Dable : Yes. So regarding FSHD enrollment, Matt, do you want to take, I can take the second part? Matthew Sherman : Hi, Carter. So, yes, we\u2019re very pleased with the enrollment to-date. We are progressing very nicely. We\u2019re on track. And as we\u2019ve indicated, we\u2019ll have data from the first cohort by the end of this year. Habib Dable : And Carter, regarding specifically your question on in-house versus external, what I can tell you right now, TGF-beta has always been the foundation of what we\u2019ve been doing here. We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue to focus on TGF-beta internally. I think that\u2019s what really differentiates us in terms of the deep expertise within this organization in terms of whether it\u2019s research development, and really understanding where this particular area could take us. One of the things that we will talk about at R&D Day in September, we\u2019ll be right around exactly where are the various opportunities? Where are the areas of high unmet need, where we feel we can leverage our deep expertise and potentially go into areas that we haven\u2019t talked about. I\u2019m going to shed some light on some of that analysis. And we\u2019ll obviously be talking a lot more about where we are with our existing programs in terms of luspatercept in the muscle programs. Regarding external and BD specifically, I guess, you could look at BD in a number of ways, right? When looking at business development opportunities could also mean, once we get to a certain point within our own existing portfolio, we may be considering opportunities in trying to finding partners to be able to help us and assist us with our wholly-owned pipeline in market, say, for example, outside of the U.S. These are options that we will consider. We have not made decisions on that yet. But we also have said that, we are very committed to building leadership in therapeutic areas that we\u2019re committed to. And at a certain point, when we are able to declare that we\u2019ve gained enough progress in certain disease areas, whether that\u2019s FSHD, or CMT, or others, we will be open to looking at enriching our portfolio with complementary assets perhaps in non-TGF-beta-related assets and bringing them in-house. But today, this is all preliminary thinking and really just good housekeeping, as we prepare ourselves for growth and leadership. Carter Gould : Thanks, Habib. Habib Dable : Thank, Carter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, guys. Thank you. So a couple of questions. So first, on the muscle program. So you mentioned that we could get some strength in function data. Can you just shed some expectations a little bit here? And how you\u2019re thinking about number one, what would be data that would motivate you to move to next goes? Do you think you\u2019ll \u2013 the patient will be \u2013 it will be long enough to see a benefit and giving you a preclinical work like where do you expect to see \u2013 would you expect to see a benefit on function and strength at the lowest dose? And then second for SG&A side. Do you expect that to be high in the second-half of the year as a single or a bit higher this quarter? Habib Dable : Yes, thanks, Robyn. So I\u2019m going to pass the first question over to Matt to talk a little bit about the strength in function datasets, and then maybe Kevin you can take the second question regarding the SG&A costs? Matthew Sherman : Hi, Robyn. So, yes, let me just sort of walk through what the design of the study is and again just emphasize what information we have. So Part 1 was \u2013 is an open label part of the study in three dose levels \u2013 dose-escalating. We escalate on safety, so we don\u2019t actually need to have all the information in terms of muscle volume, muscle strength testing or muscle function another two to escalate. It is our plan. So we are, obviously, collecting that information one to two weeks throughout the study. And the Phase 2 study has been designed as a three-month study, and we do feel that that is a duration that is sufficient to be able to see meaningful changes in these parameters. If you go back to the healthy volunteer study, it was only after two doses 21 days apart that we\u2019re able to see a 14.5% increase in muscle volume in the rectus femoris muscle and 8.9% increase in muscle volume in the tibialis anterior muscle. So certainly with three-month dosing in the Phase 2 study, we expect that we\u2019ll meet or exceed those levels, of course, this is a disease population that\u2019s the unknown. Kevin McLaughlin : Robyn, hi, this is Kevin. On the \u2013 on your question regarding SG&A and spending as we go forward in time, the second quarter was impacted by a one-time non-cash charge of about $3.6 million regarding the change in status of one of our employees. That obviously, caused the second quarter run rate to go above what has been a more normalized rate. So we would expect expenses to grow over time, but not in a manner which is represented in the second quarter. Robyn Karnauskas : Got it. Thank you. Habib Dable : And our guidance remains unchanged in turns having enough runway to take us into the second-half of 2019. Robyn Karnauskas : Got it. Thank you. Habib Dable : Thanks, Robyn. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ted Tenthoff of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Edward Tenthoff : Great. Thank you very much. Just digging a little deeper into the systemic muscle program. What looked to be potential Phase 2 indications for that? And with respect to sort of more systemic disease, where do you think you might go broadly with respect to endpoints and/or different disease areas? Todd James : Hey, Ted, it\u2019s Todd. Thanks for your question. So as far as that program goes, I would say, there\u2019s a bunch of areas that we\u2019re thinking about in the rare disease muscle \u2013 neuromuscular area that we could, someone like our size Acceleron around could develop here in-house. And as far as going into details of disease areas, I\u2019d say, stay tuned for R&D Day, where we\u2019ll give some more of our thinking about how that program will progress. And then the first goal is to go into a healthy volunteer Phase 1 study. And so I would say, as far as a protocol or endpoints would depend on the disease that we choose for the Phase 2 study and all the other parameters, so stay tuned. Edward Tenthoff : All right. Fair enough. Looking forward to R&D Day. Thanks. Habib Dable : Thanks, Ted. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alethia Young : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, sorry, two for me. One can you talk a little bit about the background luspatercept to use in myelofibrosis and kind of where it positions relative to the current players in the market? And then just a kind of a strategic question, I guess, as you guys kind of move forward and move past some of the interesting programs that you have now, are you looking to kind of be more of a smaller scale company as far as rare diseases, or are you will \u2013 you focus on large opportunities into their partnerships, or is it kind of both doors are open, if you can expand on that, that would be great? Thanks. Habib Dable : Hey, Alethia, it\u2019s Habib. So thanks for your questions. Regarding the first one, regarding myelofibrosis in terms of it\u2019s kind of sizing up the opportunity. Right now, you\u2019ve got Jakafi, which is used in the marketplace for those patients \u2013 for those myelofibrosis patients who suffer from an enlarged spleen. If you really look at that patient group, you\u2019ve got approximately 30,000 patients that we estimate with myelofibrosis. About half of those patients, Alethia, we believe suffer from moderate to severe anemia, okay? Some of them are actually anemic without an enlarged spleen, some of them actually are an anemic and have an enlarged spleen on Jakafi. So we plan to be looking at dose populations in monotherapy with luspatercept, as well as an add-on to Jakafi. Alethia Young : And the strategic question? Habib Dable : Yes. And so strategically, you\u2019ve kind \u2013 you\u2019ve cut off a little bit when you\u2019re asked on the second part. Could you just repeat the second part of the question a little bit. Alethia Young : Yes, sure. I\u2019m just trying to understand whether you have a preference toward like smaller market opportunities that you commercialize, or opportunities that would require partnership, or you still kind of down in the middle on this? Habib Dable : Yes, now I got it, yes. So right now, our focus really is on those rare diseases where there\u2019s a huge unmet need. And in most cases, the areas that we\u2019re studying right now are in areas where there\u2019s actually no pharmacology therapy. Now, if indeed, we find that we\u2019ve got some compelling science and mechanism of action that leads that towards an area of high unmet need and it happens to be a very large area, we\u2019ll think about that and perhaps assess the many strategic options that we would have at our disposal. But I would argue right now, that is not core to our strategy and that we really are focusing on those rare diseases with high unmet needs. Alethia Young : Great. Thanks. Habib Dable : Yes, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike King of JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Michael King : Hey, guys, sorry, little slow getting of mute there. Maybe further to the questions about MDS \u2013 lower-risk MDS and myelofibrosis. Can you talk a little bit about Commands and BEYOND, because I don\u2019t know that investor world has gotten sort of a broad appreciation of the kind of endpoint you\u2019re trying to achieve in both of those. So if you might shed some lightness on that front for starters? Thanks. Matthew Sherman : Yes. So with respect to those two disease areas, we obviously are going to \u2013 we\u2019re still obviously working with the authorities. We\u2019re working with our partners at Celgene and looking at some of the specific endpoints. Between now and the end of the year, we obviously will be shedding a lot more light on that. I think what does remain is the fact that, in both those areas, the unmet need is very high. And specifically, when you look at the first-line setting where COMMANDS is looking at, all we have is off-label use ESAs. And as you \u2013 as you\u2019ve probably seen some of the recent publications, Mike, even at ASH, these patients are being treated with ESAs, with minimal to moderate effect. You saw that the data was anywhere from 15% to 30% response rate. And the durability within the patient population, it\u2019s relatively low. When we saw that it\u2019s sounds from seven to 12 months in those cases. So we\u2019re really trying to look at finding an opportunity for us to differentiate and to do that in a meaningful and durable way. And I believe that as the year goes on and as we get more and more feedback from the authorities, we\u2019ll be able to share with you a little bit more specifics about what those endpoints will look like. Michael King : Okay, so it sounds to me like what you\u2019re saying is that it\u2019s really about the magnitude of the benefit over ESAs as the accepted standard of care rather than any one particular definition of superiority? Todd James : Hey Mike, it\u2019s Todd. If you look at their \u2013 Michael King : Hey, Todd. Todd James : \u2013 their HI-E rate that Habib described at the 15% to 30% rate, and you look at the treatment naive patients that we evaluated in our Phase 2 trial that it remains ongoing, we\u2019re seeing a 50% plus response rate on a HI-E. If you look at their data, if any patient came into a trial with a baseline transfusion burden, it really significantly impacts the patient\u2019s ability to respond. If you look at data with luspatercept in Phase 2 in patients that are naive and a transfusion burden really doesn\u2019t impact their ability to respond at all in that patient population. So, from based off of our Phase 2 results, we see clear differentiation between the patients that they are able to get respond versus luspatercept, so a lot to be excited about in that patient population. Michael King : Got it, okay and is it also fair to say that it maybe also about what the appropriate secondary end points might be in order to either demonstrate quality of life benefits pharmacoeconomic etcetera? Todd James : Yes, I mean I think given that, so always all end points are fairly important, obviously nothing outweighs the primary, but given that it\u2019s off label therapy, we think you know definitely just showing at a primary will be very important. Michael King : Got it, okay that\u2019s great. Thanks for further added color. And then question on Myelofibrosis, just wondering if, I mean I know a lot of them have anemia, but it comes from a failing marrow. So if you don\u2019t have \u2013 you know based on the mechanism of luspatercept and sotatercept for that matter. If you\u2019ve got \u2013 if you are not generating enough of the BFU, the blast and other cells in the lineage, how helpful do you think luspatercept can be in that setting? Matthew Sherman : Hi Mike, it\u2019s Matt. So, we hope it will be very helpful and based on the earlier data that we generated from the investigator-initiated trial at the MD Anderson Cancer Center showing that we had, five out of 14 patients we had response \u2013 hematologic response to sotatercept, so what that adds, the background information, obviously moving forward with this, very well designed rigorous Phase 2 study of luspatercept in myelopoiesis patients. You asked really about the endpoints for this, this trial is now posted on clinicaltrial.gov, so it\u2019s detailed there. Michael King : Okay. Matthew Sherman : The end points are fairly, again fairly standard or rigorous end points in terms of the anemia only patient. They are required to have an increase in hemoglobin of 1.5 g/dL over 12 weeks and for the patients with transfusion dependent, they must become transfusion independent as well for a period of 12 weeks. So, with those data, we obviously will have lot of information to move forward into a Phase 3 trial. Michael King : Yes, I appreciate that. Again I\u2019m just trying to figure out sort of the factors that determine commercial success in addition to clinical success, but we can take the rest of that discussion offline. I just wanted to spend a second on another topic, a separate topic that I talk to clients about a fair bit and that\u2019s sort of the overall advancement of the gene therapy space, you know we\u2019ve seen a lot obviously in hemophilia, but I think most investors think that the same \u2013 similar benefits are going to come to things like beta-cell, sickle-cell etcetera. So just wondering how you guys think about the advent of gene therapy when you are thinking about your strategic and commercial planning? Thanks. Habib Dable : Mike, this is Habib. With respect to gene therapy, I mean we are obviously aware of some of the studies are ongoing there. I personally feel if gene therapy is successful, it will be a wonderful thing for patients, but I also believe that we would not be direct competitors for all patients in that space and that there will be an opportunity for luspatercept in a very, very large population independent of that success. And we can talk about why I believe that whether that\u2019s because of access, whether that\u2019s because of the specific patient groups that they would be targeting etcetera. But I do believe wholeheartedly that if the opportunity for gene therapy and beta-thalassemia comes to existence that can only be a good thing for patients and it\u2019s something that we have taken into account, but do not see as a formidable competitor in where we plan to compete. Michael King : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Habib Dable : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Choi of Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Choi : Hi, thanks for taking our questions and also let me offer our congratulations on all the progress in the quarter. Thanks for the details on the enrollment updates and numbers for both MEDALIST and BELIEVE and it looks like you exceeded your targets by about 10% give or take. And I just wanted to check if by the success in enrollment, would there be potential changes in empowering or effect size or anything if we should think about the assumptions being somehow affected by the excess enrollment in both of those studies? Matthew Sherman : Hi, Paul. So no, I think as Habib indicated, it was a very rapid enrollment, it was very enthusiastic support by the investigators and certainly by the patients that led to the over enrollment, it\u2019s not unusual for such large trails more than 70 sites per trial. Once you hit that target enrollment, slowing it down those patients and screening who will eventually need to be swept into enrollment if they were eligible and then further randomization would discontinue. It won\u2019t have any significant impact on the powering of that study. Paul Choi : Okay, great and thanks for that. And then I know it\u2019s several months off here, but is it fair to expect that the upcoming ASH meeting in December that you\u2019ll have any incremental updates on the Phase 2 datasets that you presented at EHA for either the MDS or the beta-thalassemia studies? Todd James : Hey Paul, it\u2019s Todd. Yes, so we always plan and submit abstracts for the upcoming medical conferences and so that that time period just popped up on us here in August and so we\u2019ll be able to discuss more of the plans when those abstracts will be potentially accepted in November. Paul Choi : Okay, great, thanks for taking our question. Todd James : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Marai of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Christopher Marai : Hi, guys, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Just wondering if you could touch base on ACE-2494 systemic formulation I suppose of the myostat inhibitor, maybe remind us that it differs from 083 and how you might expect that impacts, I guess the side effects, the notes that you file with systemic is ACE-083? And then secondarily, just with respect ACE-083 trail enrollment, could you give us some color decision in patient sort of excitement around that drug and then perhaps any indication that those intramuscular injections are being well tolerated, I know there will be three weeks, but is that something you might address with the 2494 in those indications and then I have one follow-up, thank you. Matthew Sherman : Hi Chris, it\u2019s Matt. So, in regard to the first question for ACE-020 molecule, we will going to the healthy volunteer trail, we\u2019ll initiate it by the end of this year, so we\u2019ll have more update in terms of the specifics of the trial design and actually the potential therapeutic indication in the molecule itself. So I think just stay tuned for that, we\u2019ll also be able to provide some update as well at the R&D day, but our overall strategy across our different programs. We \u2013 regarding \u2013 I\u2019m sorry your second question. [Multiple speakers] Matthew Sherman : On the mechanism, so as ACE-031 that was partnered with Shire that we discontinued due to having an impact on vasculature due to its binding of a TGF-beta ligand called BMP9 and so what we are able to do is protein engineering for our new systemic molecule was basically take that binding out and now that molecule ligand trap hits GDF8 or myostatin, GDF11 and and activins. And the difference between ACE-024 and ACE-094 and ACE-083, ACE-083 was developed after the naturally occurring ligand trap in the TGF-beta superfamily called follistatin. So different protein, though, they hit similar ligands with hitting GDF8/11 and activins also with ACE-083, but the protein itself is different. Matthew Sherman : And again, to add to the strategy, so ACE-083 is developed as a local muscle injection ACE-2494 will be a systemic. And really talking different diseases, because there are some diseases, as we indicated earlier, about FSHD, dystrophy, and CMT that can affect some of the number of muscles. And so they are a local therapy has the advantages of not having system exposure, where other diseases potentially might be more amenable to a systemic therapy. In regard to local injections for ACE-083, we haven\u2019t released any information yet regarding the study. But we\u2019re very pleased with the progress and now we continue to be on track for having data from our trial by the end of this year. Christopher Marai : Okay, great. And then just with respect to the trial in CMT, I was wondering they\u2019re talking nerve impairment probably where the disease is diagnosed and part of the disease in general. And I was just wondering, how can we expect the benefit or what type of benefit should we sort of expect if you\u2019re increasing muscle strength in size, but the nerves may still be impaired. Is it possible that you\u2019re going to be able to enter the early on here any disease, or when nerves are still intact, or how should we look at that in terms of a potential patient benefit, and how are you identifying those potential muscles in the trial? Thank you. Matthew Sherman : So regarding trial on CMT, as you say, as you can hear, this is a disease where there\u2019s lots of nerve function as opposed to a loss of muscle function and secondarily, then the muscle plus innovated and was strong. With that intact muscles there still is nerve innervation to their muscle and patients do have residual strength. So by building up muscle strength and function, it should improve the function for the patients. We identify patients, there \u2013 this is actually a disease that\u2019s definitely took effect about 100,000 people in the United States. They present fairly routinely to regional or muscular clinics and in terms of eligibility for the trial they must have some strength. So that they \u2013 some mild to moderate weakness, but obviously some residual strength as well in order to for us to be able to show benefit for therapy. Todd James : And Chris, it\u2019s Todd. I\u2019d also add that, we\u2019re focused on specific subtypes of CMT with CMT-1 and CMTX. And these subtypes of the disease are more adept myonating form and don\u2019t have external involvement until much later in that patient\u2019s disease progression. And to Matt\u2019s point that there are still healthy nerves innervating the muscle. And so we believe if we are able to strengthen and enlarge the fibers connected to those healthy nerves that we\u2019d increase the overall contract out force of the muscle. And focused in CMT on the tibialis anterior as many of these patients have put drop and it really tax their ability to lift the front their foot when they walk leading to not only lots of mobility, but a lot of falls. Christopher Marai : Great. Excellent. I appreciate that. Thank you. Todd James : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just maybe two for me. First, on the front-line MDS trial that you guys are planning. I was just wondering if you can share any preliminary thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about baseline EPO level for inclusion and then also ESA dosing, as I know, that can be pretty variable and given it\u2019s an off-label indication. How you\u2019d look to nail that down> And then the second part is, just do you guys see the oral hip inhibitors as a potential future competitive threat to luspatercept and MDS? Thanks Habib Dable : Matt, I turn it over to you. Matthew Sherman : Yes. So, hi, Terence. So, we haven\u2019t really presented any of the details in terms of the state designs. I think, we\u2019ll just have to stay tuned and wait till later in this year when we get to the specifics of the trial design. Just to refer you to the most recent update that we had in terms of the activity at the \u2013 both at the MDS Symposium in Valencia and EHA in Spain, we\u2019re able to show that, we have very good activity in MDS patients \u2013 in the lower-risk first-line MDS patients with baseline EPO level less than 500. So, that\u2019s one good benchmark to keep an eye on. Habib Dable : As far as the hips go, Terence, we really look at them very similar to the ESAs. In that, they boost natural erythropoietin levels. And so as far as a mechanism, we think that their results would probably be fairly similar to the essays. And given the mechanism for MDS in these patients being more of this later stage, in effect of a erythropoiesis versus an actual lack of endogenous erythropoietin, think that that therapy will have some challenges in having a significant impact on these patients anemia and underlying confusion burden. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks a lot. Matthew Sherman : Thank you, Terence. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Habib Dable for any closing remarks. Habib Dable : Thanks, everybody, and thanks for joining the call this afternoon. We hope you enjoy the rest of this summer and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences and as well the R&D Day on September the 19. Have a great day, and please feel free to reach out to us if you have any additional questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Merck's Q3 2017 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meetings of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including 1A in the 2016 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining the call today. Our third quarter results again demonstrate the underlying strength of our business. Throughout the year, we've been executing on global launches for new products and delivering growth in our vaccines and Animal Health businesses. Our strong performance is particularly notable in a year where we've been facing the combined loss of nearly $2.5 billion in patent protected sales, continued pricing pressures, an isolated but meaningful cyber incident, and most recently, several natural disasters. Our consistent performance also underscores the company's resolve to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company. We measure success based on our ability to sustainably deliver differentiated medicines and vaccines. And we believe that long-term value creation is a direct function of our ability to deliver on the promise of innovation. To that end, we continue to prioritize our resources to invest in Merck's research laboratories, including our new discovery hubs in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and South San Francisco, to advance the next generation of Merck medicines and vaccines. At the same time, we're scouring the landscape to find the best external science to augment our portfolio. An example is the newly formed oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca, which involves codeveloping and co-commercializing LYNPARZA. We're already seeing good progress with LYNPARZA and believe it will add significant strength to our growing leadership in oncology, which is anchored by KEYTRUDA. We're also looking carefully at other potential products in our pipeline, determining which opportunities have the highest potential to address unmet needs. For instance, we recently made the decision to prioritize certain opportunities in our pipeline for vaccines and for HIV. We believe these represent areas of long-term growth and could sizably add to our other key pillars of growth, namely oncology and animal health. Recognizing that invention requires significant resources and investment, we remain disciplined in supporting our R&D opportunities, while at the same time reshaping our operating model in line with our changing portfolio and the evolving health care environment. Going forward, we will build on the momentum of Merck's product launches and pipeline opportunities and seek new or additional ways to maximize long-term growth and sustainable value for society and shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Davis, to go through our results in more detail. Rob? Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong operational performance, allowing us to deliver solid bottom-line growth on a non-GAAP basis, despite several challenges in the quarter. Now, starting first with our top-line results. Total company revenues were $10.3 billion, a decrease of 2% year over year. Excluding the impact of exchange, third quarter revenues declined 3%, with the 4% decline in our Human Health business partially offset by 14% growth in Animal Health. While Adam will detail Human Health performance in a moment, it's worth highlighting that the quarterly sales of our Animal Health business reached $1 billion for the first time, driven primarily by continued strength in our Companion Animal business, including BRAVECTO, and growth in our Ruminants business, which includes contributions from the Vall\u00e9e acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margin was 76% in the quarter, an increase of roughly 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2016. Favorable product mix, driven by KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER, was the largest contributor to the year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.2 billion increased 4% year over year, primarily driven by higher R&D expense, reflecting increased investment in early drug development. Taken together, we earned $1.11 per share on a non-GAAP basis, up 4% excluding exchange. Note that our GAAP EPS loss of $0.02 reflects a charge of $2.35 billion related to the formation of the strategic oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca announced earlier in the quarter. As we had cautioned in July, the June cyber event negatively impacted third quarter results, including an unfavorable revenue impact of approximately $135 million from lost sales and approximately $175 million in costs spread across the cost of goods sold and the operating expense lines. We anticipate a similar impact to revenue and expenses in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our updated guidance. In addition, we borrowed $240 million of GARDASIL from the CDC stockpile to fulfill shipments in the quarter. The borrowing was driven in part by the temporary production shutdown resulting from the cyberattack, as well as overall higher demand than originally planned. The revenue will ultimately be recognized as we replenish the stockpile, which we currently anticipate will occur in the second half of 2018. It's worth noting that while our reported sales for the third quarter were down $210 million, absent the cyber and stockpile items, we would have had a quarter of growth, even in the face of significant LOEs. Turning to 2017 guidance. Given our operational strength year to date as well as a more favorable exchange rate environment, we are narrowing and raising our revenue range for the full year. We now expect revenues to be between $40 billion and $40.5 billion. We continue to expect a moderate year-over-year increase in our gross margin. We also continue to expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a mid-single digit rate compared to full year 2016, driven by higher R&D cost to support our oncology business, including the AstraZeneca collaboration, as well as vaccines and other pipeline opportunities. We are also assuming approximately $175 million of business development expenses in the fourth quarter, largely driven by the closing of the Rigontec acquisition. We now expect the full year non-GAAP tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. We continue to project average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 2.75 billion for the year. Taken together, we are narrowing and raising our expected non-GAAP EPS range for the full year to $3.91 to $3.97. Both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS ranges include a negative impact from foreign exchange of less than 1% using mid-October rates. In summary, we continue to execute well. We have many opportunities in our pipeline that we believe can drive long term growth, for which we have invested in this year and we will continue to invest in throughout next year as well. We have been reallocating resources wherever possible. And we will continue to remain disciplined to maximize the long term trajectory of our business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the Performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter. And my comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health delivered sales of $9.2 billion, a decline of 4%, primarily driven by the loss of exclusivity for several products. We continue to see strong underlying growth from launch products, including KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION. Now I'll highlight a few of our key franchises and product launches, and I'll start with oncology. This is an exciting time for Merck as a global leader in immuno-oncology. We remain focused on executing on the extensive opportunity that we have with KEYTRUDA. And we are also excited about the growth opportunity for LYNPARZA, which we have begun co-marketing globally with AstraZeneca. I'll start with KEYTRUDA. Worldwide sales for KEYTRUDA in the quarter exceeded $1 billion for the first time, making KEYTRUDA the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio. And in 2017 alone, we have launched six new indications in the U.S., four in Europe, and three in Japan. In the U.S., more new patients now start on KEYTRUDA than any other I-O agent across all indications. With 10 indications in six tumor types and MSI-high cancers, U.S. KEYTRUDA sales grew to just over $600 million in the quarter. Although there was some noise in the channel this quarter, as distributors normalized their inventory levels, if you look at the most recent script data, we have seen substantial growth in demand both year over year as well as quarter over quarter. We continued to build on our leadership position in lung cancer with growth driven by continued adoption of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in high expressers, as well as the uptake of the KEYTRUDA/ALIMTA combination in the first-line setting. Across all of lung cancer, nearly one in three new lung cancer patients in the U.S. are being started on KEYRUDA, making it the most prescribed treatment for new metastatic lung cancer patients. Lung cancer was our largest tumor type, but indications outside of lung cancer contributed to approximately 45% of U.S. sales. In addition to continued leadership position in melanoma and head and neck cancer, we have seen strong momentum for the bladder cancer launch. Within just two months in the second line or greater setting, KEYTRUDA achieved I-O leadership in new Rx share, despite being the fifth market entrant. Outside of the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain a leadership position in the PD-1 class in melanoma. And we are seeing a greater contribution from lung cancer, as reimbursement is established in additional markets in the first-line and second-line settings. Following our recent 1bladder cancer approval in Europe, we're now also working through the reimbursement process for this indication in each country. Early performance in Japan is also strong, with PD-L1 testing rates in lung cancer consistent with that in the U.S. Altogether, we see great opportunity for KEYTRUDA around the world, and we remain focused on establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundation for the treatment of cancer. We also began working side by side with our colleagues at AstraZeneca and are ramping up our sales force to support the ongoing launch of LYNPARZA. We are excited about the opportunity we see with the broader label in ovarian cancer. And we're looking forward to the upcoming opportunity in metastatic breast cancer. Now I'll move to JANUVIA. Global sales for the JANUVIA franchise were $1.5 billion, a decline of 2%. While we saw volume growth globally, we also experienced continued pricing pressure as we've discussed for the last several years. While we expect pricing pressure to continue, macro trends support volume growth going forward, especially outside of the U.S. As a result, we view our diabetes franchise as a relatively stable foundation from which to grow our portfolio of new products. Moving now to our Vaccine business. Global sales were $1.9 billion with growth outside of the U.S., including the contribution from the European JV termination. Underlying demand for GARDASIL remains strong. And increased patient starts are helping to offset the negative impact in the transition to the two-dose regimen in the U.S. GARDASIL worldwide sales would have grown in the quarter absent our borrowing from the stockpile. Based on current trends, we are confident in the continuous supply in the U.S. going forward. We continue to see opportunities for growth in our Vaccine business, particularly from the continued strength in GARDASIL as we move into the next year. Moving now to Hospital and Specialty. The ZEPATIER launch progressed well in the quarter with growth driven by Europe, Japan, and the U.S. However, we recognize the evolving marketplace and competitive landscape. And while we remain focused on maximizing its potential, we expect significant pressure on ZEPATIER throughout the remainder of this year and into next year. Finally, BRIDION delivered another great quarter with growth of more than 30%, driven by strong demand in most markets around the world, including the ongoing launch in the U.S. We have seen nearly 95% repurchasing from top accounts in the U.S., which demonstrates the market's continued positive experience with BRIDION. In closing, our results show the benefit from our strong execution and the contribution from launches. We have good momentum in our global oncology and Vaccine businesses in addition to others. And we believe these franchises position us well for success heading into 2018. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Adam. Progress in the registration of KEYTRUDA continued during the third quarter with accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, who have previously received two or more lines of chemotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1. Also as part of our partnership with AstraZeneca, we received approval in the United States for new uses of LYNPARZA, our poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor, including a new tablet formation \u2013 formulation for the fourth line treatment of patients with ovarian cancer, who have deleterious or suspected to be deleterious BRCA alleles. LYNPARZA also received FDA approval for maintenance treatment of patients regardless of BRCA mutation status with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have responded to platinum based chemotherapy. We're excited by additional data that we've seen for LYNPARZA treatment. In particular, we announced during the third quarter that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted for review our supplemental new drug application for the use of LYNPARZA tablets in patients with germline, BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, who have been previously treated with chemotherapy either in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting. The FDA granted priority review with a PDUFA action date in the first quarter of 2018. LYNPARZA is also undergoing regulatory review in Japan. During the third quarter at the Congress of the European Society of Cardiology, we presented the results of REVEAL, our 30,000 patient study, testing whether anacetrapib, when added to an effective LDL-cholesterol lowering regimen, could reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events as compared with the placebo control. Although the REVEAL study met its primary endpoint, after consultation with experts in cardiovascular disease, including those who had advised us through the decade-long prosecution of the anacetrapib development program, we concluded that we would not pursue regulatory filings of this drug. We are grateful to the patients, families, and physicians who participated in this study and to the Oxford University team that led all aspects of study execution and data analysis. Separately, after reviewing the evolving hepatitis C therapeutic landscape, we decided not to pursue development of doublet and triplet regimens containing MK-3682, our highly effective nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor. This decision was not stimulated by any inadequacies in the antiviral compounds themselves, especially the triplet MK-3682B. But instead followed directly from prioritization decisions during our portfolio management process. Despite these conclusions regarding our newest HCV therapies, we remain very enthusiastic about ZEPATIER. For example, earlier this month we presented real world data from the U.S. Veterans Administration (sic) [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], demonstrating very high antiviral activity in genotype 1 or 4 HCV infected patients with chronic renal disease, including a 95.6% sustained urologic response in patients with a very severe chronic kidney disease, CKD 4 and 5. Beyond ZEPATIER, during the third quarter we continued to elaborate a broad program in infectious disease and vaccine research. Earlier this month, we presented data from our pivotal Phase III study of letermovir, a cytomegalovirus terminase inhibitor for the prophylaxis of CMV infection or reactivation in adult recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants. These data are currently under review by the FDA with a PDUFA date of November 8. They're also being evaluated by the Committee on Human Medicinal Products (sic) [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] of the European Medicines Agency. Returning again to our oncology program, at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Yokohama earlier this month, Julie Brahmer and colleagues presented long-term follow-up data from KEYNOTE-024, showing that in the first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, in which greater than 50% of tumor cells express PD-L1, the median survival for patients randomized to the KEYTRUDA arm was 30 months, as compared to 14.2 months for those receiving chemotherapy, despite a 62% effective crossover rate. We also continue to see impressive improvements in overall survival following treatment with KEYTRUDA in combination with traditional chemotherapy. Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings last month documented enhanced separation of the survival curves with longer follow-up in our KEYNOTE-021G study, comparing traditional therapy, that is carboplatin/pemetrexed, with the results achieved when KEYTRUDA was added to this treatment regimen. While the hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.9 in the primary analysis, after a median of 18.7 months follow-up, the observed hazard ratio for overall survival had fallen to 0.59. This was true despite a 75% crossover rate to anti-PD-1/L1 therapy in the chemotherapy arm. In other words, early administration of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy seemed to confer improved overall survival. With these results in mind, we have elected to revise the statistical analysis plan for KEYNOTE-189, a nearly 600 patient study patterned after KEYNOTE-021G, to include dual endpoints of progression pre-survival and overall survival. This revision has been reviewed and accepted by the FDA. The timeline for completion of KEYNOTE-189 has therefore been extended to capture longer term survival data, with an estimated completion date, depending upon the underlying event rate, in February of 2019. The study is fully enrolled, as we announced in the second quarter. And the opportunity exists to conduct interim analyses, again depending upon the underlying event rate that we observe. Lastly, I note that beyond LYNPARZA and selumetinib, in the third quarter we acquired a RIG-I antagonist through the purchase of Munich-based Rigontec. And beyond these programs, our early oncology pipeline include 20 proprietary molecules, which have either entered the clinic or which have been approved to enter development. We are now beginning to see evidence of activity in a number of these early programs. And details of these studies will be presented in scientific meetings beginning in 2018. I'll now turn the call back to Teri. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. We'll be moving on to our Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to please keep to a maximum of two questions to allow us to get as many people on the call as possible this morning. So, Darla, if you can queue everyone up, please. Operator : Certainly. Your first question is from Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Roger, could you comment on any differential activity you've seen in KEYNOTE-021G with patients with high versus low baseline TMB [tumor mutational burden]? And whether TMB forms part of the primary endpoint of your recently initiated ipi/pembro [ipilimumab/pembrolizumab] trial? And then second, the market is currently viewing your recent LYNPARZA deal as a play on ovarian and breast cancer. What opportunity do you see significantly beyond that? Both in patients with germline DNA repair mutations, given the prevalence in refractory cancers, as well as in combination with KEYTRUDA? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right, Andrew, okay. So first of all, the question is differential activity in KEYNOTE-021G as a function of tumor mutational burden. We don't really have those kinds of data specifically. We've done a lot of work on tumor mutational burden in all of our studies. But those we're not \u2013 in response to your second question. We're not including tumor mutational burden as an explicit endpoint within KEYNOTE-189 in part because of course one has to define cut points for tumor mutational burden. That is, at what point within each tumor type does a tumor mutational burden rise to the point where you believe that's meaningful? And we have a lot of data of course from this from looking at MSI-high populations. And as you know we have a broad label for patients who have MSI-high tumors. And we can see the magnitude of the tumor mutational burden in that population, where response rates are quite good. And we can look at tumor mutational burden in other populations and stratify. But there's still work to be done to define what those cut points actually are. So that's not part of the KEYNOTE-189 program. Specifically with regard to LYNPARZA, the opportunities are really quite broad. We have, together with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, more than a dozen potential registration-enabling studies covering a broad range of tumor types. One of the things that excited us, of course, relevant to the tumor mutational burden question, is that by virtue of the fact that PARP inhibitors have an effect on the salvage mechanism for DNA repair, the accumulation of mutations that could encode neo-androgens might be expected to increase. And those could provide acceptable targets for T lymphocytes that would be unleashed in the presence of KEYTRUDA. So the combination of KEYTRUDA therapy and LYNPARZA is something that we're really very excited about. Of course preliminary data along those lines has been generated with niraparib in combination with KEYTRUDA as part of our collaboration with TESARO. And we continue to pursue those studies as well. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. We'll move on to the next question, please? Operator : It's from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Alexander Man - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Alex Man on for Tim. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two here, please. First, a high level question. So you guys have threaded the I-O needle very well throughout 2017, yet your stock hasn't done too much. One of the reasons for this is that investors are nervous that I-O is the only growth driver and sometimes surprises can happen. When you think forward over the next two years to three years, what else outside of I-O can you point to as a potential source of revenue and earnings growth? And then second, on ECHO-305, one of your two newly-posted Phase III IDO combos in first-line lung, this trial only recruits high expressers. Publicly, we've only seen early clinical data in small sample sets with this combo in lung and not much in first-line patients exclusively. So what drove the rationale to pursue the combo in high expressers only? And is the hypothesis that you really need chemotherapy to unlock IDO combo's potential in all expressers like ECHO-306? Thank you. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Let me start with the first question about our portfolio. So first of all, as a company we believe that a broad and balanced portfolio capitalizes on our strength and best positions the company for long term success. We are committed to making the necessary investments to optimize KEYTRUDA and LYNPARZA, as you've already heard, in addition to our many other early-stage assets in oncology. At the same time, we have a number of clinical programs across our portfolio outside oncology that we believe will be meaningful growth fillers for the company long term. For example, we're moving into Phase III with our cough compound that we acquired from Afferent. We also have a number of programs advancing in our Vaccines business. In addition, we have a lot of work going on in other areas of our early pipeline, including the next generation of HIV assets. So again, we recognize the need to balance delivering in the short term, while making the appropriate investments to drive long term growth. We actively review our portfolio on an ongoing basis to shift resources to those assets that have higher growth potential. So beyond oncology, we believe we have opportunities in areas like cough, in areas like Vaccines as we move forward. And we're going to continue to augment our pipeline in addition to that. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Roger, do you want to answer the other... Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah, so just with respect to the IDO1 combination studies. And there are, as you know, a number of studies that will be posted with respect to IDO1 combinations. We've put a lot of time into evaluating which studies in lung cancer might potentially yield results. You're quite right, and you have seen the data that exists with respect to IDO1 combinations with KEYTRUDA. We are evaluating this information over time. But we don't have a lot of information to tell us exactly how these would behave. The fundamental observation remains that by virtue of IDO1 inhibition that one can improve T lymphocyte responsiveness. And it represents a second axis for improvement in T lymphocyte responsiveness beyond checkpoint blockade. It makes sense to think that you would see that activity best in a circumstance when you know there are a lot of responsive T lymphocytes. And of course we know that occurs in the setting where inflammation is already present, as in the PD-L1 high population. That's just a sort of a high level look at it. We're looking at a bunch of other ways of trying to evaluate IDO1 inhibition in combination with KEYTRUDA. But clearly the existence of inflammation, as we've found over the last many years of study, existence \u2013 preexistence of inflammation is important, because these molecules, IDO1 inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors, reveal the preexisting immunity that for one reason or another is inadequate. And so that the goal is to try and make that immunity visible through tumor reduction. That's what we're trying to get done here. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We'll move on to the next question, please? Operator : It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. First one is maybe a question for Ken. Just another one of your competitors announced that they are exploring strategic options for their Animal Health business. And I know there's been some debate over time in terms of how core Animal Health is to Merck and just how it fits in the overall portfolio. So can we just get your updated thoughts on just Animal Health, that business? How it fits within the broader Merck story? Just as we think about kind of different approaches to those franchises from some of your competitors? My second question was on the KEYNOTE-189 endpoint co-primary. Will we hear from the company on PFS prior to the overall study wrapping up? Or do we really need to wait for both endpoints to hit before we'll get any update from Merck? And then maybe more broadly as part of that discussion, can you just talk about just a little bit more on the confidence that you can show in OS benefit here despite the crossover? I know we had some encouraging data from KEYNOTE-021G. But just as you're adding that to the \u2013 as a primary here, just I guess a little bit more in terms of just your overall confidence on overall survival here. Thank you. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks for the question, Chris. So we are focused on driving long term growth through innovation generally. And we see Animal Health and the innovation that we can create through that portal as a pillar of growth for the company. As we noted this quarter, it surpassed $1 billion for the first time inside our portfolio, which is meaningful. And we continue to see it going forward as a key growth driver, because it has healthy margins and as well as a strong market outlook. So from our perspective we see it fitting very nicely and augmenting our growth as an overall company. And we intend, where we find opportunities, to further augment that business with additional business development. So it's an important part of our business, Chris. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Chris, regarding KEYNOTE-189, the key issue, as you know, is that when you look at the curves for PFS as opposed to OS, the PFS curves separate essentially at the first time of analysis. So at three months, those curves are already quite different for the combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy as opposed to chemotherapy alone. For OS, the curves are separating at 12 months. But in the KEYNOTE-021G study, perhaps in part because of the small size of that study with only 16 patients per group, you're really not seeing meaningful separation of those curves until you get out closer to 18 months and beyond based on what we have right now. Now with the improved power of the KEYNOTE-189 study, we may be able to see that earlier. But the idea would be, to the extent possible we would like to preserve the overall survival results. And that is \u2013 overall survival is of course the gold standard. It's what we're all trying to achieve. And we see KEYNOTE-189 as really very important in terms of how physicians will manage lung cancer patients for a long time to come. To the extent that we announce the PFS data when these data become positive, then of course we're going to be driving people who believe that they are not receiving KEYTRUDA, we're going to be driving them out of the study. And we've got to be very careful about that. So while there will be opportunities for interim analyses in the study, we're going to be careful to preserve the integrity of the study. You can be confident that as soon as we have results that we think are meaningful, you'll be the second to know. We're definitely going to announce these results. It will be very important. But we want to preserve the integrity of the study in the interest of patient care. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. So I wanted to follow up with questions on KEYNOTE-189 and the IDO Phase III trial. So with respect to KEYNOTE-189, Roger, the enrollment completed in February of 2017 according to clinicaltrials.gov. Just wondering why the primary completion would be two years later in February of 2019 for OS? And related to that, maybe that the event rate is low because the KEYTRUDA combo is keeping patients alive much longer. But based upon the event numbers that you have in hand, should we assume that the first interim timing is the first half of next year? Or is there any other color you can provide on the first interim look timing? And then separately with respect to the IDO Phase IIIs that have been posted, could you please provide a framework for them? And the expected timing of readouts? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right, David. On KEYNOTE-189, yeah. The study completed a little bit later. I mean it completed enrollment a little bit later, I think in March. But the event rate \u2013 based on our prior experience and what we're seeing now, the event rate is low. And so we simply calculate, well, based on the power of the study and what we expect the hazard ratio to be, we simply calculate how long \u2013 how many events we will have, at which times, and how many events we need to see. And that's how we come up with the date. On the other hand, we're going to be following that event rate very closely. And so it can't have stabilized at this point. And so we do expect that there will be opportunities for interim analyses and that we'll have a chance to see them. I can't give you any clarity about exactly when that will take place. And again, with IDO1, I think the issue is that across a range of different tumor types, we saw evidence that the combination of IDO1 with KEYTRUDA appeared to provide benefit in terms of response rate. That's what drove the Phase III study design. We announced that there will be a half dozen such studies. And we were just beginning to post those studies. The information that's on clinicaltrials.gov gives you a feel for what we're trying to get done there. But I hasten to add we do not know for sure that the combination of IDO1 plus KEYTRUDA in a larger study, where you have randomization and control, that you're actually going to see that improvement in response rate, or that improvement in response rate will translate into durable responses that have a meaningful impact on progression and overall survival. So those are the things that we're going to be looking at, because clearly we're trying to improve treatment for cancer patients. It's that simple. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : From Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen and Co. LLC: Well, thank you very much. Merck's KEYNOTE-189 and Roche's IMpower-150 had similar primary completions. But IMpower-150 will still read out PFS and OS this year. And then take another look at OS in the first half of next year. Could you perhaps compare and contrast what Merck is doing relative to PFS and OS readouts versus what Roche is doing? Specifically the simultaneous versus step-wide readouts? I'm not sure I understand why Roche can do a step-wide readout, and Merck believes simultaneous is the way to go. And secondly, consensus is looking for 7% EPS growth in 2018. Ken, any preliminary thoughts on the outlook for 2018? There are clearly opportunities for growth but also some risks. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right, Steve. So I can't really comment on IMpower of course and how they've designed their studies and what treatment effect they believe they're seeing. For us, we decided to revise our program in order to put more \u2013 to assign more of the study power to the overall survival endpoint. We have dual primary endpoints. And overall survival is clearly the important thing. KEYNOTE-021G gives us a lot of confidence we had anyway in terms of the improvement of PFS. The issue really is the OS data. That's the thing that's proved to be most important. And really to us, very impressive that overall survival is continuing to separate as we look further on in the KEYNOTE-021G study, despite the fact that the study is really comparing early versus late KEYTRUDA therapy. Remember, everybody gets chemotherapy and then they get KEYTRUDA. The crossover numbers are such that anybody who fails on chemotherapy then gets KEYTRUDA. And what that means is you either got KEYTRUDA at the beginning, or you got it late. And because there's such a dramatic decline in PFS, with a median PFS of less than nine months in the chemotherapy arm, everybody gets KEYTRUDA pretty quickly. So that business of KEYTRUDA versus early versus late becomes very important. And that's the thing we really want to make sure that we understand and that we obtain very solid data on in the KEYNOTE-189 study. Because ultimately that's practice changing. That's crucially important. That's crucially important for the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. So that's what we've done in that study. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Yeah. Thanks, Roger. Good morning, Steve. And to your second question about EPS growth in 2018, as you know, we don't provide specific guidance for 2018 until we get to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call, which will be in February. But maybe I can provide to your point some of the headwinds and tailwinds that give a sense of what we're seeing. I would just start by reiterating the point that Ken made, that we do have several pillars of long term growth. Obviously it starts with KEYTRUDA and what we continue to believe is a real opportunity there for continued growth, not only with KEYTRUDA but expanding with the broader oncology portfolio. With our vaccines business, we continue to expect to see good growth, especially GARDASIL. And then obviously Adam touched upon what we've seen this year with BRIDION, which has really done quite well. And we continue to believe has great growth opportunities as we look forward. And then finally I'd just highlight Animal Health. Animal Health grew 14% in the quarter. It's growing double digits year to date. And we continue to see very strong growth in that business. And given the fact that it's now reaching a size, to Ken's point, that it was $1 billion in the quarter, it's meaningful to our overall portfolio. So we think we have a lot of opportunities to drive good growth on the top line next year. But obviously we do have some pressures with ZEPATIER and ZOSTAVAX, to name a few, as well as obviously continuing LOE pressure, particularly from ZETIA/VYTORIN as that tails off as we move into next year. And then the only other point I'd make is that Adam highlighted JANUVIA we see as a very stable product, which is really going to be the foundation from which we'll drive growth with the other pillars I mentioned, even given some of the pricing pressure we face there. And then finally, as you think about investments, clearly we continue to believe we have real opportunity on an R&D front for continued investment. A lot of promise, not only with KEYTRUDA and LYNPARZA but the broader oncology pipeline that we're starting to advance and add to with things like Rigontec that Roger mentioned. And then beyond that, other products that we continue to want to invest in, vaccines and others in the pipeline. So we are going to make meaningful investment in R&D next year. That will make driving an overall leveraged P&L more challenging as we get into next year. But obviously we remain committed to that long term. And we will do everything we can to be disciplined and reallocate resources behind those growth opportunities by making the right trade-offs to drive growth. So hopefully that gives you a sense of some of the pushes and pulls. And then we look forward to February, where we'll give you more specifics. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Good morning, folks. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Roger, first on KEYNOTE-189, I just want to make sure that I heard you correctly. Is everybody in the chemo arm, once they progress, will they all get KEYTRUDA? And the reason I ask that question is in KEYNOTE-021G with 60% to 70% crossover, you're clearly seeing the chemo arm being lifted and doing much better than traditionally expected. So with presumably 100% crossover, again I'm just trying to struggle how you're confident about hitting that OS endpoint, given that we know PD-1s are effective in a second-line setting. And my follow-up for Adam. Since you're basically going to have to promote KEYNOTE-021G for another 1.5 years, what's the feedback you're getting from physicians regarding the latest updates at ESMO? Are they believing your latest 19-month median PFS 70% 18-month OS rate, et cetera? Or are you still getting significant pushback? And could you give us an approximate breakdown of KEYTRUDA sales by indications, please? Thank you very much. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: So, Alex, no, there's no mandatory crossover. And you've hit the exact point, which was in response to a different question from (43:56), which is basically if we are \u2013 if we look at the study and we announce PFS. And the study is very positive in PFS at a time when overall survival is immature, the fact that that study behaves in that way will cause patients who are progressing to drop out. They will gain access, of course, to KEYTRUDA in second line. We've already demonstrated that KEYTRUDA is extremely effective in second-line therapy based on the KEYNOTE-010 data. And so in essence you're going to be looking at crossover. But the key thing we need to understand in this patient population is really what is the overall survival difference as a result of providing the combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy early as opposed to KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy late? And so we want to try and make sure that we can understand that difference, because that's what's important ultimately for physicians and for patients, as they contemplate how best to treat non-small cell lung cancer. This is the opportunity to do that. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And to answer your question regarding the uptake in lung cancer, I mean in the United States and also in Japan, we're seeing a very strong uptake in lung cancer. And if you look at the high expressers above 50, we're seeing significant utilization of KEYTRUDA monotherapy. If you look at expressers between 1 and 50, that's where we're seeing increased use of the combination with ALIMTA. We're hearing that now that it's in our label, physicians are being more comfortable to prescribe the combination therapy. We're hearing that a lot in the community sector where they treat most of the lung cancer patients. And they're used to using chemotherapy, so they feel very comfortable with the combination. In addition, what we're really trying to work on now is in the non-expressers or in the patients that are not PD-L1 tested to reinforce that we have the indication for the combination to be used in those patients, which we think represents an additional significant opportunity. And we're spending a lot of time educating physicians on those patient types. To give you a rough estimate, we think about 55% of our sales are coming from lung cancer in the U.S., about 20% melanoma, 10% head and neck, 5% bladder, and then 10% everything else. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, Adam. We'll go on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Have a vaccine question for you. We noticed you were trying to IPR some Prevnar patents. And was curious how that relates to your pneumococcal vaccine and its status? And when you could take that one into Phase III? And then for Roger, on your pembro/ipi study that was recently posted, have you designed that to answer any questions that will not be answered by [CheckMate] 227 from Bristol, other than the obvious fact that the PD-1 agents are different? Thanks. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right, Gregg. So the first question is with respect to our pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program. We have a very broad program in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We are looking at mechanisms whereby we can expand the set of carbohydrate specificities in order to improve vaccination, improve resistance to invasive pneumococcal disease. We believe that we have freedom to operate in this area. We've always believed that. And we are moving forward with the first of these opportunities, V-114, which will be advancing into Phase III very shortly. With respect to the combination of ipilimumab with KEYTRUDA, the study is designed to look to see whether those two agents when combined together really offer meaningful advantage as opposed to KEYTRUDA alone. I think that comparison, the randomized comparison of the combination of those two agents versus KEYTRUDA alone is a critical one, because of course you do add very substantial toxicity when you add ipilimumab to the therapeutic regimen. And of course we've already demonstrated the impressive results that one gets in combination with chemotherapy. So that's the comparison that ultimately needs to be made. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just shifting a little bit to the diabetes side. And you mentioned you feel that portfolio is stable. We obviously have JANUVIA LOE coming in a few years. You have (48:42) in the glargine biosimilar. But just curious given what JANUVIA is going to face a few years from now and also the decision on anacetrapib, is that maybe an area that you've looked to sort of boost through business development to kind of have multiple portfolio down the road? Or maybe just more broadly beyond oncology, what areas are you focused on in terms of business development? And then one question, a follow-up just on the oncology side with the MSI-high indication. Just curious how that's going from a commercial perspective in terms of obviously there's no MSI-high doctors out there. So how you're approaching that from a commercial perspective? And what sort of traction you're getting in people using that biomarker? Thanks. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks, Vamil, for the question. As it relates to our business development strategy, what we're looking for is the opportunity to find the best scientific innovations that will enhance our overall pipeline and help our patients live healthier lives. Diabetes is a very important category for us. And therefore we will continue to look for opportunities to provide a benefit to diabetic patients. But I think overall, I think the key here is we are agnostic, pretty much, to the therapeutic category. We like the work that we're doing in oncology. But we'll look beyond oncology to find other partnerships and collaborations and acquisitions that actually provide differentiated drug, regardless of therapeutic area. So I think we have a strong series of opportunities to grow our pillars our Vaccines and oncology and Animal Health. Diabetes remains important to us. And we'll look for those opportunities in diabetes and elsewhere. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And with regard to MSI-high, obviously having a multitude of indications is very helpful. And it helped establish KEYTRUDA as a new standard of care in oncology. What we're doing right now is working to increase awareness of MSI-high testing and the value of KEYTRUDA across other tumor types. As you know MSI-high is an established biomarker, but it's primarily used in colorectal cancer or endometrial cancer. Right now if you think about MSI-high, it's available across a wide spectrum of cancers, some that are common like I just mentioned. Others that are uncommon. So it really is a lot of education in the marketplace. So I do believe over time it will be a meaningful opportunity. But in the short term, it's going to take some time for education as the market will evolve. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Roger, on the recent ECHO-202 data in melanoma, can you talk a little bit about the PD-L1 negative cohort? I'm just trying to reconcile what we could see in melanoma in Phase III, versus the lung opportunity. And then on Adam \u2013 for Adam, ahead of the potential KEYNOTE-021G approval in Europe, what's your early read on the risk/benefit perceptions from EU docs, versus what you've seen or heard so far in the U.S.? And do you think that the reimbursement or uptake will be influenced by whether or not you have the KEYNOTE-189 data? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: So, Geoff, on ECHO data, let me just say that we do not have sufficient information at the present time to know whether the combination of IDO1 antagonist and KEYTRUDA actually provides meaningful benefit. We continue to accrue data that is intriguing, that says that there is an improvement in response rate. And as I've said before, that that relates to both breadth and depth of response. We are hopeful that that will translate in Phase III studies into something really very meaningful. But at the moment we don't have those data in hand. We're pursuing that through a very broad Phase III program, as you know. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And with regard to lung, we continue to see good progress. And in the EU, we've worked really hard to increase the number of patients being tested for PD-L1 status. And as you look across the various countries, we're seeing the pickup very significantly. So in Germany, it's over 60% already. In the UK, it's greater than 90%. Our focus right now is really continuing to work through the reimbursement process for first-line and second-line lung. And each and every month, we have new countries that are coming on. And we're getting more and more reimbursement. We'll have to wait ultimately to see more about KEYNOTE-021G before we can comment. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Go on to the next question, please? Operator : It's from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. So I have a three \u2013 I have one question but with three parts. And I want to focus specifically on the new first-line lung trial of KEYTRUDA plus epacadostat, ECHO-306. And here's what I find interesting. The comparator arm in this ECHO-306 is KEYTRUDA plus chemo. So that's the highest bar we've ever seen in first-line lung to-date. So here's my three-part question. One, can you confirm you were actively involved in the trial design? Two, I'm just curious how you're thinking about pitting pembro plus IDO versus this KEYTRUDA plus chemo comp? And then finally, the fact that you have this KEYTRUDA plus chemo comp in this trial, is this a further validation of your confidence in this combo, especially as we head into KEYNOTE-189? Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: So, Umer, first of all, the \u2013 we are actively involved with our colleagues at [BioPharm] Insight in designing all of these studies. These are not things that are being pursued independently by them. Secondly, the study design \u2013 and we've gone through many, many iterations on study design \u2013 we chose this particular study design because we are eager to see the contribution both in terms of efficacy as well as safety. Epacadostat in combination with KEYTRUDA compared to what we now regard as a standard in the non-small cell lung cancer setting. It is a high bar as you say, because the results of that, as demonstrated by KEYNOTE-021G and some other information we previously reported, are very impressive. And as I've said I think repeatedly on this call, I just want to make plain, we're doing these Phase III studies because we do not have randomized data that tell us that the combination of KEYTUDA plus epacadostat provides meaningful benefit. We have single-arm data that are very intriguing, because they imply that we have improved response rates, both breadth and depth. And that may translate into improvements in PFS and overall survival versus monotherapy, or in this case the combination. But it is \u2013 we do not have that information. That's the reason we're doing these studies. And we're optimistic that we will see the benefit that we believe we've seen in single-arm studies. But we just don't know. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: All right. We'll take another question. We're running out of time. We're going to try to get through one more at least, and if we can, one other. Operator : And your next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Ken, a question for you. Just reading the company's press release, you do mention very early on in your prepared remarks that BD is expected to be an important growth driver, or you're looking to BD as an important growth driver. We hadn't seen that in previous press releases before. I'm just wondering if you could talk to that, just the importance of business development as the company sort of moves into the next decade with the JANUVIA patent expiration. What you think is that \u2013 do you think of a large scale acquisition as something that you think will be necessary going forward? And, Rob, you did a really helpful job talking about 2018 without giving guidance. Can you be a little bit more specific on operating expenses? Clearly R&D is going up, but what about SG&A? Should we assume operating expenses can be maintained next year? Or should we assume that they will be up? And just lastly, Roger, for you on KEYNOTE-189, how will you allocate the statistical analysis between PFS and OS? Thanks very much. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Well, good morning, Jami. Let me first of all say that I'd have to go back and look at the other press releases, because we've tried to talk about the importance of business development consistently. And what I would say is that our perspective on business development is unchanged. And that is that it is an important priority for the company. We're very actively engaged and looking for the best scientific innovations to enhance our long term growth in our pipeline. As it relates to large transactions, what we've said is that we're primarily looking for those things that enhance the company's ability to innovate. We're not looking at things purely for synergies or consolidation purposes. And so I would think that our view continues to be that we're going to look for those things, particularly bolt-ons, that will help us as we go further with our innervation strategy. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Rob, do you want to take the next? Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Good morning, Jami. Thanks for the question. So to be maybe a little more specific than I was a minute ago. Obviously as we have constantly stated, our goal is to drive operating leverage long term. So that continues to be where our focus is, through looking at opportunities to make trade-offs and reallocation of resources to drive productivity. With that being said, we do anticipate operating expenses to increase as we move into next year, primarily driven by R&D with the opportunities we talked about around KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA, and the broader portfolio. So that is something we expect. And overall expenses will rise, even though we will do our best to manage on the SG&A line, to make the appropriate trade-offs, and drive those investments in R&D, as well as though to make sure we're continuing to invest appropriately behind some of the key launches. So hopefully that gives a little more clarity than what I said earlier. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Jami, with respect to KEYNOTE-189, as you know, we don't provide details of statistical analysis plans and health allocation. So I'm not going to go through that with you. But suffice it to say that we believe the overall survival part of the study is extremely important. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: So let me just close the call by saying thank you again for joining us. We are executing well. And we expect topline strength from this year, particularly for KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL, and Animal Health to continue into 2018 and beyond. We're also focusing on delivering a sustainable pipeline to drive our long term growth. And as a result, we'll continue to invest in R&D. And I'd also like to just take a moment to acknowledge all those who were impacted by the storms in Puerto Rico and Mexico over the past couple of months. I'd just say the courage and resilience that's been demonstrated is notable. And I want to thank particularly our many dedicated employees who've helped us through that period. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Todd James, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Acceleron. Please go ahead. Todd James : Thanks, Chelsea. And welcome, everyone, to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, are available on Investors & Media page of the corporate website at www.acceleronpharma.com. Joining me for the call today are Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer; Matthew Sherman, our Chief Medical Officer; Kevin McLaughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; John Quisel, our Head of Corporate Development; and Chris Rovaldi, our Head of Operations and Program Management. Our goal this afternoon is to provide an overview of our recent operational progress, review updated financial results for the full-year 2017 and outline our upcoming priorities. After that, we look forward to answering your questions. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans and research activities. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent Form 10-K on file with the SEC. I'd now like to turn the call over to Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer. Habib Dable : Thank you, Todd. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2017 was an important year for Acceleron and I'm extremely proud of the progress we made across our entire pipeline and business. We spent a lot of time during the first half of the year thinking about and planning for our future. We leveraged our R&D day in September to outline our corporate strategy and vision to build therapeutic area leadership within three disease areas \u2013 hematology, neuromuscular and pulmonary. And to quickly recap a few 2017 events, one, we completed full enrollment of the MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase III trials of luspatercept in myelodysplastic syndromes and beta-thalassemia with our partner Celgene. Two, we continue to advance our lead neuromuscular candidate, ACE-083, which is currently in Phase II trials in two neuromuscular diseases. Three, we retained the rights to sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH from Celgene, allowing us to begin a new Phase II program in the first half of 2018.  And finally, we maintain a strong balance sheet. With the completion of a follow-on offering in the fall, successfully raising $215.8 million in net proceeds, extending our cash runway into 2021. With these important events and our strategic focus clearly defined last year, looking forward to 2018 and beyond, we are focused on clinical and operational execution to drive the strategy and vision for long-term growth and value creation. I'd now like to review the most recent highlights for each therapeutic area, beginning with hematology and our lead product candidate luspatercept. With full enrollment completed and treatment ongoing in both Phase III trials, we are on track to report topline results from the MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials with our partner Celgene in mid-2018. As you know, luspatercept is an erythroid maturation agent designed to inhibit multiple TGF-beta proteins that regulate late-stage red blood cell differentiation and maturation.  Based on our Phase II results that I will discuss in a few minutes, we believe it could be an important medicine for thousands of patients who are dependent on frequent red blood cell transfusions due to chronic anemia across multiple rare blood disorders. In anticipation of luspatercept's potential commercial launch in late 2019, we recently hired a chief commercial officer, Sujay Kango, who joins us from AbbVie. We are thrilled to have Sujay join our team as we accelerate the work we've been doing to prepare for the regulatory filings and commercial readiness of our lead product candidate luspatercept and his experience across multiple companies and product launches positions us to fully support the luspatercept franchise alongside our partner Celgene. We're also preparing for a new Phase III trial with luspatercept called the COMMANDS trial in first-line lower risk ESA-na\u00efve MDS. And we expect this trial to initiate in the first half of 2018. We continue to build upon the depth of the luspatercept opportunity with several new Phase II luspatercept trials ongoing. The BEYOND trial is planned to enroll 150 non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia patients and the Phase II trial in myelofibrosis is planned to enroll 70 monotherapy and combination therapy patients. Regular updates from our ongoing Phase II base and long-term extension trials drive our confidence in luspatercept's clinical benefit to patients. We presented at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, in December, making the fourth straight annual ASH update where we reported updated preliminary results of the ongoing Phase II trials in patients with lower risk MDS. The results presented demonstrated luspatercept achieving clinically-meaningful erythroid response in over 50% of patients and red blood cell transfusion independence in over 40% of the patients. As a reminder, these results are looking at all MDS patients treated at therapeutic dose levels with luspatercept. We have also presented specific subpopulation response rates based on baseline EPO levels, ESA treatment experience and RS status. Duration of response was also significant as luspatercept continues to provide long-term benefit to multiple patients, now nearing three years on treatment. With these data, we have now collected more than 1,200 patient months or 100 patient years of Phase II experience in lower-risk MDS. These results further support luspatercept's potential to be a transformative treatment option for patients with lower-risk MDS. Also at ASH, the investigator at M.D. Anderson provided an update on the Phase II trial in myelofibrosis with sotatercept. Over 30% of both monotherapy and combination therapy patients have achieved an anemia response. The results inform the decision to initiate a company-sponsored Phase II trial with luspatercept that I mentioned on the previous slide. Turning out to our neuromuscular franchise, we continue to advance ACE-083, our locally-acting muscle agent where we recently reported initial data from the dose escalation cohorts one and two of part one of the Phase II trial in patients with FSHD. The preliminary results demonstrated safety and tolerability of ACE-083 treatment and achieved total mean muscle volume increases of over 12% in the tibialis anterior and biceps brachii muscle cohorts. Both cohorts also demonstrated reductions in fat fraction.  As a reminder, the key objective of part one is to evaluate safety and changes in muscle volume and to identify a dose level to take forward into part two. For part two, the key objectives are changes in muscle volume as well as muscle strength and function. We're encouraged by the data reported to date and are on track to initiate part two of the trial in the second quarter of 2018.  We also continue to advance ACE-083 in our Phase II trial in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or CMT and plan to report preliminary results from part one of the Phase II trial in the second half of 2018 and to initiate part two of the Phase II CMT trial by the end of 2018. For our systemic neuromuscular agent, we recently initiated a Phase I healthy volunteer trial with ACE-2494. The trial will enroll three single and three multiple ascending dose cohorts to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics. We expect to enroll a total of 60 healthy volunteers for this trial. Additionally, with our focus in pulmonary, our collaborator, Paul Yu from the Brigham and Women's Hospital highlighted positive preclinical results with sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension at the American Heart Association scientific sessions in November. Data showed remarkable biological activity on the pulmonary vasculature across two well-established animal models of PAH, further supporting our mechanistic approach for sotatercept and its potential to be a first-in-class disease modifying therapy for patients with PAH. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we plan to initiate a Phase II trial with sotatercept in PAH during the first half of 2018 and we plan to host an educational webinar beforehand to discuss trial design. So, please be on the lookout for a save-the-date coming out soon. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin McLaughlin, our Chief Financial Officer, to run through our financials for the quarter. Kevin McLaughlin : Thanks, Habib. Good afternoon, everyone. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2017 were $372.9 million compared to $234.4 million as of December 31, 2016. This includes the net proceeds from our successful follow-on offering in 2017. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into 2021. Collaboration revenue for the year was $13.5 million. The revenue is entirely from our Celgene partnership and is primarily due to cost-sharing revenue of $12.9 million related to expenses incurred by the company in support of our partnered programs. Total costs and expenses for the year were $123.5 million. This includes R&D expenses of $89.7 million and G&A expenses of $33.7 million. The company posted a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $108.5 million. I will now turn the presentation back over to Habib for final remarks. Habib Dable : Thanks, Kevin. As you have heard, we have a busy and productive year ahead of us. I will briefly touch on our priorities for the remainder of the year and beyond. In hematology, we expect to provide topline results from our MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase III trials by midyear and plan to initiate the COMMANDS Phase III trial in the first half of 2018. In neuromuscular, we plan to present ACE-083 part one results from all dose cohorts in FSHD and CMT in the second half of 2018 and plan to begin FSHD part two in the second quarter of 2018 and CMT part two by year-end. For ACE-2494, we plan to present Phase I results during the first half of 2019. And finally, in pulmonary, we're looking forward to initiating a Phase II trial in PAH with sotatercept in the first half of 2018 and we look forward to discussing the trial design during the first half of 2018. In closing, we remain committed to moving our clinical programs into late stage development and our goal is to have three programs in Phase III within three years or by year-end 2020. Our long-term vision begins with luspatercept in hematology as our number one priority. We remain confident in our ability to leverage this multibillion-dollar opportunity with luspatercept, which in turn will drive our ability to build therapeutic area leadership in neuromuscular and pulmonary disease. I will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. There's been a lot of activity in the MS space since the start of the year, the recent business development activity. Has that in anyway changed how you guys are looking at the commercial opportunity here or potential development plans? Do you still intend to share data on the Phase II MDS study at EHA and ASH as in years past given the Phase III readout coming up? Thank you. Habib Dable : Hey, Carter. This is Habib. Thanks for your question. So, with respect to the activity in myelofibrosis, you're right. And more specifically, the recent acquisition of Impact by Celgene in that particular space speaks volume in terms of their commitment to the space. But it also is very encouraging for us because, as you know, we are studying myelofibrosis with luspatercept. And, specifically, we're looking at the patients in myelofibrosis who are suffering from moderate to severe anemia. And in many cases, patients are not only suffering from disease-induced anemia, but in many cases they are also suffering from drug-induced anemia. And these JAK inhibitors \u2013 as you know, for those patients with an enlarged spleen, they're on a JAK inhibitor, are also having the opportunity \u2013 or finding themselves needing something to deal with that anemia. And given the fact that there is a lack of pharmacology solutions in the space, we really are looking forward to studying luspatercept and having hopefully an available agent to treat patients with this unmet need.  And, quite frankly, Celgene's recent move in that space is comforting on a number of fronts. One, as one of their partners, it's very encouraging to see them so committed to the space, given the work with luspatercept. But it also gives an opportunity for more patients to have a potential alternative to rociletinib. which will in turn open the opportunity for more patients available for potentially on luspatercept. With respect to data, I'll pass it over to Todd to give you an idea of what we can potentially expect at EHA. Todd James : Hey, Carter. So, just to first talk about the MF development plan, it continues to remain the same. We initiated the Phase II trial with Celgene about midyear last year, and so that trial continues to progress. And based off of clinicaltrials.gov, you could expect to see data mid-to-late 2019 in myelofibrosis. As far as our upcoming plans at the medical congresses, we've been presenting this Phase II data quite frequently, every six-month updates. And so, we will continue to submit abstracts for the upcoming congresses as far as whether the Phase IIs will continue to be accepted or not. Hard for us to say. And so, we'll be able to provide color when the abstracts go live. But we would anticipate that the Phase IIs would at least be presented one time this year, whether it be at EHA or at ASH. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Your line is open. Bradley Canino : Hey, this is Brad coming on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our questions. Had a couple of clinical ones on my end. First for luspatercept, in the COMMAND study, based on your knowledge right now of the front-line population, what proportion of patients do you think are likely to be RS-positive versus RS-negative. Todd James : Sure. Hey, Brad. It's Todd. So, as you know, we've been talking a lot about the prevent population given the MEDALIST indication is in the second line, ESA refractory patient population. And so, we most recently have been talking about the incidence population.  And in the prevalent pool, we believe there's about two-thirds to 70% RS-positive due to their slower progression in disease. These patients live more, five to eight years, versus the RS-negative patients are on the lower of the five-year median. So, they'll progress more like three to five. And so, due to that difference in the progression time for the patients, the incidence pool was actually more weighted towards the RS-negative patient population. So, within the incidence or first-line setting, we believe that the RS-negative is probably more like two-thirds in that setting. And then, you see that conversion due to the progression rate when you think about the refractory or prevalent pool. Bradley Canino : Okay, thank you. And then, moving on to muscle for ACE-083, have you yet disclosed the dose you're taking forward into part two for FSHD and can you tell us how many injections that dose would be required to give? Matthew Sherman : Hi. This is Matt, Brad. So, as we updated the folks at J.P. Morgan in terms of the data from part one of the FSHD study, showing increases in muscle volume in the muscles that were treated, the biceps and the tibialis anterior muscle, and decreases in fat fraction, also a very important measure of muscle quality and function. We have not yet disclosed the dose levels that we'll be taking forward into part two of trial. We have indicated that will be initiated in part two in the second quarter of this year. So, stay tuned and we'll be able to give you further information about that. Bradley Canino : And then, I just wanted to clarify a timeline. You had previously stated \u2013 Matthew Sherman : I'm sorry. You did ask about injections. We do administer the drugs and for injections. So, we take the total dose and divided into four injections across the length of the muscle. This is what we piloted in the Phase I healthy volunteer trial where we also showed very significant increases in muscle volume at that time both in the rectus femoris muscle as well as in the TA muscle. Bradley Canino : Okay, that's clear. Thank you. And then, you previously committed to a full dose escalation data release for the CMT trial by year-end 2018. Are you changing your guidance with stating preliminary part one results now in your press release or will that still be preliminary, but from all cohorts? Todd James : Hey, Brad. It's Todd. So, yeah, in the second half, we will be able \u2013 it will still be preliminary results from part one of the dose cohorts because we have some follow-up period, about \u2013 past three weeks after the last dose. And so, until we get through that further follow-up, we won't be able to say final. But for both FSHD and CMT, we'll be through three weeks after the last dose of all cohorts in the second half of the year and we'll be able to provide that update. So, really, no change in guidance still before year-end, but we've been a little bit more specific with the second half. Bradley Canino : Okay, got it. And then, on 2494, the systemic therapy, what muscle will you be measuring and how will this differ from what you've looked at in healthy volunteers for 083? And, I guess, could you compare your expectations for the size of increase between the two molecules? Matthew Sherman : Hi, Brad. So, again, Matt here. So, ACE-2494 is a systemically administered Myostatin+ agent. So, as we did [indiscernible] trial, we'll be looking at muscle increases by MRI scan and we generally have focused on MRI scans in the lower extremity for changes in those patients. I'm sorry, the second part of your question? Bradley Canino : I guess, wanted to know more on your expectations of muscle size increase from a systemic agent versus what you saw in healthy volunteers for your local acting agent. Matthew Sherman : So, again, based on the mechanism, we expect to see substantial increases in muscle volume. We haven't really given information in terms of the head to head comparison of the systemically administered agent versus a locally acting agent, but they do target the same range of ligands. So, we expect to see significant increases in muscle volume. Habib Dable : But as far as our expectations for success, Brad, similar to how we're guiding with ACE-083, we really feel like 5% for either a systemic or a locally acting agent is what you need to hopefully then \u2013 subsequently be able to see strength and function increase in patients. So, that's something we're hoping to see both initially in Phase I in healthy volunteers and then, hopefully, subsequently in diseased patients when we go into Phase II. And to just give a little bit more color on the MRI in Phase I, everyone \u2013 the myostatin selective agents that have also looked at Phase I in our earlier trial with ACE-31 in healthy volunteers, everyone really images the thigh muscle to look at the change relative to baseline in patients. Matthew Sherman : And in terms of timing, we initiated that trial and, as we've indicated, we will have data from the trial in the first half of 2019. Operator : Okay, that's all from me. Thank you. Habib Dable : Thanks, Brad. Todd James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is open. Greg Harrison : Hi. This is Greg Harrison on for Robyn. Thanks for taking the question. Another one on 2494. Since the mechanism of action is different from typical anti-myostatin, how does that help you guys decide which indications you would want to target with it? Matthew Sherman : Thanks, Greg. We went over this in some detail at the R&D presentation back in September. And there, we were really talking about the novel mechanism for ACE-2494.  And the indication that we went into some detail, although we've not selected an indication yet for Phase II development, include FSHD, DMD, ALS and spinal muscular atrophy. So, in that range, we showed a fair amount of preclinical data showing very meaningful increases in muscle in several of those preclinical indications. So, that would be \u2013 updates, we would be able to provide to you as we move along with the program. Greg Harrison : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Joseph with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Eric Joseph : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one for me related to the COMMANDS trial. I know we will get some additional color on that on the trial design as it gets underway in the coming months. But I just want to get a sense of what docs would view as sort of meaningful differentiation from ESAs, considering [indiscernible] that you're going up against here. Is superiority on erythroid response a reasonable expectation based on the prior Phase II and historical data that we've seen to date or would the focus more be on sort of longer-term measures, sustained erythroid response or duration of therapy, transfusion avoidance, that sort of thing? Thanks. Habib Dable : Hey, Eric. This is Habib. Thanks for your question. So, with respect to what doctors have seen so far, I'd probably guide you to the two company-sponsored trials that were presented at ASH 2016. And there you can see where the unmet need that was really amplified, if you want. When you took a look at some of the data with respect to a specific response, HI-E or hematologic improvement erythroid, where in those two trials where you had subsets of less than 100 and less than 200 endogenous EPO levels, you had HI-E response rates of 15% to 30%. And in those cases, that compares to the HI-E rates within our Phase II trials where we were looking at HI-E response rates above 50%.  And with respect to the quality of the response, that also becomes extremely important. So, you touched on a very important point here because when you think of quality, one of the ways to look at quality of response is the duration. And as you know, one of the biggest benefits of continuing to follow-up patients in our Phase II studies, not only do we continue to gain encouragement from the overall response rates as well as the safety and tolerability profiles of patients of luspatercept, we're also gaining very beneficial information on the quality of response. And to take you back to the April data [indiscernible] when we presented at EHA last year, the duration of therapy for patients who were TI responders was 14.7 months. We updated that again at ASH of 2017. And there, we were able to update that with the September data cut where that response rate moved to 19 months. So, again, when you think of the quality of the responders, it's going to be really important for us to continue to follow these patients. And again, as a reminder, the patients that very much informed us within the Phase II study or the MEDALIST study were seeing response rates in terms of transfusion independence of 39%. So, when you think of all of those markers, we go into the COMMANDS study with a certain degree of confidence that going head-to-head against ESAs in a superior design fashion is absolutely the right thing to do based on a number of data points, not only from our study, but also from company-sponsored studies from Amgen and J&J. Eric Joseph : Got it. And maybe just kind of following up with reference to those Amgen and J&J studies, how useful are those as sort of guides in terms of the size and scope of trials and what we might see in terms of baseline patient characteristics, baseline EPO levels that you're targeting in COMMANDS? Thanks. Matthew Sherman : Yeah. Hi, Eric. This is Matt. Just to go into those two studies, so they were actually two of the only randomized studies that were done with ESAs. There were a lot of open-label studies that were done that, I think, falsely \u2013 so, they elevated expectations in terms of ESA response rates.  So, these two randomized double-blind studies, they were well controlled studies. The Amgen study was 146 patients. The J&J Jameson [ph] study was 145 patients. So, again, fairly robust data sets. Again, showed the 15% response rate in the Amgen study, only 31% in the Jameson study. And the responding population for the IWG HI-E response population was only in patients with ESA levels less than 100 in the Amgen study and less than 200 in the J&J study. So, a population that, in fact, is the prevalent population for lower risk, first-line MDS patients and one that we feel that we'll be able to compete and show superiority with \u2013as Habib reported the data that we've had shows a high degree \u2013 excess of 50% of responses in the similar patient population. Todd James : Eric, it's Todd. As far as expectations for what you can think about as far as the size of the trial, given that we're going to go head-to-head and want to show some superiority, be more in line with our MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials versus these Phase III trials from J&J and Amgen and then as far as how you should be thinking about baseline EPO levels and potential endpoints, that's something that we'll get into closer to the initiation of the trial in just a few months here. Eric Joseph : Got it, got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Todd James : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Marai with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Christopher Marai : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on all the progress. I was wondering if you can further comment perhaps on some of the data that we might see second half on 083 with respect to FSHD, what should we be really looking for here in terms of functional outcome measures that you might be able to re-examine in, what I would assume, would be a registrational trial that would kickoff maybe later this year, early 2019, maybe remind us of your plans there. Thank you. Todd James : Hey, Chris. It's Todd. Thanks for the question. So, just want to be clear on \u2013 we're in a Phase II. That's a part one and part two and we don't believe that either parts are registrational, that we believe that we'll need to then take the part two data and then move into registrational Phase III after we get health authority feedback. And as far as what you could expect from the \u2013 we updated part one dose cohorts one and two earlier in the year. And then, we'll be able to provide cohort three in the second half of the year. As far as strength and function expectations, the ends continue to be small, six patients per patient group and there's no placebo. So, as far as expectations for strength and function, I'd really point you to part two of the trial, which will kick off in the second quarter of this year and then you could expect results from part two in the latter half of 2019. And that will be a larger randomized, placebo-controlled trial where we'll be able to get a really nice read on strength and function endpoints. Christopher Marai : Right. And so, when should we expect an update on the kind of design that you're looking to execute on there? Thank you. Todd James : Sure. So, we gave a preliminary look at the design when we kicked off the study in late 2016 and we've since updated that trial design which you can look out for an update on clinicaltrials.gov shortly. And so, we were initially going to looking at 40 patients, randomized, placebo-controlled, three to two across the two cohorts. We've updated that, extending \u2013 expanding the size of the patients up to 56, 28 in each dose cohort randomized one-to-one. We'll be looking at six months of treatment on ACE-083 and we'll be focused on things like six-minute walk test, 10-meter walk run and other functional endpoints for walking. And on the upper limb, we will be looking at the performance upper limb score in patients and also there's an FSHD health inventory PRO that we're also interested in that \u2013 the six-month time point of treatment. Christopher Marai : Okay. And then, just lastly, with respect to the FSHD patient population, is there potentially any group of patients you could target that would be, I suppose, similarly affected by some functional outcome that you might be able to move on an endpoint with respect to basically intramuscular injection. That is a modification of one or a series of specific muscle groups. Would you be able to resolve, in the clinical outcome, benefits that could form a registrational worthy endpoint? Thank you. Todd James : So, sorry, Chris, just want to understand your question. You're asking if we could potentially, outside of the tibialis anterior or bicep, look at a different affected muscle in the patient to try to move quicker? Christopher Marai : Yes. So, with respect to even those two muscle groups, whether you could identify a sub-patient population with FSHD that would be most meaningfully impacted by lack of function in those particular muscle groups to design a registration trial? Matthew Sherman : Hi, Chris. It's Matt. I think the study as it's designed right now, it's designed in the subpopulation of the FSHD patients who have mild to moderate weakness. We're not taking patients who have normal muscle function nor are we enrolling patients who have severe muscle weakness. But it's folks that have mild to moderate muscle weakness that are eligible for the study. So, it's in this a population. And then, of course, whether or not they have a weakness in the upper extremity in the biceps or in their walking and foot drop function in the tibialis anterior muscle puts them into one of the two subsets or cohorts of those patients. So, this, right now, we feel is the fastest way to Phase III. As we indicated, we will be kicking off the [indiscernible] part two of the study in the second quarter of this year. And as Todd just indicated, that data from the part two of the study in the latter half of 2019. Christopher Marai : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Paul Choi with Barclays. Your line is open. Paul Choi : Hi. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking our questions. If I could maybe go back to 083 for a moment here. And I'm just thinking about the competitive landscape with regard to a myostatin-positive approach versus some of the competing active NA [ph] approaches. Can you maybe \u2013 just in your mind, think about how the market might evolve recognizing that the studies are still all at early stage. And your thinking about, is there any more evidence supporting 083 versus some of the competing assets here in your mind. Todd James : Hey, Paul. It's Todd. Thanks for your question. Yeah. So, I think there's an important point to make here is that ACE-083 is a locally acting agent. And all of the myostatin selective or even Regeneron's most recent combination of myostatin selective plus active NA [ph] selective antibodies is these are very different molecules for very different disease. And so, ACE-083 sweet spot is really in patients that have local muscle weakness, so diseases like FSHD, CMT and other diseases where there's local muscle weakness and the systemic approaches from these other molecules and even with our ACE-2494 is for patients that are afflicted with systemic muscle weakness. And so, we wouldn't view ACE-083 as being competitive with any systemic agent. But in our portfolio, makes a lot of sense with our franchise to have both a locally acting and systemic agent. And there might even be a synergistic approach with the two compounds in certain diseases. Habib Dable : Yeah. Paul, this is Habib. Just to add to the comments from Todd, of course, we are, obviously, delighted with the fact that we've got the opportunity to be studying both a local and a systemic agent in treating very important neuromuscular diseases. But in terms of the trends that you're seeing right now, I have to admit that we're actually quite confident by the fact that you're seeing more activity now in terms of agents being beyond just GDF-8 or myostatin. But as you know, Paul, we've been positioning ourselves with both ACE-083 and 2494 as Myostatin+ agents and the fact that we do believe, for various reasons, that inhibiting GDF-8 as well as other selected act events [ph] will play a \u2013 potentially a very significant role in treating some of these serious neuromuscular diseases. Paul Choi : Great. And just with regard to the initial \u2013 the Phase I result that might be coming out in the second half of year, is that something you would just do a top line with or would that be something that we would see at a medical meeting? Todd James : Hey, Paul. It's Todd again. So, yes, just to be clear, the Phase I results will be the first half of 2019 and that would be something that we would probably update at a medical congress in the first half of the year. Paul Choi : Okay. Todd James : That will also include a release in conjunction with the conference. Paul Choi : Great. Habib Dable : And then, just one quick one on PAH with regard to the Phase II. With regard to the endpoints and some of the learnings from the initial data that you presented, is there anything that stands out in your mind as being either incrementally more likely with regard to sort of the classic PAH endpoints that you would want investors to focus on or anything else that you think would be probably less significant going forward? Habib Dable : Hey, Paul. It's Habib again. So, I think with respect to the endpoints, we are, obviously, collaborating with a number of our key stakeholders as we think through this. We are, obviously, benefiting from regulatory input. And we do plan to host the webinar with both our internal colleagues as well as some external experts. And during this call, we'll actually shed a lot more light on the trial design, the specific endpoints that we would guide you to be focusing on, where we'll be initiating the studies as well time, duration, number of patients, et cetera. So, more to come. Paul Choi : Great, okay. We will stay tuned. Thanks for the questions. Habib Dable : Yeah. Thank. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Mike King with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Michael King, Jr.: Hey, good, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wonder \u2013 I'm just sort of following up on a couple of other questions that have risen on 2494. And just wonder if some of the recent FDA decisions about guidance on therapies for DMD has caused you to rethink your development timelines and/or strategy for 2494 in DMD and what suitable surrogates you might think about that could satisfy some of the recent agency directives? Matthew Sherman : Hi, Mike. This is Matt. That's actually a great question because, obviously, we are aware of the new FDA guidance that came out, that spoke to some of these diseases, particularly some of the opportunities for companies to move more quickly with their agents in this area. So, we're fully aware of them. We want to be aggressive and move quickly. And I think being on the cutting edge of development with these agents gives us the opportunity to really blaze a new trail and come up with potentially novel endpoints or composites of endpoints. I think right now it's a little too early to be specific about what the specific target endpoints that could be considered and what the timeline might be to [indiscernible] in the specific diseases. Todd James : And, Mike, it's Todd. Just to be clear, we haven't picked a lead indication for ACE-2494. We have discussed DMD as one of four disease areas that we're interested in. So, we continue to evaluate that disease area along with FSHD systemic therapy, SMA and ALS. So, stay tuned over the next 12 to 18 months as the Phase I comes in. In early 2019, we'll be able to discuss more the disease area that we think is the lead indication. Michael King, Jr.: Thanks, guys. Habib Dable : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Habib Dable, Acceleron's CEO, for his closing remarks. Habib Dable : Yeah. So, I just want to thank everybody for their question, for your continued interest in our company. Wish you all a great evening. And look forward to seeing you at upcoming congresses. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Merck's First Quarter 2018 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Darla, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2018 conference call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call maybe considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Teri. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. With our first quarter performance, we're off to a strong start for 2018, including the KEYNOTE-189 results that were presented at the recent American Association for Cancer Research Meeting. These compelling data showed longer survival in nonsquamous first-line lung cancer patients when KEYTRUDA was combined with chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy alone. This should help establish KEYTRUDA as a new standard-of-care in this patient setting. This is a significant advance, especially given that lung cancer kills more patients than any other form of malignant disease. KEYTRUDA offers new hope for these patients and KEYNOTE-189 sets a new bar against which future trials in first-line lung cancer treatment should be measured. Delivering therapeutics and vaccines for unmet medical needs is what Merck is all about and doing it in a way that provides long-term value to shareholders in addition to patients is our top priority. Our solid first quarter performance provides good momentum for the rest of the year and into the long-term. We firmly believe that our prospects for revenue growth through 2021 and then beyond to 2025 are underappreciated. We've always believed in KEYTRUDA, but we think our data from KEYNOTE-189 along with what we anticipate to be a strong program going forward firmly establishes KEYTRUDA as a foundation for cancer treatment and a substantial driver for this company. We also believe we have tremendous near and long-term opportunities with our partnered products, Lynparza and Lenvima, along with the robust early-stage oncology pipeline. We believe our vaccines portfolio, including GARDASIL and complemented by our next-generation pneumococcal asset, V114, can drive significant value. Our early-stage pipeline, including vaccines, HIV, neuroscience and other areas should also be significant contributors. The continued strength we expect from Animal Health further adds to our confidence. Business development remains a top priority and we will continue to look for opportunities to further augment our outlook. We must continue to execute, but I am very optimistic about our near and long-term growth trajectory driven by these key pillars. And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Davis, to go through our results in more detail. Rob? Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued strength in our key pillars and good operational discipline resulting in top and bottom line growth. Our underlying business continues to perform well, setting the company up for a strong start to the year. I will note that our first quarter results included a one-time non-operational benefit of just over $0.03 related to the Apotex litigation settlement originally expected to occur in the second quarter as well as a more favorable-than-expected FX benefit. Total company revenues were $10 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year, driven by both the Human Health and Animal Health businesses. Excluding the impact of exchange, first quarter revenues grew 3%. Our Human Health business grew 4%, excluding exchange. Adam will provide more color on those results in a moment. As we noted in our press release this morning, given the size of our Animal Health business, it became a reportable segment this quarter, resulting additional disclosure requirements, including segment profits. Animal Health sales totaled $1.1 billion in Q1, an increase of 13% compared with the first quarter of 2017, including a 6 percentage point positive impact from foreign currency. Excluding the impact of exchange, livestock sales grew 6%, while companion animal sales grew 9%. Animal Health segment profits were $413 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing a roughly 39% operating margin. Note that these profits exclude certain expenses and other overhead costs not directly incurred by the business. When compared to a year-ago, the quarterly segment profits decreased 1% compared to $417 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by exchange, seasonality and one-time charges. We anticipate for the full year, the Animal Health business will deliver a leveraged P&L, excluding the impact of exchange. As you can see, our Animal Health business is profitable, has strong growth, provides the company with significant diversification from the Human Health business and benefits from synergies with our Human Health R&D capabilities. As such, Animal Health represents an important pillar of growth for Merck in 2018 and beyond. Turning back to the total company P&L, non-GAAP gross margin was 75.7% in the quarter, a decrease of 170 basis points versus the first quarter of 2017, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange as well as amortization of unfavorable manufacturing variances, partly resulting from last year's cyber incident. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.3 billion, increased 1% year-over-year, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. Excluding FX, both M&A and R&D declined in the quarter with the decrease in R&D reflecting the timing of licensing costs, which more than offset the increased clinical development spending and investment in early drug development. Taken together, we earned $1.05 per share on a non-GAAP basis, up 18%, excluding exchange. Turning to the outlook for the year, we are narrowing and raising both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges for 2018. We continue to believe that several of our growth pillars, including oncology, vaccines and Animal Health, will drive both top and bottom line growth for the year. We also expect a more favorable exchange environment. For the full year, we now expect revenues to be between $41.8 billion and $43 billion, including an approximately 2 percentage point impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates. This topline increase flows to the bottom line and we now expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $4.16 and $4.28, including a roughly 1 percentage point positive impact from foreign currency at mid-April rates. All other elements of our non-GAAP guidance provided during the fourth quarter earnings call remain unchanged. In summary, we expect our momentum to continue through 2018. We will remain disciplined in our allocation of resources, while we fully fund our near-term opportunities and invest in our pipeline to drive long-term growth. This approach positions us well to maximize our ability to grow both revenues and earnings and to deliver shareholder value. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights in the performance of Global Human Health for the first quarter of 2018. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. Merck's Global Human Health business achieved solid growth in the first quarter. Sales of $8.9 billion grew 4%, driven by several important franchises which more than offset competitive pressures and loss of exclusivity for select products. Merck sales outside of the U.S. grew 8%, representing now almost 60% of total Global Human Health sales. I'll now highlight a few of our key franchises and I'll start with oncology. Our oncology business continues to expand rapidly, led by KEYTRUDA, which is now a foundational cancer treatment across multiple tumor types. Global sales of KEYTRUDA more than doubled to nearly $1.5 billion versus prior year. In the United States, there are more new patient starts on KEYTRUDA than any other immunotherapy and KEYTRUDA remains the leader in patients with metastatic lung cancer. We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from key opinion leaders and physicians based upon the recently-presented KEYNOTE-189 data. They were very impressed by the overall survival benefit across all PD-L1 subgroups. And given that OS is the gold standard, we expect the use of this chemo combo to substantially increase moving forward. Beyond lung, KEYTRUDA remains the leading immunotherapy in head and neck and bladder cancers and it continues to be used extensively in metastatic melanoma. In addition, we're gaining traction in MSI-high, where testing rates continue to increase across many different tumor types. Outside of the U.S., KEYTRUDA sales nearly tripled from a year ago, as access continues to increase and lung cancer is now representing the majority of sales in major European markets. In summary, KEYTRUDA has become foundational in cancer care and the potential growth for KEYTRUDA in 2018 and beyond remains very strong. We're also very pleased by the performance of Lynparza in both ovarian cancer and more recently in metastatic breast cancer, where the launch is progressing well following the January U.S. approval. Lynparza leads the PARP inhibitor class in both new and total prescriptions. In addition, Lenvima will be an important product for oncology portfolio through our recently announced collaboration with Eisai. We are accelerating the development and the commercialization of Lenvima, which has already established itself in several approved indications, including renal, thyroid and, and more recently, hepatocellular cancers. We are very optimistic about the long-term potential of both Lynparza and Lenvima and we believe they represent important additions to our growing oncology portfolio. Now, moving to our vaccine business, global sales exceeded $1.5 billion in the first quarter, driven by continued strong demand for GARDASIL, which grew 20% despite pressure in the U.S. from the transition to the two-dose regimen. Ex-U.S., sales nearly doubled, driven by a strong launch in China following its approval last year and continued strong demand in other markets. We view GARDASIL in our vaccines portfolio as a key pillar of Merck's future growth. Turning to the diabetes franchise, global diabetes sales grew to $1.4 billion for the quarter. U.S. sales declined as TRx and pricing trends remained consistent with past quarters. Ex-U.S., growth was strong, driven by increased demand in most markets around the world. We continue to view the diabetes franchise as a relatively stable franchise moving forward. Moving to the Hospital/Specialty portfolio where BRIDION stands out as a fast-growing product, driven by strong formulary acceptance and favorable customer experiences. In the U.S., BRIDION is used in a wide range of procedures and has gained significant share of the neuromuscular blockade reversal market since its launch just two years ago. BRIDION continues to grow strongly ex-U.S. as well, where it has launched in 60 countries. In closing, it is a remarkable time at Merck to be launching so many important new oncology products and indications. With our broad portfolio and our global footprint, we were able to overcome several competitive pressures and patent expiries and deliver 4% growth in the quarter. We remain optimistic by what we see in front of us for the rest of this year and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And thanks, Adam. The first quarter was an important one for Merck Research Laboratories with progress on many fronts. Much of the activity this quarter was focused in the oncology therapeutic area where we had the opportunity to present meaningful new data and to advance regulatory review across several important programs. For example, yesterday, we announced that the FDA has granted Priority Review with the PDUFA date of September 23 to our supplementary Biologics Licensing Application seeking full approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in patients whose tumors lack EGF receptor or ALK gene mutations. Data supporting the filing were derived from our KEYNOTE-189 study, in which patients receiving this KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy combination showed a greater than 50% improvement in overall survival as compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. These results were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research or AACR Annual Meeting in early April and published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Roy Herbst, the discussant selected by AACR to comment on the KEYNOTE-189 data, describes our KEYTRUDA chemotherapy regimen as a new standard of care for patients receiving initial therapy for metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. The KEYNOTE-189 data are also under review at the European Medicines Agency and by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency or PMDA in Japan. During the AACR Meeting last month, we were also able to present data from our KEYNOTE-054 study, performed in collaboration with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, which demonstrated that adjuvant therapy with KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of death or tumor recurrence by 43% as compared to placebo in patients undergoing definitive surgery for high-risk stage III melanoma. These results were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine. During the first quarter, we also obtained important new results from our KEYNOTE-042 study, showing improved overall survival in patients with EGFR and ALK mutation negative metastatic or advanced non-small cell lung cancer, receiving first-line treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent as opposed to traditional platinum-based chemotherapy when the tumor cells of these patients showed PD-L1 tumor proportion scores of at least 1%. Because this was a monotherapy study, patients with both nonsquamous and squamous tumor histologies were included in this study, details of which will be presented at the upcoming American Society for Clinical Oncology or ASCO Annual Meeting next month. These data extend those from our KEYNOTE-024 study for which we received regulatory approval from the FDA in 2016, which demonstrated improved overall survival in the smaller cohort of patients whose tumors expressed the PD-L1 biomarker on greater than 50% of cells. The new results therefore offer the promise of extending the benefit of KEYTRUDA monotherapy to the majority of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA has already received approval from the FDA for use in 10 different settings involving 7 different tumor types, melanoma; non-small cell lung cancer; squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; gastric cancer; classical Hodgkin Lymphoma; urothelial cancer; and in solid tumors with evidence of DNA mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability. During the first quarter, the FDA also granted Priority Review with a PDUFA date of June 28 to our supplementary filing for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer following progression on or off chemotherapy. KEYTRUDA is also under review for the third-line treatment of patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and especially aggressive malignancy. The PDUFA date was extended until July 3 to permit analysis of additional data that we have provided. Another filing based on our Phase 3 KEYNOTE-040 trial and supporting the use of KEYTRUDA in the second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck has also been accepted for review by the FDA with a PDUFA date of December 28. In all, there are now more than 750 studies of KEYTRUDA listed on clinicaltrials.gov, including more than 400 combination studies. Not all of these studies will succeed of course. During the first quarter, for example, we announced that a Phase III study exploring the utility of Incyte Corporation's epacadostat, used in combination with KEYTRUDA, failed to meet its primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma as compared with KEYTRUDA therapy alone. However, numerous other combination programs employing other agents appear quite promising. Beyond KEYTRUDA, the first quarter saw important progress in the development of Lynparza, our PARP inhibitor that we are developing with our colleagues at AstraZeneca. Already approved in the United States for use as maintenance therapy for patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who've had a complete or partial response to chemotherapy, the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion for a similar indication, so it will become applicable in all participating European markets following ratification by the European community. Lynparza is also under review by the EMA for use in patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer following treatment with traditional chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting, an indication that was approved in the United States during the first quarter. Progress has also continued in our infectious disease research. During the first quarter, we announced that the combination of imipenem, cilastatin and relebactam, our new beta-lactamase inhibitor, demonstrated a favorable overall response in patients with imipenem-insensitive bacterial infection, which was the primary endpoint of our first Phase III study. The addition of relebactam promises to expand the utility of imipenem, an important broad spectrum antibiotic. These data will form the basis of a new drug application which we intend to submit in the very near future. Separately, we announced the initiation of two Phase III studies of V114, our novel polyvalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Based on favorable serology data from our earlier studies, some of which we presented at the 2018 International Society on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases in Melbourne, we are optimistic that this new vaccine will demonstrate improved immunogenicity along with satisfactory safety and tolerability findings in healthy adult subjects and in adults receiving therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection. As has already been mentioned, the first quarter was also an important one for business development with the announcement of our collaboration with Eisai Corporation on the development of Lenvima, an orally available protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor already approved in the United States as monotherapy for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer that is no longer responsive to radio-iodine and for the second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma in combination with everolimus. Initial studies combining Lenvima and KEYTRUDA treatment defined a dose and schedule for the combination and yielded intriguing results regarding efficacy in multiple tumor types. Indeed a Phase III program for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma testing the Lenvima-KEYTRUDA combination versus Lenvima plus everolimus or monotherapy sunitinib began in October of 2016. So, we've been engaged in studying Lenvima in combination with KEYTRUDA for some time. Lenvima has broad activity as monotherapy and it was recently approved for the first-line treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan, the first new systemic therapy for this disease approved in Japan in more than a decade. During the first quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Viralytics, Incorporated, providing us with a coxsackie A21-derived oncolytic virus called CAVATAK that has been studied as both monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA. Details of these clinical programs involving CAVATAK will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings. Speaking of which, during the first quarter, we submitted more than 100 abstracts for presentation at the ASCO Meeting next month. Included in these presentations are examples of many combination studies, including those involving traditional chemotherapy, targeted agents like Lenvima and exploratory immunological manipulations. Data to be presented at ASCO also include the previously mentioned KEYNOTE-042 monotherapy study in the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, our KEYNOTE-407 study, a KEYTRUDA plus traditional chemotherapy in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, and our KEYNOTE-427 monotherapy study in the first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma. We look forward to sharing these data with the broad international community of oncologists at ASCO in 2018. I'll now turn the call back over to Teri. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Darla, we're ready to move on to our Q&A phase. I would like to remind everybody to keep your questions to one or two maximum, so we can try to get as many people on the call as possible. So, with that, Darla, let's turn it over. Operator : Your first question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Congrats on the performance. I wanted to ask two questions. First, could you just update us on the potential approval timing for KEYNOTE-189, ex-U.S., in major markets? And then, second, with respect to the company's operating leverage potential, it appears that some of the negative pressures on key franchises will subside after 2018 and there should be operating leverage in coming years. But I just wanted to ask you to characterize how you're thinking about the opportunity to drive potentially faster operating profit growth and revenue growth in coming years. Thank you. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: David, it's Roger. With regard to the approval timing for KEYNOTE-189, ex-U.S., the files are moving forward in a variety of jurisdictions. We expect them to move in the usual sort of way. There are no special accelerations that we see in Europe or in other jurisdictions, but the files will move forward and, as we learn more, we'll update you on their progress. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, David. This is Rob. I'll address your question on operating leverage. The answer is we do expect \u2013 as we've been signaling for quite some time, that we do expect long-term operating margin expansion and improvement due to the fact \u2013 really several things. One, obviously, as we continue to see growth in our sales line and the shift in our mix of our products, that should drive operating margin improvement. And as we have been talking about over the last several quarters, we've been in a period of heavy investment, particularly into the clinical studies behind KEYTRUDA and just the vast oncology portfolio we have in total moving through the clinic. So, that obviously has been putting some pressure on our ability to drive leverage in the near-term and will continue to make leverage more challenging over the near-term. But long-term, we are focused on driving operating margin improvement. So, you should see them. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Ken and Rob, I know you like the Animal Health business for the reasons you've articulated many times. So, don't need you to repeat those, but how do you balance those attributes with the fact that the business could be much more highly valued outside of the company? And my second question is on the Eisai collaboration. Roger, what are the important points of differentiation you see for Lenvima versus other TKIs? Thanks. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Well, so, thanks, Gregg, for the question. Let me start by saying what we've stated in the past, which is that we think this is a key growth driver for the company with healthy margins and a strong market outlook. Our goal over the longer term is to drive long-term growth and we think Animal Health, a business that generates really good cash flows, that actually helps fund the Human Health R&D we intend to do, is a way of generating long-term shareholder value within Merck. In addition, I guess, ironically, I might add that from time to time, we're told that a concern is the concentration risk around KEYTRUDA and this provides diversification from KEYTRUDA as well as the rest of our Human Health portfolio. So, I guess, I would say we view this business as an important future pillar of growth for Merck. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right. And, Gregg, the Lenvima is, just as you point out, is one of a large number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are active across a broad range of malignancies. It's pretty difficult to compare them, because the different protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors have related, but not identical spectra of activity with respect to the VEGF receptor family, PDGF receptor and others. As a result, one just has to look at the clinical data. I'd say that Lenvima data, first of all, as a monotherapy in renal cell carcinoma and in differentiated thyroid are strong and the hepatocellular data are really very good that provided approval in Japan. Our knowledge of this led us to begin the initial combination studies. We found we were able to combine Lenvima with KEYTRUDA effectively and the results which we presented in part for the combination of the two in renal cell carcinoma are really very, very encouraging. Additional data on the combination of Lenvima plus KEYTRUDA will be presented at ASCO and they're really quite interesting results. That Phase III program, of course, is still ongoing and won't be available until next year, but it is a formidable combination. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We'll take the next question, please, Darla? Operator : It's from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. The first one was on KEYTRUDA and just your thoughts on the role of monotherapy KEYTRUDA relative to combo in light of KEYNOTE-189, the data from KEYNOTE-024 as well as the data from the upcoming KEYNOTE-042 study. When we think about the high expressors as well as that 1 through 49 population, I was trying to understand how you're thinking about how people will be using monotherapy versus combo in those two settings specifically. My second question was a broader question just for Ken. I guess what we're seeing here is just the success you've had with KEYTRUDA and the visibility that provides to the longer-term business, does that change at all how you think about either investing in the portfolio today, your business development priorities or just how you think about core versus non-core assets at all? Thank you very much. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Roger, you want to start on KEYTRUDA? Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, Chris, the decision as to whether to use monotherapy versus combination therapy, I think, will be a very personal one that results from the discussions that go on between physician and patient. In a general sort of way, as you can imagine, for patients who have substantial comorbidities and where there is concern about the adverse effect profile of adding chemotherapy, monotherapy is a sensible alternative. For patients who are younger and where comorbidities are not a concern, combination therapy might be the right answer, but it will be a very personalized decision. I guess the important thing to emphasize is that in either case, KEYTRUDA provides the foundation for a therapy either with or without chemotherapy and the data on that becomes stronger and stronger over time. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Chris, with respect to your broader question, first of all, let me just say that we're pleased that due to the strong execution we've had, KEYTRUDA has the potential to be the largest product Merck has ever had, which is a good thing for Merck, but also for the patients that we can help. But we are and aspire to be much more than just a KEYTRUDA story. And so, as it relates to business development, as I've always said, it's an important priority for the company. Everything is in scope, in terms of acquisitions, we look at our portfolio to decide what's better in our portfolio, what's better outside our portfolio, but as we move forward, we're going to continue to look for those opportunities to drive and enhance our pipeline, like the deals we've done with Eisai and AZ. The challenge is obviously \u2013 recently, as we've looked at a number of acquisitions over the past couple years, the competition for assets has been such that often the prices became unreasonable based on the assumptions that we were able to make. But I just want to say again, we have a strong balance sheet, we have the power and the flexibility to do deals at any size and stage and we're going to continue to look for things that can drive long-term value and growth for our company. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Ken. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just a couple questions, mostly for you, Ken. Congrats again on winning the I-O war with KEYTRUDA which has been phenomenal news for patients, but that has not translated into shareholder value creation as Merck shares have been sort of a chronic underperformer for the past one, three, five years. So, just as you sort of wind down your period as CEO and I also want you to touch upon succession plans, what are your priorities to unlock shareholder value? You just said you're not going to spin out Animal Health. I believe that would be one very easy way to unlock value, but in the absence of doing that, what are the other plans to unlock value? Investors have been frustrated that there has been less aggressive BD activity. Can you talk more about that? And then, Rob, you touched upon margin leverage, but will this be primarily just coming from mix or is there an opportunity for absolute cost cuts? And then, Ken, again, if you could comment on succession plans. Thanks very much. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Jami, for your questions. So, first of all, of course, we would like to see our stock perform better than it has in recent years, particularly given the fact, as I've said, we have executed, I think, exceptionally well in the I-O space and we also think we've positioned the company for long-term growth and value creation. As I've said in my opening comments, we actually believe that our revenue growth opportunities are somewhat underappreciated, but moving to, I think, the thrust of your question, we continue to look for opportunities to augment our growth in our pipeline through business development. I won't repeat what I've said before. There are challenges. I think, as you know, across this industry, there are challenges as it relates to finding the right kind of assets to drive our long-term growth, but that is what we expect to do and that's what we intend to do. As it relates to succession, all I can say is that that's obviously an issue that our board is very, very focused on and that's something that totally in their viewpoint and something that they intend to proceed with. When we have something to announce, we'll let people know, but I'd just assure you that is something that's primary in the board's concerns right now. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: And good morning, Jami. On your question on what's driving operating margin, obviously, given the strong revenue growth we expect between now and 2021 as well as more broadly through 2025, along with our product mix shifting to a more specialty focus, we do anticipate operating margin expansion as we move forward. I would point out that if you look back over the last few years, we've actually done aggressive reductions mainly in our SG&A spend. If you recall, we went through over $2.5 billion cost-cutting exercise from 2013 to 2015. That allowed us to drive EPS growth during that period, while we were seeing the revenue decline and importantly build out an oncology franchise from scratch and invest in R&D. So, as we look forward, we really are more focused on how do we drive leverage by being productive in seeing our expenses grow to the rates slower than sales with the focus in SG&A of continuing to show discipline in allocation to our areas of growth. I do think there's opportunity to see SG&A as a percentage of sales continue to improve. I'd point out at 24.9%, we're already pretty much near the best-in-class within our space and that's what's allowed us to fund R&D. So, there is some opportunity there, but this is much more about how do you manage the growth of spend in a disciplined way at a rate smaller than sales long-term to take advantage of product mix through revenue growth to drive operating margin, not cost-cutting initiatives. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Rob. We'll move on to the next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So, one, I know there's been a lot of focus on lung cancer market and, obviously, the data you presented there. Just maybe, I guess, this is for Adam, just some thoughts on the commercial impact you think that might have on the use of KEYTRUDA in other indications and could there be the sort of halo effect that some of us have been talking about in terms of just driving KEYTRUDA to be the sort of preferred PD-1 across a whole range of indications? And then, my second question is more for Roger I guess. With the IDO news that you mentioned, I'm just wondering how that changes, how you think about advancing mechanisms. As you think about combinations, does it make more of an emphasis on finding monotherapy activity from agents before you move them into combinations or just any sort of thoughts, you have so many different combinations that you're working on, how do you think about prioritizing ones that maybe more likely to succeed than others? Thanks so much. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Vamil. This is Adam. Thanks for the question. And I'll start with the U.S. In the U.S., we're already seeing growth across all indications. We're seeing a particularly strong uptake in first-line lung, but we're also encouraged by the recent launches, so there's a strong launch in bladder, we're already number one. Head and neck is continuing to perform very, very well. We see good traction in MSI-high with increased testing. And when you look at the clinical program that Roger talked about, I think we will be a leader in many indications as you move forward. And I do think that there becomes a halo impact as you see the efficacy data across multiple indications where KEYTRUDA really does become foundational in cancer care. International markets are seeing not only increase in melanoma, but lung is now driving significant revenue, particularly in the larger European markets and I also believe that there would be a halo over time as we continue to get more and more data moving forward. The last thing I'd say is that the key opinion leader and the physician feedback on KEYNOTE-189 coming out of the Meeting is just remarkable and we're hearing it in all markets around the world. We're hearing it in community-based physicians as well as in the key opinion leader landscape and I do think that there is a very positive mindset coming out of the AACR Meeting. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right. And, Vamil, with respect to other, I think what you meant is immunological mechanisms for combinations, first of all, I think we should say that with respect to IDO-1, the thing that was most attractive about it was its safety and tolerability profile and in single-arm studies, it looked as if responses were broader and deeper. With that favorable tolerability profile, there was reason to want to advance it. Sure, we'd love to see combinations with agents that have profound single-agent efficacy. There are some that one can employ in that regard. I think that we do need to look much more carefully at the data from the epacadostat study and understand in more detail exactly what was seen there. We have, as has been announced by our colleagues at Incyte, scaled back the epacadostat combination program, but are continuing some Phase II studies now in lung cancer and we'll look at these data from an immunologic perspective and try and understand exactly what happened there. There are many other programs involving, for example, toll-like receptor agonists, our STING program, our RIG-I program, oncolytic viruses. Some of those, for example, in the combination with TVEC, have already demonstrated combined responses. So, there's reason for optimism that we will find the right combinations, but it's clearly going to require quite a lot of clinical experimentation. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Next question, please. Operator : It's from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I'd like to press you again on M&A, because I have kind of been confused what the message is. Merck has talked about not doing transformative deals, which I think really speaks to big pharma tie-ups and how that doesn't create value. At AACR, Roger talked about deals not really \u2013 deal focus not really being revenue-based, yet today, you mentioned your balance sheet is strong, you kind of suggest you're looking at everything. You claim that asset prices are high. I don't think that's really true when you look at big biopharma names. And so, my question is this, can you really rule out that it's not realistic that Merck is looking at a big biopharma name? It'd be great if you could just kind of narrow down what it is you're willing to consider versus not. I understand nothing transformative, but that still leaves open a very broad bandwidth of target companies potentially. Second question is on KEYNOTE-042. I know results haven't been released. Can you say, at least directionally, whether you saw a meaningful benefit on efficacy in low expressors such as the 1% to 20% segment, I think that was one of your cut offs or could the benefit in the ITT group really have been driven by primarily the high expressors? Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Tim. Let me just start by saying what I said earlier which is that when we look at the possibilities, we try not to restrict our scope in terms of what we look at. What I've said before and I will say again is that a large, what some people would call, transformational deal is not our preference. It is not consistent with our strategy. What we are trying to do is to enhance our pipeline with those kinds of deals, collaborations, acquisitions, whatever they may be, that actually enhances the pipeline long-term. I also would say that we are not looking to do deals solely for revenue. At the same time, if we're able to do deals that enhance our pipeline \u2013 and again, we're looking at all kinds of deals in terms of size and scope, if we're able to enhance our pipeline and at the same time increase revenue, that will be something that we would be very interested in doing. And indeed, I think, that characterizes the Eisai and the AstraZeneca deals, because in both those cases, we have immediate revenues as well as access to what we think are good scientific opportunities. So, I'll just say again, we continue to look for good opportunities across all acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations and licensing. And on your point about pricing in the marketplace, what I was referring to is in the past, we have looked at assets that, based on the competition, got too expensive for our assumptions. I was not making a general comment about the valuations in today's marketplace. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right. And, Tim, on KEYNOTE-042, what we announced was \u2013 remember, this study was designed to look at a population of cancer patients who had PD-L1 scores at baseline of 1% or greater. For reasons having to do with appropriate statistical analysis, the analysis looked first at the population that had greater than 50% and then stepped down ultimately to the total population and we announced that it met the endpoints of overall survival in those analyses. Really not going to be able to give you a lot more detail on that study, more color and shading, because we will be presenting that study at ASCO in June, so very soon, and you'll have a chance to see the totality of the data there. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. A couple questions. First, Ken, you mentioned with more intensity than in the past that Merck revenue prospects are underappreciated. Consensus looks for a 3% compound revenue growth through 2022. Are you saying that revenue growth will be more like mid-single digit, if not higher, through 2022 and beyond? And if that's the case, then you probably don't need to do M&A. And then, one for Adam on GARDASIL. Can you give us a sense of GARDASIL's potential in China? For instance, can China double the current GARDASIL sales base from $2.5 billion to $5 billion alone? Thank you. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay. Steve, with respect to your first question, I'm not going to be specific about numbers and I'm not giving long-term guidance. What I can say is that we look at our portfolio, we look at the growth that's possible, for example, in oncology and we are very confident about our ability to grow the company in the near- to long-term based on our key pillars, as I said before, oncology, vaccines, Animal Health and Hospital/Specialty. So, we are very confident in our ability to drive that growth and I can't be more specific in terms of specific guidance. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And then \u2013 hi, Steve, this is Adam. GARDASIL continues to perform very well in many markets around the world and we see it as a continuing growth driver for us as we move forward. I mentioned in my script that outside the U.S., we saw significant growth in this quarter and that was partially driven by the performance in China. There's no doubt that China represents a strong opportunity for GARDASIL moving forward. We're just in the initial launches in China. We're off to a very strong start, but we're going to have to really wait to see a period of time to understand if that demand will continue over time. So, I believe that represents a very good opportunity for us, but the magnitude of which we're not going to talk about today, we have to give it more time. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Let's move on the next question, please. Operator : It's from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Morning. Couple of questions, please. First to Ken and Adam. The FDA and the HHS have made clear that they want to see commercial success for biosimilars. I note on the PBM side, many PBMs, including Express today, have voluntarily adopted to adopt pass-through of rebates to patients. The question on the biosimilars' side is do you think shareholders will voluntarily adopt the biosimilars' first strategy before anything gets mandated by CMS through the legislative or regulatory pathway? And then, second, Merck has been a pioneer of tissue-agnostic approvals with KEYTRUDA in MSI. Given the reimbursement of next-generation sequencing on the Medicare as of the beginning of this year, I'm somewhat surprised Merck isn't exploring a trial of KEYTRUDA in patients with germline DNA damage repair, given the stats. Do you have a trial ongoing? Do you have one planned? Given the size of the market, isn't that an obvious area of interest for you? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, hi, Andrew. This is Adam. And I'll start with biosimilars and I'll be focused on the U.S. market. I think that there will continue to be a significant potential market for biosimilars in the U.S. and I do think that there's a lot of energy to ensure that cost savings can occur by the appropriate utilization of biosimilars. Whether it's through regulatory environment or payers that \u2013 who are volunteering to try to use biosimilars first, I do believe that there will continue to be an increase in their utilization. At the same time, I think that you'll continue to see price pressure and you'll see the free market work the way in which it's supposed to work. So, the parent compounds or the originators might come down in price in order to compete with the biosimilars. I think at the end of the day what payers are looking to do is to reduce cost by the appropriate utilization of the biologic products. So, I do believe you'll see continued pressure for increased use of biosimilars. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Andrew, it's Roger. We are very interested in the question of what exactly is driving appropriate anti-tumor responses in KEYTRUDA-treated patients and have done a lot of work on DNA sequence substitutions as part of that. The story is more complex than, of course, all of us would like it to be. We have a quite large study in press describing the relationships among these things. The answer, of course, is that we believe the DNA damage repair does contribute to response in this to KEYTRUDA and that's one of the reasons, of course, that we've been especially interested in the combination with Lynparza. Our colleagues at AstraZeneca have done quite a lot of work on DNA damage repair and the combination of the two is a likely mechanism for exploiting further the ability of KEYTRUDA to illicit profound anti-tumor responses and improve overall survival. So, we're deeply involved in this. We're looking at it from a number of perspectives. It's a complicated story and we'll have a lot more to say about it in the next few months. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Adam or Roger, on first-line lung in the U.S., you touched on this, but I want to get a better sense from you as to who the incremental prescriber is or what overall share you think could now be in play based on the full KEYNOTE-189 dataset. I'm assuming that low expressors could be the biggest opportunity. And then on \u2013 Ken, another strategic question for you, you mentioned Animal Health diversifying the model and concentration risk. Investors have long been worried about the LOE from diabetes and how much of a strategic priority is filling this gap over the long-term? Thank you. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yes. Hi, Geoff. This is Adam. And as I mentioned before, the key opinion leader and even the community-based, there's an excitement on the KEYNOTE-189 data is very strong. As I mentioned in the past, I think we did a very good job with penetrating the greater-than-50% PD-L1 marketplace previously and a lot of that was the monotherapy use. Where we weren't as successful, it was in the patients with 1 to 49 or the patients below 1. And what we're hearing is now that we've shown the overall survival data in all of those segments that there will be increased utilization of the combination therapy for those segments and I think that there's a lot of runway to go into those two segments. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Geoff, this is Rob. I'll answer the question about filling the gap related to JANUVIA, JANUMET. As Ken mentioned in his prepared comments, we are feeling very confident in the growth potential we have. And if you look at some of the recent deals we've done, we are focused on filling that gap. And I believe doing deals like the Lenvima deal with Eisai, doing the deal with AstraZeneca for Lynparza, as well as you look at assets we have in our pipeline like our PCV V114 asset for pneumococcal pneumonia, all of these are starting to fill that gap. So, we are focused on it and we think we're making progress. There's more to do and that's why business development continues to be a focus, but I think if you look at where we are today on revenue going forward, given these new assets and the increasing confidence we have in them, we're making progress. And Animal Health is also an important part of that. It continues to perform extremely well. It is a diversification. I think people don't give credit for the Animal Health business for what it is. It's an annuity stream and it carries a risk profile very different than the pharma business and, as a result, gives us both diversification and good growth at rates above both Merck and the Animal Health industry. So, in that sense, it also should help to fill that gap. So, we're focused on that, we're making progress, more to come. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Rob. We'll move on to the next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Jason Gerberry, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just first question, just wanted clarification. I thought I heard you say KEYNOTE-407 would be presented at ASCO, but we didn't see it in the titles or the study hasn't been top-lined. So, Roger, could you just provide some clarification there? And then on your 15 valent vaccine that you initiated Phase 3 studies on, just wondering if you guys can comment a little bit on how you see the products competitively positioned relative to Prevnar. Is it basically roughly about 15% (54:43) coverage with no additional negative trade-offs? Is that sort of the ultimate value proposition if that study is successful? Thanks. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Jason, it's Roger. KEYNOTE-407, it was actually \u2013 the title was in the abstract publication and it will be presented at ASCO. So, those data will \u2013 people will have a chance to see them. It wasn't specifically named, but the title was there with respect to squamous and lung cancer. And regarding V114, the serology data, which we had a chance to present in Melbourne just recently, are really very, very strong for the V114 vaccine. And it provides the opportunity to both strengthen the response to serotypes covered by other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, but also to add additional stereotypes which will be important in terms of preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. So, we see opportunities there in both areas and we anticipate that assuming that we can get those same kinds of results in the Phase 3 studies, then we'll have a very attractive profile. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. We're going to try to squeeze one more question in here. Operator : It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions. A few quick ones, if I may. Rob, on your tax rate, we're seeing notably lower tax rate from some of your peers. I'm just wondering if there's a further opportunity for lowering your rate as well. Roger, you're obviously showing a very strong execution, R&D execution with KEYTRUDA, but there seems to be a notable difference in your R&D productivity with KEYTRUDA and the rest of the pipeline. I'm just wondering if you have a comment on that please and if there's any additional steps being taken to close that apparent gap. And then, finally, Adam, not sure if I missed it, but could you please provide estimated KEYTRUDA sales by different indications? Thank you. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Good morning. This is Rob. I'll answer your question about the tax rate. So, if you look at where we are, we are guiding for 19% to 20% for this year. As we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we do expect \u2013 as we move into 2019, there is the opportunity for us to see a further reduction in our tax rate of up to 1 percentage point. So, you will see our tax rate improve as we move forward from 2018 into 2019. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Alex, I guess you and I might have to agree to disagree on the issue of the rest of the pipeline. I thought you were going to say the pipeline execution outside KEYTRUDA is even stronger. If you look at things like the registration for PREVYMIS, which is an extraordinary drug in CMV, it is already being adopted as the standard in hematologic transplant and the solid organ transplant work is going along. Look at the work that was done in the development of BRIDION. Look at the work that's being done in the totality of infectious disease programs. I guess I would say I feel really good about the way in which the clinical development organization is prosecuting these the way in which our regulatory affairs organization is gaining registration for these molecules and with the balance of new molecules that are coming out of the pipeline, including 20 in the immuno-oncology area alone. So, I'm actually feeling pretty good about it. And let's talk. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And then, with regard to utilization of KEYTRUDA by indication, I'll start with the U.S. Based on the latest data we have, and these are rough estimates, we think about 60% is in lung, 15% in melanoma, about 5% in head and neck, about 5% in bladder and about 15% in other indications. Outside the U.S., metastatic melanoma and lung is where the majority of utilization is. What we're already seeing in some of the large European markets is that lung is becoming the largest indication. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, thank you all for participating in today's call. I want to reiterate again that we're starting 2018 with strong momentum. And as I mentioned at the beginning, I am confident about our near and long-term trajectory. That confidence doesn't provide any basis for us not to continue to look to BD to augment our pipeline, but we are confident in the near and long-term trajectory of the business. And I thank you for being on the call today and I hope you have a good day. Operator : This concludes Merck's first quarter 2018 sales and earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Doherty, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Merck's Second Quarter 2018 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam : Thank you, Doherty, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call maybe considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2017 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Teri. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. During the second quarter, Merck delivered strong growth. We also further advanced our leadership in oncology through focused commercial execution, the achievement of important regulatory milestones and the presentation of clinical data at ASCO for KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and LENVIMA. Following the unprecedented results in first-line non-small cell lung cancer presented at AACR, we followed up with similarly impressive data at ASCO. This included more than 140 abstracts across 25 tumor types, which is a substantial increase from just five years ago when we\u2019ve presented the first clinical data for KEYTRUDA, a single abstract for advanced melanoma. KEYTRUDA is becoming foundational for the treatment of cancer and adding Lynparza and LENVIMA as well as our other oncology assets in the pipeline, and we believe that Merck\u2019s oncology portfolio has the breadth and depth to further expand our leadership position. Our vaccines business is also an important growth driver. We are pleased to see the growing momentum of our HPV vaccination worldwide. The WHO Director General recently called for all countries to take action to help eliminate cervical cancer, which is predominantly caused by HPV. We've seen several countries offer expanded recommendations and we recently gained approval for GARDASIL in China, all of which contributes to our long-term confidence in this brand. Briefly turning to Animal Health. This business continues to deliver strong results growing faster than Human Health. In addition to our global scale and the synergies we gained from sharing innovations across the two businesses, it also diversifies our portfolio and is a key pillar of our long-term growth strategy. Delivering innovative products is at the core of who we are as a company. We will continue to augment our animal and human health pipelines through internal investments as well as externally through business development. As our results have demonstrated so far this year, we have good momentum and we are focused on continuing to execute across our business to drive growth and create long-term shareholder value. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Davis, who go through our results in more detail. Rob? Rob Davis : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments today will be based on a non-GAAP earnings basis. In the second quarter, we deliver strong performance in both are Human and Animal Health businesses, resulting in meaningful revenue and EPS growth. Total company revenues were $10.5 billion, an increase the 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, second quarter revenues grew 4%. Our Human Health business grew 3% excluding exchange, and Adam will provide more color on those results in a moment. Animal Health sales totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14%. Excluding the impact of exchange, sale grew 12%, with livestock sales growing 7% and Companion Animal sales growing 19%. Animal Health segment profits were $450 million in the second quarter, an increase of 14% compared to the prior year or 10% excluding exchange. Turning to the expense lines. Gross margin was 74.4% in the quarter, a decrease of 290 basis points versus the second quarter of 2017. The decrease reflects increased amortization including a sizable catchup adjustment for an accrued sales milestone related to Adempas. In addition, gross margin was impacted by unfavorable manufacturing variances, partly due to last year's cyber event as well as FX.  Operating expenses were $4.4 billion, increased 4% year-over-year, including a negative two percentage point impact from foreign exchange. The increase was driven by our continued investment in R&D, primarily for the clinical development of Lynparza and LENVIMA, as well as for early development efforts. The tax rates was 17.9% in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of tax reform. Pasting together, we earned $1.06 per share, an increase the 6%, excluding exchange. Turning to the outlook for the year. Based on continued operational strength, we are narrowing our revenue guidance range and narrowing and raising our EPS guidance range for 2018, despite a less favorable exchange environment versus our prior expectations in May. For the full year, we now expect revenues to be between $42 billion and $42.8 billion, including a slightly positive impact from foreign currency at mid-July rates. We anticipate our gross margin will now be lower year-over-year by approximately 1 percentage point with the slight change primarily being driven by the Adempas milestone related amortization this quarter. We continue to expect OpEx to increase year-over-year by low to mid-single digits. We have slightly lowered our tax rate assumption and now expect it to be between 18.5% and 19.5%. We continue to anticipate approximately $2.7 billion in average shares -- or 2.7 billion shares outstanding as of the end of the year. Taken together, we now expect EPS to be between $4.22 and $4.30, including a roughly 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency at mid-July rates. In summary, we continue to execute well on our strategy driving top and bottom line performance. Re-allocating resources to effectively support our commercial opportunities in the near term, we\u2019re making the necessary investments in R&D to support long-term growth. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Adam to provide more detail on our Human Health business. Adam? Adam Schechter : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I\u2019ll provide highlights in the performance of Global Human Health for the second quarter of 2018. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. Global Human Health sales grew 3% to $9.3 billion. Consistent with last quarter, our key growth drivers including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and BRIDION performed very well. Roughly 60% of our sales were from outside of the U.S. and grew 8%, highlighting of our global commercial presence and solid execution around the world.  I\u2019ll now focus on a few of our key franchises, and I\u2019ll start with oncology. Our oncology business is benefiting from a rapid worldwide uptake of KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and LENVIMA. KEYTRUDA with global sales of nearly $1.7 billion is now approved in 12 indications across 8 tumor types in the U.S. and similarly approved a multiple indications across tumor types in countries around the world. We believe our breath of current indications, with significant opportunities yet to come, will be a competitive advantage and will help us continue to be a leader in this field for many years. In the United States, KEYTRUDA means the leading immunotherapy in new patient starts. We\u2019re looking at all indications combined. Sales this quarter benefited from accelerated adoption in metastatic lung cancer as well as growth in bladder and MSI high cancers. In patients diagnosed with non-squamous first-line lung cancer, the significant survival benefits demonstrated in KEYNOTE-189 is resulting in sharply broader use of KEYTRUDA in combination chemotherapy. Physicians now clearly see the benefit of using this combination across all of their first-line patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression. We are currently capturing roughly two-thirds of new patient starts, excluding EGFR and ALK, approximately 20 share points higher than prior to AACR. We expect continued substantial adoption of this indication in the second half of 2018 and beyond. In addition, the strong survival benefits in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer from KEYNOTE-407 to enable us to become standard of care in this population, which represents roughly 20% of the market. With the strength shown in our clinical program, KEYTRUDA indication should be able to represent roughly 80% of all non-small cell lung cancer patients within its overall survival benefit, which is the gold standard.  Outside the U.S., we're seeing significant growth of KEYTRUDA and now represents over 40% of total sales. We are seeing strong uptake in first-line lung, and we have secured reimbursement in most major markets worldwide for our monotherapy indications. Sales also continued to grow in melanoma, head and neck and bladder cancers. We continued to be very confident in the near- and long-term growth prospects of KEYTRUDA, driven by continued penetration of approved indications as well as the potential from many additional indications in the future. The potential benefit of KEYTRUDA in patients with breast, gastric, hepatocellular, renal, head and neck and other, including various adjuvant-stage cancers, are exciting opportunities for us.  Now turning to Lymparza, which we\u2019re co-commercializing and co-developing with AstraZeneca. Oncology business benefitted from the strong performance of Lymparza, which leads the PARP inhibitor class in both new and total prescriptions. U.S. sales grew significantly, driven by continued growth in ovarian cancer as well as the strong launch in the new breast cancer indication.  Ex-U.S. sales benefited from the recent launch in ovarian cancer in Japan. Going forward, we expect the recent breast cancer approval in Japan and expectations for an ovarian cancer approval in China to continue to enable strong growth. Our partnership with Eisai for LENVIMA is also up to advanced fast start. In the United States, our sales representatives started promoting LENVIMA in renal cell carcinoma in June, and we look forward to the potential hepatocellular carcinoma approval this quarter within August 24 FDUFA date. Over the next six months, we'll begin promoting LENVIMA in many key countries in both Europe and Asia-Pacific. So as you can see we are very confident about our future growth of Lymparza and LENVIMA, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents.  Now moving to vaccines, which represents another key pillar of growth. Global vaccines grew 7% and exceed $1.5 billion this quarter, led by GARDASIL, which remains in very high demand. The transition to two dose regimen in the U.S. is nearly complete, and we continue to see strong underlying demand. Outside of the U.S., growth remains very strong as the benefit of HPV vaccination continue to become more broadly understood by healthcare systems worldwide. In addition, uptick in China has been particularly robust following a launch there. We're excited about the FDA acceptance of our SPLA for the use of GARDASIL in women and men ages 27 to 45 and believe GARDASIL will remains a significant growth opportunity moving forward. Now moving to diabetes. Our diabetes franchise continues to be relatively stable. Global sales were nearly $1.6 billion, flat with year ago levels. Trends worldwide remained largely consistent with strong demand-driven growth ex-U.S. markets being largely offset by continued pricing pressure in the U.S. Lastly, in our hospital specialty portfolio, PBM report another very strong quarter of growth both in the U.S. and worldwide. The neuromuscular blockade market continues to grow because of increases in robotic and minimally invasive surgical procedures. And PBM continues to gain market share as a reversal agent of choice. We recently launched PBM in China and believe our prospects for growth both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. remains strong. In total, we are pleased by performance of our global Human Health business this quarter and we're very optimistic about our future potential, driven by our key growth areas including oncology, vaccines and hospital specialty.  With that, I'll turn it over to Roger. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks, Adam. During the second quarter, we had the opportunity to present important data related to our programs in oncology and infectious diseases at multiple scientific meetings and we advanced many of our key programs. Looking first at KEYTRUDA. Since our last earnings call, we gave US registration for the treatment of relapsed for refractory mediastinal and B-cell lymphoma and for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in women whose tumors expressed PDL1, that is with CPS greater than or equal to one. In all, the FDA has now granted approval for the use of KEYTRUDA in 12 different indications, standing eight different tumor types and the broader categories for the patients whose tumors demonstrate microsatellite instability. Also during the second quarter, the FDA granted priority review to our sBLA submission for the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic carcinoma for the PDUFA date of November 9 and for the use of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy or the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the lung for the PDUFA date of October 30. The latter submission was based on our recently completed KEYNOTE-407 study, results of which were presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology or ASCO meeting in June. Now these data were described by the ASCO commentator as representing a new standard of care for patients suffering from advanced renal cell carcinoma to lung. Similarly, the results of KEYNOTE-189 study, which tested the utility of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and patience receiving first-line treatment for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer were incorporated into a supplementary sBLA that was accepted for priority review for the PDUFA date of September 23 by the FDA earlier in the quarter. Data supporting the filing showed a greater than 50% improvement in overall survival in patients receiving simultaneous KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy as compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Separately our supplementary BLA for the use of KEYTRUDA in the adjutant treatment of patients undergoing definitive surgical resection of cutaneous melanoma was also accepted by the FDA with an action date of February 16, 2019. Outside of the United States, yesterday we announced that KEYTRUDA was approved in China for the second-line treatment of unresectable or advanced melanoma, with first approval of our PD-1 therapies for melanoma in China. These numerous approvals and filings are really just the beginning of what will be a very robust period of evaluation for KEYTRUDA in both combination therapy and normal therapy settings. At the ASCO meeting in June, my colleagues presented more than 100 abstracts related KEYTRUDA alone. Many of these represented progress reports that we expect will yield data support of its registration in the not too distant future, including for the treatment of small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. At some greater remove, we expect that data will also merge support in the use of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer.  Beyond KEYTRUDA, very substantial progress is made in our other oncology programs. With our colleagues at AstraZeneca, we achieved registration for the use of Lynparza tablets in the maintenance treatment of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer in the European Union and then the treatment of BRCA-mutated HER2-negative breast cancer in Japan. Our join efforts on LENVIMA with colleagues at Eisai also yielded in important regulatory actions. The approval of this multi-kinase inhibitor for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan, LENVIMA is under review for the same education in United States. Progress is continued in other areas as well. Earlier this week, at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam, we presented 96-week data from our DRIVE-FORWARD Study of Doravirine, our investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in combination with other antiretroviral agency in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients, doing long-term suppression of HIV borrowed burden with this new age. Doravirine, both as a single agent and as a combination single tablet regimen, is currently under review at the FDA with an action date of October 23. We\u2019re also setting Doravirine in combination with MK-8591, our first-in-class nucleoside derivative that durably blocks both reverse transcriptase translocation as well as polymerase activity. Data from this Phase II study will become available later this year. Also in the infectious disease arena, as Adam mentioned, the FDA has accepted supplementary BLA and granted priority review for the use of GARDASIL in women and men ages 27 to 45 with an action date of October 6. Early in the quarter, we announced that GARDASIL 9 is approved in China for use in girls and women 16 to 26 years old. We see these new regulatory actions as emblematic of an increased focus on the impact of Human Papillomavirus-induced diseases, especially cervical cancer. At the ASCO meeting in June, Doug Lowy of the National Cancer Institute, who shared last year\u2019s at Alaska award for his studies of HPV median diseases both persuasively about the importance of mounting worldwide immunization campaigns against HPV and both the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute in the United States. Their designated cancer centers have endorsed the goal of eliminating cancers caused by HPV through effective gender-neutral vaccination of adolescence. GARDASIL and especially GARDASIL 9 will play a pivotal role in these worldwide efforts. We have many other important vaccine initiatives underway, including V114, our 15 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently under investigation and Phase III trials; and V160, our novel vaccine for the prevention of primary CMV infection in healthy seronegative women, which is currently being evaluated a large Phase II study. But today, I wish to pay tribute to the many dedicated healthcare workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and especially the Congolese Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization for the successful containment of the recent Ebola virus disease upgrades in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My colleagues at Merck Research Laboratories works tirelessly to supply nearly 13,000 doses of our investigational V920 vaccine, which we previously demonstrated have protective activity in the 2014-2015 Ebola disease upgrade to any, these data will publish as part of the Ebola \u00c7a Suffit! trial in the Lancet in 2017. This permitted vaccination in healthcare workers and people at high risks contracting the Ebola virus disease during this most recent outbreak. We\u2019ve proud to have been able to contribute to this effort and are continuing to make rapid progress towards the registration of V920, which has been described as a game-changer in this control of Ebola virus infection.  I will now turn the call back over to Teri. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Roger. Doherty, we\u2019ll move on the question-and-answer session. I'd like to remind everyone on the phone to try to limit your questions to a maximum of two or one question with two parts so that we can try to get as many people on as possible. So, Doherty, if we can move on please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala : Thank you very much. Roger, what is Merck's strategy in Stage III unresectable lung cancer where Astra has done well with Pacific. At the ASCO meeting, you were asked the question but not answer suggesting that Merck is pursuing approval perhaps on its single-arm trial. So I'm wondering if you can update us there. And secondly, Adam, could you provide us KEYTRUDA's market share by tumor type in the U.S. and EU? Thank you very much. Roger Perlmutter : Yeah, Steve. The specific registrational strategy, we were pursuing different aspects of lung cancer approval is not something that we generate comment on. Suffice it to say that we do have some data available in advanced cancer, non-resectable cancer that is non-metastatic. And we expect that there will be additional data that will come forward in the months and years ahead that will permit a specific indication, but we're not commenting on the regulatory strategy. Adam Schechter : Hi, Steve. I hope all is going well. Just with regard to your question, I'll give you a rough estimate as you know the data is not perfect in this area. But if you start with the U.S., the rough estimate is about 60% to 65% is in lung, about 15% melanoma, about 5% in bladder, about 5% in MSI High and then the rest is in all other indications. And then if you look at Europe, the data is even harder to get exact numbers on. What I would say is if you look at Europe and Japan, lung is the majority of revenue; and then followed by melanoma, which is the second largest contributor; and then all the other tumor types like head and neck, and bladder, are the rest of the numbers in there. But it's clearly lung followed by melanoma and then all others. Teri Loxam : Thanks. We'll move on to the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A question for Adam and then one for Roger. So I guess you might have seen this coming. Could you comment on the puzzles that have been made by HHF, the White House, to either remove or significantly amend the \u2013 structure by taking way the Lymparza. In particular, could you comment on your understanding of under the rages whether this has been it's just a federal plans or do you believe that there could be direct or indirect impact on commercial book of business either through the action of administration or more likely to the PBM\u2019s activity down? And then separately, potential timing whether we should expect something for this 12 months now, but do you think there is any possibility that could happen faster than that. So I know there is lot of uncertainty there, but anything you could add would be helpful? And then to Roger. As far as I can see, the anticipation of expansion of the -- trial that was spoke about previously hasn't happened yet, unless I\u2019ve missed them. So I was wondering whether this is just the challenges of dealing with a partner company rather than your own internal assets or whether it's being compounded by the departure of some of your senior employees meeting for your resource constraints. Adam Schechter : Well, thank you, Andrew. Let me start with your first question about the proposal to remove the Safe Harbor for rebates plans and PBMs. So I have to start by saying it's rather difficult to comment on specifics at this point. As you know there's so many different proposals being considered to address the high out-of-pocket cost or drugs to patients, what I would say as we will work with the administration and the Congress to help find appropriate solutions to these issues. We do think it's important to make sure that patients to have meaningful access and lowering out-of-pockets across the patients is something that we're strongly and support of. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : And Andrew, with respect to the expansion of the olaparib trial, well as you know and as I\u2019ve described we've done quite a lot with Lynparza since the partnership with AstraZeneca plus consummate. We have a lot of new studies that we've gone through and it's taken a little bit longer than we wanted to for the two organizations to come together and agree on exactly what we should study and where we should study it. But you'll be seeing a lot of those trials grow a lot very soon in response to your question. It is not because we are in any way constrained by personnel and we have our clinical team is really firing in all cylinders, no doubt. Teri Loxam : Thanks for your question, Andrew. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin : Thank you. I have a couple of questions. First, just wondering, Ken and Rob, if you're comfortable with the way the Street is thinking about the cadence of KEYTRUDA uptake, given the stickiness in the second-line lung market as reported by Russell Myers, we really have yet to see an inflection point in KEYTRUDA. Yes, it's doing well, but we haven't really seen a meaningful impact from KEYNOTE-189. And even more importantly, when do you expect to see the operating margin pull-through from KEYTRUDA. Even this quarter if you adjust to the Adempas milestone, operating margins are below where they were a year ago despite KEYTRUDA sales up over $800 million. So -- I mean are we thinking about operating margins correctly? Should they go up? And when do they go up? And then, Ken, for you a question on Animal Health. We heard you loud and clear in your opening comments, fully committed to Animal Health toward your growth, et cetera, et cetera. But I'm sure you've noticed outside of Merck this wave of corporate simplification that is going across the industry. We've seen it with Lilly, with Novartis, et cetera, et cetera. Investors are rewarding companies that are unlocking values through spinning off assets, such as animal health. And I'm sure you've also noticed the big difference in valuation between Merck\u2019s and so other. So while we understand that\u2019s an important growth driver, I think if a company is fully committed to KEYTRUDA and confident in KEYTRUDA and that business, I'm not sure I understand why this deigning on Animal House? So if you could address those two questions, I'd appreciate it. Thanks. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Jami. So we'll start with Adam talk about the commercial uptake of KEYTRUDA, then go to Rob for the operating margins and then follow-up with Ken on Animal Health. Adam Schechter : Yeah. Hi, Jamie. So it's our first reward, we're very pleased with the performance of KEYTRUDA. And if you look at the sales for the first half of '18, it's doubled versus the first half of 2017. And we\u2019ve seen robust growth sequentially every single quarter since launch both in the U.S. and outside the US. And I think people sometimes don\u2019t recognize is the fact that 40%, more than 40% of our sales are outside the U.S. And we\u2019ve only launched the immunotherapy there. We have not yet launched the combination therapy. But I can tell you the feedback on the chemo combo in the U.S. use has been very well received. And as I mentioned, about two-thirds of new patients are now starting on KEYTRUDA, when you exclude EGFR and ALK, and that\u2019s a 20 points share increase since AACR. I\u2019ve always said this is not going to be a big bolus of patients because these are patients coming into the market as are diagnosed each and every day and month. But as you continue to grow new patients share, those patients become part of the RF base and that represents a very large opportunity for growth for us for moving forward. And in addition to that, we\u2019ve done really well with had head and neck, bladder and MSI-high, and we\u2019re looking forward to all patients that Roger has spoken about. Rob Davis : Good morning, Jami. And to your question about operating margin, obviously as we look at the profile of the company, I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent with this. Clearly, as we look to long term, we intend and expect to see both the leverage P&L and operating margin expansion over time. But as we\u2019ve said previously, in the near term, as we look at 2018, we are continuing through a period of pretty meaningful investment both in the ongoing clinical studies for KEYTRUDA, but as you saw this quarter, we\u2019re now starting to see the clinical studies for Lynparza and LENVIMA also start to pick up and that is driving a lot of the growth in R&D you\u2019re seeing the quarter as well as continue to advance several programs through our vaccines portfolio. So obviously we\u2019re very cognizant of the need to get operating leverage and to margin expansion, but we also want to make sure we\u2019re making appropriate investments for the long term. And so you\u2019re probably not going to see that type of expansion you\u2019re looking for until we get through this bolus spend over the next year or so. And then on the gross margin line, you mentioned Adempas. Recall that as we came into the quarter, we did expect -- or into the year actually, we did expect to see a slight decline in our gross margins year-on-year. This is really due to the fact that we did have coming into the year of the expectation of larger negative manufacturing variances. Part of that was due to the carryover effect of cyber and part of it is due to the fact that a few years ago we actually benefited quite a bit from the start-up of commercialization of KEYTRUDA that brought with us very positive one-time manufacturing variances as we converted from our pilot plans to our commercial plans. So you are seeing that happening through the gross margin line. As we\u2019ve said in the past, well, we\u2019re not getting specific guidance on gross margin as you look forward long term. We do see both the tailwinds of margin expansion from important products like the KEYTRUDA, BRIDION other new products launching, which are margin-positive, being offset by the LOEs, ZETIA being an important one had a very high margin, and then products like ZEPATIER coming down, which also had a high margin. So those headwinds and tailwinds are largely offsetting. And as we look forward, whether or not we end up with a slightly higher margin or slightly lower margin will really depend on how product mix and currency play themselves through as we look forward. So that hopefully gives you a sense of what\u2019s happening both of the gross and operating margin line. Ken Frazier : And, Jami, thanks for your question about Animal Health. Let me start by letting you know and showing you that we consistently reevaluate our corporate portfolio in light of various facts, including the environment, to determine how we can generate the highest value for our shareholders over the long term. You mentioned the growth impact that we talked about earlier in the call of animal health. In addition to growth, we believe our Animal health business provides us diversification from KEYTRUDA in the rest of our human health portfolio. And we also think it's important to note the important synergies of having animal and human health together within Merck. We\u2019ll point out though our animal health business is growing more quickly than its industry peers and a great deal of that has to do with the fact that we are able to achieve synergies between our animal health R&D and our human health R&D. For example, we have innovative protein and vaccine technology that is shared across that portfolio. Animal health have access to our human health catalog, which has led to innovations on the animal health side. Right now they're investigating oncology and diabetes where our companion animals, and their other examples of human health leveraging discovery from animal health as well. So we see all of those reasons, as we sit here today, we see animal health still fitting with our strategy intent and our intrinsic capabilities as a research-based pharmaceutical company, and we believe these synergies will help our animal health business grow faster in its market and will also have an impact on overall Merck. Teri Loxam : Great. Thanks for your question, Jami. We'll move on to the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just had two here. Maybe first on KEYTRUDA. Where do you think penetration rates can go for PD-1s in frontline lung when we think about those non-AL to non-EGFR patients? As you mentioned, you're right now at two-thirds of new starts. Where is that go over sight? It now go to 75% at 85%, just any color there would be appreciated? My second quarter, GARDASIL. You got $2.4 billion or $2.5 billion kind of run-rate business now. You\u2019re talking about significant growth. I guess my question here is how much larger could this product to be overtime. I mean as part of that whether you think as growth markets how quickly can you hit to those markets. And just a little bit there we\u2019re trying to get our hands on how we should think about the ramp of the product from here. Thank you so much. Adam Schechter : Hi, Chris. This is Adam. First of all, with regard to KEYTRUDA penetration rates in first-line lung, a couple of things to note. First of all the two-thirds and 20 share point increase have happened very quickly and we believe that there is still substantial opportunity for that to grow even further. And as I mentioned that if you exclude ALK and EGFR, we now have survival benefits in 80% of the markets. So we believe that we continue to see good growth. Outside the U.S., the opportunity remains very big because we've only launched for monotherapy, we have not yet launched the chemo combo therapy and some other data. So I think the growth opportunity there remains significant. So there is no doubt that our lung indication will continue to be a good driver of growth for us in the future, but as I said before, all the new indications that we're expecting and some of those to be rather large, we're excited about the potential future opportunity. And the two-thirds as I talked about, new patients, those are patients that are just been diagnosed coming into the market. So I do believe that there is significant opportunity there moving forward.  With regard to GARDASIL, there is opportunity frankly globally. In the United States, there still opportunity to increase vaccination rates in 11-12 years old but also in the 19 to 26 years old. I also believe the opportunity for the 27 to 46-year olds, as we discussed with that indication, will represent another very important opportunity for us in the United States. Outside the United States, there is opportunity in new geographies, and China is an exemplar of that. And the uptake in China continues to be very strong. And then with new data that's been introduced in countries like Australia, there really is a lot of talk about elimination campaigns in markets around the world. So I believe that the opportunity for GARDASIL in the short term and long term for growth remains very significant. Teri Loxam : Thanks for your questions, Chris. Move on to the next one please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just following up on Christopher. Just think I forgot that 80% of overall survival benefit now of the frontline market in the lung cancer. I guess what is a reasonable sort of penetration rate do you think? If we look out, say, 12 to 18 months, I think from the comments from Bristol yesterday suggests maybe the penetration will be as high as people think. So maybe you can just give your sense of out of that 80%, what would you be satisfied with it? We looked at 12 to 18 months in terms of how much KEYTRUDA alone or maybe PD-1, PD-L1 combined can penetrate? And then my second question is more for Ken and is on the business development on a presuming that remains a priority. I think investors maybe have been a little bit surprised that I've been more active. You've done some of these collaborations, which I think might be a little bit appreciated. But just in terms of business development as you look out now, thoughts around maybe a larger deal or any change in your perspective on the focus on innovation and being the commentary about what's held you back and but all my change and getting more rest of going forward? Thanks. Adam Schechter : So this is Adam. So we're currently capturing, as I said, roughly two-thirds of the new patient starts when you said EGFR and ALK. I also said that\u2019s about a 20 share point higher increase than what we had prior to AACR. But I would expect continued substantial adoption is indicating as we go through the rest of this year. So I do believe it will continue to grow. Also, if you look at patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer from KEYNOTE-407, that should enable us to become the standard of care in this population as well, and that's about 20% of the market. So again, with strength that we've seen in the clinical program or indications to be able to represent about 80% of all non-small cell lung cancer patients with overall survival. And overall survival is the gold standard. So that's why I believe there's still significant opportunity there Ken Frazier : And on business development, I'd start by again reinforces how important that priority is for the company, and we are actively looking for the best opportunities across all kinds of structures, including acquisitions and partnerships, collaboration and licensing. And with respect to acquisitions, over the past couple years, as I said previously, we can't looked at some that didn't can out either because of the target was just not a willing seller. Well, because it was for kind of competition for the asset that made the price untenable based on our assumptions. I think, as you\u2019ve seen, there has also been generally a terrific of M&A across the industry recently. There's been significant funding flowing in the small biotech, including the IPO, which are at multiyear highs. So as a result, biotechs have access to ample capital and they have perhaps less need or desire to sell right now and the deals that are getting done are being done at very high prices and premium. But I want to assure you that augmenting our pipeline to business development nevertheless remains an important priority. So we'll continue to scour the landscape carefully. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : So I have two questions. First, when do you expect to provide more clarity on the longer-term outlook? And I guess that that includes the early- to mid-stage pipeline and the financial prospects beyond 2018. And then second. With respect to GARDASIL, could you just discuss the things that are holding it back right now supply sort of shortages. I\u2019m assuming the 3 to 2 dose conversion is over. And then finally, and I\u2019m sorry for all the questions, but just China, could you comment on net pricing there versus the U.S.? Thank you. Adam Schechter : David, I\u2019ll take your first question, which has to do with explaining or helping people to understand a longer term prospect. So we continue to evaluate the best way to do that, including perhaps the possibility of giving longer term guidance as we appreciate the desire investors for additional insights into our own internal expectations. Obviously we want investors to understand why we\u2019re so confident in our long-term prospect. So that they continue to evaluate Merck versus other investments, they can do that. I will say that we are thinking about the best way to do that, and we will get back to you in that regard. Ken Frazier : And with regard to GARDASIL. Again, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity there. We\u2019re still in the beginning, frankly at the launch in China and we\u2019re excited about that opportunity. Regarding the U.S., the transition to the 2-dose regimen is nearly completed. It\u2019s not entirely complete, so we are overlapping the vast majority of that change. So I think we\u2019ll start to see some growth there as we finalize the 2-dose transition. And then lastly, I would say that and showing that we\u2019ve got the right amount of products in the right parts of the world will always be something that we\u2019re going to be working on. And frankly, the update in China has been larger than what we would have initially anticipated, and we\u2019re still trying to ensure that we understand what the demand there, because this is such a large opportunity. There are so many people there that we\u2019ve got to understand how much product will need to get into that country. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Gregg Gilbert : I want to start with Roger. The pneumococcal vaccine front, obviously, the stakes are pretty huge, albeit a few years out from things changing. But it appears that you could leapfrog Pfizer in a few years and then possibly get re-leapfrogged by them with their 20-valent product. Obviously the studies have to be done. But can you shed some light on your views on how that space will evolve and any other nuances we should be aware of in terms of the potential for differentiation other than sort of whose is bigger than whose? And then, Adam, can you talk about the commercial opportunity for Duravarin? It seems to be something where there\u2019s a disconnect between them the company\u2019s enthusiasm the Streets focus? Thanks. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Well, thanks, Gregg. On pneumococcal vaccine. Clearly, I think this is an area where we\u2019ve been very active for a long time. With PNEUMOVAX, we have a lot of understanding of the marketplace and the needs in terms of invasive pneumococcal disease continue to evolve because of the availability of vaccines, particularly in the younger susceptible population. So as new vaccines are introduced, there are changes in the epidemiology of pneumococcal serotypes, which we follow quite closely. My expectation is that there will be need in the marketplace for multiple \u2013 vaccines to lead advanced chemo moving forward but advancing \u2013 there will be other things that will be coming forward. There will be others in the marketplace. Obviously our colleagues and competitors advisor are hard at work in these two. And we'll see how it plays out, but I think there is clear need for many vaccines in this extremely important area given the bread of the -- disease and its impact on human population. Adam Schechter : And with regard to doravirine, it's important to have options outside the integration inhibitor class and that is the most frequently described class at the moment. But RKI based regimens are one of the most commonly used treatment regimens in a wholly lung patient populations. And if you look at the -- profile it would improve on some of the limitations with the NNRTI class more favorable CNS side effect profile and they're put it back. But I look at it more as a bridge and so we've to continue to build on our legacy in HIV upgrades to that product that Roger talked about which is the MKE --1 novel product. So I would look at it as a near term way for us to continue to be relevant in the market but a real growth opportunity as we bridge into the future with our pipeline. Teri Loxam : Thanks for the question. We'll move on to the next? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore. Omar Saad : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on KEYTRUDA and maybe start off a little broader and perhaps a bit more specific. So first on KEYTRUDA experience to-date across all the indications that you have commercially, my question is how does the duration of therapy track relative to the PFS you\u2019ve put in each of those indications. Both I'm trying to understand that for our own modeling purposes. Is it two thirds of PFS which is been the proxy you mentioned by some other companies in the past or is it similar to the PFS in for KEYTRUDA or even higher than PFS. Just wanted to understand that.  Secondly, I wanted to focus a bit more on KEYNOTE-522, the neoadjuvant, and adjuvant trial in the triple negative breast. And my question was what's the bar for a very competitive profile? And perhaps, Roger, if you could speak to the variety of PCR definitions incorporated in the secondary endpoints and whether you would sort of focused as more on one definition over the other. And perhaps, Adam, could speak to the commercial opportunity in that indication as well. Thank you. Adam Schechter : Yeah so with regard to KEYTRUDA, it's very hard to get data and you've really do need to have a quite a bit of data overtime to understand the exact duration of therapy. So I would, I'd be hesitant to give any specific numbers. We are collecting real world evidence data, we are working on various data sources to have better estimates of that. And over time, we may be able to provide more specific information on that. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : And with respect to the Neoadjuvant breasts, we are first of all, I mean, just wait and see we are very excited about the opportunities that exists for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy with KEYTRUDA across the broad range of tumor types. And I think the neoadjuvant experience is particularly instructive because of the pro-inflammatory effect of surgery in a variety of contexts. I draw your attention and you don't need your attention because you already know it very well to the I-SPY 2 data that we've got the opportunity to present previously. And the pathology of complete response results there are extremely impressive without going into any attempting any way to compare different definitions of pathologic complete response. I think there was a good understanding in breast cancer in particular about the relationship between pathologic complete response as studied a nice by two and outcomes. And that's the kind of analysis that we are using or will use in KEYNOTE-042 and with other studies going forward I'm very enthusiastic about where that could lead. Adam Schechter : And with regard to the indication, I mean as I've mentioned before, having a whole host of indications just reinforces how foundational KEYTRUDA is to overall cancer care. So every indication is important. With regard to this one, we're excited to get into the breast cancer market, but we're also starting to call this but this is already with Lynparza. So we are ready to launch with KEYTRUDA as soon as the data would be available or indication available. Teri Loxam : Okay. Thanks for the question. Move on to the next one please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Jason Gerberry : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, on we talked about U.S. KEYTRUDA alone, can you talk a little bit about in terms of regulatory and then pricing and reimbursement? When do you actually expect to see meaningful contribution from KEYTRUDA in lung ex-U.S. outside of the monotherapy, PD-L1 high group? And then my second question just on JANUVIA/JANUMET, a little bit higher than we were expecting for the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment? It seems as though oral antibiotic drugs were we're continuing to see grows to net adjustments spike and pricing pressure. But maybe it has it stabilized a little bit or are you guys just including your SGLT combo in that line? Any clarity just around have had to think about that would be helpful? Thanks. Ken Frazier : So, I'll start with a JANUVIA question. As I said before, outside of U.S. we continue to see strong growth in the innumerous offset by the pricing pressure that we see in the U.S. And as I said, the last couple years, each year is tougher than the last year, this year, there is more pricing pressure than it was last year. And I believe next year, they'll be more pricing pressure than there is this year. So I believe that that will continue. The good news is we are seeing growth outside of the U.S. and we're in the middle of launching in China, for example, where we think there is still a growth opportunity there. So what's happening is the growth outside of U.S. is offset by the U.S. pricing pressure, I'll be in the U.S. we still continue to see good volume there. With regards to KEYTRUDA outside the United States, I mean lung cancer is the majority of revenue already outside of U.S. Even though it's coming from the monotherapy, we already have most of the major markets reimbursing for lung for the monotherapy. We're waiting to be able to promote the combo and I think that will represent an additional opportunity for us outside of the U.S. moving forward. Teri Loxam : Move on to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. John Boris : Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the results. My question for Ken on at the conclusion of the last call, Ken, you mentioned that Mark was transitioning from a primary care to a specialty care business and that the three most important franchises would be certainly oncology, vaccines and Animal Health going forward. When we look at the revenue generated from those businesses. It's basically two-thirds of your revenue around the time of loss of exclusivity of JANUVIA in the U.S. And when we benchmark the incremental revenue that you're driving from those three businesses and benchmark oncology versus Roche vaccines versus GSK and Animal Health versus Zoetis, it certainly implies that operating margins expand quite substantially, especially beyond 2022. Can you provide any color on magnitude of operating margin expansion going forward, especially when the benchmark against those key players? Second question for Rob. If you look at the 35% tail of revenue, there\u2019s some old legacy assets, respiratory assets within healthcare assets and I expected assets that carry high fixed cost, most notably women\u2019s health and animal health, because you need dedicated manufacturing facilities. Any thoughts about divestitures added that tail? Thanks. Ken Frazier : So maybe I\u2019ll jump on the operating margin question and I can hit the second question. Or did you want to\u2026 Adam Schechter : So to your question what we think long-term operating margin. We\u2019re not going to give specific guidance that we have been consistent to say in general, we do believe we\u2019re going to see operating margins expand as we move forward. As a result of what you pointed out, which is if you look at the mix of businesses with oncology and vaccines relative to what you would think that was a traditional primary care infrastructure, clearly those are more efficient businesses. But I would point out, as you look at this, maybe just some in general thoughts to give context. As you think about a pure specialty, we are a little bit different and what you think of as a pure specialty type company for a couple reasons. Starting with oncology, you really have never seen a situation in oncology, like what we have right now, with KEYTRUDA because this is the first time you have a drug that is crossing so many different tumor types, so many different indications. And as a result of that, you\u2019re really dealing with the needs to promote and to sell to multiple different specialists. So the infrastructure burden for product like the KEYTRUDA probably is going to be more than what you would see for traditional oncology companies, just given that. Although still is very beneficial to where we are today.  So we are going to expand that I just would say, be cautious not to look at a pure ontology play with a more limited indication profile as a competitor. And then likewise, in vaccines. If you look at our vaccines portfolio, several the products in our vaccines portfolio and as we look forward to some of the products in our pipeline, actually, several those will not only go to specialists, but also will be marketed to the primary care doctors. So that in and of itself will mean a little bit more of a footprint. So I just want to give you a sense of that to say that while we do expect to see margins expand, it\u2019s. I think it\u2019s hard to think in terms of what a pure stuff for the company would look like.  And then with regards to the portfolio, and what we\u2019re thinking about. As Ken mentioned in his earlier comments at the beginning of the call, we are always reevaluating our portfolio. And so we are not before close to any opportunity to optimize the portfolio. If it makes sense for both the short-term and long-term, I think that\u2019s the important thing. In everything we look at. We try to measure, what is the long-term path is sustainable value creation, sustainable growth and make the decisions balancing that relative to what we see in the short-term. But to your point, as we look across diversified brands, and in particular, and products like women\u2019s health, we\u2019re always asking the question, would it be more valuable in someone else\u2019s hands, including the manufacturing assets and if we see something that makes sense from a deal perspective. We would consider it. Teri Loxam : And we\u2019re going to try to get one more and if we can. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Okay, thank you and good morning. Adam, follow up on your commentary on KEYTRUDA. You mentioned a number of future indications for growth opportunities. Could you please prioritize those in terms of which ones you think have greater commercial potential? And then a follow up on animal health, obviously very strong growth that used to be growing above the market rate. Just wondering how long you think that is sustainable. When should we expect this to I guess gets larger to return closer to the market growth rate? Thank you. Adam Schechter : Yeah so as I look at KEYTRUDA as I said. Each of these indications is important that represents value to patients the patients suffering from cancer. As I look at the size and our quarter entry and those types of things, obviously the breast cancer indication the gastric cancer indication are important to power those cellular is important to be able to compete in renal as well. And again as we look even further out the adjuvant stage cancer are very exciting opportunities for us. Ken Frazier : And then with your question to animal health. You are right, as you look at the quarter, we have very strong growth in the quarter and if you look back over the last couple of years we've been consistently outpacing the markets animal health market in our growth. And as Tim mentioned earlier, this is largely due to the fact that we have both a robust in line portfolio products but also we're having meaningful new product launches across vaccines across in animals. So it really is a story of innovation that is driving the above market growth. And as we look forward. We expect we're not going to give specific guidance but I would say as we look forward over the next several years I would expect to continue to see above market growth on the basis of the new products as well as the strength of them on products we have which really ties to the whole nature of the innovation story and the innovation synergies that Ken mentioned earlier. Ken Frazier : Okay. Thank you all for participating in today's call. I want to reiterate that we are focused on commercial execution and continuing to advance our portfolio. I'm very optimistic about the rest of the year and our long term outlook. And I want to thank you and have a good day. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck's Third Quarter 2018 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam, SVP, Investor Relations and Global Communications. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Adam Schechter, President of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Finally, in an effort to further improve our communications and transparency, we have posted a presentation to the investor section of Merck.com. This includes some of our highlights from this quarter and we will \u2013 throughout this morning's discussion, we will reference certain slides of the presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. The strong performance of our business demonstrates that our innovation strategy is working, and that Merck is on the right track to deliver sustainable value to shareholders and patients. In addition to delivering solid results in the third quarter, we also continued to advance our pipeline with exciting new data readouts and milestones. While there are many aspects of the business to highlight this quarter, I would like to turn first to KEYTRUDA's performance. This drug continues to lead the I-O field with the breadth and depth of indications across multiple tumor types. We've executed well both in the clinic and commercially. And we are seeing firsthand how KEYTRUDA is making a tremendous difference to cancer patients around the world. We are very confident in KEYTRUDA's near- and long-term growth prospects, as we continue to launch existing indications and look towards future approvals. We believe that our approach of following the science throughout KEYTRUDA's development has and will continue to successfully differentiate the medicine as a foundational cancer treatment. We are also encouraged by LYNPARZA and LENVIMA, both targets of our strategic business development, as well as our other oncology assets in the pipeline that position us to further expand our leadership in oncology. Beyond oncology, Merck has the strongest vaccine portfolio in our company's history, led by GARDASIL, which continues to experience healthy demand and growth. The Hospital and Specialty business is performing well. And our Animal Health business is an industry leader. We have great momentum as we close out the year and prepare for 2019, given our existing portfolio and pipeline. And we are confident about our long-term outlook. As a reflection of our confidence in our future growth prospects, today we announced a dividend increase, along with an accelerated share repurchase program, which Rob will talk about in more detail in a moment. These actions are driven by our commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy and supported by our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation that provide us the flexibility to return cash to shareholders, while also investing in our pipeline, innovation, and growth. Even with these actions, we continue to have ample capacity for business development, which remains a major priority. Looking ahead, we are confident in the strength of our business. We believe that our well-balanced portfolio will continue to drive sustainable growth and value creation. Along with the rest of Merck's world-class team of scientists and employees, I'm excited to build on our strong performance, as we achieve our objective of delivering innovative and urgently needed medicines and vaccines to serve the critical needs of patients, while enhancing shareholder value. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis, to provide more detail on the quarter. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please note that my comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis. In the third quarter, we delivered both top and bottom line growth, and we are well-positioned to finish the year strong. Total company revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exchange, third quarter revenues grew 6%. Our Human Health business grew 7%, excluding exchange. And Adam will provide more color on those results in a moment. Animal Health sales totaled $1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2%. And excluding the impact of exchange, sales grew 6%, with Companion Animal growing 7% and Livestock growing 5%. We continue to see strong demand for our products. However, this quarter's revenue growth rate was unfavorably impacted by timing of purchases, as well as a shorter flea and tick season. Animal Health segment profits were $409 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5% compared to prior year. Turning to the expense lines. Gross margin was 76.7% in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points versus the third quarter of 2017, with the increase primarily driven by favorable effects of exchange. Recall, manufacturing variances related to the cyber-attack negatively impacted gross margins in the third quarter of 2017. Operating expenses of $4.5 billion increased 6% year-over-year, including a favorable 2 percentage point impact from exchange. The increase was driven by R&D, which was comprised of higher oncology clinical spend, investments in discovery and early development, as well as licensing costs. Our tax rate of 18.9% for the quarter was roughly flat year-over-year. Taken together, we earned $1.19 per share, an increase of 8%, excluding exchange. Turning to the outlook for the year. We are now narrowing our revenue guidance range and narrowing and raising our EPS guidance range for 2018, reflecting our strong operational performance throughout the year. For the full year, we now expect revenues to be between $42.1 billion and $42.7 billion, including a minimal impact from foreign exchange at mid-October rates. We now expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. We now expect EPS to be between $4.30 and $4.36, including a roughly 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-October rates. All other aspects of our guidance provided on our second quarter call remain the same. A summary of our guidance can be found on slide 7 of our earnings presentation. Before concluding, let me spend a few moments speaking about our capital allocation strategy, through which we are able to deliver for our patients, grow the business and ultimately create meaningful shareholder value. As Ken mentioned, we are committed to maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation, which you can see on slide 8. Our first priority continues to be to appropriately invest in R&D and support our key brands and launches in order to drive value creation. As we stated, funding opportunities in our portfolio that grow revenue remains our primary focus. Consistent with this focus, we also see significant opportunities to drive growth from increased market demand. And we will continue to allocate resources to position ourselves for success. We now plan to spend roughly $16 billion on capital projects through 2022. This is up from our prior estimate of $12 billion that we announced in February. Our primary focus through these projects is to increase manufacturing capacity across our key businesses, including Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health, where demand continues to be higher than originally projected, as well as to invest in our discovery and development operations and IT infrastructure. We also continue to prioritize value-creating business development opportunities. We believe building a best-in-class pipeline will ultimately generate long-term growth and value for shareholders. With our strong balance sheet, we have the financial flexibility to pursue all forms of business development, including acquisitions, partnerships and collaboration. We will continue to actively look at and evaluate those opportunities to create the strongest portfolio and pipeline. While our primary objective is to fund the business, we have a strong track record of returning meaningful cash to our shareholders. Over the past year, we've returned approximately $10 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Given the increasingly strong confidence we have in our pipeline, long-term revenue growth, cash flow projections and overall balance sheet strength, we've decided to grow our dividend above historical levels and increase our share repurchases. Today, we announced that we will increase our quarterly dividend by 15% or by $0.07 to $0.55 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, the board has approved an additional $10 billion share repurchase authorization; giving us approximately $18 billion in share repurchase capacity. As a first step, we entered into a $5 billion ASR, with the remainder providing us the opportunity to flex our regular share repurchase program over the next two-plus years. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we're able to return this cash to shareholders today, while retaining the ability to execute on any value-creating business development opportunities that further our growth strategy. We believe we have the ability to drive significant additional value to shareholders over the long term. And these actions are a reflection of that confidence. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Adam to provide more detail on our Human Health business. Adam? Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide highlights on the performance of Global Human Health for the third quarter of 2018. My comments will be on a constant currency basis. We continued to execute very well both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets. Sales this quarter grew 7% to $9.7 billion, driven by the strong performance of key products in our Oncology, Vaccines, and Hospital and Specialty franchises. We have overcome loss of exclusivity and competitive pressures on certain significant products. And we are optimistic about our future revenue growth prospects. I'll now focus on key franchises starting with Oncology. With nearly $1.9 billion in sales this quarter, KEYTRUDA's performance after four years on the market is unprecedented not only in the field of oncology, but also in the pharmaceutical industry more broadly. KEYTRUDA is now the leading I-O therapy in the U.S. in both new patient starts and total patient volumes and has become a foundational oncology treatment. Five applications are now on file with the FDA, and numerous registration enabling readouts are expected over the next 18 months. We look forward to launching additional indications and tumor types, such as renal cell carcinoma, where last week we announced strong trial results. Our clinical results have demonstrated KEYTRUDA's benefit across a wide range of cancers. And our vast global regulatory and commercial capabilities have enabled us to rapidly bring this therapy to patients around the world. KEYTRUDA's growth this quarter was driven by higher use in first-line nonsquamous non-small [cell] lung cancer patients, those whose tumors do not express EGFR or ALK. In the U.S., the robust survival benefit seen in KEYNOTE-189 is convincing more and more physicians of the benefits of using KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy across all of the newly diagnosed patients, including patients whose tumors express low levels of PD-L1 or non-expressers. We see continued growth of KEYTRUDA in this setting, as we further establish the benefits of the combination in the community setting. Additionally, beyond lung, we see strong usage in our other proved indications and have leadership positions in head and neck, bladder, and MSI-High cancers. Merck's extensive global presence is helping to drive strong growth of KEYTRUDA in ex-U.S. markets. Use in first-line lung continues to increase, driven by further uptake of our monotherapy indication following reimbursement approvals. In Europe, lung now represents a majority of our KEYTRUDA sales in all major markets. We received European approval in early September for the chemo combo and believe that our addressable market of first-line nonsquamous metastatic lung cancer patients in Europe has now tripled. Use of the chemo combo began immediately upon approval, as some large markets, such as Germany, have already begun reimbursing. And reimbursement discussions are beginning in other major markets as well. Beyond KEYTRUDA, the strong growth in sales of LYNPARZA and LENVIMA add to our confidence in the potential of both of these oncology therapies to be meaningful contributors to Merck's revenue growth. LYNPARZA leads the PARP inhibitor class in both new and total prescriptions. U.S. sales grew significantly, driven by growth in ovarian cancer as well as uptake from breast cancer. We are also excited by the first-line maintenance opportunity in BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, given the very impressive SOLO-1 data presented this past weekend. And we look forward to the potential approval of this important indication. Separately, we're making great progress in building our partnership with Eisai for LENVIMA, which continued to grow strongly. Following hepatocellular cancer approval in Japan earlier this year, we have seen rapid adoption of LENVIMA in that indication. Additionally, the recent hepatocellular approvals in the U.S. and Europe add to the existing indications in differentiated thyroid and renal cell carcinoma. Now moving to Vaccines. Global Vaccine sales were nearly $2.2 billion this quarter, up 13% from a year ago. GARDASIL achieved over $1 billion in sales, reflecting strong demand worldwide. The China launch has been very successful and is a meaningful contributor to ex-U.S. growth. GARDASIL is increasingly viewed as an anti-cancer vaccine for certain HPV-related cancers. Countries like Australia have increased vaccination rates to levels that could potentially help obtain the goal of cervical cancer elimination, driving demand and awareness as well as serving as a model for others. In the United States, demand remains strong. And the recent expansion in our proved H cohort to include men and women up to age of 45 represents an exciting opportunity. We believe that GARDASIL has a very long run rate of growth ahead. Moving to our diabetes franchise. Our diabetes franchise continues to be relatively stable with global sales of nearly $1.5 billion, about equal to year ago levels. Increased demand in ex-U.S. markets was offset by pricing pressure in the U.S. Finally, our overall Hospital and Specialty business performed well, led by BRIDION, which again grew strongly this quarter. ZERBAXA is also growing with exciting future potential, given the recent Phase 3 success in hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia. In the HIV space, we launched doravirine in August and believe it represents an opportunity for patients looking for alternative NNRTI therapies and a great bridge to our exciting HIV pipeline. In summary, our Global Human Health business is very strong. And we remain confident in our growth prospects due to the solid performance in our Oncology, Vaccines, and Hospital/Specialty franchises. We believe we are very well positioned and look forward to the future with great optimism. With that, I'll turn over the call to Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Adam. Well, as summarized on slide 10 of our presentation, the third quarter saw very important regulatory activity for KEYTRUDA, including the approval in Europe for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with platinum-based therapy and Alimta, reflecting the integrated results of the KEYNOTE-021C, -021G, and -189 studies. The KEYNOTE-189 results were also incorporated in the revised label for KEYTRUDA in the United States. As previously announced, KEYTRUDA was also approved in China for the treatment of advanced melanoma, the first such approval in China for a PD-1 directed therapy. Slide 11 provides a summary of important regulatory and clinical catalysts. KEYTRUDA is under regulatory review in the United States for the first-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in combination with appropriate chemotherapy, based on the KEYNOTE-407 results. For the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, based on the KEYNOTE-224 trial, for the first-line treatment of Merkel Cell carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-017, as monotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer in an expanded population of patients with PD-L1 expression in at least 1% of tumor cells, based on KEYNOTE-042, and for the adjuvant treatment of cutaneous melanoma, following definitive surgical excision based on KEYNOTE-054. The European [Medicines Agency] Committee on Human Medicinal Products have adopted a positive opinion for this adjuvant melanoma indication last week. And many of the other indications are under review in Europe and in other jurisdictions. We've also made substantial progress in identifying new tumor settings, where KEYTRUDA can be used to advantage. At the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this week, Dr. Barbara Burtness of Yale University School of Medicine reported the results with the KEYNOTE-048 study, which addressed the first-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with KEYTRUDA, given either as monotherapy or in combination with platinum-based therapy in 5-fluorouracil. This study included an active comparator, the EXTREME regimen, which includes cetuximab as the platinum-based chemotherapy in 5-fluorouracil. And this is the standard of care for this disease in many areas. And employed a comprehensive statistical analysis plan to control Type I error. The improvement in overall survival seen with KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expressing tumors, as judged by a combined proportion score, with a hazard ratio of 0.61 in the CPS 20 or greater population. And the improvement in overall survival seen when KEYTRUDA was administered with chemotherapy hazard ratio of 0.77 in all patients as compared with the EXTREME regimen suggests that KEYTRUDA has the potential to become the new standard of care in the first-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. As a result, we intend to incorporate previously-filed data from our second-line head and neck cancer study, KEYNOTE-040, in the U.S. filing for KEYNOTE-048. In Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the use of KEYTRUDA as second-line therapy in appropriate patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, based on the KEYNOTE-040 data. And hence we will submit a separate file containing the new KEYNOTE-048 data. Meanwhile, important new data continued to emerge as shown on slide 11. The ESMO meeting, we presented the results of our Phase 2 KEYNOTE-057 study, which showed that more than 40% of patients with persistent or recurrent non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer achieved a complete response following KEYTRUDA monotherapy. And just last week, we announced the results of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-426 study, in which the combination of KEYTRUDA plus axitinib, marketed by Pfizer as Inlyta, improved overall survival, progression-free survival, and the overall response rate in the first-line treatment of locally-advanced or refractory renal cell carcinoma as compared with sunitinib. These data will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. And we intend to seek regulatory approval for this first-line indication around the world. Beyond KEYTRUDA, our Oncology programs are advancing in important ways that are also shown on slides 10 and 11. At the ESMO meeting, we joined our colleagues from AstraZeneca in presenting the results of SOLO-1, a study addressing the maintenance use of LYNPARZA in patients with newly diagnosed BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, who were in complete or partial remission following treatment with platinum-based regimens. In SOLO-1, LYNPARZA reduced the risk of disease progression or death compared with placebo by an astonishing 70%, such that at the three-year time point, 60.4% of women receiving LYNPARZA remained progression-free, compared to just 26.9% of women receiving standard-of-care placebo. Numerous future studies will address expanding opportunities for LYNPARZA in breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. And we eagerly await data from combination studies of LYNPARZA with KEYTRUDA, which will emerge in the near future. During the third quarter, our partnership with Eisai led to the approval of LENVIMA for the first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States, the European Union, and in China. We also received breakthrough designation from the FDA for the combination of LENVIMA with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of advanced or metastatic microsatellite stable endometrial carcinoma. LENVIMA is a very attractive partner for KEYTRUDA across a broad range of malignancies. As an example, our KEYNOTE-581 trial, exploring the combination of KEYTRUDA with LENVIMA in the first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma, is well under way. At the ESMO meeting, we also had the opportunity to highlight some newer programs in our oncology portfolio, including MK-1454, our STING agonist for intratumoral injection; and MK-1308, the CTLA-4 directed checkpoint inhibitor. Both drugs would be developed in combination with KEYTRUDA. And indeed, in light of the positive impact of KEYTRUDA across a broad range of tumor types, we anticipate that most of our new programs will seek in the first instance to expand the impact of KEYTRUDA still further. Our teams are also active in other therapeutic areas. During the third quarter, we gained FDA approval for PIFELTRO, our second generation non-nucleosidal protease inhibitor for the control of HIV infection, which was also approved in combination with lamivudine and tenofovir under the brand name DELSTRIGO. The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use also adopted a positive opinion for PIFELTRO and DELSTRIGO in September, meaning that marketing authorization can be expected in late-November. We're also studying PIFELTRO in combination with MK-8591, our first-in-class nucleoside derivative that durably blocks reverse transcriptase translocation, as well as polymerase activity. Data from this Phase 2 study will become available towards the end of this year. Our anti-microbial efforts include ZERBAXA, for which we reported positive results from our large Phase 3 study in patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia using an investigational dose. These data will be submitted to regulatory agencies in the near future, as will data supporting our new beta-lactamase inhibitor, relebactam, which we have shown to improve clinical responses to imipenem in patients infected with carbapenemase expressing bacteria. Also in the infectious disease arena, the FDA granted approval for GARDASIL 9 in women and men ages 27 to 45 as a means to reduce the incidence of certain HPV-related malignancies and dysplastic syndrome. We continue to see high interest around the world in developing strategies with the goal of broader control or even elimination of HPV infection. We have many other important vaccine initiatives under way including V114, our 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently under investigation in Phase 3 trials; and V160, our novel vaccine for the prevention of primary CMV infection in healthy seronegative women, which is currently being evaluated in a large Phase 2 study. More broadly, as shown on slide 12, we have a large set of late-stage clinical assets in cardiometabolic disease and neuroscience, for which data will become available in the relatively near future. I'll now turn the call back over to Teri. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll be getting started with questions. Before we do, I just wanted to remind everyone to please keep your questions to one or two maximum, so that we can get to as many people as possible. So, Darla, let's start off the Q&A portion, please? Operator : And your first question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the question. So and my first one is just a broader question for Ken. There was obviously the announcement recently that you won't be retiring at the end of next year. And I'm just curious how we should think about how that might impact your views on the longer term outlook for Merck or the company's strategy as we think about business development? Or a lot of questions around Animal Health and how you guys see that business in your company. Does the fact that you're staying on longer as a CEO impact how you guys are thinking about maybe doing something more transformational from a strategic perspective? And then, the second one is a more specific question for Roger. And it's just around your STING asset you presented data (28:27) for last weekend. Just curious how you think about \u2013 I think in the data we saw the monotherapy impact was more limited than I was expecting. So how do you think about the need for monotherapy impact before moving forward with a combination approach, whether it's for STING or some of the other approaches you have in your pipeline? Thanks so much. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Vamil, for the questions. Let me start by talking about whether or not my extended tenure will affect how I think about transformational deals one way or the other. So our responsibility, as a management, team is to continue to focus on the best opportunities to put together the best portfolio to drive sustainable value. That remains our focus. While we remain disciplined in our approach, we're also committed to identifying and acquiring assets that will create sustainable value. And as we've said in our comments earlier today, we have the capacity to do deals of all sizes and all types. The question is, are they the right deals for Merck? And that's what our management team debates. That's what we discuss. That's what our board debates and discusses. So to answer your question, no, I don't believe the fact that I'm expected to stay a little bit longer is going to change the fundamental analysis of all of these people about what makes sense from a sustainable value creation standpoint. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. And, Vamil, it's Roger. On MK-1454, the STING agonist that we presented at ESMO, I think it's important to remember that this was our first opportunity to describe this molecule. It's in the manner of a birth announcement. Birth announcements are important because they speak the potential. But the important thing to recognize is that 1454 can be given intratumorally effectively. It stimulates inflammation. That was clear. And if you looked at the pattern of tumor response, the injected tumors had more response than the abscopal effect in combination with KEYTRUDA, which suggests that there's something going on there besides just KEYTRUDA itself. But, boy, it's early days, so we have very few patients. And as I indicated, we see these kinds of therapies as being adjunctive. What we're seeking to do is to improve still further the response to KEYTRUDA. So, so far so good. Let's see how we do. And we're enthusiastic about these kinds of approaches, not just 1454, but other inflammatory mediators, including oncolytic viruses, including TLR agonists and other things that we are studying in this setting. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for the questions, and also appreciate the additional color you guys are providing in the slide deck. So I just had a couple of questions here. Maybe first, first-line renal. Just would be interested in your perspective with some data at ESMO, and obviously your data pending, how you see the PD-1/PKI combos fitting into the treatment landscape, particularly relative to OPDIVO/YERVOY? Second question I had was on KEYTRUDA in first-line lung in Europe. I know you've got a recommendation there. But can you just elaborate a bit more in terms of where we stand today in terms of penetration? And how quickly you are expecting a ramp, given the positive recommendation on KEYNOTE-189, as we think about the rest of this year and into 2019? And if I can slip a third really quick one in there. Could we just get an update on KEYTRUDA usage by tumor type in U.S. and ex-U.S. as you've done in the past? Thanks so much. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: So, Chris, this is Roger. Let me try the renal first. And then Adam can take on the other issues. With respect to first-line renal, of course we haven't presented the KEYNOTE-426 data. We announced top line results. And it's important to recognize that those top line results came from the first interim analysis, where KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib met its endpoints in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival both, as well as the key secondary endpoint of response rate. Those are important results at this first interim. And they speak to the power of the combination. Obviously what people are going to be interested in is, how much treatment effect is there and at what level are there adverse effects? In this setting, in renal cell carcinoma, as is typical, efficacy is extremely important. And I think people are going to be very, very interested therefore in looking at the efficacy results, the overall survival results that we've obtained with this combination. Suffice it to say that we're enthusiastic about it. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Chris. This is Adam. Let me start by giving you the percent breakout by tumor type. And I've always provided this for the U.S. and outside the U.S. The caveat is, it's very hard to get data. And it does differ by country. But in the U.S., if you look at non-small-cell lung cancer, it's about 65%; about 10% melanoma; 5% head and neck; 5% bladder; 5% MSI-High; and then about 10% all other indications. When you look at Europe, and lung, as you know, we've been launching the monotherapy for patients who have PD-L1 greater than 50, and we're making significant in-roads. And as I said, now in the major European markets, lung is the largest tumor type versus all the other tumor types. So we are seeing significant growth there. With the combo, that will triple the size of the eligible market. So obviously that's going to be a much bigger market for us. But as I've always said, when it comes to first-line lung, ramp-up is slower, because you're not getting a lot of patients that have been treated before, failed, and come in in a bolus. It's as each person comes in, is diagnosed, that the chemo combo will be considered. Also in countries like Germany where you have reimbursement right away, you'll start to see sales come in quickly. But in other markets, we're working on reimbursement to get that as soon as possible. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, Adam. Darla, we'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just a couple for you, Ken. I noticed that at a recent competitive conference, you characterized margin expansion potential as being meaningful. And I think that's the first time you've actually used the word meaningful. Can you just elaborate a bit on what you mean by that? And if at any point in time you would expect the company to provide a line in the sand in terms of where you see that going? And second question, you won't be at all surprised I'm asking. But while we recognize and you've been very clear that Animal Health is a strong pillar for Merck's growth and diversification, based on the math that we done \u2013 we have done, we see an approximate $12 per share upside if the market were to value your Animal Health business in line with Zoetis and Elanco, both of which have obviously been hugely successful. If you don't consider spinning this business, which it sounds like you're not, what steps can you take to highlight its value? And what conditions are you looking for in order to consider changing your mind? Or should we expect that Animal Health will be part of Merck indefinitely? Thanks. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: So the thing I would say about this, Jami, is that, first of all, we actively evaluate our portfolio on an ongoing basis. So you shouldn't expect that any decision that we are making today will necessarily be the decision that we make forever. But we are actively evaluating our portfolio to decide what we think makes sense in terms of our overall strategy of driving sustainable value and growth for our shareholders. I also want you to know that we do pay attention to what happens on the outside world. In fact, we share the market's excitement around Animal Health's value as a sector and our business in particular. In fact, we believe that we've run this business very well inside the company, compared to its competitors. So if you look at our business, it's a global leader. We continue to view it as one that we can be a good owner of. When you look at it, it has industry-leading growth in margins. And so as we think about it, again, coming back to what I said at the beginning, we have to actively review our portfolio, looking at multiple factors, including market development, to decide whether or not a particular asset, not just Animal Health, should remain in our portfolio. And we'll continue to do that on an ongoing basis. With respect to the issue around margin expansion, we did say that we expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time. We see the growth of certain parts of our business like Oncology as being very helpful to driving that kind of margin expansion. But as it relates to being more specific and putting numbers around that and time periods, at this time, we don't know that that's the right thing for us to do. We will continue to give guidance in the way that we normally do it on an annual basis. But I don't really think it makes sense for us today, as we're seeing this business grow and expand, for us to try to say a specific number in terms of what the margin expansion will be. What I can tell you is that we will continue to work very hard to drive that margin expansion. At the same time, making the right kinds of investments that we need to make to drive our growth over the next few years. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks. Darla, let's move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you very much. Ken, given your demonstrated confidence in your long-term growth prospects now, why do you still see business development as a priority? I appreciate that you have the capacity. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. So is business development a key? Are you looking at it as a priority because of risk management reasons, given your KEYTRUDA exposure? Or is something else driving this? And if I could, a follow up for Roger. Just wondering about your updated CTLA-4 data. Some interesting activity. Seems to have better safety than what we're seeing with the YERVOY combination. But just as this field evolves and as you get more information from CheckMate-227 and other competitive agents, I'm just wondering where your CTLA-4 ranks as a priority for you. Thank you. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: So on business development, let me start by saying that we're pleased with the way in which our business is growing now, particularly in the Oncology field. But that doesn't make us comfortable. At the end of the day, we know that we have to continue to build our portfolio and build on our pipeline. And that's why it's an important priority for us going forward. Going back to the question that was asked a few questions ago, that's the situation that we face as a company. Our pipeline is never going to be strong enough. We can always add to our pipeline. And that's not just a question of de-risking, it's a question of driving our future growth. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah, and, Alex, on MK-1308, you're right. I mean, our molecule looks pretty good. I mean, we've worked quite hard to select a CTLA-4 directed molecule and to try and establish what the appropriate dose and schedule would be for such a molecule. And we are interested in the question. Not sure why, but the combination looks a little promising. And so we think that there may be a possibility for it. We're sort of still stepping through it. Haven't made explicit decisions. But it looks like there may be an opportunity there. We wanted to make sure that people were aware of what we were seeing. And we did present the data at ESMO for that reason. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Let's move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities : Thanks very much for the questions. So maybe the first question is really around business development. A number of times on the BD, in your prepared comments, I think about six times, you mentioned business development as a priority. So maybe, Ken, if you can just give us a little bit of an incremental sense, or perhaps Roger could opine as well, on the areas where you think adding to the pipeline and really targeting the timeframe, the sort of post-JANUVIA timeframe, as a key opportunity. Yeah. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: So I \u2013 let me just \u2013 oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go ahead and finish. I'm sorry. Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities : No. That's okay. I'll follow up with my second question after you go. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: No, I think you should go ahead and ask it, so that way we can have them all. Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities : Okay. Then you can proceed. So and then maybe, Roger, just two quick questions for you. Maybe you can just give us a sense of, in the wake of the first-line kidney cancer result as you've seen it, do you see a meaningful opportunity to improve upon the data with other TKIs like LENVIMA in the same setting? And then just my last question. The KEYNOTE-522 study, we're on the cusp of it. Maybe you could just help us understand the opportunity in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant TNBC setting. Thanks so much. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Seamus, and I apologize for interrupting. So with respect to business development, it remains an important priority for us, because it's our job to find the best scientific innovations that will enhance our pipeline. We think building a best-in-class pipeline is ultimately what generates long-term growth and value for shareholders. And that's what we intend to do. And let me turn it over to Roger now. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Right. Well, I mean, if I could, on the business development side, I think everybody recognizes that for any pharmaceutical company at our scale, it will always be the case that business development contributes materially to our pipeline. It must be the case. And typically something over a majority of the molecules that we develop are licensed in from the outside or acquired in some way. If we can acquire those in a way which also adds meaningful revenue right from the beginning, terrific. But we're fundamentally interested in the best science, the best opportunities that could have the biggest impact on patient care. I think that should be clear. With respect to first-line renal, I don't want to pre-judge any data that we would see from other combinations. We've had data that we presented previously and discussed after ASCO of the combination of KEYTRUDA with axitinib and with lenvatinib. And those data are both \u2013 both datasets were extremely interesting. We're charging ahead in the lenvatinib story. Every single one of the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors will have slightly different characteristics. And I don't think there's any way to predict exactly what those are going to look like. But certainly the success of LENVIMA in the hepatocellular arena is very promising. And of course the work that we've done in endometrial as well. So we're enthusiastic about those combinations. And lastly, you're right. KEYNOTE-522 is getting close to the point where there would be a DMC review. We are expecting that that will happen this quarter, fourth quarter. And in principle, I mean, it's very hard to predict what those data will look like. But in principle, anything that can add \u2013 improve responses in the triple negative breast cancer population obviously would be extremely welcome. A very aggressive disease, a concerning disease, and so we're looking forward to seeing those data. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, Roger. Let's move on to the next question. Operator : It's from Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. So a couple of questions for \u2013 well, one for Roger and then a couple for Adam. So you recently \u2013 Merck published a paper in the JCO [Journal of Clinical Oncology] commenting on inflammatory signatures in TMB as biomarkers for responsiveness. In light of the recent disclosure from CheckMate-227 around TMB as a predictive factor for overall survival, how does that influence how you're thinking about the future role of TMB in various combinations within your own studies? Second, for Adam. Ken has referenced business development as being critical part of Merck's focus. Obviously, the reimbursement outlook in the U.S. is very dynamic. The President's going to address, what looks like, Part B this afternoon. I'm interested how you think about that dynamism and valuation in light of business development? And where you're leaning in terms of where you see the most risk from proposed and potentially enacted reform? And then, finally, just a couple of quick comments on the future expansion of GARDASIL that you alluded to, both from China, but also from vaccination of males throughout Europe and the timelines for that? Thank you. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: All right. Let's start with Roger. Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: So, yeah, Andrew, thanks for the question. With respect to TMB, I have to say I'm not much influenced by reports from a single study like CheckMate-227, where there was relatively modest ascertainment. We didn't have a lot of information from patients and patient subsets. We've done quite large studies on TMB, comparing TMB to inflammatory signature. The JCO paper you referenced is one of those. There's quite a large series coming out in the Frontline journal very soon that describes a more comprehensive analysis. You and I could talk about the underlying science here. It's quite interesting. I think that the question of how it is that mutation influences response rate, which it clearly does, is important to understand. People jump to the conclusion that that's neoepitopes and improved immune response; not so clear for a whole variety of reasons. And, nevertheless, it's something that's very important to study and to understand in depth. And we continue to do that. We do not see tumor mutational burden as a test that could be implemented in any near term as a way of selecting patients who would be appropriate to treat with KEYTRUDA monotherapy, for example. And as we know, in the combination therapy setting, the utility of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy is quite broad. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Go to Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Andrew, with regard to business development in the U.S. specifically, obviously the U.S. remains extremely important as we think about the future. And I believe that when we find products that make a significant difference in the world, and those that there's nothing that competes in new areas, that the U.S. will continue to have good reimbursement for those types of products. I would not want to be a late-entry, non-differentiator product. And I wouldn't want to necessarily be a new mechanism that doesn't give significant additional benefit. So when we're looking at business development, we're looking for real breakthroughs that can increase the health of large numbers of patients. With regard to GARDASIL, we're seeing growth, very strong on a global basis. And if you look, we sold just over $1 billion. A lot of that was due to demand, but it's also from the CDC stockpile borrowing. The thing with Vaccines is it's very lumpy and you have to be careful looking at any one quarter. But if you look over time, we believe GARDASIL represents a very significant growth opportunity. If you look at the new indication in the United States, that's a big additional cohort. But also if you look at China and even in Europe, where we've taken back GARDASIL from the joint venture last year, we're seeing real big growth opportunities there. And then, lastly, I'd say other countries are looking at what Australia has done and they're already beginning to think about whether or not to implement those types of programs. So we see a real long runway of growth for GARDASIL over time. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Adam. We'll move on to the next question, please, Darla. Operator : It's from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Timothy Minton Anderson - Wolfe Research, LLC: Thank you. A few questions. You talked about spending more on capital projects, with part of that going towards manufacturing. One of those products is KEYTRUDA, though there is GARDASIL. And my question is, whether as you look forward over the next couple of years is there the chance that demand will outstrip supply? I know with Vaccines, for example, manufacturing can be very tricky. So is there any sort of risk we should anticipate in terms of sales kind of being capped until manufacturing is fully up and running? And then, going back to GARDASIL, you guys seem to be flagging that that could be an under-appreciated opportunity. So you just touched on this I think in your last comment. But can you just talk about where you are with health authorities and payers in the various markets in terms of a broad embrace on vaccinating both boys and girls as a way of preventing different cancers? And if that product this year is going to sell $3 billion, is it unrealistic to think that over time it could do something like double in size? I'm trying to quantify what you think is the opportunity that you guys keep highlighting. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Let's start with Rob on the CapEx. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Morning, Tim. Thanks for the question. So if you look at where our capacity is expanding, you are correct; it is around Vaccines, GARDASIL in particular, but frankly our broader Vaccines portfolio, KEYTRUDA and Animal Health. So it is really spread across all of the key growth areas of the company. And it's important to point out, and I'll let Adam speak specifically to what we see as the long-term demand in the marketplace. But as we look at the supply we've been able to bring to the market, we have meaningfully increased our GARDASIL supply over the last several years, including coming into this year. As we look forward, we also have the ability to continue to increase supply on a meaningful basis going forward. So we are making the necessary investments to ensure we can drive growth in this product and are very confident in that fact. And I'll turn it over to Adam to maybe give some specifics beyond that. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Rob; and, hi, Tim. Yeah. So we really are seeing unprecedented increase in worldwide demand for the HPV vaccines. And it's doubled in the last year alone in terms of demand necessarily. A lot of the increase in demand is driven by the policy change for Gavi countries. And many countries are moving from demonstration programs to multi-age cohorts. So as Rob said, we are really working hard to increase the global supply of the HPV vaccines and it's a top priority for us. And we have plans in place to really significantly increase the global supply from our 2017 base, as we look over the next three years. And I do think the demand is going to really continue to grow, so we're going to need that supply. As you look around the world, different countries are putting in place different mechanisms to ensure vaccination. So if you look at Brazil, you have a very different profile than say a country like France. So it's hard to give generalizations. But I would say the highest level is that people are really beginning to understand the importance of vaccinating both men and women for the approved cohorts in the countries in which we're launched. And the demand will continue to grow. And after nine years in the market to see the growth that we're seeing is really unprecedented. And I believe that that growth will continue to be very, very strong. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We'll move on to the next question. Operator : It's from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I had three if I may. First, we're seeing some proposals come out of Trump administration, not formally proposed. But KEYTRUDA and the other I-Os are being proposed as some of the top Part B priorities, where they're seeing a price disconnect between U.S. and ex-U.S. So I'm just curious how you guys see this play out? One. And secondly, Ken, for you on margins. I guess the question really is, when investors hear you speak about margin expansion, there's this assumption that perhaps what it's implying is a margin expansion that may be beyond what's in consensus already. Because consensus has it going up 500 bps, 600 bps from current levels. I'm not sure how much granular you want to get there. But just wanted to get your temperature on that in general. And then finally, Roger, we noticed for your upcoming neoadjuvant triple negative breast trial, the powering was increased by 35% a few months ago. Just wanted to get some color around the thought process behind that decision? Thank you. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: So let me start with the pricing question. So let me start by saying, I think right now there's a lot that's being talked about in Washington. But we really need to see further details to better understand how all this is expected to be implemented. What we do agree with is that we need to find ways of getting patients more meaningful access to these Part B drugs. But at the end of the day, while we're open to that, we would be opposed to anything that would actually create a problem from the standpoint of patient access or innovation. But again, it's really early to try to comment on some of the things. I know the President will be speaking this afternoon. And we'll just have to continue to interact with the administration and Congress on those issues. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. Rob, maybe you can take the margin expansion? Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. No. Umer, thanks for the question. I don't want to comment specifically on how we look relative to consensus. I think the key message here that we want to make sure people understand is that we do expect to see meaningful margin expansion due to the mix of the business and our ability to continue to drive leverage through a productive use of our investments to drive faster top-line growth over time. So really, that's the message. How that compares to consensus, we're not going to comment. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: And, Roger, you want to finish up? Roger M. Perlmutter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah, Umer, on KEYNOTE-522, you know I'm a huge believer in adequately powering studies. I really am. And Roy [Baynes] and I spend a lot of time thinking through the issue of how to ensure that the results that we'll get from a study will be as definitive as possible. The important point to recognize and sort of \u2013 I know you know this. But we don't see data that results in our change in the study. The study is going on. And we don't know what the results are. But what we do is we simply look at everything that we've learned from everything that everyone is doing and ask questions about how we should improve the way in which the study proceeds. And so we'll see where we get to. We're not always going to do it exactly right, but we do the best we can. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Great. We're going to try to get a couple more in here. Darla, next question. Operator : It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I will follow the instructions from Teri very closely, unlike some of my competitors. So my two questions are, number one, could you please provide the percentages of U.S. sales that Merck generates from Medicare, including Medicare Part B? And second, could you talk a little bit more about Animal Health growth? It was 6%, which is solid organically. But I just don't have a sense for what we should expect going forward in that business. I think there was some moderation in the organic growth. And if you could give us a sense for how we should think about future organic growth prospects, that would be great. Thank you. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: We'll start with Adam. Adam H. Schechter - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, David, thanks for the question. We don't really break out segment growth. And the reason why is because if you look at our portfolio, it's changing every quarter and growth is coming from different areas, some of which are much bigger in Medicaid than Medicare. And we don't \u2013 it's very hard, because a lot of the data you also get is retroactive versus where you are today. But in general, you know that KEYTRUDA is reimbursed through Part B. You can tell that Vaccines are reimbursed differently. And I think as we go forward, obviously Oncology is going to play a much bigger role for us. Robert M. Davis - Merck & Co., Inc.: Yeah. And to your question about Animal Health, as I commented in the prepared remarks, I wouldn't look at what you see as the \u2013 what could appear to be the slower growth in the quarter as any indication of what's going on in the business, as I said. There really are some timing impacts. We actually had some customer purchases in the Companion Animal space that positively impacted the second quarter. It was a buy ahead of a price increase. That is affecting the comps. If you adjusted for that in the third quarter, you'd actually see Animal Health growth very much in line, where it's been consistently. And as we look longer term, as we said in the past, we see this business driven by our innovative pipeline, which comes from the synergies we get with our Human Health business, to continue to drive strong, above-market growth for this business over the long term. So that hasn't changed. And our confidence in this growth profile continues to be very strong. Teri Loxam - Merck & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Rob. And unfortunately, I think we're going to have to close the questions there. Dave, I really appreciate you listening to the instructions. And hopefully next time we'll be able to get more questions in. I'll toss it over to Ken to close. Kenneth C. Frazier - Merck & Co., Inc.: So I want to thank you all for your continuing support and interest in Merck. We are energized by the momentum in our business right now. And we believe our portfolio of opportunity is better than it has been at any time since I've been here at Merck. We look to the future with great confidence about what we can deliver for our patients and shareholders. And we look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Todd James, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Acceleron. Please go ahead. Todd James : Thanks, and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, are available on the Investors and Media page on the corporate website at www.acceleronpharma.com. Joining me for the call today are Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer; Robert Zeldin, our Chief Medical Officer; Kevin McLaughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; John Quisel, our Chief Business Officer; and Sujay Kango, our Chief Commercial Officer. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans and research activities. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to materially differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent Form 10-K on file with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer. Habib Dable : Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2018 was an important year of Acceleron and I am extremely proud of the progress we've continued to make across our entire pipeline. 15 years after our founding, we have one of the most advanced TGF- beta super family based pipelines in the industry, focused on three disease areas. Hematology, Neuromuscular and Pulmonary.  Looking ahead 2019 and 2020 includes several key milestones for all of our programs, including the potential approval and commercial launch of our lead product candidate luspatercept in both the United States and Europe. We also expect important Phase 2 results from each of our ongoing trials in Neuromuscular and pulmonary disease.  Turning to our pipeline in Hematology along side our collaboration partner Celgene. We currently have multiple ongoing luspatercept trials in patients with anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS and beta-thalassemia and myelofibrosis. In Neuromuscular, we have two Phase 2 trials of ACE-083in two diseases associated with focal muscle weakness, FSHD and CMT. Lastly in pulmonary both our PULSAR and SPECTRA trials are active and we'll be evaluating Sotatercept in patients with PAH. Focusing first on luspatercept, in the middle of last year we were excited to announce positive results from our pivotal Phase 3 trials, MEDALIST and BELIEVE in lower risk MDS and beta- thalassemia respectively. This set the stage for a very strong showing at ASH 2018 with luspatercept front and center. The Acceleron and Celgene teams did a phenomenal job planning and executing at this key Hematology Congress attended by more than 25,000 people. Among the key highlights at ASH, the top-line results from both MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials were reviewed and discussed at the meetings opening press conference along with only two other clinical trials. The BELIEVE trial presented by Dr. [Anika Capellini] from the University of Milan to a full room along with multiple ancillary rooms of attendee overflow. The MEDALIST trial, the first of six plenary presentations presented by Dr. Alan List from Moffitt Cancer Center to a main conference center room packed with over 10,000 meeting attendees. And both trials were selected from among thousands of scientific presentations at the meeting for Best of ASH honors distinguishing them as some of the biggest breakthroughs in hematology. Finally, with these important results in both MDS and beta -thalassemia, we and Celgene remain on track to submit regulatory marketing applications in the US and EU in the first half of 2019, starting with the submission of the VLA to the FDA expected in April. In addition to the patient population studied in the MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials, we have continued to expand the luspatercept's overall development plan with three additional trials already underway. This includes the COMMANDS Phase 3 trial and first-line lower risk MDS, the BEYOND Phase 2 trial in non -transfusion dependent beta- thalassemia and the Phase 2 trial in myelofibrosis, which recently reached its target enrollment of 70 patients. Patients with anemia associated with lower risk MDS, beta-thalassemia and myelofibrosis are in dire need of new therapies, with current treatment options larger limited to red blood cell transfusions and unapproved agents. Because of this significant unmet medical need, we in Celgene estimate annual global peak sales of luspatercept to exceed $2 billion for the MDS and beta -thalassemia indications alone. We also estimate as much as another $1 billion of global peak sales potential for the opportunity in myelofibrosis associated anemia. With our low to mid 20% tiered royalty rate and Celgene covering approximately 100% of the program cost, these peak sales estimates have the potential to translate to significant royalty revenue for Acceleron. As you would expect with an opportunity in an unmet need of this magnitude, the teams at Celgene and Acceleron remain highly focused on all upcoming regulatory and launch readiness activities along with continued clinical trial execution and expansion. I will now hand the call over to our Chief Medical Officer, Robert Zeldin to review our neuromuscular and pulmonary disease programs. Robert Zeldin : Thanks Habib. I'd like to begin with ACE-083 in neuromuscular disease. We continue to advance ACE-083, our locally acting muscle agent in Phase 2 trials in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy or FSHD and charcot-marie-tooth disease or CMT. FSHD is a myopathy caused by the expression of a typically dormant protein that is toxic to muscle tissue, while CMT is a neuropathy in which disease nerve leads to muscle atrophy. At the World Muscle Society Annual Meeting in October, we presented positive results from part one of the trials, the open-label part which evaluated safety and tolerability along with changes in muscle mass to enable dose selection for part two. Patients with FSHD and CMT treated with an ACE-083 experienced mean total muscle volume increases from baseline of greater than 14%, reduction in absolute fat fraction and a favorable safety profile over the 12-week treatment period. Based on these positive results, we moved into part two of the trials designed to assess the efficacy and safety of an ACE-083 versus placebo over a six-month treatment period followed by a six-month open-label period. The primary endpoint is the percent change in total muscle volume via magnetic resonance imaging with secondary endpoints including motor function tests such as timed walking tests in both FSHD and CMT, as well as upper limb tests in FSHD. We will also be evaluating disease specific patient reported outcomes in both trials. I am happy to announce that the FSHD trial recently completed full enrolment of 55 patients and we remain on track to present the top-line results in the second half of the year. Patient recruitment in the CMT trial is ongoing. With that I'd like to turn to our pulmonary disease program. As we described at our Pulmonary Arterial hypertension or PAH Deep Dive event in November, we are very excited to be developing Sotatercept in PAH, a rare progressive disorder characterized by high blood pressure or hypertension in the arteries of the lungs. There is an urgent need for new therapies in PAH despite 14 drug approvals over the 20 last years; the median survival for these patients is still only 5 to 7 years post diagnosis.  Also in November, we and our collaborators at the Brigham and Women's Hospital presented preclinical research on Sotatercept at the American Heart Association Annual Scientific Sessions which demonstrated so Sotatercept's ability to reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling and improve pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular structure and function in an animal model of PAH. Our Phase 2 PULSAR trial to evaluate Sotatercept's activity in patients with PAH is ongoing. This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial that will enroll 100 patients with World Health Organization group one functional class 23 PAH. The primary treatment period is six months. The primary endpoint is change in pulmonary vascular resistance with multiple secondary endpoints. We also recently initiated an exploratory study called SPECTRA. This trial will look at innovative endpoints of invasive cardiopulmonary exercise tests or IC pet and cardiac MRI in addition to the more traditional PAH trial endpoints being assessed in the PULSAR trial. With that I will turn the call over to Kevin McLaughlin, our CFO to review the financials. Kevin McLaughlin : Thanks Robert. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31st, 2018 were $291.3 million compared to $372.9 million as of December 31st, 2017. Additionally, we were recently able to successfully execute a follow-on offering of common stock including the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option for net proceeds to Acceleron of approximately $248.2 million from new and existing institutional shareholders. Based on our current operating plan and projections, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments together with the net proceeds from the offering will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements until such time as we expect to receive significant royalty revenue from the luspatercept sales. Collaboration revenue for the year was $14 million. The revenue is all from the company's Celgene partnership and is primarily related to expenses incurred by the company in support of luspatercept. Total costs and expenses for the year were $138.4 million. This includes R&D expenses of $103.9 million and G&A expenses of $34.5 million. The company posted a net loss for the year ended December 31st, 2018 of $118.9 million. I will now turn the presentation back over to Habib for final remarks. Habib Dable : Great. Thank you, Kevin. And with that I'll briefly summarize our priorities for the remainder of this year and beyond. Beginning with luspatercept and Hematology, we and Celgene plan to submit regulatory marketing applications to the US and EU health authorities in both lower-risk MDS and beta -thalassemia in the first half of 2019, starting with the submission of the BLA to the FDA expected in April. In addition, we plan to submit the Phase 3 MEDALIST and BELIEVE results for publication in 2019.  For the Phase 2 trial in myelofibrosis, we anticipate reporting top-line results in the second half of 2019 and expect to provide preliminary top-line results for the BEYOND phase 2 trials in 2020. The recently initiated phase 3 COMMANDS trial continues to enroll patients. We also expect to discuss our initial clinical trial expansion plan for luspatercept in 2019. Looking at our neuromuscular programs, we plan to present preliminary results from part two of the Phase 2 trials with ACE-083 in the second half of 2019 for FSHD, and by year end 2019 for CMT. We expect to provide ASC-2494 preliminary results for the phase 1 healthy volunteer trial in the first half of this year. And lastly for PAH, we expect to provide preliminary results for the PULSAR and SPECTRA trials in 2020. In closing, luspatercept has created significant [Technical Difficulty] the need to date and we believe it will continue to do so through its commercial launch and further indication expansion over time. We are also approaching important value inflection points with both ACE-083 and Sotatercept expected to produce Phase 2 proof-of-concept data in neuromuscular and pulmonary disease over the next 12 to 18 months. We have a busy year ahead and remain confident in our ability to continue advancing these potentially transformative therapies for patients, while focusing on long- term value creation for both our business and shareholders. I will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Gould of UBS. Your line is now open. Carter Gould : Great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first on ACE-083, even clear on the need to show benefit in terms of function and strength, but I was just kind of wanted to get a little more detail on how you're thinking about the clinical hurdle in terms of them potentially moving that forward into essentially a phase 3 study. Any color on how you expect the placebo arm to perform or kind of what's a clinically meaningful separation there. And then since the studies enrolled, any color on the demographics of that Part B enrollment and maybe how that compares to Part one? Thank you. Habib Dable : Hey, Carter. This is Habib. Thanks for your question. Maybe I'll just kind of kick it off and then hand it over to Robert to add any additional color. So you're right with respect to ACE-083 in both charcot-marie-teeth which we plan to --in charcot-marie-tooth as well as FSHD where we plan to disclose top-line results for Part 2 of the studies in the second half of this year. The important part of this study as you knows is all about function as you alluded to.  We have up to date been able to demonstrate double-digit growth in both indications in terms of total muscle volume in a generally safe and tolerable way. Now what we want to be able to do is to replicate that muscle growth and to be able to translate that into a functional benefit. Now when you're looking at FSHD where we're dosing both the biceps as well as the TA muscles, in the biceps we're looking at functional improvements by measuring, using a measurement called the PUL or the Performance Upper Limb test where patients are asked to engage in various exercises like putting pegs in holes, stacking cans et cetera and timing them. When you're looking at the TA muscle for both charcot-marie-tooth as well as FSHD, we're looking at end points such as for stair climb, time and meter walk run, six-minute walk distance et cetera. So at the end of the day, Carter, we again as I said, we're powering the studies to be able to demonstrate total muscle volume increases. And we're looking across a spectrum of functional endpoints including quality of life assessments through a validated PRO where we're working with collaborators at the University of Rochester. And we will be looking at all of that data in totality. And again we power the studies to be able to show us a functional improvement. We're looking for double-digit increases in function, but again looking at the totality of the data at the end of part two of these studies, we hope to be able to be very well informed in terms of what a phase three would look like in terms of a go/no-go. Robert, I don't know if there's anything on top of that you'd like to add? Robert Zeldin : Too comprehensive. Todd James : Hey, Carter, it's Todd. I would just add about the baseline demographics. We targeted patients based off of the muscle scores for the trial that they see mild to moderate patients. So the patients wouldn't be too far gone that we couldn't provide an improvement with a therapy like an ACE-083 and so that's in line with the patient's they were involved in the trial. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Brill of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, everyone. This is [Indiscernible] on for Danielle Brill. I just had a couple quick questions that I wanted to hit on. First was the myelofibrosis trial, would you be able to give us some color on what we should be looking out for in the preliminary data that's going to be coming up in the second half? Habib Dable : Yes. I know thanks for your question. So from myelofibrosis just to remind everyone this is a phase 2 study that we're running where we recruited 70 patients, and we have also guided that in the second half of this year that we would be presenting data on these patients. Again, the way we looked at these 70 patients was looking at we --40 patients who are being treated with our asset luspatercept without the combination of ruxolitinib because of the fact that they don't have an enlarged spleen. And then 30 patients out of that 70 are looking at luspatercept in combination with ruxolitinib. And again we're looking at transfusion dependent patients, as well as non transfusion dependent patients. And so at the end of the day, I think it's important to highlight the unmet need with these patients because of the fact that they are suffering from anemia in some --in many cases just due to the fibrotic bone marrow. And so therefore the disease induce anemia is something where we're looking at in the mono patient, but also please remember when you think about ruxolitinib and JAK inhibition in general, there also suffer -- because of the mechanism of action in many cases it is transient, but it is an impact on these patients where they're suffering from the fibrotic bone marrow, as well as drug-induced anemia because of the JAK inhibition. This also led us to announce together with our collaborators recently of Phase 1/ 2 study with Fedratinib which is Celgene JAK inhibitor where we'll be looking at combination use of luspatercept as well as part of our myelofibrosis study. Todd James : Hey, it's Todd. As far as the primary endpoints for the Phase 2 depending on which cohort the patient's in whether it's the anemia only cohort. There we're looking for consecutive 12 weeks hemoglobin increase of a 1.5 gram or greater within the first 24 weeks or the six-month primary treatment period. And for the patients that have the 2 to 4 unit transfusion burden over a four-week period of time, there we are looking for transfusion independence or no transfusions over a 12 consecutive week period within that 24 week primary treatment period. So that's the main endpoints that you could expect to see when we do present results in the second half of the year. Habib Dable : Great, thanks, Todd. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thank you so much. That was really helpful. And I guess the second question I had was you mentioned you're getting ready with launch readiness activities right now for the luspatercept. Could you expand on that a little bit? What are you guys doing and how is it coming about? Habib Dable : So thanks for your question. Obviously, now with announcement that we made recently with the BLA expected to be filed in April and under a standard review process we could anticipate that a year later from April we could be in launch mode. Now that said, we also are doing a number of activities together with our collaboration partner Celgene in preparation for that, as well as the fact that if indeed we were surprised with a priority review and we were able to launch earlier that we would be prepared. So a number of activities in terms of launch readiness.  Whether it's in preparations from our positioning strategy, in terms of our pricing research, in terms of manufacturing and supply. I can tell you that there's a tremendous amount of work that's going on. Now with respect to specifics in terms of commercial launch perhaps, Sujay, you maybe you want to add a little bit of color in terms of some of the things that we're working on right now with our partners. Sujay Kango : Sure. Thanks, Habib. So couple of things right as Habib mentioned, we do have joint commercialization teams already in place. And as part of that we are clearly understanding what the patient needs that on the forefront and putting programs together that would be necessary for launch as and when we get approval. So in that instance what we have is preparing all the materials that are necessary, trying to think from a peer engagement early peer engagement perspective planning around that component to ensure that access is appropriate, understanding the where the patients are within the US. So we are able to deploy the right team members appropriately at the right time point. So all this work for planning in a pre-launch phase is what we are doing to prepare with ensuring that at launch we'll be ready to go day one and have the patient's needs on the forefront of our mind. So that's what we are working on. Operator : Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Yaron Werber : Great. Thank you so much. I have a couple of questions and maybe just the first one to clarify the endpoint. Todd that you mentioned the consecutive 12-week endpoint. Is that any consecutive 12-week and you sort of record the best data within that 24 week or is it -- it needs to be consecutive 12-week within a specific time point? Todd James : Yes. And it's the first. So if it's week 0 to 12 or 2 to 14 or 12 to 24 within that 24 week period, all those instances would be considered a responder within that 24 week period. Yaron Werber : And can you just remind us -- yes with the Sotatercept study that was done obviously in that single center how was that endpoint defined? Was it defined the same way that 33% to 39% response rate? Todd James : Yes, that's right and whether it was the Sotatercept IST or MDS trials there we're looking for a consecutive eight-week, that's how we've done the endpoints over the treatment period. Yaron Werber : Okay, great. And then it sounds like you're going to - the way I'm hearing you're correct so maybe times like you're going to be asking for Priority Review. Can you just remind us, I don't know if you're comfortable sharing this whether which division of FDA is actually reviewing the application? Is it the same division reviewing both filings for both indications? Habib Dable : Yes. So Robert would you like to answer that? Robert Zeldin : What? Habib Dable : Division of Hematology. Robert Zeldin : So it's hematology, yes, our expectation is that division will review both applications. Yaron Werber : Okay, so there will be a single priority review and they'll review of them at the same time. Habib Dable : Yes. So it's -- that's not necessarily the case that it would be single. So obviously, Yaron, at standard practice we would be looking and asking for that, but just to remind you again just so I'm clear, our base case assumptions that is a standard review process. Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citi. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Nicole on for Robyn. Thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to the regulatory process could you --do you expect the regulatory process to be the same between or similar between the US and EU? And did you get a sense from your communications that the regulatory authorities that they're --there would be any potential hurdles or concerns about acceptance of the application? Habib Dable : Robert would you like to -- Robert Zeldin : Yes. I mean I think that at the pre BLA meeting I think that was a very positive open discussion. I think the agency was excited about receiving the application. And I could not identify any specific areas of concern as folks are now clearly aware we intend to file with the FDA in April. And subsequently with the -submit the marketing authorization application in the first half. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then just a quick follow up given the evolving and competitive landscape in beta cell with multiple different modalities being investigated. Where do you see greater potential for luspatercept been fall? And do you expect there to be any difference a take between the transfusion dependent and non transfusion dependencification? Habib Dable : Yes. So with respect to two beta -thalassemia, so let me answer the second part of your question first. The BELIEVE study just to remind everyone it was studied in transfusion dependent patients. So the initial approval that we will be looking for is exactly that. Now I think it's important to also note though is that there is a significant population probably equivalent to the transfusion dependent population that we're exploring through the BEYOND study.  And so we're recruiting patients 150 there and so obviously this is a population and again it's just to kind of repeat what cited by Dr. Capellini on stage is that this is a population with a very high unmet need because of the fact that they are not actually being transfused but there are in many, many cases very symptomatic. So we're very much looking forward to the results of that study. Now in terms of the first part of your question in terms of competition and how --what the potential for beta - thalassemia and luspatercept would be. One of the things that we are extremely proud of is that luspatercept has been able to demonstrate the ability to restore healthy red blood cell formations in two very distinct diseases. Lower risk MDS as well as beta- thalassemia to date which has given us a confidence to want to proceed with other lifecycle management activities such as myelofibrosis and potentially other diseases of chronic anemia. With respect to beta- thalassemia, if we are approved, we feel that there will be a tremendous unmet need that we will be catering to. Now, obviously, I know there's a lot of attention right now on gene therapy and if gene therapies are proven to be safe and efficacious, I'm thrilled that the community is going to have that as an option. Do I feel that that option is going to cater to the many, many patients with unmet needs> No, I don't. And I feel that if indeed it is another option for patients, I feel there will be a tremendous opportunity for luspatercept to find a space and a very significant space for this patient population who may not feel or be qualified for such a therapy. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open. Greg Harrison : Hi, this Greg Harrison on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the question. So now that potential luspatercept launch is on the horizon, do you think the expanded indications and development could end up garnering the same penetration as with the MEDALIST and BELIEVE populations? And if so, what factors could possibly enable that outcome? Habib Dable : So I just want to make sure I understood your question. You're asking for the -- in the follow-on indications beyond MEDALIST and BELIEVE as to whether or not we feel that they will be equally robust in terms of the opportunity, in terms of the unmet need, is that correct? Greg Harrison : Yes, exactly. Habib Dable : Okay, great. So again let's start with MEDALIST and BELIEVE and make sure that we're on the same page. When we look at MEDALIST and BELIEVE, we feel that we're going to be catering to a very significant population. So for example when we look at the datasets that we've got that we feel that we have the most robust information around, and we look at US and Europe. For the MEDALIST population, we feel that there's approximately about 40,000 patients between the US and Europe that we'll be able to have an opportunity to serve. With the BELIEVE patient population, we feel that it's approximately 20,000. Now admittedly, the opportunity for that to expand is going to be driven by success in our subsequent studies. So if indeed the BEYOND study is successful, we feel that that patient population for beta-cell alone could double. If indeed the COMMAND study which is our first line treatment naive study in lower risk MDS is successful, we believe that that's population of patient has an incidence rate of approximately 15,000 a year, is that right Todd? Todd James : Yes. 15,000 to 25,000 Habib Dable : 15,000 to 25,000 a year. And the nice thing about that is it allows us to get into this space and to be able to provide with luspatercept much earlier in the disease setting as well. When you look at myelofibrosis, myelofibrosis patient population across between US and Europe is approximately 30,000 -35,000 patients and if you look at that patient group probably 50% to 60% of them suffer from moderate to severe anemia. So now you're again looking at another 15,000 to 20,000 patients and independent as to whether or not they're on ruxolitinib or not as I said before, these patients are suffering from chronic anemia due to this fibrotic bone marrow, as well as the drug-induced anemia. So the opportunity for a luspatercept to play a role here as an erythroid maturation agent can be pretty profound in this group. So all of these groups that we're looking at have a potential to have a very high unmet need and an underserved population. And then beyond that we obviously have talked about looking at expanding the lifecycle management strategy. We're working very closely with our partners at Celgene. They are very motivated to continue to moving forward beyond the already identified disease indications. I think you've heard us talk a little bit about chronic induced anemia as one that we're exploring, but it is one of many chemo induced anemia. And that's just one of many areas that we're exploring and prioritizing and hopefully more to come as that analysis continues to finalize. Greg Harrison : Great. Thank you. Habib Dable : And just by the way just to kind of close off on that. we just recently this year we've given a little bit more granularity in terms of the commercial opportunity of these indications where we have traditionally always said that if you look at the lower risk MDS and beta-thalassemia that represented a $2 billion plus opportunity and now as we move forward with our next indication in myelofibrosis, if indeed the myelofibrosis study is successful and the drug is approved in that indication, we and our partners at Celgene believe that it's an incremental $1 billion opportunity, $1billion opportunity in that indication alone. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Joseph of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Eric Joseph : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple from us. I guess the first on most luspatercept and myelofibrosis, assuming that safety data are good maybe can you talk a little bit about the registration path forward? Whether you would need to pursue individuals --individualized trials and the non transmuting dependent versus transfusion dependent populations? And whether there's sort of a wholesale way of pursuing the indication and how should we be thinking about where the Fedratinib combination studies factors in to later stage development? Habib Dable : Yes. So, Eric, I think the first question is pretty easy to answer in that too early right now. Let's wait and see how the phase 2 reads out, let's see what data comes out of that and based on that we'll obviously have the appropriate interactions with the regulatory agencies. And then we'll be guided by that feedback and then we'll share with you the development path forward for phase 3.  With respect to Fedratinib, I think all I can tell you at this point are what have already been disclosed in terms of the phase \u00bd studies. The Celgene disclosed this last month and then on top of that I think it's important to note that also sends a very strong signal in terms of their commitment to myelofibrosis with luspatercept as their anchor. Eric Joseph : Got it. And maybe just a clarification question on ACE-083, you made a point earlier that -- is it the expectation that you'll be able to detect a static benefit and functional improvement based on a trial sizing and which measure specifically are you expects to see that benefit be shown? Robert Zeldin : Yes. So I think Habib's point was that we're going to look at the totality of the data. So we know the primary efficacy endpoint is clear. That's overall most growth and now we have a number of assessments of functional benefit we're going to look at them in the totality. So I'd say in general we're guiding to say that we'd like to see a 10% improvement on those individual measures that would give us the confidence to advance the program. But I don't think we would you know pick one of our children above the other. Eric Joseph : Got it, got it. And just can you comment around sort of how frequently subjects are assessed or the number of intervals that we'll see in the part 2 read out? Habib Dable : Yes. So as we haven't gotten to the granularity of the assessment timelines, but what again just so you know these patients are coming in every three weeks for their injections. Their intramuscular injections that are done in the OP. Operator : Our question comes from Gerard Smith of SVB Leerink. Your line is now open. Gerard Smith : Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is Gerard on for Geoff. A couple on muscle could you remind us how you expect to disclose the 2494 phase one data, what type of disclosure, what will you say exactly in terms of safety and volume et cetera? And then could you also talk about the different ligand specificities for the two different muscle agents? And how we should be thinking about making inferences on 2494 based on the ACE-083 function data that we'll get later in the year? Can we sort of try to make inferences about the two or it is not appropriate? Thank you. Todd James : Hey, Gerard, it's Todd. As far as the communication plan for those results, hard to say have to go fall exactly at Congress or not but at the very least there would be a press release that discloses the results. As far as what you could expect it's a single ascending dose trial across I think five, six different doses and as safety as you can imagine anything if serious would absolutely be outlined. Typically, if things are just grade one, two we categorize them. If there are injection site reactions for example like we saw in part one, we would comment about that. And as far as the PD that you could expect to see, we're looking at potential increases in muscle volume of the quad which is very regular to do in this style of a trial. As far as if you can read anything in from the ACE-083 results to the 2494 results, I think it would be fairly difficult to do that, very distinct molecule of ACE-083, is locally acting agent that we can take very high therapeutic dose levels, inject it right into the target muscle and there we've seen in part one increases of 14 plus percent at the high doses, whereas a systemic agent like 2494 you most likely to see mid to high single digit increases at least agents whether it be Regeneron, [Nagarmab] that have come before us, have seen increases of that nature. And so yes don't think there's much read through from one to the other. As far as the binding affinity. I think I'd let John Quisel get into those details. John Quisel : Yes. So the important thing to remember to know about the ligand binding is the both ACE-083 and ACE-2494 are what we call myostatin plus, so they can form with our view of how best to stimulate muscle growth and improve function by inhibiting as many of the relevant ligands that are negative regulators of muscle as you can safely. The two molecules so apart from being minus and plus in their approaches as Todd mentioned they're very different ACE-083 being locally administered being able to reach local concentrations that you probably can't get to with a 2494 like systemic agent. So where we've shown the muscle lab increases in the in the teens, they would be surprising probably the feedback kind of effects from a systemic agent like 2494 even though the two agents are engaging similar spectrum of ligands. Just speaking briefly to the protein scaffolds are built off of a ACE083 it's based generally around [fall stand] structure while the other one 2494 is a ligand track based on the cell surface receptors that are involved in binding the key ligand. So they're very different proteins with similar ligand binding spectra and due to their different modalities we've very different, we expect very different effects on the muscle mass. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Hung of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Hung : Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about conversations you've had with payers and anything that surprised you or any discussions on value-based pricing? Habib Dable : So I don't think there's much we can say about that discussion, but do you want to comment, Sujay, in terms of anything we can share with respect to payer or pay research that's ongoing? Sujay Kango : Sure. So as you know we are conducting payer research, we are getting insights over there. And Celgene is a very methodological approach to value based pricing right. So at this juncture we are getting that insight that's what I can comment. And those sort of taking into account that we want to ensure that we have the broadest access possible for the patient population right. So with that in mind I think they're in a good position at this juncture to get all that insight. We can also based on FDA guidance we can do early payer engagement and through that we are collecting that insight. And then very close to launch we'll be able to disclose the price related to the value proposition as well. We feel that the phase 3 made us strong. Jeffrey Hung : Great and then maybe for the neuromuscular and pulmonary franchises. Can you talk about your strategy in terms of -- and your thoughts on partnering versus going in alone? Habib Dable : Yes. It's a good question, Jeff, I think at the end of the day we are fully committed to both therapeutic areas as we disclosed during R&D day in 2017. We just successfully were able to execute on our secondary which gives us obviously the appropriate firepower to drive these studies to conclusion. And at the end of phase two and based on that data, we will take a good look in terms of what would be drive the most value strategically for the programs and for Acceleron. And we'll make a decision at that point. I think the most important nuance to all of that is we are positioning ourselves to be in a position of potentially partnering these programs to maximize value rather than the necessity to partner these programs because we would otherwise not be able to afford to do to run them. I think it's a very important nuance. Operator : Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kennen MacKay : Thanks for taking the question. Habib that $2 billion to $3 billion in peak sales guidance is reminiscent of Babe Ruth pointing at centerfield bleachers that's quite the move I liked it. Couple of quick questions. On the luspatercept clearly in MEDALIST there's a major impact on hemoglobin and transfusion but it looks like there's also some impact on platelets. Could you maybe remind us how requirements for g-csf were impacted in MEDALIST and potentially how this could factor into own label or usage in the clinic?  Then also in MDS, correct me if I'm wrong but when luspatercept will likely sort of be thought of as supportive care for these patients, and I guess how should we think about that impacting usage of either high or low intensity antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies in these patients? What --obviously there was no difference in leukemic transformation but is there any compound data out there with some of these anything leukemic. Thank you. Habib Dable : So I'm going to ask Dr. Robert Zeldin to comment. I'm not sure how much depth you want to get into and all of that. And I think the first part of that question I'm not sure if you caught all that, but cut out a little bit. Robert Zeldin : Yes. If you could repeat I think -- Habib Dable : The first part of you --just repeat the first part. Kennen MacKay : On points, yes, looked like there was an effect on -- some of those forest plots that had been presented in the MEDALIST trial. I was wondering if there was any difference in requirements for g-csf in MEDALIST. Robert Zeldin : No. I can't speak to the specifics on an individual patient basis, but I can tell you having very comprehensively review the safety data that we have no concerns regarding thrombocytosis in the population of patients treated in the MEDALIST study. Kennen MacKay : Oh, no. I was thinking more that you could reduce the need for some of the --therapies from your last -- Habib Dable : So, Kenn, sorry, I think we tripped over each other in hearing and we did --I think the first part of the question was answered by Robert in terms of the comment that you got from it. The second part of your question though I don't believe was answered. So you want to repeat that again, Kennen. Okay, we lost him, okay, we weren't catching at all. Okay, we'll have to go to the next question, operator. Operator : And your next question comes from Terrence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Holly Barra : Hi, guys. This is Holly on for Terrence. Just one from us is that can you discuss the status of the COMMANDS trial enrollment and when we could potentially see data? Thank you. Todd James : Sure. Hey, Holly. It's Todd. Yes, we kicked off the COMMAND trial with our partner Celgene in late in the third quarter of last year. So as you can imagine in the first 6 to 12 months of trial that's all about getting sites up and running and obviously the initial patients into the trial, but as you get more sites on enrollment starts to pick up pretty quickly. So we're still in the early days here. As far as when you could expect data, we haven't guided to that today, but they are typically some initial forecast listed on clinical trials.gov for trials. End of Q& A Operator : And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Habib Dable for any closing remarks. Habib Dable : Yes. No, if there is no other questions, thanks everybody for your participation. Thank you for your continued interest in the company. And look forward to meeting you at future investor conferences or -- with that everybody have good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Merck's First Quarter 2019 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam, SVP, Investor Relations and Global Communications. Please go ahead. Teri Loxam : Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2019 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs, who will each have prepared remarks. In addition, I'm also joined by Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand that sales in the quarter for the business units and products. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we made during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. Finally, similar to last quarter, we have posted a presentation to the investors section of merck.com, which includes some of our highlights from the quarter. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Teri. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. We had a very strong start to 2019. And we are seeing our fundamental strategy of investing thoughtfully in R&D involving the science payoff. Our current portfolio of assets continues to drive strong growth and we are working to ensure that we capture the near-term opportunities in front of us to maintain this momentum, while planning for the next generation of treatments. Our first quarter performance with double-digit year-over-year sales and EPS growth are the results of portfolio and operational strengths driven by oncology, vaccines, and select hospitals and specialty products. We\u2019re confident that products within these areas, including KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA, LENVIMA, GARDASIL, BRIDION and others together with our Animal Health franchise will lead to strong growth over the coming years. Our performance in this first quarter also speaks to our success globally as we've received a number of additional approvals and launched new products in various markets around the world. Our international business, which represented nearly 60% of our sales this quarter, has strong momentum. And we believe that we've only scratched the surface in terms of the opportunity in key markets such as China, where we are seeing significant growth. We foresee a stream of additional approvals from our current portfolio of products across markets globally, and we will look to maximize these opportunities powered by our commercial team's proven ability to execute. In parallel, we are also focused on advancing our promising pipeline and continuing to augment our internal research and development efforts with external innovation. We are excited by the prospect of our pipeline, which includes potential new treatments and vaccines, oncology, HIV, and many other areas of significant and ongoing unmet needs. There is also impressive work underway in our discovery hubs in Cambridge, London, and South San Francisco, where we are incorporating some of the most scientifically advanced modalities and technologies in the world. Importantly, these hubs are located where many of the best biotech and scientific mines are gathered. And we're benefiting from the vibrant academics and biotech communities in each of our respective hub. Finally, we're continuing to evolve in a rapidly changing industry environment to best position Merck for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term, while helping to drive positive outcomes for patients. The overall healthcare landscape remains dynamic as the industry grapples with complex issues such as the rising cost of healthcare, generally, pharmaceutical prices in an excess, and the shift to more outcomes based reimbursement systems. At the same time, we believe that demand for even better outcomes for more innovative medicines will continue around the world giving us back and growing unmet need in cancer, Alzheimer's disease and in so many other areas as the global population continues to grow, while countries, certain countries age. As a result, we will remain step-back and going where the science leads us in order to bring forward transformative medicines and vaccines. We are confident in our strategy, our growth prospects and our ability to continue to deliver significant benefits for patients and value to shareholders in 2019 and beyond. We look forward to discussing these matters in more detail with you in our Investor Day in June, where we plan to give you a deeper understanding of our pipeline and company and provide you with the opportunity to meet a broader set of our scientists and business leaders. With that, I'll pass the call over to Rob to go through the details of our quarterly results. Rob? Rob Davis : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken mentioned, Merck had one of its strongest quarters in the recent history. Our first quarter results reflect broad based strength across our portfolio and continued discipline in our resource allocation. We executed very well across our key growth stores, and our updated guidance reflects confidence that we remain well positioned to deliver strong growth this year and in for the future. Turning to the top line, total company revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year, or 11%, excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. This quarter was led by our human health business with growth of 12%, excluding exchange. Animal Health revenues grew 3%, excluding exchange. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an exchange basis. The increase in human health revenues was led by key products in our oncology, vaccines and hospital and specialty businesses. Growth was strong in both the U.S. and international markets, and especially in China, where sales increased 67% year-over-year, driven largely by newly launched products, In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales were nearly $2.3 billion this quarter, an increase of 60% versus the first quarter of 2018. Growth was primarily driven by higher use in first line non-small cell lung cancer both as monotherapy and with the rollout of the chemo combo. In addition, utilization remains strong across the breadth of indications including melanoma, head and neck, bladder and MSI-high cancers. With our recent approvals and adjuvant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma in the United States, we are now approved in 18 indications across 11 different tumor types, plus a pan tumor approval in MSI-high patients. We are also very excited by recent approvals in Japan and China, and look forward to making additional indications available to patients and markets around the world. In the U.S., first-line lung cancer remains a key driver of growth given further penetration of the chemo combo in both nonsquamous and squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We also are encouraged by early feedback in adjuvant melanoma, which was our first approval in the adjuvant setting. First-line lung has also become a larger contributor in ex-U.S. markets with growth driven by further uptake of our monotherapy indication and PD-L1 high expressers that also by demand for the chemo combo, following regulatory and reimbursement approvals in select EU markets and Japan. In Europe, the uptake of the chemo combo and non-squamous patients has strong end-markets, where we have gain reimbursement. And we look forward to potential additional reimbursement approvals later this year as well as an introduction of the chemo combo in the squamous setting. In Japan, KEYTRUDA growth accelerated this quarter given the recent approvals across find indications, including lung, adjuvant melanoma and MSI-high cancers with utilization of the chemo combo and first-line lung cancer as a particularly strong driver of growth. Finally, in China, we are seeing strong sales of KEYTRUDA, following our launch late last year and metastatic melanoma. And we were very excited by our recent approval in China in first-line lung cancer. Overall, we remain very confident in KEYTRUDA's benefit to patients and long-term growth potential given its established immune-oncology leadership and increased utilization across many indications, and in markets around the world, as well as our expectation for many additional approvals going forward. We also remain encouraged by the progress and potential of both LYNPARZA and LENVIMA, which we are developing and marketing in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Eisai respectably. LYNPARZA sales doubled this quarter, driven by further uptake in ovarian cancer following the U.S. approval of solo one in December as well as uptake in new markets such as China and Japan. In the U.S. across all tumors, LYNPARZA continues to lead the PARP inhibitor class with over 50% total patient share. We remain excited by the long-term potential of LYNPARZA, especially with a recent start of the initial Phase 3 KEYTRUDA combination studies. LENVIMA is another important product for our oncology portfolio. Sales this quarter reflected continued strong performance in hepatocellular carcinoma following recent launches around the world. The launch in China is still early, but we believe that opportunity there is large given the high prevalence of HTC in that market. Now turning to vaccines. Our vaccines business reflected strong demand for GARDASIL, which achieved sales of over $800 million this quarter, representing growth at 31% compared to Q1 of 2018. Ex-U.S. demand remains particularly robust while continued strong uptake in China, following the GARDASIL 9 launch last May, and increased general neutral vaccination in Europe. The decline in the U.S. reflects timing of public sector purchases which will more than offset underlying demand. The strong growth demonstrating across our overall vaccines portfolio was also helped by the performance of certain pediatric products. Our hospital and specialty business was led by 30% growth in sales of BRIDION. U.S. growth reflects BRIDION's increased utilization and procedures were neuromuscular reversal agent issues, including in robotics and minimally invasive surgeries. Animal Health revenue increased 3% this quarter to just over $1 billion. Companion animal sales grew 6%, primarily driven by strong demand globally for the BRAVECTO line of products. Livestock sales grew 1%, driven by volume growth, particularly from new poultry and swine vaccines. This was largely offset by lower aluminum product sales, driven by distributor purchasing patterns and weather-related softness resulting in delayed movement of cattle into the feed loss in the United States. While Animal Health growth this quarter was light versus recent trends, we still expect our full year performance to again outpace the overall market. Additionally, we are very excited by the recent closing of our acquisition of Antelliq, which establishes Merck as a leader in animal identification and monitoring, one of the fastest growing parts of the Animal Health industry. Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on the non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.9% in the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points versus the first quarter of 2018, favorable benefits of product mix and foreign currency were mostly offset by lower price, higher royalties and amortization of milestone payments. Operating expenses of $4.4 billion increased 2% year-over-year, including a favorable two-percentage-point impact from foreign exchange. Our investments in research and development grew 9%, driven by clinical development spending in oncology and vaccines as well as our discovery and early development efforts. SG&A spending declined 3% year-over-year as we continue to drive productivity and reallocate resources to our highest value growth opportunities. Other income and expense reflected $21 million of expense this quarter versus $259 million of income last year. The negative variance was primarily due to a litigation settlement gain in last year's first quarter as well as lower income from certain investments in equity securities and higher net interest expense this year. Our tax rate of 16.5% for the quarter was 350 basis points lower year-over-year, largely due to favorable discrete items, primarily related to foreign tax credits and prior year mix of income adjustments booked this quarter. Taken together, our earnings per share increased 18%, excluding exchange to $1.22. Turning to our outlook for the year, we are narrowing and raising both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges for 2019, reflecting our strong and continued operational performance. We remain confident in both our near and long-term prospects to revenue growth, driven by expected demand for innovative products across key growth pillars, which more than overcome expected headwinds from price, foreign currency and pressures on mature and LOE products. For 2019, we now expect revenues of $43.9 billion to $45.1 billion, which represents 4% to 7% growth versus 2018, driven by strength across our oncology, vaccines, hospital and specialty and Animal Health businesses. This range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of just over one-percentage-point using mid-April rates, which is slightly above our former assumption. We are also increasing our expected EPS range to be between $4.67 and $4.79, including a slightly positive impact from foreign exchange at mid-April rates, down from the one-percentage-point positive impact we had previously assumed. The new range represents growth of approximately 8% to 10% versus 2018. Other elements of our guidance remain unchanged, including our expectation for roughly flat gross margins, a low to mid-single digit increase in operating expense, driven mostly by the meaningful investments we continue to make in R&D, which we expect to increase in the back half of the year an expectation for roughly $0 in other income and expense, and finally, a full year tax rate of a range of 18.5% to 19.5%. In summary, we are very pleased by our first quarter performance. We expect our operational momentum to continue throughout the remainder of 2019 with continued strength across our few pillars of growth. Strong revenue growth along with disciplined resource allocation will allow us to make important investments in our pipeline, while at the same time delivering a leverage P&L and meaningful increases in earnings per share. We believe our ongoing efforts to develop and deliver innovative products that help meet unmet medical needs for patients worldwide and coupled with strong commercial execution and discipline financial management positioned us very well to generate strong short and long-term value to society and to our shareholders. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Roger. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks, Rob. The first quarter saw a continued progress across all aspects of the R&D portfolio. As has already been mentioned, early in the quarter we obtained U.S. approval for KEYTRUDA when used as Adjuvant therapy in the treatment of patients for the malignant melanoma with lymph node following definitive reception. More recently we obtained approval for combined use of KEYTRUDA and Pfizer's axitinib in the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma based on the results of our KEYNOTE-426 trial. The strength of this study in which improved overall response rates, progression free survival and overall survival compared with traditional treatment with single agent sunitinib were observed led to a very rapid review with approval secured nearly two months prior to the PDUFA date. I should also note that the combination of KEYTRUDA plus axitinib yielded consistently favorable results versus sunitinib in all traditionally defined patient subgroups and irrespective the PD-L1 expression in the tumor. KEYTRUDA acts on a very broad range of malignancies. The current FDA label includes indications from SALVAGE to Adjuvant therapy while in different settings expanding 11 different tumor types with more indications currently under review. During the quarter, we also gained approval for KEYTRUDA in China when combined with platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. With this approval, we hope to bring the benefits of this combination regiment previously approved in the United States, the EU, Japan and other major jurisdictions for the very large population of patients in China suffering from pulmonary malignancy. We also obtained FDA approval for the use of KEYTRUDA monotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at 1% or more of tumor cells based on the results of our KEYNOTE-042 study. This indication broadly use of KEYTRUDA monotheraphy to a much larger set of patients. Previously only those patients in whom 50% or more of tumor cells were shown or expressed PD-L1 were included in the monotheraphy indication. This recent broader approval also includes stage pre-patients who are not candidates for surgical resection of their disease or for treatment by definitive chemoradiation. At this point, I should note at the end of first quarter, we posted our 1,000 KEYTRUDA study on clinicaltrials.gov. And surprisingly, the bulk of new studies examined combinations of KEYTRUDA with other regiments and at earlier stages of disease. Not all of these studies yielded the results that we and our patients around the hope for. As we have previously announced both our KEYNOTE-240 study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and our KEYNOTE-062 study in the first-line treatment of patients with gastric cancer did not meet our expectations. However, both of these studies, the results of which we expect to be discussed with The American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting in June, provided important information that we'll assist specialists and refining their treatment regiments. In addition, the aggregated results of our clinical programs inform the selection of novel agents. As an example, we have more than 20 molecular entities currently under study in early stage clinical trials. Beyond this, together with our colleagues of AstraZeneca, we made significant progress in advancing the use of our PARP inhibitor LYNPARZA for the maintenance treatment of patients with malignancies that they are evidence of defective DNA repair. Just yesterday, we announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP of European Medicines Agency has adapted a positive opinion recommending LYNPARZA as first-line maintenance treatment for women with advanced BRCA-mutated epithelial ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have responded to traditional first-line platinum based chemo therapy. This recommendation or an indication has already been achieved in the United States was based on the SOLO-1 study showing that LYNPARZA treatment reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 70% versus that observe the placebo treatment. The CHMP recommendation follows approval by The European Commission authorizing LYNPARZA for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated HER2-negative advanced breast cancer based on the OlympiAD trial. Also in the first quarter, we announced that LYNPARZA treatment improved progression-free survival versus placebo in patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer. This disease had not progressed on platinum based chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer is an exceedingly difficult disease to treat. And we were gratified to see both statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patients with germline BRCA-mutations. On the infectious disease front, earlier this month, we have the opportunity to describe the use of ZERBAXA to treat hospital acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia at the European Congress on Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Meeting in Amsterdam. In this ASPECT-NP study, we evaluated an increased dose of ZERBAXA 3 grams per day, which provided improved intrapulmonary drug levels and infected lungs. The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints in this critically ill population. 92% of them were accessed in intensive care units, including favorable efficacy in patients with key key gram-negative pathogens. The results of ASPECT-NP are currently under priority review at the FDA as a qualified infectious disease product with a PDUFA date of June 3rd. The same medication is also under review by the CHMP in Europe. Looking ahead and beyond ZERBAXA, we have multiple PDUFAs during the second quarter. In the infectious disease area, the first quarter saw acceptance with priority review for a new drug application detailing the activity of our novel beta-lactamase inhibitor Relebactam to be used in combination with Imipenem and Cilastatin for the treatment is susceptible Gram-negative infections with the PDUFA date of July 16th. In the oncology space, FDA has granted priority review for KEYTRUDA in the first-line treatment of patients with current or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy based on the results of the KEYNOTE-048 trial with the PDUFA date of June 10th, and for KEYTRUDA in the third-line treatment of patients with advanced small-cell lung cancer based on results from the KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-028 trials for the PDUFA date of June 17th. We're also looking forward to a large set of Phase 3 results, including the first data from our registration enabling program for the 15 Valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine V114, which is intended to provide broad protection against invasive pneumococcal disease in susceptible population. We will provide more information about this program and about our other areas of research at the Investor Day meeting on June 20th. Now my colleagues and I will take your questions. Teri Loxam : Thanks Roger. Darla, we'll move to the Q&A portion. We're sensitive to the rest of our peers reporting this morning. So we'll end our call just before 9 A.M. So I'd ask that you keep your questions to a maximum of one or two so that we can get as many people on the call as possible. So Darla? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question from Jason Gerberry, Bank of America. Jason Gerberry : Just two for me. First, just can you talk, Ken, maybe a little bit about the future of Merck's role as a primary care company? I know a lot of investors perceive the company is largely pivoting post genuity LOE away from primary care and becoming more of a specialty company. But you also have programs like MK-7264. So just -- if you can provide a little bit of color in terms of the company's commitment and thought process regarding being a primary care player longer term? And then just, secondly, can you guys give a little bit of color that the KEYTRUDA loan opportunity in China? A little bit more specific there would be helpful. Thanks. Ken Frazier : Well, let me start by saying that as a company, we are focused on following the science and coming up with innovative products that make a big difference. We are not saying we're going to be totally a specialty company or vaccines company or primary care company. What we actually want to do is to make sure that we take advantage of the best opportunities. Right now, in oncology, the current growth is largely driven by that. But if you look at our pipeline, things like for example, the pneumococcal vaccines are things that are essentially primary care type products. So I would say we haven't committed ourselves to one area of medicine. It has always been helpful to us to follow the science. And we're going to continue to do that going forward. Frank Clyburn : And with regards to China -- good morning, this is Frank. We're one very excited about the overall opportunity in China as we demonstrated, as Rob mentioned, 67% growth versus prior year. Specifically with KEYTRUDA, last year we received our second-line melanoma indication in China, and as Roger mentioned, we just received our first-line lung indication with the combination with chemotherapy. We're really excited about the opportunity in China. We will be working through the NRDL listing process with the Chinese regulators. And given the timing of our lung approval, we'll have to see if NRDL listing is a possibility this year. A listing would open up an exciting opportunity to expand volumes. But even without that, we feel that we're very well positioned for with KEYTRUDA in China with the only PD-1 that has a first-line lung cancer indication. And we feel as though the breath of our program as you've seen in other markets, we plan to bring additional indications to China, which we think positions us very well for future growth. Teri Loxam : Right. Thanks. Let's move to the next question, please. Operator : Let's move to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I actually wanted to focus not on cancer today for a change and perhaps on HIV for a minute. I just wanted to gauge your expectations into the drive to simplify Phase 2 trials coming up this summer. I understand you have a triple of like regimen. And I guess my question really is what is it that we can learn about MK-8591 in the context of the combination pill? And what are you, specifically looking for on deciding whether to take this program forward into larger Phase 3? Thank you. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : 8591 has extraordinary properties as you appreciate both in terms of its potency and in terms of the duration of its effects. We have had the opportunity to present some of those data in the past, but we're now getting -- we'll have a chance to look at significant Phase 2 studies of long duration. I'm quite optimistic actually, that we're going to see very good responses in that setting in that that will lead to Phase 3 programs. Over time, I think the real advantage of 8591 -- this has ability to be put into a long-term format as potentially an implantable that could provide enormous benefits from pre-exposure prophylaxis point of view, but as well, dramatically simplify the treatment regimen for patients who are already infected with HIV in order to achieve long-term viral suppression. So we're going to be looking at those results of Phase 2 results very soon and have the opportunity to present them. And I think that will lead to much larger studies. And we're quite enthusiastic about 8591. Teri Loxam : Okay. Thank you. We'll move on to the next question please, Darla? Operator : It's from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Chris Schott : I guess, just two here. Maybe first, can you just elaborate a little bit more on KEYTRUDA in front-line lung, as you think about Europe? Just, where are we at this point in terms of reimbursement and market share? And how should we be thinking about kind of the ramp in that first-line lung business as we go through the rest of this year? My second question was just trying to get a better handle on longer-term margin dynamics. Can you just elaborate a little bit more expense trends over time? I know specifically, you've talked about R&D investments this year and next. But we think longer-term -- can we think about expenses actually rolling over beyond 2020 starting decline or is the longer-term margin opportunity more about expenses this growing at a slower rate than top line? Thanks very much. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : With regards to KEYTRUDA outside the U.S. and Europe, in particular, first, we're very pleased. We sold close to $985 million this quarter and had growth of almost 69% versus prior year outside the U.S. So we're very pleased with our progress. In lung, specifically, lung represents about 70% of our sales outside the U.S. We have access right now in Germany and many of the mid-European markets. We're still working on access in several of the other large European markets for reimbursements, which we expect will come on line hopefully in the second half of this year. So our overall momentum where we have first-line lung approval for monotherapy is very strong with a leader clearly in lung, in that setting. The chemo combination has helped us to ramp, as I mentioned. And we have market leading shares in the markets -- in Europe there and then look forward to the second half of the year where we'll see additional reimbursement additional markets come onboard for access. So we're very pleased with where we are in Europe and outside the U.S. with regards to lung. Teri Loxam : And Rob, can you comment on margins. Rob Davis : So with your question on margin, maybe just an overall comment then the specifics on what's happening in the operating expense line. We have said and we continue to believe we do expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time driven by revenue growth, the changing mix of our business, our continued focus on efficiencies and ultimately a moderation of R&D growth over time. So I just put that up there as to set context with, specifically when you look at what will be driving the margin expansion into your question. We will continue to see R&D grow over the next couple of years and we would expect that to be at a rate faster than sales. But after that, we do expect to see R&D moderate. It will still grow. And our overall OpEx we believe will continue to grow. It just will be growing at rates slower than sales that should allow for the margin expansion we've been talking about. So it's not that we expect absolute reduction in spend, but just a moderation of growth as we move through the bolus of investments in the really expansive and frankly impressive clinical program that our MRL colleagues have put together in the near-term here. Teri Loxam : Let's move on to the next question please. Operator : It's from Navin Jacob with UBS. Navin Jacob : If I may, on KEYTRUDA, the administration will be or the OMB putting out the regulations on or draft guidance on IP. I just wondering to the extent that you can share with us what the average net prices in the Europe relative to the net price here in the U.S.? Is the administration's characterization of EU to U.S. pricing differential of -- or U.S. to EU pricing differential of 1.3 to 1. Is that fair? And then number two, just on the China market, how large is KEYTRUDA right now, roughly analyzing in China that'd be very helpful to us? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Yes. So on the first question, this is Frank, with regards to KEYTRUDA, we're really focused on our overall strong underlying demand in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in our strong data. We haven't shared with regards to net pricing outside the U.S. With regards to China, we see the opportunity as very significant. If you look at the lung market in particular, the 600,000 to 700,000 lung cancer patients in China, half of them have a driver mutation, and we think a couple hundred thousand of those patients are available for treatment with our overall KEYNOTE-189 regimen. So we see China is a very significant opportunity of growth going forward. And we're very pleased that we're rolling out our new lung cancer indication. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Frank. We'll move on to the next question please, Darla. Operator : It\u2019s from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Vamil Divan : So one, maybe just on the lung side, you mentioned the KEYNOTE-042 approval. Can you may be just quantify sort of your expectations on the use of monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 between 1 to 50? And then also the stage three opportunity, I think, maybe because people may surprise with that label expansion. So if you can talk about the commercial opportunities there? And then maybe, Ken, just building on the earlier question around primary care and sort of business development priorities. Can you maybe just comment broader on sort of the size of deals that you want to focus on the science? I think a lot of investors also curious on just as you think about bolt-on versus largest transactions? Or any changes in your priorities there? Teri Loxam : All right. Let's start with Frank. Frank Clyburn : So KEYNOTE-042, we see as a very positive advancement for our position in non-small cell lung cancer. As Roger mentioned, our new indication is based on -- for patients who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemo radiation. So it gives us an entry in the Stage 3 patients. It's a smaller subset of Stage 3 patients based on our indication, but an important indication for us to expand into non-small cell lung cancer. The other aspect of 42 does allow us. It allows to bringing all PD-L1 positive patients in the metastatic setting that would look for a monotherapy option. And there are patients that look for monotherapy options may be based off of their performance status or other co-morbidities. We see this as an important opportunity as well. So we're very pleased that KEYNOTE-042 helps to round out our overall lung story and positions us very strong for future growth in lung. Ken Frazier : Okay. And on the business development side, I would just say that, first of all, last year, we were very active. We did about 60 transactions spanning licensing, technology deals and clinical collaborations. As we said before, our goal is to find the best scientific opportunities that we can. Our balance sheet gives us the opportunity to look across the entire spectrum of opportunities. But we've also been very clear that while we look at everything, what most appetizing to us are the bolt-on deals because we believe that the least disruptive thing from an R&D standpoint. I would also comment that while the end of last year, we felt valuations were going in the right direction with the first quarter 2019 market recovery, assets being more fully valued. And as we look forward, we continue to say we have to be disciplined and look for those opportunities where we can create value going forward. Thank you. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Ken. We'll move on to the next question. Operator : It's from Andrew Baum with Citigroup. Andrew Baum : I have two questions, please. The first one for Roger on V114. I'm simplistically wanted to say, well, your competitor is in market experience that has a great number of stereotype areas, precious for replacement strains. And so I underline the word simplistically. But what is that you believe Merck brings to the table apart from speed to market, which you think is going to make sure that Merck is a major participant both pediatric and adult segments? And then second, in relation to the IPI proposals, and this is addressed to Ken or Frank. What do you think is the ultimate impact of IPI given the ability to negotiate in Europe provides nontransparent discounts but increased lift? Because what is the complexity of -- attacks this pricing the 340B hospitals? How does that all shake out? And do you think it's actually feasible to find a solution that works? Teri Loxam : Let's start with -- thanks Andrew. Let's start with Roger on V114. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : So first of all, we're not inexperienced in the pneumococcal disease market. And we have had pneumovax on the market for decades. This is an area that we know extremely well. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been in development for more than 20 years in our laboratories. In fact, I started these programs through my first tour of duty long time ago. And so we've learned a great deal about how to make these vaccines and make them very efficacious. And particular, we've learned about balancing stereotypes in order to provide the broadest possible response. Over time, our program, which includes not just V114, but others as well, will become an important contributor to human health and protection from pneumococcal disease -- invasive pneumococcal disease both in adults and in the pediatric population. So you'll see that evolve over a period of years. It's going to be an important contributor, no doubt. Ken Frazier : On the international price index situation, so we have, first of all, we submitted our comments. We continue to see that it's not the best approach to dealing with the major problem that we have with patient out-of-pocket cost. I think we are much better approaching. I think it's still early days. I don't know exactly how these kinds of things will be implemented a number of proposals out there, as you know, involving healthcare reform in this country. I would say that we negotiate as much as we can in ex-U.S. markets for the value that we believe that we can bring. And I don't think anyone's opposition that -- by doing that, it's going to improve our ability to negotiate in Europe is really the right thing. Finally, I would say that we've looked at some of the calculations in the report about KEYTRUDA. We're not sure it's actually the right one, but I will tell you that that we continue to focus on the strong data that makes KEYTRUDA a unique product across many indications. Teri Loxam : Right. Thanks, Ken. We'll move on to the next question. Operator : It's from Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala : A couple questions. KEYTRUDA numbers were impressive, but a touch below expectations. Just wondering if there were any one-time factors that impacted the Q1 number? And secondly, on gefapixant, it looks like an effective drug and a safe drug, but I don't believe the Phase II data in OA or OA pain ever was presented neither were other smaller studies that completed sometime ago. So can you elaborate on the data set supporting gefapixant? Thank you. Teri Loxam : Right. We'll first go to Frank on KEYTRUDA. Frank Clyburn : Yes. So KEYTRUDA sales, as we've mentioned, were $2.3 billion this quarter of 60% growth year-over-year as exchange. And what I tend to look at is what's happening from an underlying demand perspective. And when you look both versus prior year and sequentially, we're seeing very good continued underlying demand. You will see quarter-to-quarter some fluctuations based on some inventory movements. But overall, I think that we feel very good about how we're seeing the demand ramp. And in particular, we're seeing strong overall demand with regard to our lung cancer indications both in non-squamous claims and squamous cell carcinoma non-small cell lung cancer. In fact, in squamous cell lung cancer, we're seeing our market shares exceed 75% for new patients. So we've become the standard of care in that subset of patients. We also are feeling very excited about the opportunities outside of lung. In the U.S., as Roger mentioned, we have our new indication now based off of KEYNOTE-426 and renal cell carcinoma. We see that as a very significant opportunity for future growth. As well as Roger also highlighted KEYNOTE-48 with a PDUFA date coming up in June, for head and neck cancer, and we have market leadership position in head and neck and later lines of therapy. And we're very excited about KEYNOTE-48. In addition to lapping, I mention is outside the U.S. as we've been saying, we see significant opportunities based on some of the continued rollouts in Japan and China and in Europe. So we're very confident about the KEYTRUDA ramp and feature growth prospects going forward. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Frank. We will move to Roger. Teri Loxam : On 7264, it makes sense that the underlying logic of this is the belief based on a variety of preclinical studies that the purinergic receptors, and particularly P2X3, contribute to a neuronal hypersensitivity syndrome. So in the setting of chronic stimulation, there's sort of a feed forward phenomenon. And it contributes to Angelin and other sensitivity syndromes. That's true. We believe, in the first case, in the chronic cough setting where an early stimulus, usually result of inflammation leads to a cough syndrome that does not resolve after eight weeks. And in that setting, as we've demonstrated in Phase II studies, gefapixant has dramatic effects, but as well in some other chronic stimulation syndromes. And we're looking at a number of those, including, as you know, endometriosis, there's a lot of preclinical data that supports the conjecture, but fundamentally, we need better clinical data. And that's what we're going to get. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Roger. We\u2019ll move like to the next question. Operator : It's from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff Meacham : Frank, I want to ask about lung trends in the U.S. When I look at brand impact data shows first-line share that stable at around 60% in 1Q. So the question is -- are you seeing any moderation and sequential share gains in the U.S.? And where do you think the ceiling share could be in first line lung? And the recent immune design deal, Roger, can you talk me to more broadly about how you can leverage the technology optimally and now that it's in-house? And how do you guys view a new engine and approach and IO more broadly? Thank you. Teri Loxam : All right. Let's start with Frank. Frank Clyburn : Geoff, in the U.S. and lung, we're seeing is with regards to share, you have to take out patients that do not have EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. So we see our market shares somewhere in the low 70% share for the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer segment. So we see very strong penetration, Geoff, within PD-L1 positive patients. The 15 above segment which we're pretty much getting all of those patients in the 145, we have penetrated very significantly. We still have opportunity for growth in the PD-L1 negative patient population. And that's a focus for the commercial team. So I do see that as being the opportunity we'll continue to educate, in particular the community physicians in the U.S. with regards to lung. As I mentioned with regards to the squamous non-small cell lung cancer patient population, we have penetrated that very rapidly over three quarters. Those patients are now being treated with a chemo combo regiment or with monotherapy. So we still see growth for squamous, but clearly we have penetrated that segment very rapidly. And as I mentioned before, we are very excited not only about lung, but all the other indications that I spoke about, and Roger spoke about that are upcoming new launches for us in the U.S. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Frank. We move to Roger for immune design. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : So in immune design, there were two principal assets and both of high interest to us. I mean, the first is the molecular defined Adjuvant -- Gilead Adjuvant, which we believe could be beneficial for some of our newer vaccines that require Adjuvant and as well for some of the older vaccines where there's a design to get to less of a fewer -- a smaller number of vaccinations. So we're looking at those things very carefully. The Adjuvant has been in thousands of people. And so we already understand its safety profile quite well. So that's good. And the second thing is the lentivirus vaccine, which is unique from several perspectives. The first is its selective targeting of dendritic cells. The second is its high carrying capacity. And the third is that it has already a substantial amount of clinical exposure demonstrating that it actually stimulates an immune response. That can be applied to neoantigens, but it can also be applied, as they have, to more conventional cancer testis antigens, which are often forgotten about. But I think may -- someday have their day in the sun. So we're looking forward to pursuing those kinds of approaches in the combination with other immune modulators that we've already developed. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Roger. We'll move on. Operator : Your next question from Alesandra Chen from Cantor. Alesandra Chen : So my first question is on China. And do you think that individual drugs have blockbuster potential? And if so, what has to change in the market for this to happen? And then just a follow-up question on V114, if it's approved, what is your go-to-market strategy you might have competition that's in the market now and potentially coming? For example, will you target children first and then go after adults? And then what do you anticipate the ACIP recommendation maybe? Thank you. Teri Loxam : We'll start with Frank in China. Frank Clyburn : So with regards to China, we see China is a very significant opportunity for us. As we mentioned, we're seeing very strong growth. And I think, for us, what's important is we have pivoted to innovation in China. And this has always been a part of our overall strategy at Merck. So when you think about the launches right now in China of GARDASIL, of KEYTRUDA, LYNPARZA, LENVIMA, BRIDION, JANUVIA has just now received an NRDL listing. We see significant opportunity for China across a number of products within our innovative portfolio. Teri Loxam : Right. Thanks. We move over to Mike Nally for V114 outlook. Mike Nally : When we think about V114 and the opportunity going forward, we think there's a great opportunity in both the pediatric and adult segments. Obviously, we've had a presence in the adult segment as Roger noted within Pneumovax 23 for over 35 years. And as we think about the pediatric segment, clearly, we were touching all pediatric offices basically around the world with our existing vaccines. And so when we look at the opportunity for 114, a lot of it comes down to really understanding the underlying epidemiology and how that's evolving over time. With 114 at a market level, that is different, but also across pediatric and the adult segments, the epidemiology is evolving quickly. So as we think about the ultimate recommendations, it's clear that customers want choice in this market. And with 114, we think we provide a really valid alternative, especially given the fact that we have a very balanced immune response across all 15 stereotypes that we're covering in our vaccine. And what we're seeing today is that there are some stereotypes that are inadequately covered. And we're seeing breakthrough with those from the existing vaccines. Teri Loxam : Thanks, Mike. We'll move on to the next question, please. Operator : From David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : I have a couple questions. And if I repeated anything from -- repeating anything, I apologize. First, with respect to Animal Health, the constant currency growth was 3%, including 1% in livestock. Was the issue in livestock just at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? I think that you know, there were the Midwest floods and other weather issues at the end of the quarter, but I don't know if there were other things that held back the livestock business. And I think that you said that for the full year you expect growth to be greater than the market for Animal Health. What is the market expected to grow in 2019? And then separately, could you just quantify the inventory swings for KEYTRUDA in the first quarter, and for Gardasil, if there were any for Gardasil? Thank you. Teri Loxam : Thanks. We'll start with Rob on Animal Health. Rob Davis : As you look at what happened with Animal Health in the first quarter, your numbers are quoting are correct. And really what we were seeing is an impact of the cold weather. It's not necessarily the flooding that went through the middle part of the country. It's really more due to the cold weather patterns, which cause the cattle to stay in the fields longer and not move into the feedlots as quickly. And given that a lot of our products are more focused to the feedlots that mix dynamic of just how it played out affected us in the quarter. So that was part of it. We also then just see some buyout from our distributor partners due to some consolidation going on in the distributor space. So it was really a combination of a change in channel and by down to pull down inventory in the channel and the seasonality impacts that affected the business in the first quarter. As we look to the full year, we do expect to grow above market. And if you look at where the Animal Health market has been over the last couple of years, it's in the roughly, I would say, low to mid-single-digits of growth. So we expect to outpace that, and as before, we layer in the impact of the Antelliq acquisition. Teri Loxam : Pass over to Frank for KEYTRUDA inventory. Frank Clyburn : And with regards to KEYTRUDA, as I mentioned, with the brand that is now of this size, you're going to see some slight movements with regards to channel quarter-to-quarter. We're focused, as I mentioned, really on the strong underlying demand that we're seeing in our major indication, as well as the future indications we're prepared to launch. Teri Loxam : Right. Let's move on to the next question, please. Operator : It's from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Arfaei : Frank, a follow-up if I may on the KEYTRUDA opportunity. In China given that it sounds like it's going to become increasingly important. As I'm sure you know there are Chinese companies that are also working on PD-L1, some of them moving to late stage. And these could compete with you on price. So as you look at China longer term. What's the outlook and from a competitive perspective in immuno oncology. And do you also see a future where these PD1s compete with KEYTRUDA in the U.S. and developed markets? And if I may, could you provide your estimated KEYTRUDA sales by indications in major markets? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : So on the -- let me start with the estimated sales in the U.S. by indication. We usually provide that out. So 65% of our sales in the U.S. are lung, 10% are approximately melanoma, and neck represents about 5%. And as I mentioned, we're very excited about the opportunity we have upcoming in head and neck, bladder represents about 5%. MSI-High is become a very important indication for us represents about 5%, and all others approximately 10%. Going back to your question on China, we believe oncology is really a data-driven area, Alex, given the severity of the disease. If you look right now what's been accomplished with KEYTRUDA, and we've always said that this wall of data is going to be important. And I think it's going to be very important for us in China as well. When you think about 18 indications across 11 different tumor types, we believe that this continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. China will clearly be a competitive market. But our first mover advantage with the first-line lung cancer approval, we think sets us up very well. And the local players in China do not have an approved indication right now in first-line lung nor have they conducted or achieve the results of a trial like KEYNOTE-189. So our strategy as we've seen in the U.S. right now, there are five additional competitors there. And we believe our clinical execution and commercial execution and our significant amount of data will help us to compete in China as well as any other market around the world. Teri Loxam : Right. We're going to try to get at least one more, and if we can squeeze it in. Operator : It\u2019s from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : Just a broader question on China in general, big growth in the quarter, but they've implemented certain policy changes like this four plus even tendering process yet a lot of industry participants think is going to slow down overall Chinese growth for multinationals. What is your outlook for that for Merck's overall book of business? The second question is KEYTRUDA. The triple-negative breast 522 has been trial system update. Are we likely going to see data this year? Is that still possible? And if it is, is that just going to be PCR? Or could we actually see clinical efficacy being reported out? Thank you. Teri Loxam : All right. So we'll do Frank comment quickly on China; and then Roger on 522. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : So as I mentioned in China, for us, we have pivoted to more of the innovative products that are driving our growth Gardasil, KEYTRUDA, BRIDION, LYNPARZA and LENVIMA. So we feel that we are very well positioned, and that's going to help us to continue to see growth. We will likely see some impact from some of the older products based on some of the pricing initiatives that are underway in China and some of the provinces. So while we may see some bumping us along the way, we have shifted the majority of our portfolio. Approximately 60% to 70% of it is now is focused on innovative products. So we feel as though that positions us very well not only in the near-term, but for the long-term growth in China. Teri Loxam : Real quick one on Slide 22. Frank Clyburn : On Slide 22, yes, of course, the study is supervised by an external data monitoring committee, and they will be evaluating that it's event-driven. My expectation is that it is possible for sure that we could see some review from them. There was a previous interim which led to the study continuing and our expectation is that there will be an opportunity to see additional data. But I can't speak to what those data will be. And as soon as we know, we'll have the opportunity to announce it. That's basically they're in control. Ken Frazier : So thank you for joining the call today. We are executing well across our business and we remain confident in our performance for the year and the long-term. We look forward to discussing our pipeline and business in more detail at our Investor Day in June. Thank you. Operator : This concludes Merck's first quarter 2019 sales and earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Acceleron Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Ed Joyce, Vice Director of Investor Relations at Acceleron. Please go ahead. Ed Joyce : Thanks and welcome everyone to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast are available on the Investors & Media page of the corporate website at www.acceleronpharma.com. Joining me for the call today are Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer; Kevin McLaughlin, our Chief Financial Officer; John Quisel, our Chief Business Officer; and Sujay Kango, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Todd James our Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans and research activities. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to materially differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent Form 10-K on file with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer. Habib Dable : Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. This is one of the most exciting times in Acceleron's 16-year history, not only have we built one of the industry's most advanced TGF-beta superfamily based pipelines spanning multiple disease areas, but with U.S. and EU regulatory filings under review for luspatercept, we're approaching the potential first approval of Acceleron discovered medicine. Our commercial team alongside our global cooperation partner Celgene is hard at work preparing for luspatercept potential approval. Patient access for this first-in-class erythroid maturation agent remained a top priority. In parallel, we are thinking hard to Acceleron led two clinical programs in neuromuscular and pulmonary disease. Our three ongoing placebo-controlled Phase 2 trials, two with ACE-083 and one with sotatercept has each completed patient enrollment and will help to establish proof-of-concept with top line results from all three Phase 3 trials expected in the next nine months. As we can see, this is meaningful progress for all programs in 2019 and we are well positioned to achieve our near and medium term clinical and regulatory objectives. Turning to luspatercept, in June, we announced that both the U.S. FDA and European Medicine Agency accepted the BLA and MAA filings respectively on this luspatercept for beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome associated anemia. This is a huge achievement for the Acceleron and Celgene teams and represents another important step in delivering this novel therapy to patients. With the filing acceptance, we are pleased with the FDA granted priority review for beta-thalassemia indication with the target action data December 4, 2019 and set a target action data for April 4, 2020 for MDS indication. Likewise, the marketing authorization application for luspatercept and adult patient for MDS or beta-thalassemia associated anemia has been validated by the European Medicine Agency. With the potential decision on the filing expected in the second half of 2020, we look forward to working closely with the U.S. and EU agencies to move this therapy toward approval. Patients are desperately in need of a viable treatment option and we believe that was luspatercept could bring a significant improvement to patients with these conditions by potentially eliminating or decreasing red blood transfusion burden. Further luspatercept clinical development continued with three unbilling clinical trials, first line treatment in lower risk MDS patients, non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalasemmia, and myelofibrosis associated anemia. To that end, we also remain committed to expanding our clinical development plan to additional patient populations with anemia that could potentially benefit from treatment with luspatercept. I would now like to move to our Acceleron led programs beginning with ACE-083 in neuromuscular disease. We\u2019re currently evaluating ACE-083 as a novel locally acting therapy with the potential to improve function in specific target muscles in two ongoing Phase 2 trials in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy or FSHD and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or CMT. Results from Part 1 of the trials demonstrated substantial increases in muscle volume in target muscles. We previously announced full enrollment of Part 2 of the FSHD trial and recently completed full enrollment of Part 2 of CMT trial. To quickly summarize beginning with FSHD, Part 2 of the trial is evaluating 56 patients with mild to moderate to tibialis anterior or bicep weakness, randomized to receive either ACE-083 or placebo. Part 2 of the CMT trial is evaluating in 40 patients with mild to moderate to tibialis anterior weakness, randomized one-to-one to receive either ACE-083 or placebo. Specifically as outlined in this slide, the trial is designed to evaluate similar top line outcome measures post six months randomized treatment period. These include the percent change in muscle volume and the changes in intramuscular fat fraction as well the percent change in motor functions. In the tibalis anterior cohort of the FSHD trial, these include the six-minute walk test, four stare climb, 10-meter walk run. In addition to these outcome measures, we\u2019re also evaluating the change in disease specific health-related quality of life as determined by patient reported outcomes in the FSHD help index and the CMT health index as well as overall safety and tolerability in both trials. We believe that if the trial demonstrates improved functional outcomes, ACE-083 has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with neuromuscular disease and unmet medical needs. We look forward to sharing top line results from both trials. We anticipate FSHD results in the second half of 2019 and CMT results in the first quarter of 2020. I'd now like to move to our pulmonary program where we recently completed enrollment in the PULSAR Phase 2 trial of our lead pulmonary candidate sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension or PAH. We believe that PULSAR's rapid enrollment over the past 12 months, underscores the excitement for the program and the urgency for new therapeutic options for patients with PAH. Currently, the only approved PAH treatments target three main pathways that each promotes vasodilation of the pulmonary vessels to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance or PVR. These therapies are used alone or in combination to improve exercise capacity and slow the progression of the disease. Sadly though, median survival for patients is only five to seven years. We believe that the sotatercept has the ability to engage a fundamental pathway in the disease by rebalancing BMPR2 signaling and potentially restoring vascular homeostasis. In preclinical models for PAH, sotatercept reversed pulmonary vessel muscularization and improved indicators of right heart failure. As outline on this slide, the PULSAR Phase 3 trial is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sotatercept in PAH patients. A total of 106 patients were randomized receive placebo, low-dose sotatercept or high dose Sotatercept in combination with a standard of care therapies. Following the six month primary treatment period, participants in the trial will be eligible to continue in the 18 month extension period. The primary end point of the trial is the change from baseline and PVR and the key secondary end points is chain from baseline is six-minute walk distance. We anticipate reporting top line results from PULSAR trial in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, our clinical team is currently enrolling patients with PAH into the exploratory SPECTRA study. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin McLaughlin, our CFO to review the financials. Kevin McLaughlin : Thanks, Habib. Good afternoon everyone. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of June 30, 2019 were $500.9 million. This cash balance includes the receipt of a $25 million gross milestone payments earned upon acceptance of the luspatercept BLA and MAA filings. This compares December 31, 2018 cash, cash equivalents and investments of $291.3 million. Based on our current operating plan and projections, we believe that current cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund projected operating requirements until such time as we expect to receive significant royalty revenue from luspatercept sales. Collaboration revenue for the second quarter was $27.7 million. The revenue is all from the Company's collaboration partnership with Celgene and is largely related to expenses incurred by the Company in support of luspatercept and includes the $25 million gross milestone payments. The next potential milestone related to the luspatercept partnership is $35 million, due upon first approval from either the FDA or EMA. Total costs and expenses for the second quarter were $48.8 million. This includes R&D expenses of $34.8 million, and G&A expenses of $14 million. The Company posted a net loss for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019 of $17.9 million. I will now turn the presentation back over Habib for final remarks. Habib Dable : Thanks Kevin. So to briefly summarize priorities for the remainder of this year and beyond, beginning with luspatercept in hematology. Our number one priority is the ongoing marketing application reviews with the FDA and EMA. We are also focused on the execution of the ongoing clinical trials in additional patient populations, along with the potential expansion of luspatercept development in other diseases associated with anemia. For ACE-083, we expect top line results from both Phase 2 trial in the next 9 months, starting with FSHD in the second half of 2019 followed both CMT trial in the first quarter. And finally, in PAH, we expect top line results from PULSAR Phase 2 trial in the first quarter of 2020 and preliminary results from the SPECTRA trial in 2020. I will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Gould of UBS. Your line is now open. Andrew Berens : Hi, guys. This is Andrew on for Carter. Thanks for taking our question. I had a couple. So, first on the FSHD study, in order to de-risk the movements in Phase 3, how critical is that as you demonstrated efficacy across both tibialis and biceps patients? I guess that to put in other way, if you demonstrated efficacy in just one cohort, how would you think about the potential profile of that Phase 3 given the more mixed data on the other side? I had a follow-up on luspatercept, but if you can start there, that will be great. Habib Dable : Yes. So, thanks for your question. This is Habib. It's an excellent question and I think was most important is as you mentioned, for us to be able to move forward in the Phase 3, there are a number of things that we are going to be looking at, both with the FSHD study as well as CMT the study, which will be reading out in the first quarter of next year. Just to remind everybody, the primary end point of both studies is looking at the total muscle volume, and then obviously the path forward is really going to driven by our ability to reliably increase functional improvement in the patients that we're treating. And so, whether its FSHD alone or CMT alone or the TAs or biceps, we will be looking at that data to ensure that we been able to achieve some minimum thresholds. And some of those thresholds that we have talk about previously are looking at specific functional improvement such as in the tibialis anterior muscle, we are looking at six-minute walk, timed 10-minute walk run, four-stare climb. And again, we are looking for trends but we are also looking at some deviations from placebo in the double-digit. And that's really what we've given ourselves as a threshold. So, if you decide today as to whether or not we would go with by biceps alone or TA alone or FSHD alone, we're going to be looking at the data in totality and then after that and after having conversations with the regulators, we will get back to you in terms of our path forward for Phase 3. Andrew Berens : And on luspatercept, seeing as you looking to co-promote in the U.S. at your own scheme -- I believe it was 15 or 20, how is Acceleron positioned its team here? In that where do you see Bristol and Celgene operating? And where can Acceleron layer on amplify the efforts here? Thank you. Habib Dable : Yes, that\u2019s a great question and maybe I\u2019ll pass it on to our, Chief Commercial Officer, Sujay Kango to elaborate on some of the details. Sujay Kango : Sure, thanks for that question, and as we have articulated before right, first and foremost, the co-promote allows us to have a dedicated team. And as you articulated, we have about a 20 people field force that is there. So, we solely focused on luspatercept and the approach we\u2019re taking with Celgene side is actually to ensure that there is a surround sound. So we'll be operating with all with two centers as well as the top docile accounts to ensure that there\u2019s coordination, collaboration, and we're going to maximize the opportunity, right. So, we're not limited to a particular sort of cohort oppositions et cetera. What we\u2019re going to do is, synergize and coordinate and amplify what is necessary to drive an optimal value proposition for luspatercept and satisfy customer needs. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Cowen. Your line is open. Yaron Werber : Great, thanks for taking my question. So, Habi maybe I have a couple of questions, the first one maybe just a little housekeeping, but you\u2019re mentioning now approval or EMA decision in the second half of \u201920 for luspatercept. It was filed I believe in early April. So, is it -- are you still sort of expecting a 12-month CHMP clock, and then 2 to 3 months EMA and maybe sort of goes into Q3? I'm just trying to understand, is it the thinking about the second half? And then I have a follow up as well. Habib Dable : Yes. So yes, Yaron, that is our expectation for the second half. And again, as you've alluded to when you were count for all of the clock stops, et cetera. That would take us into a second half potential decision. And so beyond that, we haven\u2019t elaborated which exactly which quarter that would fall into, but you\u2019re right it does account for all the clock stop. Yaron Werber : Okay has there been any request for EMA recently that we need to know about? Habib Dable : No everything remains on track and is going as expected. Yaron Werber : Okay. And then for the full PULSAR study, it\u2019s a 106 patients, it's a randomized 3 to 3 to 4, and so overall, it\u2019s going to be sort of 30, 40 patients in arm or so. And so, I guess like my question really has to be with, do you think is powered for a statistically significant different? Or are you looking at trend at this point? Habib Dable : Yes so, with respect to the primary end point, again primary end point is for PVR, and it is powered to show a difference, and we\u2019re looking for difference for approximately 20% reduction in PVR. Yaron Werber : Okay. And is the primary end point that is in both doses? Or is it one of them, the high dose really powered against the placebo? Habib Dable : Both. Yaron Werber : It\u2019s both okay terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Brill of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Danielle Brill : Thanks again for the questions. A couple for me as well, I guess following up on the last question for the PULSAR study. In addition to PVR, do you ultimately need to see an improvement on the six-minute walk distance to justify moving forward? Or will the PVR end point be enough to go into Phase 3? Habib Dable : Yes, so, it\u2019s a great question Danielle. So obviously, the primary end point of PVR is not going to be enough based on historical approvals that we've seen in this space. The gold standard has been and we believe will continue to be six-minute walk distance. So, we're also looking at some secondary including six-minute walk distance, and we've given ourselves the thresholds there for that functional improvement of 30 meters. Now that said, we do believe that we potentially are approaching this disease area from a very unique perspective to the mechanism of action of rebalancing BMP signaling. And as such, we could, if approved the one of the first disease modifying drugs approved in for these patients. And so, we could have an opportunity to be looking at some unique end points, as we think about Phase 3. And as such, we move forward with the SPECTRA study and we're looking at some unique end points there, such as cardiac MRI, invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing. And so, as we think about Phase 3 once we flip the card on Phase 2, yes, indeed, we do want to see an improvement in six-minute walk, in addition to PVR, but we also could be looking at some creative end points as we think about Phase 3, as we get a better look at some patients as they start coming out of SPECTRA. Danielle Brill : Okay. So would a trend be enough there? Habib Dable : Yes, so I think it's too early to say. Whence we look at the data, well, and we couple that again with what we're seeing in SPECTRA, I think we have a better read. That said, I think 30-meter increase is what we've been hearing from a number of our stakeholders, as a threshold that we'd like to achieve on top of standard of care. Danielle Brill : Okay. And then one other related to luspatercept, you guys mentioned plans for next indications. Can you just remind us, what some indications of interest might be and when we might get an update on that? Habib Dable : Yes, so coming out of last summer, where we announced positive Phase 3 results for beta-thalassemia as well as lower risk MDS, not only were we thrilled that, the luspatercept was able to show that it can be restored healthy red blood cell formation in two very distinct diseases, but also it did so in a safe and tolerable way. Now, just to remind everyone, we do have three ongoing studies today. We've got the BEYOND study, which is looking at non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. We've got the COMMANDS study, which is looking at the frontline settings head-to-head against ESA. We've also got the ongoing myelofibrosis study. So, myelofibrosis is an addition to some of the recently where I guess at JPMorgan, we had announced that, if you looked at beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes and all of the indications including the front-line settings and non-transfusion independence, we saw an opportunity of over $2 billion. If indeed myelofibrosis at the next indications is successful, we believe that that could add an incremental 1 billion in peak sales opportunity. Now beyond that, we also feel that there is an opportunity to cast an even wider net. And the teams, our teams and the Celgene teams are working and prioritizing some of those and they ask what else BEYOND myelofibrosis we could be looking at. We are looking at indications where we believe the unmet need is very high, but also where the mechanism of luspatercept could have a meaningful benefits to these patients. And some of those indications could be alpha-thalassemia, chemo-induced anemia as some examples of areas where we believe the unmet need is high and where we potentially could have a path forward, so some more to come. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Joseph from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Eric Joseph : Just a couple of questions from us, I guess first on FSHD with ACE-083. I guess from talking to doc, it seems that some of the feedbacks that we're getting from docs is that while presumably function in the TA and biceps is important other muscles, shoulders, hip, groin. So, I guess I'm wondering, if more sort of fast forward to where ACE-083 potentially approved. How, whether if kind of speak to, how -- what other the muscles groups you might anticipate the use of ACE-083 and whether other muscle groups might get back into the desirable Phase 3 trial? Habib Dable : Okay. So Eric, you did cut out a bit, but I think what you're asking is based on some of the feedbacks you've been receiving from KOLs is that. The TA and biceps are obviously important muscle that drives disability in the patient early on, but there are other muscles that the disease progress that may warrant perhaps some further studies around and perhaps an opportunity for lifecycle management. Is that your question? Ed Joyce : Let's go. Habib Dable : Yes, okay. I think we may have lost, Eric, but I'm going to assume that, it's the question. So, I guess when we think about it, we were deliberate about the biceps and TA muscle as the early muscle group to be looking at for a number of reasons. One, we have been able to identify these being the actual dominant muscle that actually affected the activity of daily livings for these patients in a very profound way. Furthermore, we also know that specifically if you think about the tibialis anterior muscle in CMT for example, it's one of the earlier muscle that are affected with disease progression. And so, if indeed we are successful with FSHD or CMT or both. We will obviously take a look at the lifecycle management opportunities, and if indeed, we feel to warrant that we can move into other dominant muscles where an intramuscular injection would have potential transformative effects of these patients' lives, then yes, we will consider it. But for now, the focus is really on these two studies and Part 2 of Phase 2 to ensure that we have a reliable functional benefit for these patients as we consider moving into Phase 3 or not. Eric Joseph : Great and one follow-up if I may hopefully, hopefully my line won't disconnect here. I guess other concern, PULSAR with trial fully approved. Can you just comment on the rate of over open label portion? Todd James : Hey Eric, it's Todd. Sorry, you're really breaking out. So, we've heard PULSAR and that recruited well, but then the rest was really hard to hear. Eric Joseph : I'm interested in the rollover rates into the open label extension portion whether the patients continuing on their current dose or being converted to either the lower high dose and the frequency of follow up for PVR back here? Todd James : Yes, it's Todd, Eric. Thanks for the question. Yes, we just finished enrollment and we\u2019re not in a spot to be able to talk about percent rollover at this point, but when me get into the top line announcement for example, that\u2019s something that we could talk about more as all the patients would have hit through the six months. And so, that would be a better data point to get into to what that rollover rate would be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Martin Auster of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Martin Auster : Hi thanks for taking my questions, Habib and company. First one is to just kind of a follow-up and clarify some things from an earlier question. The SPECTRA trial I guess or the standard luspatercept trial is powered for the primary endpoint of PVR reduction. Just want to clarify it\u2019s not powered on the secondary endpoint for six minute walk? And then my second question had to do with you've obviously been in a really good position to be generating significant cash flows pretty quickly potentially from luspatercept. Wanted to talk a little bit about kind of how you\u2019re thinking about external BD discipline going forward, as there's cash flow coming in. What is the sort of magnitude you think about and at what stage assets much of you looking to bring in the pipeline? Conversely, if you have a 100% success which is current kind of mid-stage pipeline so do you think you\u2019ve got adequate resources and kind of cash that you can manage global pivotal registration programs for both assets or would you potentially seek geographic partnerships around those? Thanks. Habib Dable : Yes, so great, Marty. So, the first part of the question was really around powering, and yes, it's high powering for the primary endpoint for PVR. So, really the meat of the question is on the second part, and it\u2019s around our current cash resources and our intent moving forward, both from our organic strategy as well as inorganic. So again just to remind when we raised capital last time in January one of the things that I had articulated was for the very first time I would not be providing a cash run rate guidance as we have done each and every time prior to that. And the reason for that is exactly as you're suggesting Marty is that we believe that based on the current burn rate and assuming that we\u2019re able to conclude all of our Phase 2 trials as planned that our visibility took us to the point where we would have overlapping luspatercept royalties and received various milestones and therefore we never really saw that one year of cash if you will which will typically trigger a need for another raise. Now that said, if indeed we flip the card on all of our Phase 2 programs and we feel that we have the opportunity to move forward and to Phase 3 from a position of strength, or if indeed there\u2019s an inorganic opportunity to help us build out our leadership strategy in any one of the therapeutic areas that we\u2019ve outlined as a commitment to moving forward, then that obviously would potentially change our posture, but again that would be on the heels of positive Phase 2 data. And then looking at Phase 3 investments and that\u2019s whether or not we felt it would be value generating and seeking an ideal partner or if indeed that we'd be better off to go it alone. And so, we will be affecting all of those at the end of Phase 2, but right now as to where we sit, I think we sit in an excellent position where we're able to conclude our Phase 2 studies. And we're able to take a good look at them and then assess what is the best path forward. Martin Auster : I agree you're in an enviable position. Do you have any sense that you can frame for investors in terms of as those royalties kind of start accruing and building up in terms of retaining profitability or maintaining profitability as a metric or how important that's going to be the selling going forward? Or is that going to be dependent on the poly opportunities in front of you in the pipeline? Habib Dable : Yes, so I again, I think at the end of the day Marty, our goal is to do what we do best. And that is to innovate. And to focus on bringing transformative medicines to the patients that we're serving. I think we're in an enviable position from a cash point of view and our ability to dictate our future moving forward in terms of how we would move into Phase 3 if we're successful. But I think we're also in a pretty enviable position that we are, we're in three therapeutic areas where we've got two positive Phase 3 results from hematology. We've got three Phase 2s that are going on between pulmonary and neuromuscular. And we're in a wonderful situation here to be able to take all of those studies to their conclusion, and then assess it to whether or not what the best investment strategy will be. That said, we will always be disciplined, and making sure that our primary focus, as we innovate is to do so in a way that we're continuing to also return value to our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of SVB Leerink. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, how you doing? This is Neil filling in for Geoff. I just have one question regarding luspatercept and the upcoming launch. Can you explain how the responsibilities will be shared between you and Celgene-Bristol? And how do you intend to report expenses and revenues in the U.S. and EU? Thank you. Habib Dable : Yes, great. Thanks for the questions again, I'll pass that commercial question on to Sujay, and perhaps maybe even Kevin for a little detail if there's anything that we can provide on the reporting. Sujay Kango : Sure. Thanks for that, Habib. And so sort of data guide, at this juncture, we are collaborating very closely with Celgene. So our discussions with them in relation to the promotional aspect is we are developing a complete approach to a day one through 90 plan, we have worked together through a joint collaboration committee that needs frequently as well as the joint operating team that meets almost on a monthly basis, to really map out our launch plan our launch strategy of sort of approach to trainings or field team is now hired so they're undergoing training. And so, all of those co-ordinations are taking place jointly with Celgene, and we will be prepared day one, ensuring that there's a sense of urgency to sort of really support the needs of the patients and the physicians. So that's our primary focus. We both equally have a target to call on the beta-thalassemia physician population as well as the MDS physician population, once we have the approval, right. So at this juncture, there's no promotional elements that are going on, there's more training and preparation that's going on at this juncture. So we'll divvy up and sort of call. Now, our territories are larger compared to the Celgene territories, so we actually coordinate at a local level to decide what's the optimal basis for us to really execute as well. And that's part of their account planning and territory planning that we are doing right now with our collaborators with Celgene. Kevin McLaughlin : Hi, Neil. This is Kevin. As far as the reporting goes, as a reminder, Celgene or BMS will be reimbursing us for a large, very large portion of our commercial appetite direct sales force et cetera. So, you will see in the P&L a reimbursement line up in collaboration revenue but the corresponding expenses down in the sales and marketing lines. In addition, revenue obviously will be reported product related revenue for us, royalty related revenue will be reported and we'll have profits in place so that will be reported standalone on a quarterly basis based on the royalty and the achievement. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Yigal Nochomovitz of Citigroup. Your line is open. Yigal Nochomovitz : Hi, Habib, and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the biology of FSHD versus CMT and just in particular some of the differences in those two diseases that could lead to possibly differential muscle growth. And more specifically, is there any reason to believe that either FSHD or CMT is more likely to yield a clinical benefit in the context of a similar muscle volume growth? Thanks. Habib Dable : Thanks for your question. I think I'll pass that on to John Quisel, our Chief Business Officer to elaborate a bit. John Quisel : Sure. Thanks Habib. Thanks for your question. Certainly, one that we thought about a lot as we were setting up these trials, and essentially, these two disease we view as testing different hypotheses about patients where FSHD treatment provides the most benefit. So, I don't think we will take a bet on which one is more likely to work. With FSHD, you have a disease where the pathology is really starting in the muscle with over-expression of the DUCs-4 transcription factor, leading to degradation of the muscle in that regard and the premise of ACE-083 is if we can strengthen and rebuild those muscle fibers it can restore function to the patients. On the flip-side, there are a variety of disorders where patient experienced the death of the neurons and a loss of innervation of muscle fiber and consequently then we give prescription in that setting and that's the CMT trial intended to test. So, there are patients who are having a slow and partial retraction of the neurons that innervate the muscle fibers. And so, what you have is muscles at the limb and the TA muscle in particular at the bottom of the leg is affected where you have only a fraction of the muscle fibers are still innervated as a result, the non- innervated fibers lose strength, manifesting as foot drop for the patient. And there the premise is that if you have a partial loss of strength in the muscle due to loss of innervation, if you can restore muscle mass and strength using something like ACE-083, then you should be able to restore the function. So again, to summarize, two different premises differential disease with a muscle origin like FSHD being tested in that trial and disease with neurological origin like CMT being tested in that trial. And that we wouldn't handicap which one is more likely to work. Yigal Nochomovitz : Okay, got it. And then with respect to the different muscle end points, 6-minute walk to 10-minute walk, run the four stair climb, is there any reason to believe that one or more of those is more likely? Or do you have the higher confidence in one of those end points? Or is it just a matter of seeing the data before you can make any comments there? John Quisel : It really is going to be data-driven, we're, as we know, one of the few companies to run clinical trials in the space and really establishing the endpoints that are appropriate in the related readout with these patients and so we design the trials to measure a suite of different endpoints and we\u2019ll be looking at the totality of the data. Habib Dable : Yes, the only thing I would add to that, Yigal, would be, we\u2019re working very closely with University of Rochester in validating a PRO, it\u2019s the FSHD health index as well as the CMT health index where we\u2019re going to be looking at a number of questions, which affect patients activities of daily living, and we will be also assessing that questionnaire as we look at the Phase 2 data as well and looking to working with the regulators and validating that. Yigal Nochomovitz : Okay that makes sense. And then just one question that wasn\u2019t asked yet, maybe you expected this just like to get your thoughts MDS you received or you and Celgene received standard review in beta-thela's priority review. Was that what you expected? If so, okay, if not I'm curious what you have to say there? Thanks. Habib Dable : Yes, actually, I\u2019ll repeat that what we expected. We actually expecting that have been anticipating a standard review for both indications, but we always said that we would prepared whether it\u2019s from all of our efforts from our commercial footprint, regulatory footprint, supply footprint to be able to execute on whether or not one or both got a priority review, and we were pleasantly surprised that we got a priority review for one of our indications, and we are prepared to execute. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leland Gershell of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Leland Gershell : Thanks for taking the questions and great progress. First question on sotatercept with the PULSAR trial fully enrolled, want to ask if this time you can comment on the nature of the patients who came into the trial in terms of the level of severity of their PAH and essentially the other therapies they were on that they came in on into PULSAR? Todd James : Hey, Leland, it\u2019s Todd. Yes, so far as the patients that were included based off the inclusion criteria we\u2019re looking, functional class 2 and 2 and so, we got what you\u2019d expect from a normal split in a Phase 2 trial of this size. And then as far as single, doublet or a triplet, that really comes down to which countries the patients got enrolled and what the standard of care is for that country. And so, we got that appropriate mix based off of how the trial enrolled per country. Leland Gershell : Okay great, and then just quick couple of questions on luspatercept. I think you\u2019ve mentioned the test you planning to fully publish the data for MEDALIST and BELIEVE. Just wonder if you can comment on that publication strategy, if we might be seeing those coming up in peer review in the near future? Todd James : Yes, so the goal is to submit both of the studies in 2019. And we\u2019re still on track. Leland Gershell : Great and then just last if I may, any comment you can provide on the or color you can provide on the community trial enrollment? Todd James : No, further updates, we continue to be pleased obviously with that study. And once we get closer to full enrollment or absolute enrollment, we\u2019ll be able to provide you a little bit more color in terms of the exact timelines you can expect for top line release, but nothing new to share Leland today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Choi of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Paul Choi : Hi good afternoon everyone. And thanks for taking our questions, maybe pivoting back to 083 for a moment. And with the Phase 2 trials wrapping up and the extension trial getting underway here, can you maybe comment on, what you're thinking with regard to, potential duration here over the longer term? And secondly, what you think as you proceed towards the Phase 3 stage? What the, what is the role of duration and sustainability of the change of muscle, the muscle change and the agencies there going forward? Habib Dable : Yes, hey Paul, it's Habib again. So thanks for your question a very, very important question. And quite frankly, it's really the driver of our investments in the extension study. And when we think about duration, we can really think about it in two different ways. One, what is the appropriate dosing into rollover patients will see a meaningful benefit, whilst at the same time minimizing office visits and/or injections. And two, the other part of duration is looking at how long will the drug last. And so, as you know, our primary end point in part two the study was at six months. And we were dosing frequency of every three weeks. When patients roll over into the extension study, they'll be randomized either for every four weeks or every eight week dosing, and so we'll get a better read there on the appropriate dosing interval for patients to be able to maintain the effect. And again, just to remind everyone, when we took a look back at part one data, and we look back at the extended dosing intervals, we had reason to believe that the efficacy was sustained up to potentially eight weeks, but I guess we'll see if indeed, that's going to materialize in part two, and more specifically, from a functional point of view. With respect to how long the drug will last, again, that's one of the things that we're going to be looking at in the extension study as we follow patients out and so more to come, but at the same time, a very important question on both fronts. Paul Choi : Okay, great. Thanks for that, and maybe just on luspatercept and myelofibrosis. I guess as you think about the Phase 2 data coming up here in the not-too-distant future, can you maybe think about where is the bigger opportunity to where you're more optimistic? Is it in the transfusion-dependent or non-transfusion-dependent population? And do you see, what as being potentially a quicker area for development and potential label expansion? Habib Dable : Yes, so another good question, Paul. So again, when we recruited for the Phase 2 study, we looked at transfusion dependent and non-transfusion-dependent. But we also looked at patients who are on ruxolitinib because of enlarged spleen and those who are not on the ruxolitinib. So we also need to look at that dimension as well. Quite frankly, if you think about it, and our focus in patients with the highest unmet need across all of the disease areas that we focus on, I would argue that the area that's probably most important would be those that are on ruxolitinib because again, to remind everyone, these myelofibrosis patients are suffering not only from an anemia due to a fibrotic bone marrow, but they're also suffering from drug-induced anemia due to just simple mechanism of action of Jak inhibition. So if you think about it from that point of view, and that, our internal estimates here have over half of the patients, myelofibrosis patients who suffer from moderate to severe anemia that have been on, that are on ruxolitinib, arguably those patients that are on ruxolitinib and transfusion-dependent, would most likely be the largest opportunity for us to cater to an unmet need in this population. And by the way, you haven't asked the question but maybe I'll give, state it anyways, Leland Gershell : Yes. Habib Dable : What we have given ourselves also an internal hurdle rate of about 25% to 30% efficacy in this particular group based on a lot of the research and feedback that we've been receiving. So, that's what we would hope to achieve, to give us the confidence to wanting to move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hung of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Jeff Hung : Thanks for taking the questions. For the MEDALIST patient population, you said that the earlier you can get the patients, the changes are better that they'll have bigger benefit from luspatercept. So from a commercial standpoint, what kinds of education or other initiatives are you considering to encourage earlier treatment versus the 44 month median time since diagnosis for patients in MEDALIST? Habib Dable : Yes. So, I think the first thing to keep in mind as we think about our anticipated label for MEDALIST, to remind everyone, these are patients whose endogenous EPO levels are over 200 and therefore they would be ineligible for ESA or if indeed they were refractory to ESAs and approximately 95% of the patients in MEDALIST were refractory to ESAs and as you stated the median time duration from therapy, sorry, the median time to entering to trial from the diagnosis was about 44 months. Now, one other things to keep in mind is that, a lot of patients in the study were on ESAs for 44 months because of the fact that there is nothing else really in terms of an alternative to be able to go on to such as Luspatercept. And so, we're hoping that if indeed luspatercept is approved that if indeed a patient is refractory to an ESA that we may be able to get them earlier by the mere fact we got another approved drug on the market as an option for treatment. But most importantly to get patients earlier, it will be really important for us to be successful in the COMMAND study, because COMMAND study is doing exactly that. It's studying front line dosing of luspatercept head-to-head against ESAs and we're designing it and is superior to design fast and so, I would say by the mere fact of having a drug approved in that indication, I would hope that the time from diagnosis to getting on luspatercept will have shrunk just by the mere availability of another option for treaters and patients, and two, the COMMAND study in itself if successful will be able to get patients earlier. Jeff Hung : Great, thanks and then housekeeping question. Look like SG&A ramped up a little bit from from Q1 to Q2 relative to prior quarters, so given commercial preparations such as your own sales reps, how should we think about SG&A for the rest of the year? Kevin McLaughlin : So, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, sales costs will go up as we just brought on our sales force but that will be reimbursed via Celgene or BMS. So, you will see an increase in the SG&A line by the corresponding increase in the collaboration revenue line. Outside of that it's the normal growth of the G&A coming into the commercial environment and along with additional marketing efforts that support both local luspatercept program, but also our internally owned programs in sotatercept and in ACE-083. Todd James : Hey, Jeff, it's Todd here as you can imagine with four if you include FSHD, CMT now the extension studies the PULSAR Phase 2 trial with the 106 patients in SPECTRA expected trial this is the most internally led program we\u2019ve ever had running at any given time so that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing on the R&D side the increase quarter to quarter and we can expect that through the end of those trials. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kennon MacKay of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is Vikram on for Kennon. I had a follow up on the 25% to 30% hurdle rate you just mentioned on myelofibrosis study if you could please elaborate on that and is that for both hemoglobin improvement and transfusion independence or how shall we be thinking about that? Todd James : Hey it\u2019s Todd yes it is multiple patient population as Habib was just describing that we\u2019re going after in this trial we\u2019re casting a pretty broad and wide net here and so really any patient population that if we meet that bar proportion patients that hits any of the endpoints that would be enough for us to potentially move forward with a Phase 3. And so, that could be monotherapy luspatercept the non-transfusion dependent or the transfusion dependent or it could be in combination with rux likewise anemia only or transfusion dependent though we know over the course of this progression disease a majority of patients over time do become transfusion dependent. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Habib Dable for any closing remarks, sir? Habib Dable : I just want to close the call by thanking everybody for joining us. I thank you for your continued interest in the Acceleron\u2019s story and I very much look forward to meeting many of you over the course of the fall and winter as we close off the year and in the meantime wishing you all a great remainder of the summer. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you sir and thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Company Third Quarter Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Jerome and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs, who will each have prepared remarks. In addition, I'm also joined by Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call. Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should know that, we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. I'd like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. We have also posted a presentation to the Investors section of merck.com, which includes some of the highlights from our results. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call. We're extremely pleased by the performance of our business this year. Execution both in the Merck Research Labs and in our commercial operations has been exceptional and Merck again achieved one of its best quarters in many years. This success reinforces our belief that our science-led approach and the significant focus and resources we are putting into innovation is the right strategy and the best path towards delivering meaningful and sustained value to our patients and shareholders. As we highlighted at our Investor Day in June, we have good visibility into the growth of our derisked portfolio of innovative products over the next five years. We are also confident that the investments we are making now in cutting-edge science focused on areas of significant unmet medical need from discovery through late-stage clinical development, will help us deliver breakthroughs over the next decade and beyond. Notwithstanding the strong momentum we are seeing in our business, we will continue to prioritize business development aimed at supplementing our portfolio and strengthening our pipeline, and we are very happy with additions of Antelliq, Peloton, Immune Design and Tilos this year. We are realizing the benefits of focusing on our key growth drivers and are now operating from a position of strength. With that said, we're also mindful of the changing industry landscape. At Investor Day, Rob spoke about our efforts to best position Merck for the future by becoming a more focused innovation-driven company. In order to realize this vision we are evolving our operating model, driving productivity across our operations and looking for ways to optimize our human health portfolio all in an effort to create sustainable growth. With that, I'll now pass it over to my colleague Rob to review the details of our quarterly performance. Rob Davis : Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. As Ken stated, the strong results we achieved across our clinical and commercial operations this quarter highlight the successful execution of our strategy to drive sustained revenue growth through innovation. As such, we remain committed to continuing to fully invest in our pipeline, while also delivering meaningful operating margin expansion over time through disciplined resource allocation and improved operating efficiencies. Now, turning to our results. Total company revenues were $12.4 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, or 16% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. Both our human health and Animal Health divisions contributed to the growth this quarter. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health revenues grew 16% led by key products in our oncology vaccines and hospital businesses. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales increased 64% year-over-year and for the first time exceeded $3 billion in a quarter. In the U.S growth was driven by strong demand across all indications. In squamous and non-squamous first-line lung KEYTRUDA continues to penetrate all eligible patient populations, including low and non-PD-L1 expressors. The survival benefits demonstrated across our four first-line lung cancer trials, have firmly established KEYTRUDA as the standard of care in these settings. We are also encouraged by our recent launches in new indications. In advanced first-line renal cell carcinoma, we are seeing strong uptake across all three patient risk groups for which we are indicated. And in adjuvant melanoma, the positive momentum continues since our approval earlier this year. We're early in the launch of KEYTRUDA monotherapy and in combination with chemo and first-line head and neck cancer and we've received positive feedback from both scientific leaders and the prescribing community. Outside the United States, KEYTRUDA sales grew 75%, driven by lung globally. In the Europe and the EU, we recently received additional reimbursements for KEYNOTE-189 and we look forward to bringing KEYTRUDA to more patients in those markets. In Japan, we're seeing strong usage across all PD-L1 patient subgroups in lung and we continue to grow our share in bladder cancer. And in China, first-line lung is the primary driver of growth and we are excited by the recent approval based off of KEYNOTE-042. Our results also reflect continued strength for both Lynparza and Lenvima, important products from our collaborations with AstraZeneca and Eisai respectively. In fact, our revenue from both products more than doubled in the third quarter. Lynparza growth reflects further uptake in ovarian cancer based on results of SOLO-1 in the United States, as well as strength in Europe, China and Japan. In the United States, Lynparza has over 60% total patient share in the PARP inhibitor class. This leadership sets us up well as we look to broaden the use of Lynparza across additional indications in the future. Launches in hepatocellular carcinoma particularly in the United States, China and Japan, continue to drive increased use of Lenvima. Also, we are early in the launch of the first approved combination of Lenvima and KEYTRUDA to treat certain patients with endometrial carcinoma and we expect more approvals in the future. Turning to vaccines. Our vaccines business reflects continued growth in our pediatric portfolio as well as strength in GARDASIL, which is primarily due to growth outside of the United States. The timing of public sector purchases negatively impacted our U.S. revenue in the third quarter. Our hospital business benefited from 32% growth in BRIDION, reflecting strong performance in the United States due to increased share within the reversal market. Animal Health revenue increased 12% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Livestock grew 12% due to the contributions from the products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition. Companion animal sales also grew 12%, driven by our BRAVECTO line of products, partially due to the timing of purchases last year. Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.9% in the quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by unfavorable manufacturing variances. Operating expenses of $4.8 billion increased 6% year-over-year. Higher administrative and promotional expenses for our growth pillars drove higher SG&A costs in the quarter, while higher clinical development spend and costs associated with our discovery efforts, drove higher R&D expense. Other income and expense was unfavorably impacted by lower income in our equity securities portfolio as well as higher net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.7%, driven by a lower assumed full year effective tax rate as a result of favorable earnings mix. This represents a decrease of 320 basis points year-over-year. Taken together, we earned $1.51 per share, an increase of 27% excluding exchange. Now, turning to our outlook for the year. We are narrowing and raising both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges for the full year of 2019. We now expect revenues of $46.5 billion to $47 billion, which represents a 10% to 11% growth versus 2018. This includes the impact of the GARDASIL CDC stockpile borrowing, which will negatively impact our fourth quarter revenue by approximately $120 million. Our updated revenue range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly two percentage points using mid-October rates. We are lowering our non-GAAP expected tax rate to roughly 17.5% for the year. Our revised non-GAAP EPS range is now $5.12 to $5.17, which represents growth of approximately 18% to 19% versus 2018, including a roughly one percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. All other elements of our guidance provided in July remain unchanged. Before I conclude, I'd like to take a moment to put our 2019 results into context. Our expected top and bottom line growth rates for the full year are exceptional. While we continue to expect strong revenue and EPS growth in 2020, there are a few things, I'd like you to keep in mind as you think about your models. First, we expect increased pricing pressure in 2020. Second, demand for GARDASIL continues to outpace supply and we expect tempered growth rates for the product versus what we reported over the last couple of years. And third, as you'll recall, we expect to face elevated pressure mainly on Noxafil and NuvaRing. That being said, we remain very confident in our business. We continue to expect strong revenue growth each year through and including 2023, a year where we still believe our revenue prospects are underappreciated. In summary, our third quarter results and updated guidance are another proof point of the confidence we have in our business and our strategy. More importantly, our innovation-led approach continues to positively impact the patients we serve. As such we will continue to invest in research and development, which we believe will be the source of significant and sustainable value for both patients and shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks, Rob. During the third quarter, we advanced important new indications for key products, presented significant new data at scientific meetings and made meaningful progress in building our research portfolio. Turning first to progress in oncology approval. During the third quarter, received accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA for KEYTRUDA when given in combination with LENVIMA in patients with advanced endometrial cancer whose disease have progressed following prior systemic therapy and whose tumors are not mismatch repair deficient for MSI-High. This approval marks the first of what we believe will be a large set of opportunities to combine LENVIMA which we're developing in collaboration with our colleagues at Eisai in Japan with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of advanced malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and urothelial cancer. As noted in our press release, the FDA also accepted our sBLA filing for the use of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that is not curable by surgery or radiation, with a PDUFA date of June 29, 2020. Separately, we also received European Medicines Agency approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA and Pfizer's Inlyta based on data from our KEYNOTE-426 study. This regimen, as Rob mentioned, is one that has gained substantial traction in the United States. Meanwhile, in China, full approval of KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 on at least 1% of tumor cells based on our KEYNOTE-042 study, was also obtained. We are optimistic that this new indication will provide benefit to the very large number of patients in China, who each year are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. Outside of oncology, the U.S. FDA granted approval for PIFELTRO when combined with other agents and DELSTRIGO as a single-tablet combination in HIV-infected patients who are virologically suppressed and on a stable regimen. This is the so-called switch indication. We believe that PIFELTRO, our second-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor offers many opportunities for combined regimens including with islatravir, our investigational nucleoside transcriptase and translocation inhibitor. Also in the infectious disease area, we obtained Phase 3 data in the hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia where RECARBRIO met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority versus the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam. Together with ZERBAXA, RECARBRIO will offer we believe a full suite of options for the treatment of serious bacterial pneumonias. I'm exceedingly proud of my colleagues in clinical development and in regulatory affairs, whose exemplary performance in 2019 has led to these approvals. The third quarter also saw the presentation of important new data at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting including the PAOLA-1 trial, demonstrating the activity of Lynparza, which we are developing with colleagues at AstraZeneca, in this case, in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who had previously responded to platinum-based therapy. But we also have the PROfound trial in which delayed radiographic progression of malignancy was demonstrated in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose tumor cells bear homologous recombination repair gene defects. And we have progressed our next-generation hormonal ablation therapy. Studies incorporating Lynparza have now yielded positive Phase 3 data in four different tumor types : breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate. Phase 2 trials encourage the view that the addition of KEYTRUDA to Lynparza therapy could prove advantageous, especially in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Phase 3 trials exploring this hypothesis are currently under way. Also at the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings, data from our KEYNOTE-522 study of KEYTRUDA as neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer demonstrated a statistically significant increase in pathologic complete response rate, confirming what we have seen previously in the Phase II I-SPY 2 trial. These data, coupled with additional results from the adjuvant portion of KEYNOTE-522 which demonstrated a trend favoring KEYTRUDA administration on event-free survival, auger well for future outcome measurements in this ongoing Phase 2 trial. Time does not permit me to highlight the many advances that have been made in earlier segments of the pipeline where critical work is being done. However, I wish to note that as the third quarter came to a close we celebrated the opening of our new discovery research facility in South San Francisco, where we expect over a period of time to accelerate the translation of fundamental breakthroughs in biologic understanding into therapies that improve and extend lives around the world. In this context, I cannot fail to mention that The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency has recently adopted a positive opinion for V920, our experimental vaccine designed to prevent transmission of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus. As all of you are aware, V920 has been thoughtfully deployed to help slow the spread of a recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our teams have shipped nearly 0.25 million doses of V920 with colleagues in the World Health Organization and other agencies, health care workers who are performing heroic work in very dangerous environments by immunizing those at highest risk for exposure to this deadly virus. They and we believe that approval of the V920 vaccine will ultimately permit routine use of this important tool to prevent outbreaks of Ebola virus infection, wherever and whenever it is needed. We will now take your questions. Peter Dannenbaum : Jerome, can you line up the queue please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ken Frazier : Good morning, David. David Risinger : Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. So, obviously, the results were very impressive. Congrats on the quarter. My questions are first, could you just talk a little bit \u2013 excuse me, about what inning Merck is in with respect to 189 adoption in Europe? My understanding is that you haven't booked any 189 sales in certain countries yet in the third quarter, but I just don't know how you would characterize the adoption of 189 in Europe to-date. And then second, Roger, could you please discuss the market opportunities and timing for KEYNOTE-604 in small cell lung cancer and KEYNOTE-355 in triple-negative breast cancer? Thanks very much. Peter Dannenbaum : Frank, do you want to start off? Frank Clyburn : Sure. Good morning, David. With regards to Europe in 189, we received reimbursement in Germany in mid-Europe. That was approximately last year. It's almost been a year when we had launched in Germany and got reimbursement. We now are very pleased that we have reimbursement in all of the major European markets. Spain just came onboard with reimbursement this past quarter, and we now have added Italy for reimbursement, which is just taking place this month as well as France. So we are in early innings in some of the markets with regards to 189. As I mentioned, Germany and mid-Europe we've had that product in combination reimbursed now for a while. Peter Dannenbaum : And Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Right. David, look clearly the major opportunity in lung cancer is in non-small cell lung cancer. But small cell lung cancer is important as well and so we are encouraged to think the breadth of activity of KEYTRUDA are ambiguous and we're encouraged to believe that there will be meaningful opportunity in small cell lung cancer as well based on the 604 trial. For triple-negative breast cancer, I mean, again, I would highlight that the KEYNOTE-522 data demonstrate a really quite dramatic improvement in pathologic complete response rate under circumstances where optimal neoadjuvant therapy is given and the trend is really quite impressive. I mean, there's a 27% roughly improvement in pathologic complete response; the event-free survival data had -- has a ratio of 0.63. That's really quite remarkable. And although we had set an extremely high bar there and didn't meet our statistical test at that point, as I said it, certainly augurs well for what the subsequent outcome measures will look like. Over time, I think that will really have a big effect on the how triple-negative breast cancer is treated. And those individuals who are not treated with a neoadjuvant kind of regimen KEYNOTE-355 offers a real opportunity. Obviously, we have to wait for the data and we're looking forward to seeing that at some point in the future. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question, Jerome Operator : Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. I guess my first question was just on operating margin expansion. I know you had previously moderated some near-term operating margin expectations based on investments you're making, et cetera, but we are seeing strong year-over-year improvement. So can we think about continued strong margin improvements as we look out into 2020 and 2021 assuming solid top line trends? Or is there another step-up of investments we need to be keeping in mind as we think about margins over the next year or two? My second question was on GARDASIL capacity at this point. I think you noted that growth may moderate in 2020. Can you just give us a bit more color on how much capacity you have left at this point, as we think about just how to kind of quantify that slowdown? And then as a follow-up to that longer-term, can you just give us an update of when we should think about more substantial expansion of GARDASIL capacity? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks. Rob, you want to start off on margins? Rob Davis : Yeah. Yeah. Good morning, Chris. To your question about operating margins, I think what you're looking at as you see the results year-to-date in the third quarter of 2019 is really just the power of what happens when you get accelerated revenue growth. And frankly, we've seen revenue growth as you've seen from the way we've been raising guidance for the year is outpacing even our own expectations. So, as a result of that, we have actually seen stronger operating margin improvement in 2019 than we expected. As we look forward we continue to see increases in operating margin every year, but our view really hasn't changed that as we look at 2020 that is still a year of investment where we do expect to continue to make sure we fully invest behind what is a growing and exciting pipeline of opportunities both in oncology and vaccines and other areas that Roger has touched upon. And then we really do expect to see operating margin then to be more meaningful as we look in 2021 and beyond as we see the rate of R&D growth slow to rates lower than sales. So, our overall view hasn't changed 2019 is just really exceptional because of the strength we're seeing in the topline. Peter Dannenbaum : And Frank on GARDASIL capacity? Frank Clyburn : Sure Chris. And so we are seeing continued strong underlying demand which was highlighted once again for GARDASIL, this quarter growing 27% and significant growth outside the U.S. What we have done and put in place is we are increasing our production from our existing plants. And as we mentioned on Investor Day, we commissioned the construction of two new bulk GARDASIL manufacturing facilities which we hope to bring online in 2023. So, in 2023, that is when we will expect to be able to ramp our supply up to meet the ex-U.S. demand. We decided to borrow from the stockpile, as Rob mentioned in his comments, really to support routine vaccinations in the U.S. as well as to free up some manufacturing capacity to make doses for other parts of the world. So, anticipate additional supply coming onboard significantly in 2023. We do believe we can still grow GARDASIL over the next several years as we continue to match and move supply to match our demand around the world. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you. Next question Jerome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions. The first is on your tax rate. You mentioned favorable product mix impacting the tax rate guidance for the year and in the quarter. Is KEYTRUDA one of those favorable mix drivers? And specifically is it set up in a tax-advantaged way such that as this product continues to do very well the tax rate for Merck could continue to drift lower beyond where it is in 2019? Second question is on KEYTRUDA. Data sets starting to roll in showing that CTLA-4 has activity in lung. Data sets like Checkmate-9LA and Poseidon, you have a program in this area. When can we expect Phase 3 data from Merck on KEYTRUDA plus Yervoy in lung? And then more broadly can you just kind of comment on the market's perception and fears that we've got competitive threats coming to KEYTRUDA in front-line lung from Bristol and Astra and whether that's something that analyst models accurately capture in your view? Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Tim. Rob will start off with the tax rate. Rob Davis : Yes, good morning Tim. With regard to your question, actually I think the comment I made in the prepared remarks is that it's due to favorable earnings mix. And the reason I'd just clarify that is that both are based on product mix as well as geographic mix. So, it's both and it's more than just what you see with KEYTRUDA, although KEYTRUDA is produced in a tax-favored jurisdiction. So, we do get benefit from seeing growth in KEYTRUDA, but it's not the only thing driving it. I would highlight as you look at this year's tax rate and just to remind you that in the first quarter, we did have some discrete items that drove our rates a couple of points lower. So, we are benefiting from that as well. And as we look forward into 2020 we have not finalized our plans so I'll only give official guidance. But I would just make sure you kind of keep that view in your mind as you balance your thinking around positive trend forward relative to where we are and where we've been. Peter Dannenbaum : And Roger on CTLA-4 and maybe to Frank on the competitive dynamics. Roger Perlmutter : Yes. So, of course, we do expect that over time there will be many, many different programs that will try and address non-small cell lung cancer and it's important that that happen. I should point out that the set of studies that we have already performed provide an enormously strong foundation for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. When you look at monotherapy the 024 data and PD-L1 greater than 50%, that's an extremely strong data set, similarly with KEYNOTE-189 similarly with 407. So, the platform is enormously strong and that's what you see reflected in the market. I think all of us are eager to understand whether anything else could be added to KEYTRUDA. But thus far we don't have any data that really support that. Our own study, our 598 study with KEYTRUDA and ipilimumab will provide, we hope, definitive information on whether the addition of ipilimumab CTLA-4-directed monoclonal antibody actually improves results as compared to what is seen with KEYTRUDA alone. Now, thus far it's kind of a mixed bag from what we can see. Of course we don't have the data to really look at with respect to 9LA or Poseidon. And so we'll have a chance to look at those data and on the basis of that to make a judgment about benefit, risk profile and how best to treat these patients. Frank? Frank Clyburn : And what I'll add is that in the marketplace right now and I'll separate a couple of things in the U.S., we have established KEYTRUDA very strongly as a standard of care in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Approximately eight out of every 10 eligible patients are receiving a KEYTRUDA regimen either a monotherapy or in combination. And what we're hearing from both the academic community or academic physicians I should say and the community physicians is that they really believe KEYTRUDA now has established itself as a standard of care in lung. I think also importantly, we have to note that there's significant real world experience based on our first-mover advantage with KEYTRUDA in lung. So while we know, it'll be eventually competitive in this space, we feel very confident on our position. If I look outside the U.S., I think it's important to note not only the significant regulatory approvals we received, but also the HTA reimbursements we now have. And that takes time. And it also is important to note that HTA bodies really do look at the magnitude of the effect of the data that you're bringing compared to other standards of care and we have done extremely well from a reimbursement perspective and positioned-well as I mentioned in Europe. China we also are very well-positioned with our first-mover advantage in lung based off of 189 and KEYNOTE-042 now in monotherapy. And also we're very well established in Japan. So as I look around the world, I feel very confident about our overall lung position. Clearly as Roger mentioned we'll have to wait and see some of the additional data sets. But going forward, we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow KEYTRUDA and continue to grow in lung cancer. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. You may ask your question. Seamus Fernandez : Great. Thanks for the question. So I was hoping, Roger might be able to give us some thoughts on data that were presented at ESMO in combination with an antibody drug conjugate in bladder cancer. Specifically, Roger I'd just love to get your thoughts on how you think about ADC technology at this point in time? And just, sort of, your broader thoughts on the ability of ADCs, which historically have been a little bit difficult to manage as linkers have improved, as data has improved along those lines? Just wondering what your thoughts are on the -- how validated ADC technology is? I know it's not an area where Merck has an obvious presence. So just wondering what other work might be -- Merck might be doing there. And then a second question, Rob as we see the numbers continue to expand, I have to imagine that the cash on the balance sheet that continues to accumulate, it needs to have some thoughts around capital deployment. Can you just give us your thoughts on where Merck is most focused in terms of deploying that building cash forward in the context of the concentration that we're starting to see increasing in KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL going forward? And we've certainly had a very narrow conversation around Merck and the future of Merck on the call so far today. Thanks. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger take ADCs. Roger Perlmutter : Seamus, so with respect to ADC technology, well as you point out there's a long history here on the attempt to couple toxins to anybodies with the idea in mind that one could selectively deliver toxins to tumor cells goes back nearly 50 years to work, for example, done at Texas Southwestern by Jonathan Noah [ph] and Alan Butetah [ph] over a period of decades now, refinements have taken place first with the substitution of more selective monoclonal antibodies, a better linker technology. As you point out initially, hydrolyzable and non-hydrolyzable and back. And the choice of toxins, it started out with ricin and then more convention toxins -- more conventional toxins were used. And I think we're beginning to see some evidence of selectivity. I think there are a few points to make. First, it's worth keeping in mind that when you're administering this toxin conjugate, there still is a pretty significant body burden of toxin. And so the benefit, risk profile has to be examined very carefully in such setting. And second is that what we've learned over time is that the choice of the antibody target really matters a lot. And finding selective tumor targets is extremely important. With that as background, I would say that the data that we obtained in collaboration with our colleagues at Seattle genetics using the EV, I'll abbreviate it that way toxin conjugate that they've developed, really were very impressive. They have monotherapy results, which they presented in a combination with KEYTRUDA looked really quite impressive on a first pass, which certainly is intriguing. And we're looking at all of those kinds of things and asking ourselves are those areas where additional leverage can be made and gained in combination with KEYTRUDA? Rob Davis : Thanks Seamus. To the question on cash flow, you are correct that the business is doing quite a nice job of generating cash flow really which is testament to the overall strength we can see in the business. As you look at our capital allocation as you're going forward, it's really unchanged. First and foremost, we will continue to fund the operations. As you know we continue to invest meaningfully within our growing R&D portfolio of opportunities. We are investing meaningfully in capacity expansion to address the growth we see in our vaccines business oncology business and our Animal Health business. And so we will continue to do that. Beyond that we are still very committed to our dividend. But as you look at the excess cash flow beyond that, our goal continues to be to invest in business development, I would point out to your one comment about the call being narrowly focused on KEYTRUDA. I do think it's important that people continue to realize while KEYTRUDA is truly a foundational product, we are a lot more than just KEYTRUDA. We have growing excitement about the broader oncology pipeline we have with Lynparza Lenvima the over 20 mechanisms we have in development that Roger has talked about in the past. Our vaccines portfolio continues to grow very nicely. I think overall vaccines grew 18% in the quarter. And you saw obviously good growth with GARDASIL our pediatric vaccines. I mean, we have a great pipeline with CMV, dengue, RSV. A lot of excitement around our HIV portfolio we have that Rogers touched upon in his prepared comments and broader in our antibiotic space and then obviously Animal Health. So we have a lot internally just to be excited about. But with that said, we are looking to continue to augment that through business development. And that's our hope to deploy the cash flow we'll generate to that. And then obviously to the extent we have any cash left over after those efforts we will return it to shareholders. So that is our strategy and pretty consistent with where we've been. Peter Dannenbaum : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch with SVB Leerink. You may ask your question. Daina Graybosch : Hi, thank you for the question. I have a few on the early-stage setting and how I-O and KEYTRUDA may evolve there. You have several adjuvant studies that have a neoadjuvant component like KEYNOTE-756 and KEYNOTE-7 -- 671 among other. The first question is, do you expect these to release the neoadjuvant results from the interim analysis? The second question is, what do you think will be required for regulatory approval in neoadjuvant settings in breast cancer triple negative as well as hormone positive and other indications? And then finally what are your expectations that you do get approval for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant settings? Do you think physicians will also use KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting? Or will they wait for adjuvant data for that use? Roger Perlmutter : Well Daina lots of questions there. Let me try and break them out. First of all, we do have a lot of studies in neoadjuvant and those studies are driven by fundamental observations. I think what we've come to recognize is that KEYTRUDA works well in settings where there is a inflammatory response in the tumor. And tumor cell death however it's caused, whether that's the result of radiotherapy or the result of chemotherapy or potentially even the result of surgical wounds that inflammation that takes place is augmented by the presence of KEYTRUDA which improves responsiveness. And we see that in preclinical models and it's played out in the clinic as well and are -- has driven a lot of our thinking about combination studies. And so that naturally led us to perform neoadjuvant studies and we began these some time ago. And we're beginning to see results in early stage and even in Phase III studies. And I talked about the KEYNOTE-522 neoadjuvant data in triple-negative breast cancer which of course were built on the I-SPY 2 data we have earlier all of which suggest that neoadjuvant can provide good responses. You specifically asked though about release of data from interim analyses. And clearly we will release those data as those data are important and that we -- and people need to hear about them. So it's really just a function of the -- what data we get. And generally we tend to see these as important results that we want to present in scientific meetings, so we generally don't provide detailed information in the context of an investor presentation. But we tend to present these in a scientific setting as we did at the European Society meeting in September. Now the requirements for regulatory approval are the traditional requirements here and that is the agency is going to be interested either in evidence of a favorable benefit/risk profile in the outcomes of treatment or they're going to want to have a surrogate that they believe is validated with respect to those kinds of endpoints. And I think that that will be true for the neoadjuvant studies and adjuvant studies as we've seen in the past. And our expectations are as I've indicated that this is going to prove to be an extremely important area which is why we have so many neoadjuvant and adjuvant studies currently under way. We have something on the order of 100 of them altogether in various different settings. So it's really quite an important area for us. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. We are hoping to get to everyone\u2019s question. So I\u2019d like ask if everyone could limit it to one or two that would be great. Next question please, Jerome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. You may ask your question. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much. Rob, I actually wanted to touch up on operating margin, a little more specifically. And by my math, I'm seeing 37.1% operating margin this quarter, which is materially higher than where consensus is in 2020 and 2021 as well. And my question is, do you expect operating margin to be lower in the next couple of years versus where it stood in 3Q 2019? And then secondly, maybe different - Animal Health for a second. It seemed like BRAVECTO has been a very strong driver over the last several years. And my question is, how do you expect your reported Animal Health revenues to change now going into next couple of years with Zoetis launching their Trio. And what's your timing of a potential Trio filing? Thank you very much. Rob Davis : Yes, I appreciate the questions. On the operating margin, I don't want to get into specific guidance. As I said, I think, if you look at this year the growth we had in operating margin is exceptional because of the fact that sales outpaced our expectations and frankly outpaced our spend. So that's really driven by the power of what the revenue line can give. And beyond that I would wait till we get to our 2020 guidance to get more specific as we look forward. With regard to Animal Health and what we're seeing there so you are correct BRAVECTO has been an important growth driver for that business. We're now actually now also though seeing good growth overall coming from the production side of the business as well. You saw that livestock grew 12% in the quarter driven by the benefits of the Antelliq products we brought into the company as well as good growth in companion animal. As we look forward, we continue to believe that the Animal Health business will grow at a rate faster than the overall market driven by the innovative products we have both in companion animal as well as across the broader vaccines portfolio and other portfolio of products we have. So our view of the strength of the growth in that business hasn't changed long-term. As we look at the triple combo that's coming from competitors we actually have some programs in development. We haven't really commented specifically on those, but safe to say, we're aware of that and work is under way in our own portfolio. But I'd bring you back to the benefits we see from our BRAVECTO product. It is the only 12-week oral therapy in the marketplace today and we continue to see that in very good demand and frankly believe that that will be a competitive product even in light of an evolving competitive set through innovation which we will eventually match through our own development efforts. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Geoff Meacham : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just have a couple of quick ones. Rob or Frank when you talk about the opportunity in China broadly, can you talk about the pricing strategy at a high level? I'm just trying to understand given the size of the population, the upcoming competitive I-O backdrop when you think about companies in the region? And the second one is for Roger. I know, 522 questions have already been asked, but I wanted to ask you more broadly. Given the results in triple-negative breast is this an indicator of success in the bigger segments of the market in cold tumors? I know you got to look at each study individually, but I-O activity in cold tumors obviously has thus far been pretty underwhelming. Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, thanks. Frank on China? Frank Clyburn : Sure. So on China, we feel very pleased and we mentioned this too on Investor Day at our current growth rate. This quarter you see we grew 98% and year-to-date we've seen very strong growth in China. It's really been driven by KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL Lynparza, Lenvima and also Januvia, when it was added to the NRDL in 2017. With regards to some of the pricing dynamics in China, we do anticipate based off of volume-based pricing and the rollout to additional provinces that there will be some headwinds and pressure on some of our more mature brands in China. As we mentioned even with that we're still very confident because the majority of our portfolio is now pivoted to the innovation side and that is what is going to drive the growth going forward. As far as NRDL and access we are still working -- we are actually working through the NRDL process right now in China. We'll have to wait and see how all that plays out but we're encouraged about China both today in the self-pay market. And then obviously if we do receive NRDL reimbursement it opens up a significant amount of new patients that we could treat with KEYTRUDA as well as other parts of our portfolio. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Roger? Roger Perlmutter : And Geoff, thanks for the question. I think as you point out the fundamental issue is that while we see terrific results with KEYTRUDA in a substantial fraction of cancer patients that still leaves a substantial fraction -- a very substantial fraction in some tumor settings, who just don't respond and the question is why. And we've published sort of data in which we presented 2-axis plot of inflammatory response versus tumor mutational burden, which are related but only weakly. And it is the case that tumors with higher mutational burden, especially very high mutational burden as you see in the MSI population respond extremely well. The question is that \u2013 that we are asking in a whole variety of studies is how can we take this less responsive tumor populations and make them more recognizable and a better trigger for immune responsiveness that can involve combinations with other agents that can involve interventions that cause mutations to become fixed a whole variety of other things that we're pursuing. Ultimately, that will be an important frontier. We do see KEYTRUDA as a foundation for that treatment. It will be KEYTRUDA plus other things that will enable us to gain access to these less responsive patient populations. But we're hard at work on it. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. You may ask your question. Mara Goldstein : Thanks so much for taking our questions. The first one is I recognize that China has had very good growth at 90%-plus this quarter. But I'm just wondering what the thoughts are around economic sensitivity. Should there be some type of projected economic slowdown? And then I want to ask a question on Gefapixant and the endometrial pain study. We noticed in ClinicalTrials.gov that there is a slight lengthening of the estimated completion and I'm wondering, if this is a function of why was this rolled out in that indication? Peter Dannenbaum : Frank, on China? Frank Clyburn : Yeah. So on China, what is happening is with regards to the four plus seven pilots so there are pilots that are under way in China that are looking at tendering processes for some of the more mature brands across the industry. Right now, the impact to us has pretty much been Cozaar and SINGULAIR the two products. However, for us as we go forward and as that process, we do anticipate will expand into the 31 provinces over time in China, it really will put some additional pricing pressure on our more mature portfolio as I mentioned. Just to give you a perspective, the reason why we're seeing the significant growth in China is because two-thirds of our portfolio already is in the innovative part of our business. So those products, we feel very confident will not be a part of the volume-based procurement rollout, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow not only near-term, but also over the next several years and long term in China. And it's really being driven by the innovative portfolio of KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, Lenvima, GARDASIL JANUVIA and some other additional launches that we plan. So, while there'll be headwinds to the older portion of the portfolio, we feel very good that our pivot to innovation has really helped us not only in the near-term but will continue to help us in the long term. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger on gefapixant. Roger Perlmutter : On gefapixant, I mean we \u2013 as you indicated Mara, we're pursuing a set of interesting indications with this P2X3 antagonist set, because we think it could turn out to be broadly useful beyond the chronic cough indication where we are in Phase 3. But I wouldn't read anything into the timing of completion of studies. We update ClinicalTrials.gov as we get more information from clinical operations. When we start out particularly in these syndications endometrial pain and other areas where we're not 100% sure about feasibility we make a guess on what we think enrollment rates are going to be in sites. And of course, every study is different because the enrollment criteria are different. And as we prosecute these studies, and we get better estimates of when trials will actually complete we update ClinicalTrials.gov. It's not a tool that helps one resolve specifically what's going on in the marketplace. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Navin Jacob with UBS. You may ask your question. Navin Jacob : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. On GARDASIL the U.S. was strong this quarter despite a tough comp from last year. Wondering if that's partly what you're attributing the decline in Q4 to. You're saying Q4 will be down I think $150 million or there'll be a work-down of $150 million. Is that part of just a push out of what was supposed to happen this quarter on a relative basis? Or is there growth this quarter in underlying demand above and beyond I think what any of us expected? And then just maybe a question for Roger. Roger wondering your thoughts on cell therapy some of the new modalities whether it's TILs or APCs as a means for targeting particularly checkpoint inhibitor refractory patients? Thank you very much. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Frank, U.S. GARDASIL? Frank Clyburn : So GARDASIL grew in the U.S. approximately 3% if you exclude -- or excluding FX. Underlying demand growth and price did drive growth, which was partially offset in Q3 by CDC purchasing timing. So we did not see CDC purchases in 3Q as we expected, which is why you saw a 3% growth. The borrowing that we mentioned or that Rob mentioned earlier on in the call will be borrowing that will take place in the fourth quarter of this year which will reduce our fourth quarter sales by approximately $120 million compared to Q4 of 2018. Peter Dannenbaum : And Roger on cell therapy? Roger Perlmutter : On cell therapy, we love the data in hematologic malignancy and I think it challenges how to translate into -- that into solid tumors where the tumor-specific antigens are less clear. Obviously, if you're targeting CD19 and you get rid of all the lymphocytes well patients can live with the elimination of all the lymphocytes including of course the malignant ones, but normal ones too. If you're targeting on the other hand antigens which are not sufficiently tumor specific in solid tumors then you potentially do enormous damage to normal structures and that's problematic. I think there are some things on the horizon, which will improve that and we're watching them carefully. And clearly with the other areas you mentioned tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, so better protocols are evolving. So it's an area of great interest and clearly something that we would want to incorporate as time goes by and things get better. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. We\u2019re going to try and get it two more questions please. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Your may ask your question. Steve Scala : Thank you. First Roger as a medical doctor, if you were caring for a first-line lung cancer patient where would you prescribe Opdivo plus Yervoy instead of KEYTRUDA plus chemo? And how big is that population? And then one for Frank. PROQUAD had a strong Q3, which followed a strong Q2 which in Q2 you said was attributed in part to buying in the private sector. So how sustainable is the strength we've now seen several quarters in a row? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Well Steve with respect to first-line non-small cell lung cancer, it is -- looking at the data that we've seen presented in some detail which is the 227 data both in publication and presentation at ESMO, it's difficult to identify the patient population in which a combination of in this case Opdivo and Yervoy would be the right choice. But I think that the argument that has been made by our colleagues at Bristol-Myers is in particular they're looking at those individuals in whom there is less PD-L1 expression. I think you'd have to look at those data very carefully because of course our data in PD-L1-negative patients in the chemo combo setting is I think really quite strong and the safety profile that we've rollout to a KEYNOTE-189 data and as it's being used in the marketplace is also very good. So I'm just not sure where I see a special niche for the use of a combination of a CTLA-4 antibody. And I'm eager to see our own data as I indicated for the 598 study to actually get a better sense of what ipilimumab, Yervoy will add to KEYTRUDA. And that might help to refine that question a little bit, but I can't really come up with a specific answer to it. Peter Dannenbaum : And Frank on pediatric vaccines? Franklin Clyburn : Yes. And so we saw to your point another very strong quarter of 19% growth. In the U.S., the growth was about 12%; ex-U.S. 52%. The growth is being driven in the third quarter by increasing demand. There were some price benefits. And there is some offset by a buyout that did take place in Q2. We'll expect to see some additional buyout as we get into Q4. But overall the demand for our pediatric vaccines continues to remain strong. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, and last question please. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Terence Flynn : Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe two follow-ups, just wondering if you are planning to file for approval of KEYTRUDA, in neoadjuvant, triple-negative breast based on the PCR data from 522 or if you're going to wait for the EFS data. And then, Rob, you mentioned, pricing pressure in 2020. Can you quantify the impact there relative to what you're seeing in 2019 and any particular areas to call out? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, Roger, on 522? Roger Perlmutter : On 522, we are -- pulled the data together. And we're having discussions with regulatory agencies. And we'll see exactly how that goes over time. And of course in the meanwhile additional data will accrue. So we'll see where we get to. Peter Dannenbaum : Frank or Rob? Rob Davis : Yeah. And on the question of pricing pressure really the context in which I was commenting was just to make sure as we look at what is truly exceptional growth in revenue and earnings, in both the quarter of 2019, third quarter of 2019 as well as what we had guided for the full year. And as we think about growth going into next year, and as you think about your models to be cognizant of the fact that we do expect to see incremental price pressure over and above, where we have been in 2019. I'm not going to specifically quantify it, but it was really to give you directional thinking as you look at your growth models for next year. Peter Dannenbaum : Great and Ken? Ken Frazier : Okay. In closing 2019, is shaping up to be a year of very exciting growth for our company. And we're looking forward with great confidence, in our ability to execute and innovate. We're confident, but we're not complacent. To the contrary, we're determined to use our strong current position, as an opportunity to take the steps necessary to ensure Merck's continued success long into the future, including pursuing the best avenues for inorganic and organic growth, as well as evolving our operating model to drive productivity across the operations, and look for ways to optimize our human health portfolio, all in an effort to create sustainable growth for the long-term. Thank you very much. And we look forward to updating you on our progress as we go forward. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you.

We have also posted a presentation to the Investors section of merck.com, which includes some of the highlights from our results and announcements. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Peter. We're very pleased to speak with you this morning as we close out what we consider to be an exceptional year for Merck. And we're excited to announce our intention to create two leading growth companies through the spinoff of our Women\u2019s Health, Legacy Brands and Biosimilar Products into a new company. As you can see from our results and our 2020 guidance, Merck had an extraordinary year and is in a position of operational and financial strength, driven by strong execution of our strategy and focus on our key growth drivers and innovative pipeline. It is this position of strength, born of that focus that gives us the confidence to do what we believe will best position us to deliver even greater value to patients and shareholders. Throughout my entire tenure as CEO, we have consistently focused on science as core to our strategy to not only benefit the most patients, but also as a means of creating the most value. As you\u2019ve seen, Merck's portfolio has evolved from one focus largely on primary care products to one focus on oncology, vaccines, hospital and animal health. It is this purposeful shift, coupled with greater prioritization and focus on key growth drivers that has led to the unprecedented growth that we are now experiencing. Going forward, we see even greater opportunities to invest behind our innovative growth drivers. In placing greater focus and prioritization behind these products, we must also think carefully about how to make the best possible use of the remainder of our expansive Human Health portfolio, which is comprised of more than 160 products in total. Our responsibility to patients and shareholders has led us to think about how we can maximize the impact of this vast array of Human Health products. Therefore, after careful consideration, over time, we've made the decision to separate into two companies : One, a research intensive biopharmaceutical leader; the other, a new company, focused on becoming a leader in women\u2019s health, with the capability to realize the full potential of a portfolio of trusted and medically important legacy products and a rapidly expanding biosmilars business. By spinning off NewCo as a distinct business, we can better prioritize and support a set of products that no longer fit in Merck\u2019s strategic framework but which remains important to public health and the patients who rely on them, and which if managed and resourced appropriately, present real opportunities for growth. We're also mindful of the changing industry landscape and believe that evolving our operating model in this way will allow Merck to benefit from an even more intense focus on breakthrough science and innovation. As I stated on our Investor Day in June, our mission and rich legacy of inventing to save and improve the lives is the foundation of our Company. The separation of NewCo will help us in our aspiration to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company by allowing us to focus on innovations that prevent and treat diseases. And over the past two years, we have seen how more focus and more prioritization leads to more growth, more efficiency and more value-creation. The spinoff will also create significant opportunities for NewCo. As an independent company, NewCo will pursue its strategic intent of becoming a global leader in women\u2019s health, an area where the future opportunities are significant. In addition to the growth potential in women\u2019s health NewCo's growth will be fueled by more fully realizing the full potential of a portfolio of trusted legacy brands in pain, dermatology, cardiovascular and other areas, as well as its rapidly expanding biosimilars business. This new company will have a strategic freedom to pursue additional growth opportunities through lifecycle management and targeted acquisitions and partnerships in women\u2019s health, dermatology and other fields. NewCo will be led by a highly experienced leadership team including Kevin Ali, who has been named Chief Executive Officer. Kevin has a proven track record of leadership at Merck with deep experience in global pharmaceutical markets and diverse therapeutic areas. In addition, NewCo's Board will be shared by Carrie Cox, who has extensive experience in pharmaceutical commercialization, particularly in Women\u2019s Health as well as broad leadership and board experience, including as former chairman and CEO of Humacyte, former chairman Array BioPharma And as president of Global Pharmaceuticals at Schering-Plough, prior to its merging with Merck. We are confident that NewCo will be in experienced and capable hands with this leadership team. Our industry faces emerging challenges such as the rising cost of innovation and increasing pressures around pricing and market access. In this environment, we must maximize our opportunities to access greater operational agility, efficiency and productivity. As separate, more focused companies with more optimal resource allocation, both Merck and NewCo will be better positioned to continue to positively impact the lives of patients, improve global public health and achieve faster growth. As a result, we expect Merck\u2019s shareholders to benefit through ownership of two focused companies, each with attractive financial characteristics and growth profile. In summary, we are seeing the benefit of focusing our organization on its best growth opportunities. As we look at out to 2024, we believe the strength of our business is under appreciated. We are more confident than consensus on every key financial metric, including revenue, operating margins and EPS growth. Our commitment to maintaining and growing the Merck dividend is evident of the confidence we have in the long-term prospects for our business. Our fundamental operating and financial strength allow us to take bold steps to stay ahead of the curve by reshaping our operating structure, focusing and streamlining Merck, enabling Merck to become an even stronger, more agile and faster growing company. I strongly believe that this is the right thing for patients, for public health and for shareholders. With that, I'll now pass it on to Rob to discuss our results and provide more details on the spinoff. Rob? Rob Davis : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to speak to you this morning about our 2019 results, as well as our decision to spin off a portion of our Human Health business, a decision that will enhance the value of both Merck and NewCo. 2019 was a year of exceptional growth for our business with revenues increasing 13% and non-GAAP EPS increasing 21%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our strong performance reflects the continued execution of our science-led strategy, and we expect our business momentum to continue, particularly as we enhance our focus on our key growth drivers through the spinoff. I'll start by highlighting our strong fourth quarter results before providing more details on the transaction and 2020 guidance. Total Company revenues were $11.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8% year-over-year, or 9% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. Both our Human Health and Animal Health divisions contributed to the growth this quarter. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health revenues grew 8%, led by products in oncology and hospital. In oncology, KEYTRUDA fourth quarter sales were $3.1 billion and for the full year sales exceeded $11 billion, representing 58% growth versus 2018. In the U.S., growth was driven by strong demand across all indications. KEYTRUDA continues to lead across many indications, including lung, bladder, and head and neck cancers with strong momentum in adjuvant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma where we're seeing strong uptake across all patient subgroups. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA sales in the quarter grew 15%, driven by lung globally was reimbursement for KEYNOTE-189 now secured across all major markets in the EU, and strong uptake in lung, following approvals in Japan and China. We're also seeing positive uptake from early launches in both, renal cell carcinoma and adjuvant melanoma in the EU and expect to see strong global growth as these and other new indications continue to roll out. Our results also reflect continued strength for both Lynparza and Lenvima, important products from our collaborations with AstraZeneca and Eisai, respectively. Lynparza continues to have strong growth in ovarian cancer, and maintains a greater than 60% total patient share in the PARP inhibitor class in the United States. Growth at Lenvima benefited from the launch of the endometrial carcinoma indication, in combination with KEYTRUDA and continued strong demand in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma, where Lenvima is now the leading treatment agent. Our vaccines business declined this quarter due to the impact from the replenishment of GARDASIL to the CDC stockpile in 2018, and our borrowing from the stockpile in the fourth quarter of 2019, which negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison of GARDASIL revenues by $245 million on a combined basis. Excluding these impacts, GARDASIL revenues grew 16%, driven by continued strong underlying global demand. Our hospital business benefited from 24% growth in BRIDION, which reached $1 billion in annual sales for the first time this quarter. Growth was largely driven by an increased share in the U.S. reversal market. For the full year, we achieved strong growth of 14% in our Human Health business, driven by our growth pillars across most geographies. Animal Health revenues increased 10% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Growth for quarter was driven largely by the products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition. Now, turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 72.6% in the quarter, a decrease of 240 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher inventory write-offs. Operating expenses of $5.2 billion increased 10% year-over-year. Administrative and promotional expenses drove higher SG&A costs in the quarter, while clinical development spend and cost associated with our discovery efforts were responsible for the increase in R&D expense. Other income and expense was positively impacted by income from our equity securities portfolio, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.9%, driven by lower and favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.16 per share, an increase of 12% excluding exchange. Now, turning to our announced spinoff. As Ken noted, by further evolving our operating model and separating into two simpler, more focused and agile companies, both will be better positioned to respond to the changing external landscape, improve efficiency and accelerate growth, creating greater value for patients and shareholders than would be achieved as a single company. Spinning off NewCo accelerates Merck's revenue growth by up to 1 percentage point on a compounded average basis through 2024. But more importantly, it allows Merck enhance focus on its key growth drivers and robust pipeline. This gives us confidence that Merck will realize even greater incremental revenue growth over time. We will also benefit from more streamlined processes in operations, enabling further operating model efficiencies across the value chain. For context, the products to be spun off into NewCo represent about 15% of Merck's Human Health revenues, based on 2020 forecast, while consuming a much larger share of our operations and resources. In fact, separating NewCo will reduce Merck's Human Health manufacturing footprint by about 25%, the number of products by 50% and the number of SKUs by 60%. As a result of the more optimized operating model, Merck will achieve even higher operating margins over time, creating additional headroom to invest in innovation, which we continue to believe is the key to our long-term growth and value-creation, as Ken has referenced. Merck will continue to benefit from broad commercial scale, driven by its key growth pillars in oncology, vaccines, hospital and animal health as well as our diabetes franchise. Merck will continue to have a strong balance sheet with significant cash flows and financial flexibility, which will allow for investments and innovation and meaningful business developments to augment its pipeline and portfolio, while continuing to return capital to shareholders. We expect to complete the transaction in the first half of 2021. Until then, we will remain focused on continuing to successfully execute our strategy and maintaining our strong financial and operational performance. Now, let's move to our outlook for 2020, a year in which we continue to operate as a combined entity. My remaining comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. We expect full year 2020 revenue to be between $48.8 billion and $50.3 billion, which represents 4% to 7% growth versus 2019. This range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of less than 1 percentage point using mid-January rates. Our gross margin will be roughly 75.5%. We expect operating expenses to increase by low-single-digit rate year-over-year due to higher R&D spending as we remain committed to fully funding the meaningful opportunities in our pipeline. SG&A expenses will remain tightly managed. We expect other expense of roughly $200 million, driven by higher net interest expense. We expect our tax rate to be roughly 17.5% to 18.5% for the year. We project average diluted shares to be 2.54 billion for 2020. And we expect EPS to be between $5.62 and $5.77, which represents growth of 8% to 11%, including a roughly 1.5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange, using mid-January rates. Longer term, Merck continues to expect strong revenue growth, driven by growing demand for innovative products. And looking out to 2024, we believe our revenue growth potential is underappreciated, even more so as we begin to realize the benefits of this transaction. We continue to expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time. The separation of NewCo enables $1.5 billion in pre-tax operating efficiencies, ratable over three years. While initially Merck's operating margins will decline slightly, we expect to achieve operating margins of greater than 40% in 2024, higher than Merck would have achieved as a combined company. The transaction is expected to result in $8 billion to $9 billion of proceeds from a special tax-free dividend from NewCo. Merck's capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and we expect to maintain a very solid financial and credit profile. First and foremost, we will fund our best growth opportunities through investments in R&D, product launches and capacity expansion. And we believe the spin-off allows us to better focus on these activities. Merck's dividend will be unaffected by this transaction. And we anticipate future dividend increases from the current 2020 dividend of $2.44 per share, post separation with the goal of achieving 47% to 50% payout ratio over time. We will continue to have ample capacity for value-enhancing business development. And finally, we will continue to repurchase shares as a way to return excess cash to shareholders. Turning now to NewCo's financial profile. The products represented by the new company portfolio are expected to achieve 2020 revenue of approximately $6.5 billion with an operating margin of approximately 45% as part of Merck. As an independent company, NewCo is expected to achieve the low-single-digit revenue growth off of a 2021 base of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Taking into consideration the cost to operate as an independent Company, operating margins for NewCo are expected to be in the mid-30% range and increase over time. And finally, we anticipate EBITDA margins to be in the low to mid-40% range in 2021 and also increase over time. NewCo will have strong cash flows and a balance sheet positioned to invest in growth opportunities and expects to pay a meaningful dividend, which will be at least as competitive as any likely peer company and entirely incremental to Merck\u2019s dividend. In total, we expect combined EPS of the NewCo and Merck together to initially be nominally lower than what Merck would have achieved without the spinoff. But, as a result of the incremental growth that NewCo will achieve standalone, combined with the benefit of the operating efficiencies that Merck will realize, we expect that shareholders owning both companies will realize higher EPS within 12 to 24 months. In summary, we are confident that through the spinoff both companies will have strong prospects for future success and sustainable profitable growth, given the clear benefits each will realize as independently operated entities, including enhanced strategic and operational focus on our key drivers to accelerate growth, improved agility to anticipate and respond to customer needs in evolving market dynamics, simplified operating models with reduced complexity and improved efficiencies, optimized capital structures and resource allocation to pursue their distinct strategic agendas, and improved financial profiles, making for unique and compelling investment cases. We are excited by this opportunity to create two patient focused growth companies and look forward to continue to deliver significant long-term value to our patients and shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks, Rob. Looking back on 2019 and in particular on our fourth quarter results, there is much to celebrate. In December, our KEYNOTE-057 data were reviewed at an FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting, which was followed three weeks later by FDA approval of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with high risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. This represents the 23rd FDA-approved indication for KEYTRUDA, broadening still further the benefit that can be expected from the use of KEYTRUDA in the urologic setting. KEYTRUDA also gained three new approvals in Japan during the fourth quarter as combination therapy and the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma based on the KEYNOTE-426 study and for the first line treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, either as monotherapy or when combined with chemotherapy, based on results of the KEYNOTE-048 trial. The KEYNOTE-048 data also permitted approval of KEYTRUDA in Europe with the similar indication. Finally, we gained approval of KEYTRUDA in China for the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in combination with chemotherapy, based on data obtained in the KEYNOTE-407 study. Substantial progress was also made in the registration of Lynparza, our leading PARP inhibitor that we are developing in collaboration with colleagues at AstraZeneca. At the December FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, a majority of committee members supported the use of Lynparza as first line maintenance therapy for patients with germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progress after at least 16 weeks of first line platinum-based chemotherapy, all based on data from the Phase 3 POLO trial, which demonstrated a 47% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the Lynparza treatment arm. FDA granted approval for Lynparza in this setting at the end of 2019. I should also note the data from our PAOLA-1 trial of Lynparza were accepted by the FDA for priority review with the PDUFA date of the second quarter of this year. In PAOLA-1 maintenance Lynparza plus bevacizumab treatment of women with advanced ovarian cancer that had responded to first line platinum-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 41%. Additional trials supporting the use of Lynparza in the treatment of men with the mutation selected metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the Phase 3 PROfound study was also accepted by the FDA for priority review with the PDUFA date in the second quarter of 2020. While we're certainly very active in advancing new cancer treatments, during the fourth quarter, we also made important progress in other areas. For example, in the management of highly resistant bacterial infections, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion for RECARBRIO, our novel combination of imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam for the treatment of infections due to aerobic gram-negative bacteria with demonstrated resistance to other agent. RECARBRIO is also under priority review by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms with the PDUFA date of June 4th. Important progress is also made in cardiovascular medicine with the completion of the Phase 2 VICTORIA study, in which vericiguat, a novel guanylate cyclase activator being developed in collaboration colleagues at Bayer, was found to reduce the composite risk of heart failure hospitalization, or cardiovascular mortality as compared with placebo, in patients with worsening heart failure with the reduced ejection fraction who are receiving standard heart failure therapy. Time does not permit me to list the many other regulatory and clinical milestones that we achieved in the fourth quarter. However, I cannot fail to note that ERVEBO, the first effective vaccine against an ebolavirus was approved by the FDA and received conditional approval from the EMA for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus. We have now provided more than 275,000 doses of this vaccine by experimental and use protocols to support the efforts of the World Health Organization and other agencies attempting to halt the spread of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Approvals have also been obtained in certain African nations, including Burundi, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo itself, which should greatly improve the process whereby individuals at high risk can be immunized. It has taken many years to reach this important moment. My colleagues and I feel privileged to have contributed in this way from the control of an otherwise fatal disease caused by the Zaire ebolavirus. Lastly, I wish to comment on the spinoff of the new company that we\u2019ve announced this morning. I\u2019ll begin with a deep belief in the power of simplification to enhance productivity. My colleagues and I have important objectives over the next few years that will, we hope, improve treatment for malignant disease and heart failure and provide vaccines that reduce suffering from infectious diseases. Simplification of our corporate structure can only sharpen our focus on these critically important programs. I have confidence that we can achieve this increased focus internally, while providing the near-term support necessary to implement NewCo to establish itself as a highly effective separate entity. I will now turn the call back to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Roger. And before turning the call over to Kevin, I'd like to take a few minutes to share with you some details on his background. Kevin brings a wealth of knowledge to NewCo, based on three decades of pharmaceutical and commercial experience at Merck. His experience ranges from leading different regions including our entire international Human Health business, and the emerging markets region to leading markets such as Germany and Turkey. Most recently, Kevin has been instrumental in evaluating Merck's options to optimize the entire Human Health portfolio and in envisioning what success looks like for NewCo, while providing invaluable counsel to me and the rest of the senior management team. I'm confident that under Kevin's leadership, NewCo will reach its full potential and drive great value for patients, shareholders and employees. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin Ali : Thanks, Ken, and good morning. I'm excited to share with you today the creation of our new company, which we believe has a remarkable opportunity to unleash the potential of a leading portfolio of assets in women's health, a rapidly growing biosimilars business and a portfolio of trusted and medically important legacy brands. NewCo revenue was expected to be flat to declining through 2024 within Merck due to limited investment focus. However, we believe that by allocating the appropriate resources and by focusing management's attention, NewCo will achieve sustainable growth and create value outside of Merck. Although revenues are expected to decline in 2021 versus 2020 to a base of approximately $6 billion to $6.5 billion, largely due to the loss of exclusivities of Zetia in Japan, and NuvaRing in the U.S. The new company will be well-positioned to achieve low-single-digit revenue growth off of that base. As no new LOEs loom and we have identified lifecycle management and commercial investment opportunities, some already underway. NewCo will have a strong global scale and geographic diversification and as a standalone entity will be better positioned to capitalize on attractive opportunities across this portfolio. NewCo will pursue global leadership and sustainable growth in women's health to its growing contraceptive and fertility business including Nexplanon, which grew 14% in 2019, and is the leading implantable long-acting reversible contraceptive worldwide with U.S. patent protection through 2027. In fact, we expect Nexplanon to be our first billion-dollar women's health product. The growing $40 billion women's health market is highly fragmented, with over 400 products in development industry-wide. NewCo will be well-positioned to capitalize on this attractive market opportunity to become an industry leader through investments in both organic growth and business development opportunities, and to deliver better and more innovative and holistic care to women. NewCo growth will also be driven by biosimilars business in the early stages of a long-term growth opportunity, with three products currently on the market through its partnership with Samsung Bioepis. Revenues of the three currently marketed products are expanding rapidly and were approximately $250 million in 2019. NewCo is well-positioned to benefit from increased biosimilar demand as markets around the world continue to seek healthcare cost savings through greater biosimilar adoption in a growing market. The women's health and biosimilar businesses will represent a larger proportion of NewCo's revenues over time and are expected to account for more than 50% sales by 2024. NewCo will also have the opportunity to realize the full potential of its portfolio of globally trusted legacy brand through increased focus and targeted investment. Importantly, the infrastructure and cash generation within this broad portfolio provides the scale, geographic reach and capital to support the growth opportunities that the women's health and biosimilar businesses present. In addition to its strong product portfolio, NewCo's global scale and geographic reach will serve as an important competitive advantage. The Company will have the capability to potentially commercialize and distribute for other innovative industry players. Finally, NewCo will be a highly profitable with stable and strong cash flows. As a standalone company, it will be able to make the capital allocation decisions that best suit its long-term interests, including organic and inorganic growth opportunities, paying a meaningful dividend, debt pay-down or returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase. In summary, I'm very excited about the future of NewCo and the opportunity to work with Carrie Cox. This Company will have a distinct opportunity to address the health needs of women around the world and to build off of important growth pillars such as Nexplanon, pain and dermatology and biosimilars. As a focused company with dedicated resources, a strong global footprint and talented and experienced employees who embody the shared values of the Merck culture, NewCo will be better positioned to create value for patients and shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Kevin. We recognize today's upfront comments ran longer than normal. So, we're prepared to extend the call beyond 9 a.m. if necessary. So, Carlo, will you please line up the queue for Q&A? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Obviously, a lot of news there today. I just had two really, both related to the spin. I guess, first on this. You mentioned you've been considering a deal like this or some structure for these assets for quite some time. I guess, why now on the timing? Is there something that\u2019s either happened with the business or the pipeline that made this -- make particular sense now versus I guess when you've worked at this in the past? And my second question is, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the $1.5 billion operating synergies correctly. Should we think about that as a net reduction in OpEx relative to what the combined Company would have spent or is that savings that goes to RemainCo and should be balanced against some of the stand-up costs that you're referring do with the NewCo? Thanks very much. Ken Frazier : This is Ken Frazier. Let me start with the why now. The reason why we're doing this now is that our fundamental and financial strength, which is being driven by the focus on our best opportunities for growth, allows us now to do what\u2019s strategically correct for the company in the long term. This is about taking actions today that will assure the long-term growth and viability of Merck, as well as allowing products that no longer fit into our strategic framework to prosper in a new organizational structure. So, from our standpoint, this is the right time. A few years ago, when we were looking at this, we saw the opportunity, but for example, the cash flow generation of our legacy product was being employed at that time and standing up our oncology business from which we grew from the ground up, and as you know, have been extremely successful. That success has been due to our ability to allocate capital to a business that we didn't have before and getting the entire organization focused and aligned around an opportunity that we had around KEYTRUDA and other compounds behind KEYTRUDA. So, that is why we can do it now. And I said before, we are confident about our long-term growth prospects. And one of the ways in which we try to manifest that is by saying we will maintain and grow the dividend on the Merck side, irrespective of losing these brands. Peter Dannenbaum : Okay. Rob on the efficiencies? Rob Davis : Good morning, Chris. On your question, so the way you should think about is the $1.5 trillion of operating efficiencies, our incremental cost savings in Merck after the spin-off is completed, the stand up costs that are required to support the new companies are really contemplated -- if you take the fact that we commented that there's 45% operating margin for the new company within Merck and it goes to 35%, roughly mid-30s after the stand up. That 10 percentage point delta is really the stand up costs. So, those are not -- those are separate independent from the $1.5 billion of net benefits, net synergies that will be joined by Merck going forward in its operating results. Peter Dannenbaum : Next question, please, Carlo? Operator : Next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Go ahead, please. Tim Anderson : Thank you. A couple of questions on spin and then a science question. On the new company to be spun out, will that be doing real R&D and have its own R&D engine? When you talk about sustainable growth, I'm just wondering if part of that\u2019s going to come from genuine R&D? And then, on RemainCo, updated views on Animal Health. Should we assume that this new split means that the remaining parent Merck company is even more likely than ever to keep Animal Health in perpetuity? And then, last question is on the adjuvant IO opportunity. Roger, in my past discussions with you, you've been highly confident the PD-1s will work in adjutant setting. Recently, we saw Roche failed in bladder. There's been some timeline slippage, we haven't seen any adjuvant trial timelines pulled forward, no trial stopped at an interim, unlike we have with metastatic disease in the PD-1. So, my question to you is, are you still highly confident that PD-1s are going to work broadly across tumor types and adjuvant? Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks. Kevin, on the research and development capabilities of NewCo. Kevin Ali : Thanks. Good morning, Tim. Yes. NewCo will have a high quality development capability, and is really well-positioned as a partner of choice for other biopharmaceutical innovators who are looking to realize commercial growth through our global scale and presence in selected international market to increase patient access. Over time, NewCo will build a research capability in selected therapeutic areas starting with women's health as a core pillar of its business development strategy, and then will move further from there. Ken Frazier : Tim, on your question about Animal Health, I'll start by saying, we never say what's going to happen in perpetuity, because we regularly review our entire portfolio and make decisions about which parts of that portfolio belong in our portfolio and which ones would be better off. As we look at our Animal Health, we believe, if you look at its growth, if you look at its profitability, we continue to believe that we are in effect advantaged owners of that business going forward. We also believe that that is an important key growth pillar that actually helps us in the long run. As you know, there are ups and downs in the pharmaceutical business. And having a business like vaccines, having a business like Animal Health gives us the long-term stability that actually allows us to confidently pursue our R&D mission. Peter Dannenbaum : Okay. Roger, on adjuvant? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Tim, on the question of the immuno-oncology in the adjuvant setting, I can't speak generally about PD-L1 and PD1 antagonists, but I can talk about KEYTRUDA. First of all, of course KEYTRUDA is already effective in the adjuvant setting as we\u2019ve shown in melanoma. And we also showed the effects in the neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer in the I-SPY 2 study and as well in the 522 study most recently, and that is a combined neoadjuvant, adjuvant study and we'll be seeing the adjuvant data in not too long time. And you shouldn't really expect adjuvant data to be pulled forward, because by definition, patients who are receiving adjuvant therapy are patients who have better overall survival over a longer period of time. So, one expects to see those adjuvant results roll out with a more defined cadence. And I think that's exactly what we'll see. And based on our success in two prior settings, I would think KEYTRUDA should be successful in these settings as well, in general. It works better when used earlier. Operator : Next question is from Steve Scala of Cowen. Go ahead, please. Steve Scala : One of the concerns investors have with Merck is the view that its outlook is heavily dependent on KEYTRUDA, and formation of NewCo would seem to increase this risk and concern. So, Merck appears to not agree that this is a concern, and I'm wondering if you can elaborate on why. And then, second, what was the rationale for leaving Januvia within Merck as opposed to NewCo? It seems placing Januvia within NewCo would have made Merck\u2019s outlook appreciably clear going forward. Thank you very much. Ken Frazier : Well, let me start on Januvia question. We continue to believe that our diabetes franchise is going to be an important contributor to Merck now and into the future. We're also continuing to do significant research in the whole cardiometabolic area. So, that's an area of focus for us going forward. In terms of the issue around KEYTRUDA concentration risk, we are mindful of that. We think KEYTRUDA revenues as a proportion of total revenues only increase by a small amount, because of this. I think, the most important thing that I would say about KEYTRUDA is that right now we continue to see the benefits of our focus both in terms of R&D and commercial execution going forward. We see it as driving more growth going forward for the Company. But we also see the benefits of our other opportunities in oncology. We have more than KEYTRUDA, we have Lenvima and Lynparza. We also have 20 molecules behind that. We also have our vaccines business, our hospital and specialty business. So, we're looking to optimize our entire portfolio and augment our pipeline through business development. That's how we see our future growth, not so much these brands, which as Kevin said, left to their own, would probably decline more steeply than they are in the NewCo. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Rob, anything to add? Rob Davis : Yes. Steve, just to kind of build on your point about why Januvia in Merck as opposed to NewCo. As we look at it, clearly, we continue to benefit from the fundamental cash flow and strength that that business gives. While it\u2019s not a growing business, it still is generating a lot of cash flow. But, in the near term, as we approach LOE, it will continue to be important for Merck. This is an important brand for us. And frankly, if you look at the NewCo company, while the loss of exclusive to Merck frankly does not affect our ability to deliver growth, as we've already commented, even through the loss of exclusivity in 2023, 2024, we grow each and every year through that period. So, we're able to absorb the loss of exclusivity, benefit from the cash now, that type of clip would be insurmountable to the new company. And then, finally, and Roger can comment on it in more detail. But, we continue to do some pretty interesting science in the cardiometabolic area. And so, exciting opportunities are there. So, continue to see from a scientific perspective fit as well. For all of those reasons, we felt keeping it within Merck made more sense than moving that over to the NewCo. Operator : Next question is from Andrew Baum of Citi. Go ahead, please. Andrew Baum : Couple of questions, please. Firstly, you initiated your islatravir dual oral combination trials. Is there any possibility within that? And being able to differentiate your combination versus Victoza on the back of less weight gain, given the absence of an integrase inhibitor? And whilst you\u2019re waiting for the long-acting trials to complete, does that provide any kind of commercial advantage? And the second question relates to Tigit. One of your competitors Roche has indicated they are opening a Phase 3 program. They've already run a head to head data in combination with that PD-L1 and non-small cell lung. I know that you have a program ongoing and have had for some time. Could you talk to your relative levels of excitement with the molecule and perhaps give us some timelines, and when it may be able to enter registration trials? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : First of all, with respect to the islatravir combination, in realty, we really have to wait for the data. I think that we're very confident in the behavior of islatravir, which we demonstrated through our reasonably large Phase 2 studies and also the work that we\u2019ve done with impactable person. [Ph] It's a terrific molecule and behaves extremely well. How it will behave with this in combination study? We have pretty good evidence that indicates to us that it will be a leading combination, and especially valuable in treatment. We also know islatravir either by itself or potential combination is a good preventive regimen. But, we need to see the data from all of those. And that's what we'll be getting. And with regard to what I call Tigit, but you can call Tigit. We do have a program. We have been working on this for some time. We have studies going on where we had tried to ask a question of whether this molecule in combination with KEYTRUDA behaves better than KEYTRUDA alone, and is there any circumstance under which it can be used? We recognized that KEYTRUDA is a very impressive compound in a whole variety of different settings. And we have to find the right place in which to use it. So, we're enthusiastic about it, and we're moving forward. Operator : Our next question is from Louise Chen of Cantor. Go ahead, please. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question to you is that you noted in the call that you're more confident than consensus on every metric through 2024. Just wondering if you could elaborate more on what you think the street is missing here. And then, second question is just on KEYTRUDA in Japan. Curious what kind of impact do you assume for price cuts this year for KEYTRUDA in Japan? And is there another potential price cut coming? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Rob? Rob Davis : Yes. Louise, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. Really, if you look at the comments that Ken made, he said we feel confident that the Street under-appreciates our revenue, our operating margins and our EPS growth as we look forward through time. And if you look at in the components, clearly on revenue, we continue to believe all of our growth pillars have meaningful growth opportunity, and in most cases, continue to be underappreciated across oncology platform, within the vaccines platform, given GARDASIL and Animal Health, just to name a few. So that story, which we've been talking to you about over the last several quarters, continues. And then, as you look beyond that, clearly with the spinoff, getting up to 1 percentage point improvement in our growth rate as a result the spin itself, that's even further growth that\u2019s not appreciated, not to mention the fact that we think through core focus and really directed efforts by our leadership team, we can run at an even faster growth. So, that is an important part as well. And then, as you look an operating margin, today, we've indicated that by 2024 or in 2024, we expect operating margins now as a result of what this spin enables, which enabling $1.5 billion dollars of incremental cost efficiency on top of the already improving natural mix we've been benefiting from in our business, we're going to achieve an operating margin of greater than 40% in 2024. And if you take that acceleration in operating margin, combined it with potentially accelerated EPS, when you think about us deploying $8 billion to $9 billion of proceeds from this transaction, if you put that share repurchase for instance, you even get further acceleration. So, as you look out to 2024, that's why across those select factors, we believe this under-appreciates revenue under-appreciates operating margin, under-appreciates EPS growth. Peter Dannenbaum : And Frank on the Japanese price cuts? Frank Clyburn : Hi Louise, it's Frank. In Japan, we did see or we will be seeing, I should say, in February of this year, a huge sales re-pricing of 17.5%. We\u2019ve seen significant strong performance based off of our lung cancer indications in Japan. And because of the sales projection, February will see the price reduced 17.5%. It's also important to note that we will face another significant reduction in April. That significant reduction is going to be within the same range as the first cut in February. Important to note that will have an impact likely on our Q1 results in Japan, but also as we take a step back, when you look at the rollout of renal cell carcinoma and our other indications in Japan, we do believe despite the price cuts, over time, we will be able to grow in Japan. And I want to reinforce that if we elevate outside of Japan, we still see very significant growth in 2020 and beyond as we continue to roll out many indications globally, very strong uptake continuing to see in Europe. And as Roger mentioned, we now have 23 indications in the U.S. So, we feel very good about our outlook for KEYTRUDA. Clearly, the Japan re-pricing will have the near-term impact in Japan, we\u2019re confident, as we go forward. Operator : Next one is from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions and I\u2019d appreciate you bearing with me a little bit on it. I guess, let me start with this, a simple one, which is, can you confirm that the standalone EPS goes down by about $1? That's first. Second, if I add up Women's Health, cardiology and diversified, that's about $6 billion, which is roughly what you're saying is what's being divested to the NewCo. But, if the goal is to focus on the innovative and pharma in the RemainCo, I noticed there's a $5 billion line for your other pharma, which is not being included. And I'm curious why that is. And finally, I think it's very interesting that you're not doing a split, you're doing a spin, very specifically. And I also noticed when you talk about the proceeds, you're mentioning BizDev, before you mentioned share repurchase. So, it almost seems to me that they might possibly be interested in replacing that last dollar. So, my question is, are you looking at a company which is more on the pipeline side or is the focus more on a accretive deal, which gets to that dollar EPS back immediately? Thank you very much. Rob Davis : Yes. Thanks for the question, Umer. So, as you look at thinking about what is the subtraction, if you will, away from Merck by pulling out this business, and I know the math you're doing to get to roughly the dollar. The only thing I would advise you on is I don't think you're giving any credit for the operating efficiencies, the $1.5 billion which we said, we will give relatively. So, that's $500 million, even in 2021, the first year, which is I think where your math is coming from, and you're not giving any credit to what we're doing with $8 billion to $9 billion of cash proceeds. But, if you deploy that to share repurchase, in reality, that dollar you're quoting, then goes down to $0.60 to $0.70 in the range. So, thinking of in terms of percentage, you're closer to 15%. And we believe the answer is probably closer to 10%. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. And Umer asked as well, what's included in NewCo? Rob Davis : Yes. So, if you look at the other line, the other pharma line picks up a lot of our hospital and specialty products and picks up our products like ZERBAXA, which is still early in its launch, but a product, which we are very excited about. So, as we look at the portfolio, those products that are sitting in the hospital's specialty space are ones that we continue to believe long-term create value for us, and we want it to maintain. And then, there's other to be launched revenue numbers sitting in their or products that are smaller in there as well. So, it really is the profile of products different than what we put into the NewCo and are really aligned with the core growth drivers that we've already identified. Peter Dannenbaum : And then, I think, Umer\u2019s last question was capital allocation priorities combined with the question about what our interest in BD might be. So, let's start with Rob and then turn it over to Ken. Rob Davis : So, if you look at the capital allocation priorities, they really remain unchanged. First and foremost, we're going to ensure we appropriately fund research and development. We're going to fund the opportunity to launch new products. And we're going to fund the capacity expansion that we have underway to ensure we have the capacity to meet what is very strong demand across all of our growth pillars in vaccines, oncology and animal health. We remain committed to the dividend. We talked about that. You heard today, very importantly. We are not lowering the dividends as a result of the spin-off of NewCo. We're going to hold our dividend at $2.44, which is in 2020, and they grow it off of that base with the goal to get to 47% to 50% as a payout ratio. So, you're actually going to see a maintained dividend growing over time. And then, you have the benefit of the incremental dividend that NewCo is going to have. So, all-in-all, you should have overall more dividend, if you hold those stocks that we do today. And then, finally, as we've always said, our goal is to use excess cash flow first and foremost for value-creating business development. To the extent though we can\u2019t find those or we don't find ones that bring us a combination of strategy and value, we will return excess cash to shareholders moving forward. And specifically, as you look at the $8 billion to $9 billion of special dividend we're going to receive from NewCo as result of this transaction, as we said in the comments, it will be deployed either to business development or to share repurchase and will not be used for debt pay-down. That's why we believe it\u2019ll be accretive over time. Ken Frazier : Umer, this is Ken. I think, you also asked about spin versus split. We chose spin, because we thought that was the quickest path and a tax efficient way of doing this for our shareholders. As it relates to business development, I'll just say, as we\u2019ve always said, it's an important priority. And first and foremost, we are always looking for the best science and innovation that will drive long-term growth and value for shareholders. So, we're still very much focused on those deals right augment our pipeline. And you saw last year, we did a number of deals, about 80 transactions spanning licensing, technology deals and clinical collaborations. We\u2019ll continue to look for those opportunities to augment our pipeline with the best science. Operator : Next one is Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Just have a few. Rob, on the spin, I get the operating margin benefit to Merck longer term, but did I hear you right that op margins to be lower this year and post spin initially? And then, with freed up capital, does the spin effect where you guys have previously discussed on the moderation of R&D investments, looking to 2021, 2022? And then, Frank, real quick, you talked about the growth strategy in China for IO at this point with the NRDL decision in first line lung. I know you guys just got approval in this indication in November. Rob Davis : So, on your question about operating margin, if you look at what NewCo is within Merck today, it's about 45%. So, it's obviously higher than the Merck's operating margin. So, it will be initially normally dilutive, when we pull it out in the first year. But, importantly, because of the fact we are getting the operating efficiencies, starting even in the first year of $500 million and then growing with an additional $500 million year two, another $500 million year three, so cumulative $1.5 billion. That offsets a lot of that dilution. And from that when you look at it, it's only about 1 percentage point of dilution to our op margin in the first year. And then, very quickly, you're going to see our operating margins continue to grow. And by the time we get to over 40% by 2024, we will be at a rate higher than we would have achieved as a combined company, largely as a result of that $1.5 billion operating efficiency. And so, that was I think first question. The second one was what's happening with I think R&D as we look at going forward. So, we have never been capital constrained in what we're doing in R&D. What's driving the inflection point we talked about, which was the slowdown of growth in R&D in 2021 as a percent sales. It's still going to grow, it's going to grow, it\u2019s just going to grow slower than sales in 2021. That inflection point is driven more by where we see the clinical programs at this is time. If we find opportunities to invest and I'm confident given the productivity that we\u2019ve seen from the labs thus far that they very well might do that. We will obviously increase our investment as those opportunities present themselves. But as of right now, our expectation is that inflection point continues to happen in 2021. Peter Dannenbaum : Frank? Frank Clyburn : Geoff, in your question on China, I first wanted to make sure that we do mention that our primary focus is on ensuring the safety of our employees\u2019 families and supporting the people of China. I think, that's on all of our minds and also the continuity of supply of our Human Health medicines and vaccines and products. And we're going to have to see how China evolves, will likely see some impact in Q1 to really to quantify. As far as your specific question on IO, our overall strategy, as we discussed, in particular, as we rollout in the self-pay market, we still feel very confident on our position. We are still the only IO therapy that's approved in non-small cell lung cancer. We recently got approval for KEYNOTE-407 in the squamous cell carcinoma population. And we feel as though we have a very significant opportunity in the self-pay market. And we've also adjusted our patient assistance programs in China to increase the affordability for patients that we're trying to provide access to as we move forward. So, we feel confident going forward in our growth prospects for KEYTRUDA in China. Operator : Next one is Seamus Fernandez of Guggenheim. Your question, please? Seamus Fernandez : Thanks for the question. So, maybe just a follow-up on one of Steve's questions. The concentration of the business -- Merck's business to KEYTRUDA going forward. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive pressure points that could emerge going forward, to talk a little bit about China. But, there also are potential Chinese assets that could be introduced into the U.S. following successful lung cancer clinical program. Just trying to get a better sense of the growth opportunity for KEYTRUDA and where you see potential pressure points? And if you could also comment on some of the administration's efforts around international pricing, again, a potential risk point for KEYTRUDA that would be helpful. And then, just as a follow-up on for Roger. Roger, how quickly the Company emphasized a lot of vaccines, opportunities for the business going forward. But most of them were Phase 1. How quickly could we see some of those programs advancing and potentially coming to market? And maybe you could just tell us, which one or two you're most excited to see in the near term? Thanks. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks. So, first, Frank, kind of the performance and outlook for KEYTRUDA. Frank Clyburn : Yes. So, on KEYTRUDA, as far as -- if we look back at 2019, we're, one, very pleased with our growth of 58% excluding exchange and almost $4 billion and eclipsing $11 billion in sales. We feel very well positioned as we've been saying with regards to KEYTRUDA, not only with regards to our significant penetration in non-small cell lung cancer within the U.S., but also the significant impact that we're having for patients with renal cell carcinoma, adjuvant melanoma, head and neck, as you heard Roger mention are recent approval non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. So, the breadth of our indications and the strength of our data, gives us a lot of confidence to continue to grow, in particular, not only in the U.S., but ex-U.S. and especially as we roll out our broader indications in non-small cell lung cancer. And we're now reimbursed in Europe in all markets for lung, which I see is an important aspect of our growth in 2020. The other thing I would add on the concentration piece too. I think, we tried to highlight that it\u2019s not just about KEYTRUDA, it's Lynparza, it's Lenvima, it's our pipeline in oncology that we've discussed. We also feel very good about our vaccine performance this year. GARDASIL this year grew 21%, as well as our hospital and specialty products. We continue to see good growth with BRIDION. So, from a concentration perspective, we feel very confident on the portfolio, not only KEYTRUDA, but the breadth of opportunities that we have going forward. Peter Dannenbaum : Right. Ken, on pricing? Ken Frazier : Okay. So, on that question specifically, we understand the administration's concerned that certain countries don't pay their fair share of the cost of innovation. We do keep continuing to make the point that incorporating additional price control is not the solution to the problem. We continue to work with the administration, the Congress and other stakeholders to provide a perspective. I think, patient groups are also providing very strong perspectives on these issues as it relates to that. But, if you take a step back and think about what we announced today, the reason why we're taking these kinds of proactive steps now is because we want to make sure that we position the Company for long-term growth and viability in the future environment. That's about being much more focused on innovation and it's about driving efficiency within our operating model. So, this is about staying ahead of the curve, rather than waiting until something happens in the pricing environment that we have to react to. Peter Dannenbaum : And Roger on vaccines? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Right. Seamus, thanks for the question. On vaccines, first of all, as you recognize, we have an enormously large program in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines with V114 program having 15 Phase 3 studies that are rolling out over the next 18, 24 months. We're going to see a lot of those studies coming this year in fact. And so, you\u2019ll be hearing a lot of data from those studies, which will ultimately permit filing. So, that's a very near-term opportunity. We have a lot of enthusiasm about our dengue virus vaccine. That vaccine incidentally is -- we are collaborating with colleagues at Butantan, where they have a registration-enabling study ongoing. And that study will deliver results at some point. So, that's pretty exciting as well. In addition, of course, we have our CMV vaccine. We have a lot of interesting things going on, respiratory syncytial virus. And those programs are actually fairly advanced. So, things are moving along quite well. I can't fail to mention the fact that the demand for GARDASIL, GARDASIL 9 remains enormous. And we have invested a huge amount of capital together with our manufacturing colleagues in building the additional capability to meet that demand and that will be rolling out in not too longer time and it will be very important obviously for the Company. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. We have several more questioners in queue. We're going to have a hard stop at 9.15, but we're going to keep going. Next question, please? Operator : Next one is from Daina Graybosch of SVB Leerink. Go ahead, please? Daina Graybosch : Thanks for the question. Two of them, first on NewCo. What do you see as the long-term relationship between NewCo and Merck? And then, the next question for Roger. As you reflect on all the internal and external immuno-oncology data that came out in 2019, what novel mechanisms are you most excited about, to add on top of KEYTRUDA to provide further benefit for patients? Ken Frazier : Well, in terms of long-term relationship, that's to be decided as both companies look to their future and decide how they want to make sure that they optimize their best opportunities. So, I can't say anything other than what we've announced today in terms of the products that are going over. But, obviously what I would say about NewCo that makes me excited is I think they will have many of the same standards and values that Merck has going forward. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Yes. Thanks for the question, Daina. In many respects, so things we're most excited about, you can tell by looking at the things that we're investing in. You can see that quite remarkably, the Lenvima and as it's been demonstrated in the endometrial cancer registration combination with KEYTRUDA most recently, but we've also seen really spectacular data in renal cell carcinoma, we presented those Phase 2 data, and we have ongoing Phase 3 data, demonstrate that the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors with special characteristics can combine very effectively with KEYTRUDA. We also have data which we presented in combination with Lynparza that are very impressive. Let me have this very large set of new molecules, which -- some of which we referred to already that include antibodies directed against other potential checkpoints Lag-3, Tigit and a whole bunch of other things. And there really are quite provocative data available now already in those settings. We're hopeful that we'll begin to tease out how best to use those things in combination. So, lots of exciting things going on here. Operator : Next one is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Peter Dannenbaum : David, are you on the line? David Risinger : Sorry. Yes. Can you hear me now? Ken Frazier : Yes. David Risinger : Great. So, I have a few questions. First, could you provide an update on where GARDASIL manufacturing supply stands and the GARDASIL revenue growth prospects in 2020? And then, Roger, could you discuss potential proof of concept results for Merck's early to mid stage pipeline to watch in 2020? And in addition, could you provide a framework for the timeline for the second pneumococcal vaccine that Merck is developing for infants, which would be added to V114 to offer broader coverage longer term? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. I think, the first question is on GARDASIL supply and outlook. So, Frank? Frank Clyburn : Yes, Dave. So, with regard to GARDASIL, we do continue to see very strong demand around the world. Currently, our supply is not able to meet that demand. As we mentioned, we saw a growth of 21% this year. The growth we do believe will continue in 2020 will be slightly tempered from the rates you've seen in 2019 and 2018. And we're focused with our manufacturing colleagues to do everything we can with contract manufacturers in the near-term to try to help our supply. And then ultimately in 2023, as we've been mentioning, we'll be bringing on two new bulk manufacturing facilities that will really allow us to ramp our supply up to meet the strong demand that we're seeing globally. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger? Dr. Roger Perlmutter : David, on the early to mid stage pipeline, well, we've already discussed that in a lot of programs in oncology in combination with KEYTRUDA, but we have a lot of other areas as well that are moving forward. Of course, building on the results of vericiguat in heart failure, the Phase 3 data which will be presented in the results for the near future and which are quite interesting. We actually have a lot of other interesting things going on in soluble guanylate cyclase activators. So, that's an important area for us and something that we expect to see quite a lot of data on. And we're going to be seeing a lot of data on of course our vaccine programs that I mentioned just a few minutes ago. So, there will be a lot of data coming forward in 2020. And speaking of vaccines, you mentioned the additional vaccine program. I think, you were referring to V117 in the pediatric context, which is not an add-on, but a separate and independent vaccine, all by itself. And that program, which we\u2019ve just given the name to, will be moving forward shortly. I\u2019d reemphasize that the V11 core program is very far advanced with lots of Phase 3 data coming forward this year and next year and will be a leading program in both adult and pediatric settings, ultimately V116 and V117 will provide further coverage. So, more to discuss there. Operator : Next one is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Terence Flynn : Just maybe a couple on the spin as well. Does this change at all how you approach M&A and business development from a timing perspective? Just wondering, if we shouldn't expect any sizable bolt-ons until after the spin's completed. And then, are there any tax rate implications that we need to consider? And then, any update on the path forward for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant breast cancer regarding discussions with FDA? And then, when can we expect your Phase 3 frontline data in metastatic triple-negative breast. And is that important in terms of the conversations with the regulators? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Okay. I think, we'll start with Ken and the timing of BD and our strategy around that. Ken Frazier : I expect to see no change in our approach to BD from a timing or strategy standpoint, as a result of the spin. We still see the need to augment our pipeline going forward, and we see opportunities and we're going to be very focused on that. Rob Davis : Yes. And I would add to that point, and then I'll address the tax question. As I said in the prepared remarks, but it's worth reemphasizing, we will have ample capital to do anything we want to do. So, this also in a way constraints us from a capital perspective. But, with regards to the tax rate, generally speaking, you should not see any meaningful change to our tax rate as a result of this transaction. Dr. Roger Perlmutter : Right. And Terence, with respect to neoadjuvant breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, of course the 522 data we presented at ESMO, the effective neoadjuvant in that setting, in terms of pathologic complete response is very clear. And we also had very provocative event-free survival data that we discussed. There is more data that will be coming forward in that. And we continue to have conversations with regulatory agencies about that study. And you're right, as we have an ongoing Phase 3 study in triple-negative breast cancer 355 that could yield data in principal, that would have an impact on thinking with regard to the neoadjuvant study, but of course we have to wait to see the data. So, that should be coming forward sometime relatively soon as well. It's event-driven, of course. I don't know exactly when. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. We're going to squeeze in one last question please, Carlo. Operator : Last one is Mara Goldstein from Mizuho. Go ahead, please. Mara Goldstein : Great. Thanks very much. Just a quick question on NewCo spin-off and the targets around achieving an R&D organization and how should we think about that from a metric perspective? And then, just quickly on China, I know we've covered it, but Merck has spoken to China as a component of growth strategy on a go-forward basis. And understanding that KEYTRUDA has been a part of that but Merck has other portfolio of products in China, so I'm wondering how much of NewCo's business is responsible for the growth in that region and how RemainCo will be able to advance its growth initiative in the absence of NRDL listing, which didn't occur as expected? Peter Dannenbaum : So, the first question I believe was on R&D metrics around NewCo. Rob or Kevin, I don't think we have much to add there at this point. Rob Davis : No. And clearly, I would just say that as we think about the 35% operating margin growing over time that contemplates investments in research and development in the business. And so, it is fully covered. There is an assumption that they will be doing R&D moving forward. And we feel like it's been adequately covered in a way we resource the investments in the business. And, I don\u2019t if Kevin wanted to add anything about the R&D other than what he said earlier. Kevin Ali : I think just to recap what we said earlier that over time we'll build more of the research and development capabilities as we start to do meaningful business development and start to see opportunities to start to do development. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. And the second question? Kevin Ali : China growth. Peter Dannenbaum : China growth. Yes. Frank Clyburn : This is Frank. With China, as we\u2019ve discussed, we're very pleased with the growth this year of 58%. And our growth, to your point, is very broad based, it's KEYTRUDA, it's GARDASIL, it's Lynparza, it's Lenvima, it's our innovative portfolio has done very well, Januvia is on the NRDL, Zepatier, Zepatier was recently placed on the NRDL. So, we see our growth going forward in China and we see significant opportunities. Obviously, as I mentioned, we're all thinking about the coronavirus, we'll have to see how that unfolds, but nothing has changed in the mid to long-term about our opportunities in China. Ken Frazier : Thank you all for joining us today. As I said in our third quarter call, we are confident but we're not complacent, and this separation is evidence of just that. We are convinced that the decision is the right one for the business and we believe that now is the right time to capitalize on a position of strength to secure even stronger future for Merck. As a more focused research-intensive biopharmaceutical company, we'll be better positioned to carry out our mission of inventing to save and improve lives and drive lasting value for the patients and shareholders we exist to serve. Thank you very much. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you all. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for attending. You may now disconnect.",

Ken Frazier : Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. In this challenging and unprecedented time, our first quarter performance reflects strong demand for our portfolio of innovative products, continued commercial and clinical execution and the dedication and resilience of our employees around the world. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. The COVID-19 global pandemic poses extraordinary challenges to all of us including serious threats to the health of people, businesses, and economies around the world. Without question, our industry and our company have a unique ability and responsibility to help the world respond to this global pandemic by working collaboratively to deliver solutions to coronavirus infection, while also maintaining the supply of medically important products to those who need them.  Amidst this crisis, we at Merck are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families, while also ensuring that our essential medicines and vaccines continue to reach the patients we serve. Importantly, the majority of Merck's manufacturing plants and clinical supply sites remain fully operational. And we have seen little impact to the production, supply, or distribution of our medicines, vaccines, and Animal Health products.  In many markets around the world, including the U.S., while our offices and laboratories remain open, our colleagues are primarily working from home. And for patients currently enrolled in our clinical trials, we're making every effort to ensure that patients in affected areas are able to continue their treatment and receive appropriate care and monitoring. Conditions are fluid and evolving. But as conditions allow, we are enrolling patients in ongoing studies, and we're starting new studies.  Of course, there is great interest in what we're doing to address COVID-19 from a scientific perspective. Roger Perlmutter will speak to the totality of our efforts in more detail. But I will mention that we have deep scientific experience and expertise in both antivirals and vaccines. And our research colleagues are actively engaged in efforts to combat COVID-19. We have teams of scientists researching COVID-19 itself, and assessing antiviral and vaccine candidates for their potential to impact the disease.  In addition, we've been working extensively with the broader scientific community to assess different assays and have been engaging with a range of research organizations on collaborative efforts. We know from our experience with viral epidemics like HIV and Ebola, that scientific collaborations are essential to develop medicines and vaccines in a global public health emergency like the one we are facing now. We also know that the path to a new medicine or vaccine is rarely short, nor that easy. But we are optimistic that our industry's efforts will create new tools to combat this coronavirus. And Merck is committed to playing its part in response to this global pandemic for the patients that depend on our medicines and vaccines, the global community and those directly impacted by COVID-19. The underlying demand for our innovative portfolio of products remains strong and our business remains fundamentally sound. However, the pandemic is impacting patients\u2019 ability to access hospitals and physician offices, particularly for many of our products, which require physician administration. And social distancing measures are also impacting customer access and demand for our Animal Health products.  Rob and Frank will speak to the near-term impacts to our business in a minute. But on a longer term basis, we remain confident in our outlook for strong growth once people adjust and find ways to address the needs of health and healthcare beyond COVID-19. Importantly, our financial strength and strong balance sheet allow us to continue with our capital allocation priorities, including investing in R&D and in our growth drivers, investing in manufacturing capacity expansion, paying our dividends, and continuing our search for value enhancing business development, which remains a top priority. We also remain fully committed to a spin-off transaction, and we believe we are on track for completion in the first half of 2021. We completed several important milestones in the quarter including the naming of the new company Organon & Co. Inc, a name which has strong brand equity and engenders trust among healthcare professionals for its dedication and innovation in Women's Health. We've also named several members of the Organon leadership team. We continue to believe that two more focused companies will allow us to reach more patients, drive stronger growth, and unlock longer term value for shareholders.  To conclude, we recognize now more than ever the importance of our investment in R&D, and the value of our science-based approach. We remain dedicated to our mission to save and improve lives through the discovery of innovative new medicines and vaccines to treat and protect patients in the midst of the pandemic and in the future.  With that, I'll now pass it over to Rob Davis to review the details of our performance and outlook. Rob Davis : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken stated, while we are operating in a challenging time, our first quarter results demonstrate the strong underlying fundamentals of our business, as well as successful planning and execution that is allowing us to maintain continuous supply of our medicines and vaccines to the patients we serve. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects, driven by the strong underlying demand for our products. So we are now seeing the COVID-19 will impact our near-term results, due mostly to patient access challenges.  In this environment, our strong financial position and conservatively positioned balance sheet is allowing us to maintain strong liquidity and very healthy access to the capital markets and our capital allocation priorities remain largely uninterrupted.  Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year or 13% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. Both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses contributed to the growth this quarter. COVID-19 had an immaterial impact on our business in the first quarter with both pushes and pulls across our divisions and regions. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an ex-exchange basis.  Our Human Health revenues grew 12% led by key products in our oncology, vaccines and hospital businesses. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales increased 46% year-over-year, reaching $3.3 billion. In the United States growth was driven by all key tumor types. And we continue to strengthen our overall leadership position in the I/O market, including across indications for lung, bladder and head and neck cancers. Our launches in renal cell carcinoma and endometrial and first-line head and neck cancers continue to feel momentum. And we are excited about the prospects for our application for a six week dosing regimen across all indications, which is currently under review by the FDA.  Outside the United States, lung cancer indications continue to drive KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU, growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 with secured reimbursement across all major markets, and we are encouraged by early uptake in the adjuvant melanoma, head and neck and renal cell carcinoma launches. In Japan, KEYTRUDA showed growth driven by new launches and continued strength in lung, despite the implementation of the huge seller price adjustment in February. Our oncology portfolio continues to benefit from both our products in Lynparza and Lenvima, with Lenvima continuing to lead PARP class in the United States with over 60% share, while Lenvima maintains market leadership in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma and benefits from the launch in combination with KEYTRUDA and in endometrial carcinoma.  Turning now to vaccines. GARDASIL growth reflects continued positive underlying demand globally as well as the timing of shipments in China, which contributed roughly $120 million in growth to the quarter, and the timing of public sector purchases in the U.S., which benefited revenue by approximately $70 million. PNEUMOVAX also contributed to growth this quarter, in part due to increased demand related to heightened interest in pneumococcal vaccination, given the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and Europe. Our hospital business benefited from growth in BRIDION recycling strong performance across all major regions and in PREVYMIS reflecting demand and the benefit of launches globally.  Animal Health revenue increased 21% this quarter to $1.2 billion. Livestock grew 24% largely due to the contribution of the Antelliq acquisition and COVID-19 related buy-in. Companion Animal grew 17% driven by demand for BRAVECTO as well as the COVID-19 related buy-in.  Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.5% in the quarter, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $4.4 billion were roughly flat year-over-year. SG&A spend decreased 7% driven by lower promotion and selling costs due in part to COVID-19, while R&D spend increased 10% reflecting higher clinical development and research costs, as well as higher licensing costs.  In total, our operating expenses were favorably impacted by $100 million in reduced spending due to COVID-19, largely driven by lower promotional and selling costs, and delayed spending on our clinical trials.  The year-over-year increase in other expense was driven by higher net interest expense due to reduced cash balances, partially offset by net gains on our security holdings, predominantly reflecting our investment in Moderna. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%. Taken together, we earned $1.50 per share, an increase of 26% excluding exchange.  In summary, the underlying demand for our products in the first quarter, even after adjusting for timing and COVID-19 impacts, delivered very strong growth and demonstrates the continued underlying strength and operational momentum in our business. As we move through the year and eventually put the impact of COVID-19 behind us, this demand will be the foundation upon which we expect to deliver strong and sustained growth into the future. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As we head into the second quarter, we are seeing decreased patient visits, due to reduced access to hospitals, and other healthcare providers, as well as social distancing recommendations.  I'd like to pass the call to Frank to provide additional color on the dynamics we are seeing. Frank Clyburn : Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ken and Rob, the impact to our business from the ongoing pandemic is largely driven by a reduction in healthcare provider and patient interactions, as hospitals redirect resources toward COVID-19 and patients avoid healthcare facility visits, and postpone preventive care. To better understand the impact to Merck, it is important to highlight that our portfolio is heavily weighted towards products administered by a physician. In fact, roughly two-thirds of our global Human Health revenue is comprised of physician administered products.  Taking this a level deeper, we've seen updated guidelines and recommendations from the CDC and various professional associations, further enforced social distancing measures via delays in wellness visits and the postponement of treatment. For example, based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC, most pediatricians have pushed out the routine immunization of all children, except for those under 24 months in the United States. And in the United States physician office visits across various areas of medicine are currently running down in the neighborhoods of 70% versus pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result of these measures, we are seeing impacts to our vaccine portfolio, including the GARDASIL, PNEUMOVAX and our pediatric vaccines and to our Women's Health products in both our fertility medicines, as well as IMPLANON/NEXPLANON of physician administered implantable. Non-urgent elective procedures have also been postponed or cancelled in most major markets in order to slow the spread of disease and enable hospital prioritization of COVID-19 patients. Many sources are reporting current declines in elective procedures of over 70% with urgent procedure volumes also being affected, though to a much lesser degree. These declines impact a product like BRIDION, which is used across many surgery settings. And even oncologists are delaying appointments and procedures as they prioritize patients based on severity and the immediate needs of different tumor types, resulting in extended dosing schedules for existing patients, as well as delays in the start of therapy for newly diagnosed patients.  As Rob will outline in a minute, however, based on our overall assumption with respect to the timeline for return to a more normal environment, as well as our experience in China, a market which was impacted earlier by the pandemic, but which is now recovering, we expect to be most heavily impacted in the second quarter. Most importantly, we believe the underlying demand for our portfolio of products remains strong based on the substantial medical benefits they bring to patients. As the peak of the pandemic passes, we believe providers and patients will move quickly to find ways to safely provide and seek treatment. And as a more normal environment for patient access is reestablished, we believe our portfolio will be -- will again be well positioned to achieve strong long-term growth.  With that, I will turn it back to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks, Ken. Now turning to guidance. We expect decreased volumes due to the reduced access and social distancing impacts that Frank described, particularly in the second quarter, which we assume is the peak of the virus in the United States and Europe. We expect to begin to see this dynamic subside as hospitals begin to normalize through the third quarter and as social distancing measures begin to lift across geographies at which point we would expect a phased return to more normal levels of volumes, unencumbered by access concerns.  While we do expect to progress to normal pre-COVID-19 volumes by the beginning of the fourth quarter, a large portion of the impact in Q2 will carry to the full year. In Animal Health, we expect to experience a more protracted recovery timeline, given decreased demand for milk and protein due to the shutdown of restaurants and schools, reduced visits to veterinarians and the impact of reduced employment and incomes. Of course, our actual results could vary based on how the disease progresses, and how various countries respond. We now expect revenues of $46.1 billion to $48.1 billion, which reflects a decrease of $2.5 billion from our previous midpoint. This difference is comprised of approximately $2.1 billion of negative impact due to COVID-19 on an ex-exchange basis, made up of approximately $1.7 billion from Human Health and $400 million in Animal Health. We also now assume a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly $750 million, or 2.5 percentage points using mid-April rates.  Finally, Human Health operational strength of roughly $300 million partially offsets the negative COVID-19 and foreign exchange impacts. We now expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are expected to decline at a low-single-digit rate driven by lower SG&A. Our updated assumption anticipates lower promotional and selling expenses and clinical trial costs. We now expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We continue to expect other expense of roughly $200 million. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Given the current environment and out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase activity, which will help ensure that we preserve our strong financial position to pursue our capital allocation priorities of investment in the business and ongoing business development. Taking together, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.17 to $5.37, which reflects a decrease of $0.43 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a roughly 3.5 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency equating to an approximately $0.11 FX headwind versus our prior assumptions. Importantly, the company's financial strength and conservatively positioned balance sheet is allowing us to execute our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged despite the currently challenging environment. As of the end of the quarter, we held $8 billion in cash and marketable securities and retained good access to the commercial paper markets.  In addition, our cash collections continue as expected, with no significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic impact to-date. As a reminder, our first priority is to invest in our existing R&D programs, as well as to support new programs aimed at COVID-19. This pandemic underscores our commitment to R&D now more than ever. We will continue to invest in manufacturing capacity expansion, and we remain firmly committed to the payment of our dividend. In addition, as Ken noted, business development remains a priority, and we will continue to look for the best external sources of science to augment our pipeline. We will assess the environment on an ongoing basis and consider reactivating the repurchase program as warranted. In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the strong demand we see for our innovative portfolio and the underlying fundamental strength in our business. While the pandemic will impact us in the short-term, we're well positioned financially to weather this storm and continue the investments we're making across our business to drive growth and importantly to bring additional innovations to the patients we serve. We also remain confident in the underlying demand of our products based on their competitive position and the benefits that they provide and fully expect to see our growth return once patient access normalizes. As a result, our expectations are unchanged regarding our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We believe all of this continues to be a source of significant and sustainable long-term value for both our patients and our shareholders.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks, Rob. I will divide my commentary on our first quarter results into three parts. First, I will describe the current operational status of Merck Research Laboratories, focusing in particular on clinical research and our interactions with regulatory agencies. Second, I will highlight some of the important results that we achieved during the first quarter and will outline some of what we hope to achieve as the year progresses. Finally, I will comment specifically on the actions that we hope and what we have taken to help address the COVID-19 pandemic.  So let me begin with our operational status. As an early point, our global clinical operations team recognized the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 infections that were reported in Wuhan, China, and made advanced preparations to manage what became the COVID-19 pandemic. These preparations included prepositioning clinical supplies, strengthening our clinical supplies network, putting in place processes to enable virtual monitoring and over time developing processes for home deliveries, investigational agents, including in some cases, developing alternative infusion sites. Operating virtually the clinical operations team, including data management and our quality organization has been able to maintain our overall clinical trial schedule. We have in some cases reduced enrollment in certain jurisdictions. But we have not halted enrollment and are continuing to launch new clinical trials across most jurisdictions.  As examples, our team processed 36 database logs in the month of March, and enrolled more than 700 new patients across our Europe, Middle East, Africa sites. These numbers provide substantial reassurance that our clinical programs are moving forward. Indeed, although I cannot predict what the course of the pandemic will be in the future, for now, our 2020 MRL objectives are not in jeopardy. This progress is owed entirely to the extraordinary work of teams across our organizations spanning five continents, and a very broad set of government regulatory agencies with whom we interact.  Turning now to important research accomplishments. As noted previously, the first quarter began with FDA approval of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with high risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, our 23rd KEYTRUDA indication and we continue to generate important data related to the ability of KEYTRUDA to improve cancer therapy. An interim analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-355 studies demonstrated that KEYTRUDA in combination with standard chemotherapy improved progression-free survival versus chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a combined proportion score of greater than or equal to 10. This result complements the data from our KEYNOTE-522 study in which a combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy provided as neoadjuvant treatment versus chemotherapy alone improves the pathologic complete response rate in patients undergoing surgery for triple-negative breast cancer. We expect to describe these results in detail at an upcoming medical meeting.  We also announced the results of our KEYNOTE-204 study which demonstrated that KEYTRUDA monotherapy improved progression-free survival in adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, as compared with brentuximab vedotin. These data strongly support our current indication in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. And the study will continue to permit evaluation of the dual primary overall survival endpoint. Also during the quarter, we announced the results of our KEYNOTE-177 trial, a Phase 3 study in which monotherapy with KEYTRUDA improved progression-free survival, as compared to standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer, whose tumors had demonstrated deficiency in mismatch DNA repair or evidence of DNA microsatellite instability, the so called MSI high phenotype. The study will continue as is customary to permit evaluation of an overall survival endpoint once the data are mature.  Most will recall that in 2017 we gained the very first approval of a tumor agnostic PD-1 directed therapy indication with the identification completed in collaboration with colleagues at Johns Hopkins University of MSI high status as a biomarker for tumor responsiveness. At the end of the first quarter, we also received priority review from the FDA for what we regard as a second potential tumor agnostic indication, the use of KEYTRUDA in certain patients whose tumors have a high mutational burden that is greater than equal to 10 mutations per megabase of DNA, irrespective of tumor type. We look forward to presenting all of these data at upcoming scientific meetings and in peer reviewed journals. As I've indicated, we are also engaged in discussions with regulatory agencies regarding these data. Finally, we announced last week that based on discussions with the FDA, we have responded to their prior Complete Response Letter and have resubmitted our application for approval of the use of KEYTRUDA in a 400 milligram every six weeks dosage form across all indications in adults, based both upon modeling information and new data that have emerged from our KEYNOTE-555 study, which will be discussed in part at the American Association for Cancer Research Meeting later today.  We've also seen important progress in our partnership with AstraZeneca of Lynparza our leading PARP inhibitor. Just last week, we announced new results from a key secondary endpoint of our PROfound trial, which shows statistically significant improvement in overall survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose tumors have mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2 genes or the ATM gene, all of which are important for homologous recombination related DNA repair, following treatment of Lynparza as compared with abiraterone or enzalutamide therapy. The result provides yet another example of the benefit of Lynparza therapy in patients whose tumors have defined DNA repair mutations. I\u2019ll remind you that we presented primary data from the PROfound studies at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting in October of 2019. We expect the details of the PROfound study, though not those just announced, will be published in the top tier medical journal in the very near future, perhaps this week.  I should also note with respect to Lynparza that our PAOLA-1 study, a Phase 3 trial examining the combination of Lynparza plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in the first-line maintenance treatment of women with advanced overall -- ovarian cancer is under review by the FDA for the PDUFA date in the second quarter.  I cannot complete our survey of important results in tumor therapy without mentioning the approval two weeks ago of Koselugo known generically as selumetinib which is the first selected therapy approved for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 who are suffering from symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromis. The approval of Koselugo is part of our longstanding collaboration with colleagues at AstraZeneca, who first identified this important next signal transduction inhibitor.  Beyond oncology, we also advanced important programs in other therapeutic areas. Earlier in the quarter, we had the opportunity to present the results of our Phase 3 VICTORIA study performed in collaboration with colleagues at Bayer which demonstrated that vericiguat, an investigational soluble guanylate cyclase agonist provided benefit as judged by composite endpoints including heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death as compared with placebo, when given as add on therapy to well treated patients with established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who had suffered a worsening event. This represents the first study of its kind in the population at very high risk for further cardiac complications. The data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented virtually at The American College of Cardiology Meeting just last month. Also during the quarter we announced that in our Phase 3 program, gefapixant, our investigational P2X3 antagonist reduced the 24 hour cough frequency in patients with longstanding chronic cough. Details of these results will also be published and presented in the not too distant future.  Finally, in the metabolic disease area, we have just announced results for the Phase 3 VERTIS CV cardiovascular outcomes trial. In this study conducted jointly by Merck and Pfizer, compared administration of STEGLATRO an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 or SGLT2 inhibitor versus placebo in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic vascular disease, and achieved its primary endpoint of non-inferiority for major adverse cardiovascular events. These events were defined as time to the first event of CV death non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The key secondary endpoints of superiority for STEGLATRO versus placebo for time to the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure, CV death alone and the composite of renal death, dialysis/transplant or doubling of serum creatinine from baseline were not met. While not a pre-specified hypothesis for statistical testing, a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure was observed with STEGLATRO. The safety profile of STEGLATRO was consistent with that reported in previous studies. Detailed results of VERTIS CV are scheduled to be presented on June 16th at the virtual American Diabetes Association\u2019s 80th Scientific Session.  I will now describe activities during the past quarter directed at developing treatments that could have an impact on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a leading vaccine manufacturer for more than 100 years, it is no surprise that we have embarked upon a broad-based development program for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.  Let me put these results in the proper context. Vaccine development is extraordinarily difficult and customarily requires many years of investigation. As others have noted during the past quarter century, despite enormous efforts, there have been only seven vaccines directed against previously unaddressed human pathogens that earned registration. Four of these seven were developed by Merck Research Laboratories. And so we have relevant experience in this area.  ERVEBO, our most recent vaccine, which has been demonstrated to provide protection from -- with the Zaire strain of Ebola virus, was developed rapidly and under emergency use authorization to help address outbreaks in West Africa. Nevertheless, there required a multiyear development program and involved building a factory that we're proud to say can produce 1 million doses of vaccine per year. The development and registration of ERVEBO required the efforts of hundreds of our employees as well as an extraordinary commitment from the World Health Organization and then from healthcare workers in Guinea, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and many other jurisdictions. With the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we are tasked with creating a completely new vaccine in 1/10th the time that we devoted to ERVEBO, and we must plan to manufacturer this vaccine at 1,000 times the scale. We approached this challenge with enthusiasm but also with humility. We know from long experience that creating safe and effective vaccines typically requires decades of efforts and investment. We're mindful of the imperative to act with speed indeed with urgency. Based on the progress that we have made, I will say that I am optimistic that a vaccine capable of inducing a potent neutralizing immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can be invented. But it's also critical to develop a comprehensive understanding of this particular coronavirus which will allow us to design, develop and ultimately to manufacture vaccine that can be deployed globally. With this in mind, we have first supported efforts to characterize effective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. As we announced yesterday, we have partnered with scientists at the Institute for Systems Biology, Swedish hospital, and the Providence health system, all in Seattle, with Stanford University and numerous others to collect cells in sera over multiple time points from patients diagnosed with COVID-19.  Data derived from these analyses will be made available to researchers worldwide, and will position us to cipher correlates of immunity to this coronavirus. With respect to the vaccines themselves, we have been thoughtful in selecting proven platforms that we\u2019ve used to generate vaccines with desirable qualities in the past. Of course, in light of my prior comments regarding the difficulty of developing successful vaccines, I cannot guarantee to you that any of these approaches will prove effective in the near-term. However, you should have no doubt that scientists in our own laboratories and those of our collaborators are committed to this process. We've also worked to identify internal resources that can support the manufacture of these potential new vaccines at an appropriate scale. And we are in discussions with contract manufacturers who could assist in what would surely rank as the most challenging vaccine production initiative ever undertaken.  Beyond our search for vaccines, we are also engaged in studying potential antiviral drugs that could be deployed more rapidly. Here too we have evaluated compounds in our own laboratories, and have identified programs at other laboratories that could prove beneficial. Time does not permit me to describe these programs in detail. Instead, I would like to mention that the global community of biopharmaceutical companies has been very open to collaboration to address this challenge.  Within MRL, we are trying to help as many of our colleagues as we possibly can, both through the active consortium led by the National Institutes of Health and also through interactions with many companies large and small, that have contacted us for advice and assistance with their own programs.  I will close by emphasizing that at Merck our mission is to translate breakthrough research into medicines and vaccines that improve and extend life. This mission has never seemed more vital than it does today. I wish to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues here at Merck for working tirelessly in pursuit of a means to ameliorate the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll now return the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Roger. Jerome, while you line up the queue, I just want to remind everybody. Our front comments went a bit longer than normal today. We're prepared to go past 09 :00 o'clock. But we do ask that you limit yourself to one or two questions so we can get as many questioners in as possible. So, thank you. Jerome, if you can line up the queue, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question. Terence Flynn : Maybe two for me. Just wondering, I know you commented a little bit on this. But in terms of the environment, and your approach to capital allocation, I know you've called out no further share repurchases. So can you just give us any more detail, the main driver there, is that you see an increasing number of M&A or BD opportunities now in this environment?  And the second, I was just wondering with respect to the pharma guidance, specifically, the new guidance. Can you give us any more detail on the pacing of the impact? I'm assuming the majority of that's going to occur in the second quarter. And then can you break that down by product meaning how much was KEYTRUDA versus GARDASIL versus other? Thank you. Rob Davis : With regard to maybe the second question first, the pharma guidance is, the majority of that will hit in the second quarter and the majority of it is in the United States. And maybe I'll turn it over to Frank to give you some of the more specifics on product detail before coming back to the first question. Frank Clyburn : Yes. So, in the second quarter, we do anticipate vaccines, in particular. It's important to note that we have a very broad vaccine portfolio that ranges from infants, all the way to older adults. And we do anticipate that based on well visits being down approximately 70% that, that will impact our vaccine portfolio. Also in the hospital specialty area, BRIDION, as I mentioned, elective surgeries are down approximately 70%. So we do see an impact there. It's important to note, we have a significant product IMPLANON/NEXPLANON, which requires physician administration. We think there'll be an impact during the second quarter. And then as far as oncology goes, overall, we believe that oncology is pretty resilient.  We are seeing new patient visits decline by approximately 10% to 20%, depending on the indication, and we think that will have a slight impact in the quarter from a new patient perspective, but feel very confident as we move into the third and fourth quarter for not only oncology, but for the rest of our portfolio. Rob? Rob Davis : Thank you, Frank. And then on your question about share repurchase program, just to be clear, and I had it in the prepared remarks, but it's worth reinforcing. We really decided to temporarily stop the share repurchase program predominantly out of an abundance of caution. Our financial position continues to be strong. And as we said, it really was to make sure that we can continue to do all of the investments we want to do in R&D and CapEx to support our future growth, and in business development, as you asked. So it's really across all those areas that we want to make sure we can prioritize investment. And we will continue to look at it and very well could reinstate the share repurchase as we see the situation evolve in the marketplace. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may now ask your question. Chris Schott : Just to follow up on the vaccine commentary, can you just talk a little bit more about how you see that business normalizing. This sounds like clearly the 2Q trends are going to be depressed. So should we think about a catch up in 3Q and 4Q as wellness visits return or is it just more like normalized volumes, and we shouldn't expect as much of a catch up I guess, specifically on that line?  The second question which is a bigger picture question about we're clearly seeing high unemployment rates, and what more broadly does that mean for Merck's business? Should we be thinking about lower price and adverse payer mix as representing a headwind to your business as we look beyond some of these near term COVID disruptions, or is that a manageable kind of dynamic as we think about the longer term business? Thank you very much. Frank Clyburn : Hi, Chris, it's Frank. Thanks for the question. I'll take your second question first on payer mix and impact. And I'll give some color into our mix in the U.S. It breaks out approximately, Chris, the commercial business represents about a third of our business from a mix perspective. We have about 17% of our mix, it\u2019s important to note, is in vaccine private pay because of the significant size of our vaccine portfolio as we've been discussing. Government represents about half of our overall payer mix. But also important to note, half of that or approximately 26%, 27% is KEYTRUDA related because of Medicare Part B. So we've talked about, as KEYTRUDA continues to grow we anticipate that will grow over time.  Medicaid Part -- or Medicare, I should say, Part D is a small percent, approximately 7%. And then we have very small percentage of our business in Medicaid. And then the rest is pretty much other with regards to federal and some other parts of our payer mix. But if you look at our portfolio, Medicaid is very small. We're clearly looking at unemployment rates, and we'll have to monitor that as it goes forward. I think it's too early to assume anything at this point in time. However, we have taken into our guidance different scenarios as we possibly will see increased unemployment. But for us, in particular, Medicaid is a small portion of our business. Shifting to vaccines, just to give you a little bit more insight, we expect as you come into -- or towards the end of the second quarter, into the third quarter, we expect that the infants and young children who have missed their vaccines during COVID-19 will be prioritized first. We then expect that we'll see the adult pneumococcal vaccines come back strongly as we head into the flu season. And then we expect adolescents and young adults will probably come back a little bit slower, Chris, as patients are able to engage with the healthcare systems. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line if Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. You may now ask your question. Tim Anderson : Yes, thank you. So I'm sure it does not go unnoticed by you that Merck so far is the only company to lower guidance, but we're maybe only halfway through. We saw companies reporting. And I'm just really trying to tease out what else beyond product mix could be driving that. Is that you guys running your supply chain narrower or you're less able to kind of manage business from a work-from-home environment. Could it be that you\u2019re possibly more conservative, for example, you're pausing share buybacks. In Merck, I think there's been a pretty strong cash position. You have slowdown in brands, but I would think also you have slowdown in spending that you could find as an offset kind of again mirroring what other companies are seeming to be able to pull off in their guidance. So, I don't know if there's anything else that you can add beyond what you said, but it just strikes me as odd. Second question, is on KEYTRUDA and a big industry overhang is data from Roche, a good oncology company, it's randomized Phase 2, its first-line lung that\u2019s coming up here at ASCO most likely, and we know they're pushing into Phase 3. And so I'm wondering, how is this not going to be a continual variable for American investors? As part of that, if you can just update us on your own TIGIT program which I know is earlier. Ken Frazier : I think we'll start with Rob and then turn it over to Roger for TIGIT. Rob Davis : Thanks, Tim, for your question. So if you look at why we lowered guidance, and understand, again, the profile of our business, and I think it's really important that we just really hit this home, it is the fact that we are seeing reduced access is what's driving the reduction in guidance. Because of the fact as Frank said two-thirds of our products are physician administered and that is probably somewhat unique and is causing the impact. And as we said, while we expect to get back to normal by the time we get to the fourth quarter, because we're going to see a large impact mainly in the second quarter, a little bit in the third, that second quarter impact largely carries to the year and it's really what's driving it. The other thing to point out is our Human Health reduction is only a little over half of what's driving the reduction in our guidance. It's actually almost half of it is coming from foreign currency, and the fact that we have the impact in Animal Health. And if you look at it, the impact in Animal Health is actually more significant than it is in the Human Health business. So that is also a little bit of a differentiation relative to some of our peers.  And if you look then at how does that translate down to the bottom-line, what you see is actually for the full year, we're actually bringing down OpEx more than what is the impact of just COVID-19 reductions in spend. Some of that is also due to the way currency is flowing through our operating expense line, but then there is a little bit of incremental savings we also were assuming. I would say we didn't go harder at OpEx primarily because we don't see this as a demand driven issue and we want to be in a position that as the market normalizes we can come back fully with our products. So we're expecting to continue to invest in research and development, R&D will continue to grow and we will continue to make selective investments to be prepared to come back strong, as we see the market normalize. And that's why we've not pulled down OpEx further. But you shouldn't read anything more into this than the mix of our business and the fact that the access is impacting our ability to deliver what we originally expected for the year. Roger on TIGIT? Roger Perlmutter : Right. Let me speak more generally to the combinations with KEYTRUDA. And it is the case that really since we began -- since I began working with the KEYTRUDA program back in 2013, we have been exploring a whole variety of different combinations with various agents and that's what led us of course to partner with AstraZeneca and Lynparza and partner with Eisai and Lenvima, and has led us to develop a whole set of programs internally that we are using in combination with KEYTRUDA in various clinical studies, including TIGIT, and numerous other biologicals that are well advanced in our program. I've indicated before that we have really quite impressive data in some of these combinations. Most importantly, of course, in our Lenvima combination where we have registration in endometrial cancer and have already presented data for the combination in renal cell carcinoma. But beyond that with the biologicals as well, we are looking for effects that are really meaningful and that will make a big difference from an efficacy standpoint, while preserving the very favorable profile that KEYTRUDA has already demonstrated. So we are making good progress. We're looking forward to developing some of these agents assuming that these play out. And of course, we'll be watching what others do. I think we're in a very good place. Peter Dannenbaum : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein from Mizuho Securities. You may now ask your question. Mara Goldstein : Just a little bit more on currency, if you don't mind. And I'm just curious as you think to how you made these adjustments for currency, can you possibly give us some more granularity on what is a contracted issue versus what is actually a country-by-country swing in currency? And then secondarily, can you just confirm the timing of the split off given everything that's going on from a COVID perspective? Rob Davis : So on a currency basis, if you look at what is driving the reduction, it is entirely just due to change in where we see rates as of mid-April. So basically, we took the mid-April exchange rates and assumed those held for the full year. And as a result of the fact that what you're seeing is that really versus almost every currency, the dollar has strengthened as there has been a flight back to the dollar -- as soon -- as the quality currency and as a defensive measure, that is impacting us. It's hitting us across all of our currencies. But importantly, what's happening as well -- and we're not able to hedge as much as we normally would is because we're also seeing a material impact in the emerging market currencies as well, where we don't hedge today. So it's really that is what's driving entirely the $750 million reduction that we talked about in our guidance. And then on your second question on the timing of the spin out. As Ken noted in his prepared remarks, we continue to expect to have the spin out completed in the first half of 2021. That is consistent with where we guided last quarter. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Navin Jacob with UBS. You may now ask your question. Navin Jacob : Navin from UBS. Roger, a question for you on your COVID-19 vaccine program. It's just -- it was interesting that you mentioned or highlighted that you've chosen to go with proven platforms. Wondering your thoughts on some of the more novel platforms such as mRNA why perhaps you may or may not be looking at some of those more novel platforms? Sort of associated with that also, would love your thoughts on neutralizing antibodies as a method for either treatment or prophylactic treatment. And then a separate to that but along the same lines, wondering how you're thinking about whether mutations around the spike protein could create selective pressure and how you think about items such as that or whether it's antibodies defendant enhancements that may be putting some -- maybe affecting how you're thinking about proven platforms versus for novel platforms? Thank you very much. Roger Perlmutter : Right. Well, thanks. Thanks very much for the question. So first of all, we are interested in any and all approaches that could be helpful in reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we've been in discussion with most all of the organizations that are trying to do this in various different ways, whether that's using passive immunization with antibodies or trying to use alternative methods of active immunization that are -- can more rapidly be brought into the clinic like nucleic acids, mRNA in particular. And of course, we have a long history of collaboration with people who have done that kind of work.  Our sense, though, is that -- the task before us is one that requires a vaccine that will be quite stimulatory and that will yield neutralizing antibodies ideally with a single immunization. Of course, it must first be safe because you're talking about a vaccine that would in principle be given to much of the world's population in order to protect the world's population. And since we believe that virtually everyone is susceptible, these are all high bars. And that makes us want to return to proven platforms that have these kinds of characteristics. And that's where we have put our focus. My expectation is that over time, we will need more than one vaccine in order to actually protect the human population from SARS-CoV-2. So that's sort of thing that we've looked at. Specifically with respect to the neutralizing antibodies being administered as passive vaccination, we've looked at a number of those. In the near term that may turn out to be a useful approach for individuals who -- perhaps in the treatment context and also for individuals who are at extraordinarily high risk and have a great susceptibility because of age and comorbidities. But it's a broadly based method to protect the human population I think, probably less likely to be used just for logistical reasons. That doesn't mean that we wouldn't be willing to work with others to help develop that if that proved to be the near term -- the most important thing that one could do.  Finally, I would say that just to put the cart back behind the horse, and the issue of selective pressure and mutation, we should recognize that while right now we're not seeing an enormous amount of variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, when we put selective pressure on the virus either with an antiviral drug and some of those do indeed look fairly promising early on or with a vaccine it is possible that we will see variants emerge and those variants can prove to be important. And that's something else that we're paying quite a bit of attention to. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. I have two questions for Roger please. To follow on to your remarks regarding COVID, could you please comment on the potential to; one, inject disinfectants; and two, to use UV rays inside the body to cure COVID. No, I'm just kidding, I'm sorry. So on a more serious note, could you discuss Merck's novel I/O agent readouts to watch in 2020? And second, could you discuss your conviction in the profile of Merck's 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and your disclosure in adult filing plans? Thank you. Roger Perlmutter : Yes, David. So with respect to novel immuno-oncology agents, I mean I've mentioned some of this before in response to a prior question, but we have a stable of them. We're of course looking at our own CTLA-4 molecule, have been for some time in combination with KEYTRUDA. We are also looking at LAG-3, TIGIT and a whole variety of others. We have 20 or so agents that we have tested in the clinic and all of these are being tested versus monotherapy and thereafter as combination with KEYTRUDA. But I should emphasize that KEYTRUDA really is quite special. We've not seen anything of course that has characteristics that are like KEYTRUDA. If we did, that would be a very different story. And it's no surprise because we and many other investigators, university-based investigators, myself included, looked for these kinds of things for decades and never found anything that looked like KEYTRUDA. It's unlikely we're just going to kick one over now when we didn't have those in the past. That doesn't mean though that those things in combination with KEYTRUDA couldn't be beneficial and we're seeing some early signs that suggest that's possible and we'll have quite a lot more to say about that during the coming year. And the second question had to do with our conviction with respect to our 15-valent molecule V114 for invasive pneumococcal disease. We have a lot of conviction behind it. I think we've already reported our Phase 2 data that everyone has had a chance to see. The Phase 3 data will be available to us very, very soon. And as soon as those data become available, assuming the data Phase 3 recapitulate what we saw in Phase 2, which is certainly our hope and expectation, those -- the top-line of those data will be announced of course and we'll at that point provide more clarity with respect to our filing plans. But our expectation would be that filing could occur not long thereafter. So we're really very enthusiastic about this vaccine because of the important new serotypes in it and also the balance with respect to the immune response that we saw in our V114 studies in Phase 2. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. You may now ask your question. Steve Scala : I have two questions. As has been stated clearly Q1 beat but full-year guidance was lowered. We are now about a third of the way through Q2, in the month of April, which could be the peak of the pandemic. You must be seeing a major impact on oncology, vaccines, hospital and Animal Health. Is that a reasonable conjecture? And secondly, Roger, many investors were underwhelmed by the data on vericiguat and gefapixant. What in your view are investors missing? Thank you. Ken Frazier : Alright, start with Frank. Frank Clyburn : So Steve, I'll start. So to answer your question, yes, Steve, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with regards to vaccines, we are seeing an impact due to the reduction in patients and well visits. We are seeing a reduction in our hospital specialty area in particular BRIDION with the reduction in elective surgeries as well as Women's Health. So we are seeing that in Q2, which is why we've updated our guidance and we also want to reiterate though we do see, as we are seeing in China, as we get through this period, we believe things will come back gradually in Q3. And then as we get into Q4, we'll return to normal operations. And I just want to continue to echo that we're very confident in the overall portfolio and in the demand trends that we see. Rob Davis : And I would just add on the Animal Health front. It's a similar situation to Human Health. We are seeing the impact now in the quarter and we do expect that the second quarter will be the vast majority of the impact driving what is the full-year reduction. So it definitely will be most acute in the second quarter, but it will continue a little bit into the third and fourth and be a little bit more prolongated than what we expect from the Human Health business, driving a larger downside impact to our Animal Health business than it's having to our Human Health business. Ken Frazier : Great, Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Yes, Steve. Thanks for the question. So first of all on vericiguat and the VICTORIA study, so the VICTORIA study address a patient population that typically is excluded from most studies and these are patients who have had a recent de-compensation in their status. These are patients with reduced ejection fraction, heart failure, who have typically undergone heart failure hospitalization as a result of some deterioration. And hence, this is a very brittle population if you looked at the data that were published. But what you saw with it was that these patients were really quite ill and had indices of heart failure, of heart stress that were much, much higher than what is typically found in a heart failure population. So the reason why the paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the reason why it was -- there was a plenary presentation at the American College of Cardiology on these results is precisely because this is a very different population, the therapy is given as add-on to existing heart failure therapies and improves outcomes. And so, that's a pretty important result and I think there is a lot of enthusiasm for it within the cardiovascular community and amongst those physicians who treat heart failure. So I think that's really important to recognize. This is really a -- quite a change in terms of how we think about these patients and it's an important patient population to treat. And then with respect to the gefapixant, well of course, we haven't presented the gefapixant data. We'll have a chance to do that. I think everyone should recognize two things; the first is that chronic cough is an extremely common complaint in the general population. So physicians are often called upon to try and help people who are interrupted by chronic cough and in our Phase 3 studies we had some individuals who have had chronic cough complaints, continuous chronic cough complaints for more -- for decades. So this is a pretty significant interruption in their lives.  On the other hand, I don't want to dismiss the difficulty of going into a completely new area, because there are no -- there hasn't been no drug registered for chronic cough. There's been no study of this kind previously. It's a completely novel area. It will take some time for this to develop and for people to understand it. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor. You may now ask your question. Louise Chen : So my first question is on the TMB-High opportunity here. What is that for Merck? And is there any off-label usage of KEYTRUDA in that population already, and if so, how much? And then second question is, if you could provide more color on your Taiho-Astex KRAS opportunity and when we can start to see data from that pipeline asset? Thank you. Ken Frazier : First question on TMB-High. Roger, would you like to speak to TMB-High please and also the second question? Roger Perlmutter : Right, Okay. For TMB-High, so this -- the basis for seeking registration is a study done in a variety of different tumor types, the KEYNOTE-158 study in which their responses at the moment are currently inadequate. And so the goal was to look and see, well was there anything that we could do in these tumor types in which we could demonstrate that KEYTRUDA had an effect in certain patients, and we looked at a variety of different markers so that we could use. It turned out for us that a tumor mutational burden marker at greater than 10 mutations per megabase was associated with an improved overall response in certain of these tumors and that's what we've sought registration for and we are in the midst of having those discussions with the agency. So we'll see what happens. I frankly am not aware of off-label use and we wouldn't necessarily know anything about that in that population. And with regard to our KRAS program, it's actually quite a broad program looking at both GDP and GTP bound forms of KRAS and looking at the mutations beyond the cysteine mutation, codon 12 mutation, veiled cyst mutation which occurs in a fraction of patients, but there of course are many other mutations, aspartic acid substitution, valiant substitution et cetera. So we're looking quite broadly, but it will be a while before we have the opportunity to bring the first of those compounds into the clinic. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, thank you. We have a number of questioners still in the queue. We're going to stop at 9 :15, but we're going to keep going for now. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. You may now ask your question. Andrew Baum : So a question for Roger on TIGIT, you've clearly seen efficacy signals from your trial activity. Genentech has noted is seeing strong efficacy signals in a PD-L1 High. So is the central reason before accelerating any Phase 3 program, whether TIGIT is additive or synergistic the chemo in patients with low PD-L1 expressing tumors or is there some other hurdle which is holding you back? And on the same note, I mean how do you view the commercial risk/reward of taking further time optimizing the patient population at the expense of potentially disadvantaging yourself by giving Roche more lead time should that Phase 3 program in first-line non-small cell lung in combination with chemo pans out. That's first question. And the second question very quickly to Frank, you've discussed the fairly obvious impact of delayed presentation to healthcare providers for third party-administered pharmaceutical. Could you talk to how you think about in the U.S., the commercial impact associated with rising insurance rates associated with unemployment? I realize that you have far less exposure than some of your peers, but I'm interested in your thoughts generally, but obviously it does relate to things such as Diovan as well, which, tell you have commercial exposure. Thank you. Ken Frazier : Great. Roger, first on TIGIT and then we'll turn it to Frank. Roger Perlmutter : Well Andrew, thank you -- thanks for the question. Again on TIGIT, different companies will have different perspectives on this. Our view really is still quite simple and it's not -- I wouldn't over think this. What we want to see is sufficient evidence of benefit in combination which is -- where you can unambiguously say that both elements, that is KEYTRUDA in our case and the anti-TIGIT antibody, both elements and that same is true for LAG-3 or CTLA-4 or any others are each contributing and so that there is at least additive effect and ideally better than that if one could get it. And so, we want to be absolutely sure of that and we want to be absolutely sure that we're addressing the right patient populations and of course we want to be sure that there is no deterioration in the favorable adverse experience profile of KEYTRUDA. So it's just a matter of reaching a conclusion about that. We could eventually reach the conclusion that you know we don't actually think it's good enough and there could be a whole variety of reasons for that or we could reach the conclusion, yes, we think this is really important, let's move forward. There are a number of programs in which we are sort of looking at that and we are going to find some data that's intriguing, but we just don't have enough data yet to make us feel comfortable about it. Other people might look at that data and say we need to go immediately. We are doing what we think is the right thing in that regard. Ken Frazier : Great, Frank? Frank Clyburn : And Andrew, I think we're all concerned obviously what we're seeing in the U.S. with regards to rising unemployment. As I mentioned earlier, for us, we'll have to see the shift potentially from our commercial business over to higher discounted segments like Medicaid. But just to reiterate again, Medicaid is a very small portion of our business currently and as we look going forward, our business and payer mix is more geared toward Medicare and in particular, Part B Medicare. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. You may now ask your question. Seamus Fernandez : Great, thanks so much for the question. So, just a couple here. Could you guys comment -- I know we'd commented on the Medicaid side of things, but 340B expansion could be a meaningful threat to the industry overall. Just trying to get a better understanding of what Merck's 340B exposure is currently since that's a hospital-based program than then could shift to Medicaid-based pricing. So just love to get a better understanding of your thoughts there on exposure. And then, for Roger, can you just help us understand what's unique or special about Lenvima that has Merck pursuing such a broad effort where others with similar type TKIs certainly not, and I think this is where I'd love for you to comment on the differentiation have not pursued that. And I think this is particularly interesting in the context of the relatively limited patent life for Lenvima. Thank so much. Ken Frazier : Frank, then Roger. Frank Clyburn : Yes, Seamus, so just -- if you look at 340B, the majority of the exposure really is for products like JANUVIA and also KEYTRUDA. For KEYTRUDA, approximately a third is within that 340B segment today. It has been growing slightly year-on-year and we'll have to see how, as I mentioned, things continue to unfold with regards to what's happening in the environment and it's obviously something that we're closely monitoring. Ken Frazier : Great, Roger, on Lenvima? Roger Perlmutter : Right. So Seamus that the -- we're quite data driven on this. We were enthusiastic about Lenvima initially from the monotherapy data that our colleagues at Eisai had obtained and we thought there was a chance that that could prove to be a good combination with KEYTRUDA. We had -- we did some experiments like that with them and then we signed our agreement with them. And when we signed our agreement, we thought let's do a signal detection study looking across a broad set of tumors. And as we've done that, we've seen a lot of really quite interesting signals. Those of course weren't the only combinations with multi-kinase inhibitors that we tried, but we've seen impressive signals in combination with KEYTRUDA. And as you know, every multi-kinase inhibitor is different. Each one hits a different range of molecules and their effects are different. So it's quite hard to describe why that's true and whether that reflects VEGF receptor-antagonism in the context of FGF receptor or whatever. But what you can say is that they're all different and the results that we've obtained with Lenvima have been very promising. So we are quite enthusiastic, obviously, first of all in endometrial, in other tumors, the data we presented for renal and there are many others besides. So we're moving forward with that program. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you all for your questions and apologies to those we didn't get to. I'm going to turn it over to Ken for closing remarks. Ken Frazier : Thank you everyone for joining us today. Our mission of save and improve lives will continue to drive the Company in the coming days and months in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Merck is committedly doing everything in its power to ensure our medicines and vaccines reach patients around the world and we expect to contribute to the global pandemic response efforts today and also to prepare for the next potential crisis. The underlying demand for our product remain strong and our fundamentals remain very sound. In the near-term, we -- I reiterate, our portfolio is different, and as a result, our near-term guidance takes into consideration what's really happening in the outside world in an attempt to be realistic about physicians and their ability to access patient. But in the final analysis, we believe that our underlying business fundamentals are very sound going forward and we look forward to providing updates on the business as we continue to navigate through these challenging times. And until then, we hope that you and your families, all safe and healthy. Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, presenters. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining Merck & Company first quarter sales and earnings conference call. That concludes this conference. Thanks all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Q2 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Laura and good morning. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2020 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories; Frank Clyburn, Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs [indiscernible] you should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, today's earnings release and an investor presentation with some highlights of our results are all posted on merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Peter. Good morning. And thank you all for joining today's call. I want to start by thanking all employees around the world for demonstrating resiliency and diligence through this difficult time. As a result of their tireless work, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities and we exited the quarter with accelerating business momentum. While the pandemic has brought challenges that few of us could have imagined, even six months ago, it has also demonstrated the critical importance of organizations that are focused on breakthrough science. Our scientists are highly focused on this effort and we are incredibly energized by this mission. Simply put, this is why Merck exists. Throughout the quarter, Merck executed well, both operationally in support of our existing portfolio and by advancing our innovative research program. We continue to perform at a very high level, without significant disruption to the production, supply and distribution of our medicines, vaccines and animal health products, or our clinical trial. As expected social distancing measures in many regions negatively impacted second quarter volume for many of us product. However, customer access to care is steadily improving, including in our portfolio of vaccines, which was hit particularly hard this quarter. We remain confident that our innovative portfolio will drive strong, long-term growth.  Our financial strength also allows us to execute on our capital allocation priorities, including continuing to invest in internal R&D and business development. In addition to advancing our strategic priority, we also achieved significant progress on our plans, spin off Organon & Co., which remains on track be completed in the first half of 2021. We remain confident that creating two more focused companies will result in each being stronger and better positioned in an evolving healthcare landscape, which will benefit the patients we serve and our shareholders. We recently announced the appointment of several talented and experienced leaders from outside the company to the strong leadership team. And they are already deeply engaged in driving the various work streams underway to set up the standalone company for success.  Before Roger provides more detail, I'd like to say a few words on the multiple efforts underway within Merck on the COVID-19 front. COVID-19 represents a tremendous challenge to the biopharmaceutical research community. And Merck is moving with urgency to apply our deep expertise in vaccines and infectious diseases towards potential solutions. During the quarter, we announced two vaccine development efforts, one through a collaboration with IAVI and the other through a now completed acquisition of Themis. We selected these candidates because they are based on proven platforms that we anticipate will lead safe, effective and broadly deployable vaccine with the promise of single dosage. Both vaccine candidates will soon enter the clinic, and we have begun investing to facilitate our ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses. We also announced a program to develop a novel, orally available, antiviral candidate through a collaboration with Ridgeback Bio. This compound has advanced into Phase 2 clinical trial. We are optimistic about the prospects with these three programs and if successful, Merck is committed to working with others to create broad, affordable, and equitable global access. These programs illustrate our continued commitment to supplementing internal capabilities with innovative external science project. Roger will provide more details on the significant progress being made in our research activities elsewhere. More broadly, the biopharmaceutical industry's response to COVID-19 has been extraordinary. Our industry is uniquely positioned to address this public health challenge on a global scale. Collaboration across the scientific, public health and biopharmaceutical industry community will be key to success and to help ensure that we are adequately prepared for the next. We are confident that science will ultimately prevail over COVID-19 with new medicines and vaccines. Let me conclude by expressing our gratitude to the frontline healthcare workers, as well as to our own employees, who have worked to help patients affected by COVID-19. Their dedication inspires us and makes us even more resolute in our commitment to bring forward new tools to help end this pandemic. The value of our industry to society is underscored by this crisis as is the need for companies like Merck, continue to invest in research and development to address the greatest health threat both now and in the future. And with that, I'll pass it over to my colleague, Rob Davis, to review the details of our performance and our outlook. Rob Davis : Thanks, Ken and good morning, everyone. As Ken highlighted, our business performed well in an unprecedented environment, while we saw a meaningful impact in the COVID pandemic in the quarter, particularly in April and May overall the business went well. Within our human health business, the impact is largely expected while within animal health, the impact was less than anticipated. That said we were able to deliver better than expected results in both human health and animal health due to our underlying operational strength combined with our execution in the face of the pandemic. Based on our ability to drive improved and accelerating operational momentum, we now expect to see stronger performance in the second half of the year. As a point of reference, if we adjust for the impact of COVID in the quarter, Merck's underlying sales growth would have been 6% nominally and 9% excluding exchange, reflecting strong demand for key growth pillars. We continue to operate from a position of financial and operational strength, which allowed us to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Investments behind our extensive pipeline of research programs remained robust and we also successfully completed two collaborations and an acquisition to bring in-house promising vaccines and antiviral candidates to address the COVID-19 pandemic as Ken referenced. All of this is in support of or goal of advancing science to fulfill unmet medical needs, the core of Merck's mission. Now turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $10.9 billion, a decrease of 8% year-over-year or 5% excluding the negative impact in foreign currency. The pandemic negatively impacted our second quarter results by $1.6 billion, reflecting approximately $1.5 billion in human health and approximately a $100 million in animal health. In the human health business, the impact to sales was spread to varying degrees across our vaccines, hospitals, women's health and oncology products due to access limitations from social distancing orders and prioritization of coronavirus patients and hospitals. Within the animal health segment, livestock product sales were impacted by a change in protein demand through the restaurant closures and regional outbreaks, while companion animal product sales reflected decreased visits to veterinarian offices. It's worth noting that despite the short term headwinds experienced in the quarter, the underlying strength and demand for our products enabled first half growth of 4% excluding exchange. The remainder of my comments will focus on the underlying performance of our key growth drivers and near term trends and will be on an exchange basis. Our human health revenues declined 6%. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 31% year-over-year, reaching $3.4 billion in the quarter. In the U.S. KEYTRUDA demonstrated strong growth across all key tumor types. We continue to strengthen our leadership in IO, including in lung in the face of recent competitor launches. We benefited from continued strength in melanoma, bladder, and head and neck cancers and strong momentum from launches in renal cell and in the matriarchal carcinomas. We received FDA approval for a six-week dosing regimen across all adult indications, which enabled greater patient access and contributed to growth. Outside the U.S., lung cancer indications, remains a driver of KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 with reimbursement secured across all major markets. In Japan, the combined impact of delay in new patient starts, reduced frequency of existing patients and a huge seller price adjustments from February and April, more than offset volume growth in new indications. We saw COVID-related impact to KEYTRUDA in April and May across all tumor types, but not to the degree we expected. We were encouraged by the recoveries we saw in June, particularly in the United States and Europe. And this trend has continued in the third quarter. Strong growth in Lynparza and selumetinib continue to bolster our oncology performance as both products experienced limited pandemic impacts this performance in the quarter continues to reflect growth in leadership and the PARP class in the United States and the recent launches of the PAOLA-1 in ovarian cancer and PROfound in prostate cancer, provide opportunities for future growth. Lenvima maintains market leadership in first line hepatocellular carcinoma, and the combination with KEYTRUDA and endometrial carcinoma, is now the leading treatment regimen in the second line setting in the United States. Turning now to vaccines, our vaccines portfolio was negatively impacted by a reduction of patient visits to physicians offices in line with our expectations. GARDASIL sales declined 24% year-over-year, driven by stay-at-home workers in the United States and most of European markets, partially offset by continued demand driven core strength in China. In the United States, we were encouraged to see significant increase in wellness visits beginning in late April for children and in late June for adults, and anticipate this trend will lead to a recovery in our vaccines business in the back half of the year. Our hospital business was impacted by delays and cancellations of elective surgeries and prioritization of coronavirus patients in hospitals. This impacted sales of BRIDION, which declined 18% year-over-year. Reduced wholesale or inventories also contributed to the decline. We remain confident in the underlying demand for BRIDION and are encouraged by the ongoing recovery in overall surgical procedure volumes. Partially offsetting the decline in our hospital portfolio was the growth in provames. Animal health revenue increased 3% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Livestock grew 3% due to contributions from an acquisition in our animal health intelligence product line. And companion animal also grew 3%, reflecting strong growth at the productive line of products. Visits to veterinarian offices were negatively impacted early in the quarter, but offices opened earlier than expected, which benefited volumes. Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 73.8% in the quarter, a decrease of 160, driven largely by catch up amortization for expected milestone achievements for our collaborations on Lynparza and selumetinib. Operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. In total, COVID resulted in reduced spending of approximately $325 million, driven largely by lower promotional, selling and administrative costs along with lower laboratory, travel and meeting expenses.  The significant year-over-year increase in other income was driven by unrealized equity gains from our security holdings, predominantly reflecting our investments in Moderna and MGM.  The tax rate for the quarter of 15% was driven by lower full year effective tax rate as a result of favorable earnings mix. Taking together, we earned $1.37 cents per share, an increase of 9% excluding exchange. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As expected April was a particularly challenging month in the human health business. As we moved through May and particularly through June, however, we saw a meaningful increase in patient wellness business to providers and in elective surgeries of hospitals. And our oncology business was particularly resilient due to the strength and breadth of our offerings. Business conditions have clearly improved and despite increased outbreaks and infection rates that are impacting the phasing of our recovery, we believe the healthcare system is better positioned to provide patient access as we move through the balance of the year. The improved underlying operational strength we are seeing across several parts of our portfolio will help to more than offset the impact from COVID-19 and lead to stronger expected second half growth. In addition, when we were benefiting from our prior investments in digital capabilities to interact with our patients, providers and payors, allowing us to continue to address medical inquiries and promote our products effectively. This gives us further confidence in our ability to drive efficiencies in our business as we adapt to a post-COVID world through our continuing digital and other transformation efforts. On the Animal Health side, as mentioned, veterinarian offices opened earlier than initially expected, which benefits our companion animal products and stay at home restrictions lifted sooner than anticipated, which positively impacts our livestock products. These favorable trends contributed to our better than expected second quarter results and favorably impacted our outlook to the full year. We will continue to monitor regional outbreaks, restaurant and school openings and any potential impacts to for our demand livestock products. Now turning to guidance, our updated guidance reflects continued confidence in the underlying strength of our business, a more limited COVID impact and previously expected [indiscernible] business as a whole and a more favorable FX environment. Our assumptions regarding the progression of the COVID impact remain unchanged. We assume that the largest impact from COVID occurred in the second quarter, which recovery haven\u2019t begun during the second quarter that will continue through the third quarter, before return to normal operating levels in the fourth quarter. We now expect revenues of $47.2 billion to $48.7 billion, which reflects an increase of $850 million from our previous midpoint. Our guidance now seems roughly $1.95 billion of COVID headwind for the year. This is a reduction from our prior assumption of $2.1 billion, which human health roughly in line with and animal health below our prior estimates. We now assume a negative impact in foreign exchange of roughly 2 percentage points using mid-July rates. Overall, our guidance implies 3% to 6% growth in revenue for the full-year, excluding the impact of exchange, reflecting strong underlying demand for our products. The one area we are watching is vaccines and GARDASIL in particular for a potential extended recovery timeline. However, this risk has been fully considered within our guidance range and more than offset by the overall strength we expect to see across the rest of our portfolio. We continue to expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are now expected to be roughly flat year-over-year, reflecting increased R&D spend offset by reduced SG&A cost. The increase in our OpEx assumptions versus previous guidance reflect spending in R&D associated with the acceleration of our COVID-19 programs. This guidance still implies operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points for the year. We now expect a full year tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% reflecting improved earnings mix. We now expect other income of roughly $550 million before I can hire unrealized gains in our equity securities portfolio based on June 30th valuations. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taking together we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.63 to $5.78 which reflects an increase of $0.44 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a negative impact in foreign exchange of roughly 3 percentage points. Our results are benefiting from an improved tax rate and higher other income due to gains from our equity holdings. Excluding these benefits, however, we continue to drive operational leverage in the P&L. Revenue growth coupled with continued expense management, while we invest in R&D including our COVID-19 candidates and capacity expansion is expected to drive operating margin expansion to the full year. Our cash flow generation and access to capital both are strong, and we remain well positioned to continue with our capital allocation priorities, including full investment behind our key growth drivers and pipeline. Continued commitment to the dividend and strategic value enhancement business development to enhance our pipeline and long-term growth potential. To conclude, we remained competent in the fundamentals of the business and the meaningful growth opportunities that lie ahead, despite the near-term impact from the pandemic. A favorable recovery trend that we saw through the quarter positions our company for accelerating business momentum as we head into the back half of the year. The underlying health of the business and demand for innovative portfolio of medicines and vaccines remains strong. This combined with our strong clinical execution across the portfolio and our expanding indications, which Roger will highlight in a moment continues to reinforce our confidence and the sustainability and strength of our revenue growth. During these challenging times, we are leveraging our operational and financial strength, not only to weather the storm, but also to execute meaningfully on our strategy of innovation and our mission to bring new medicines to patients. We continue to believe this best positions Merck for a success and value creation long into the future. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Perlmutter : Thank you, Rob. During the second quarter, we were able to expand laboratory operations beyond the essential production of materials for clinical trials, such that we are now once again selecting new chemical entities in discovery research and advancing these materials in preclinical testing. As our laboratories reopen, our priorities remains first ensuring the safety of our employees; and second, ensuring the patients in our clinical trials receive their treatments and are managed appropriately; and finally, we are once again applying our skills to identify new medicines and vaccines. Many programs that I highlighted in my remarks during our first quarter earnings call made substantial progress. For example, in May we received FDA approval for Lynparza developed in collaboration with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, when used in combination with bevacizumab for the first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who sustained a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and whose tumors demonstrate deficiency in homologous recombination based on results from an FDA approved diagnostic test. This approval referenced a biomarker subgroup analysis of the Phase 3 PAOLA-1 trial in which Lynparza plus bevacizumab improved median progression-free survival by more than two fold to 37.2 months. Lynparza also received FDA approval in May for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose tumors have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone and also contain deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair gene mutations. This approval was based on results of our Phase 3 PROfound study. We estimate that approximately 20% to 30% of men with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer have tumors containing these kinds of mutations. Later in the quarter, Lynparza gained a positive opinion from the CHMP for use in the first-line maintenance treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, whose tumors contain germline BRCA mutations, based on the POLO study. This recommendation was ratified by the European commission early in July. KEYTRUDA was the subject of numerous important regulatory actions in the second quarter, such that the FDA label is now nearly 100 pages in length and tabulate nearly 30 explicit approvals. I will not enumerate all of the regulatory activity associated with KEYTRUDA filings today, but we'll note that the second quarter began with the approval by the FDA of an extended dosing interval, 400 milligrams every six weeks for all adult indications. Though previously registered in Europe approval of this new dosing schedule in the United States offers positions and options to reduce the number of clinic visits that patients must attend to at a time when they have implemented important social distancing measures. In June, the FDA granted three additional approvals for KEYTRUDA. First, for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that cannot be cured by surgery or radiation therapy. Second, for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer in patients whose tumors show evidence of mismatch repair deficient or MSI-high. And third, for the second line treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors whose tumors have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory treatment options provided that the tumors show a high mutational burden of at least 10 mutations per megabase of DNA. I wish to note here that this is the second tumor agnostic indication for KEYTRUDA. We received the very first such indication in the history of oncology therapeutics in 2017 with the accelerated approval of our MSI-high indication for KEYTRUDA in adults with solid tumors. As I just mentioned, this approach was extended still further in June with the approval for first-line treatment of MSI-high colorectal cancer, based on our KEYNOTE-177 trial. FDA approval for the second line treatment of patients whose tumors show a high tumor mutational burden represents the second time that KEYTRUDA has received an indication based on the molecular characteristics of the tumors themselves rather than the cell or organ from which these tumors are believed to have originated Two other FDA approvals from the second quarter deserves special mention. GARDASIL 9 was approved for the prevention of Human Papillomavirus related oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers. This was an accelerated approval, based on the effectiveness of GARDASIL 9 in preventing Papillomavirus-related anogenital disease and was supported by studies showing clearance of persistent oropharyngeal HPV infection index needs. A recent analysis by the U.S. centers for disease control, demonstrated that HPV attributable oropharyngeal cancer has now surpassed cervical cancer as the most prevalent form of HPV related cancer in the United States, approval in the head and neck cancer setting was the result of decades of investigation pursued by Merck Research Laboratories. We also received FDA approval for RECARBRIO for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms. As COVID-19 hospitalizations increased the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia becomes more profound. RECARBRIO provides an important new antibiotic that can be especially helpful in treating infections due to pseudomonas species. Beyond these regulatory approvals, we continue to support \u2013 to submit important new files. For example, during the second quarter we filed the results of the VICTORIA study conducted in partnership with Bayer, which demonstrated that vericiguat, our novel orally administered soluble guanylate cyclase activator reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization when added to standard therapy in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure following a worsening event. These data were previously presented at the American College of cardiology meetings in the spring. The FDA has granted priority review to this application, reflecting the significant unmet need for new therapies in the heart failure population. In the oncology area, we also submitted for review our data from the KEYNOTE-355 and KEYNOTE-522 studies, which document the activity of KEYTRUDA in triple negative breast cancer either as second line treatment in combination with chemotherapy that in KEYNOTE-355 or as an adjunct to surgery in the neoadjuvant setting in combination with chemotherapy followed by monotherapy, KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting, that is the KEYNOTE-522 study. We announced yesterday, the acceptance of both files for review by the FDA, and here was well the KEYNOTE-355 file was granted priority review. This week we also announced that the FDA had granted breakthrough designation to MK-6482, our Novel HIF-2 alpha inhibitor for the treatment of certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease associated renal cell carcinoma based on data that we presented at the American society for clinical oncology meetings in June. Finally, our broad portfolio of activities in cardiovascular medicine, oncology and in infectious diseases now includes three new programs directed at interdicting the COVID-19 pandemic. As you are aware, during the second quarter we've forged a partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop MK-4482 in nucleoside analog that disrupts the faithful replication of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. MK-4482 has now been studied in ascending dose protocol and has been shown to be well tolerated during five-day oral administration achieving drug levels that we would expect would be more than sufficient to block viral replication. The compound is currently under study in three different Phase 2 programs in outpatients, as well as in inpatients here in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Based partially on the results of these studies, we expect to initiate two large pivotal trials, one in outpatients and the second in hospitalized COVID-19 patients beginning in September. We are also in discussions with the active consortium to begin a large Phase 2 outpatient study conducted under the supervision of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. MK-4482 has demonstrated a strong barrier to resistance when studied in vitro, which was to be expected based on its mechanism of action. It is for example, active against viruses that have acquired mutations, rendering them resistant to remdesivir. In light of the profound medical need for an orally active treatment to reduce the impact of COVID-19, we have mounted a very aggressive clinical program as I described. And we have secured manufacturing capability to produce many millions of doses of the drug before the end of this year. At the same time, we're answering two important new vaccines directed against SARS-CoV-2. These vaccine approaches were selected for three reasons as Ken mentioned. First, they make use of proven vaccine platforms that have been used in human studies demonstrating both efficacy and safety. Second, they are replicating viral-vaccines, which means that they provide a very potent immune stimulus that could offer the promise of single dose administration. In dealing with an aggressive globally dispersed disease like COVID-19, we believe that it is wise to lower the barrier to vaccination as much as possible. For example by launching a vaccine that is effective with just a single administration. Third, since we believe that there may well be a need for different vaccines in different populations, we chose two well-characterized vaccine platforms that have quite different properties. A measles virus recombinant that was invented by the Institut Pasteur in Paris, and which we acquired through the purchase of Themis Bioscience and a vesicular stomatitis virus recombinant first developed by Health Canada, which we're advancing in partnership with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, IAVI. As this construct utilizes the same virus platform that we employed to develop our successful Ebola virus vaccine, which was registered in the United States earlier this year. In preclinical studies, both of these COVID-19 vaccine constructs have now been shown to stimulate neutralizing antibody production following a single intramuscular administration. Our program using the measles virus vaccine platform, which we call V591 has not completed clinical manufacturing. And we plan to begin clinical studies performed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur later this quarter. Meanwhile, we've been manufacturing clinical doses of the VSV-based COVID-19 vaccine, which we call V590 in our facilities in Pennsylvania. We also expect to begin clinical studies with V590 in the next few months. Planning for large global clinical trials involving both V590 and V591 is now nearly complete. These trials will initiate as soon as we have supportive data regarding immunogenicity. Finally, I note that one additional advantage of V590 is that it may be active when administered orally via a swish and swallow protocol. And again, this will help to lower the barrier to vaccination should it be affective. It should be playing that Merck Research Laboratories continues to advance development of new drugs and vaccines across many fronts. In this context, I wish specifically to commend the dedication of more than 10,000 MRL employees around the globe whose supererogatory efforts have again brought us hope that the world can gain greater freedom from greivous illness. Reviewing the progress that we have made in developing MK-4482 and both of our COVID-19 vaccines, I am optimistic that we will be able to reduce the impact of this devastating pendant. And now I'll turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Eric, if you could put the Q&A order in place, please, and I'll just remind questioners to limit yourself to one or two questions as always. We have a lot of questioners in the queue and we are prepared to extend a bit past nine to try to get to as many as we can. A couple of our speakers today are remote. So I'll do the best I can to quarterback those questions when they come in. Laura. Operator : Thank you so much sir. Let me go ahead and begin with your first question for today, which is going to be coming from Mr. Andrew Baum of Citi. Sir, your line is now live. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you. Two questions. First one, we can see from your clinical trials that there's significant cold expansion going on in several of your programs and one that's been taken about, but also little [indiscernible] and there's a number of others, which suggests that you're seeing signs and promising activity. Can you give us some sense just because the market is so very focused on the importance of KEYTRUDA, when you may be exiting to share some of that emerging Phase II data and extend into cardiology as well? That'd be the first question, timing of sharing. And I'm not expecting you to give me which confidence or when, but as much as you can. And then second, given the perceived competitive KEYTRUDA, particularly in non-small cell, you have an ongoing trial with Lynparza in the maintenance setting. So perhaps Roger, you could talk to your optimism in that because you're obviously drawing that in other indications in sensitive disease and particularly whether you could address \u2013 do you think you need to select for patients who have [indiscernible] loss of HIV genes or whether you think just come [indiscernible] use together with the sales, which are [indiscernible] sufficient? So those are the two questions. Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger, I think those are both for you. If you... Roger Perlmutter : Yes. Andrew, thank you for the questions. I think that in some sense, questions are related, if I caught them correctly, and I apologize the fact that I'm remote. And so the connection is perhaps not as clear as I would like it to be. But with respect to the expansion of clinical trials for a whole variety of new agents, we're seeing some interesting activity. Some of these data we'll, we hope, be able to present at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meetings, which are coming up in September. And we'll have additional opportunities we hope through towards the end of the year to talk about these data. And these data go precisely to the issue that you raised with non-small cell lung cancer. Now first, I should mention that, as you know, we have an extremely strong data set in non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA is very active in that setting and active in combination with chemotherapy as we've shown. And that remains a hugely important intervention, the dominant intervention in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, either as monotherapy in the PD-L1 high population or in combination therapy. That said, you're also looking at activity of these new agents directed at a whole variety of different checkpoints in multiple cellular components as well as looking at the issue of mismatch repair deficiency in combination with KEYTRUDA. We're optimistic that we will begin to segregate non-small cell lung cancer patients still further on the basis of the fundamental properties of the tumors, and this goes precisely to our efforts in both MSI-high and tumor mutational burden in order to achieve still better results in the non-small cell lung cancer setting. So suffice it to say, we're extremely active in this area and generating a lot of very interesting data and hope to have a chance to present it to you very soon. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you. Next question please Laura. Operator : Absolutely. Your next question will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Thank you so much. My questions of COVID with two parts, if I may. Roger, you've probably been seeing a lot of the first round of COVID vaccine data so far. And without really commenting on any single company, I'm curious how you view the data and totality to date of all the clinical data on COVID vaccine? Perhaps specifically on whether you think the neutralizing titers that various layers have shown are good enough? Or do you a lot see of room for improvement and your take on the T-cell data? And also on your small molecule for COVID, do you think you can show an antiviral benefit? Because that's something Remdesivir was never able to achieve. But then there's also this school of thought that there's no large viremia in COVID, or you may not be able to show that in the first place. So I really appreciate your thoughts there. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Yes. Thank you, Umer. The \u2013 so, first of all, with respect to the COVID vaccine data, we have to say that from our starting position, knowing very little about SARS-CoV-2 to at the beginning. The results that we've seen thus far from a variety of early studies, Phase I studies, are as good as one could hope for, really. There was no guarantee that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 would prove to be as immunogenic as it is. So immune response, broadly speaking, across the population of vaccinees are quite good. The question you asked is, is there enough neutralizing antibody and how well we have to perform clinically. And unfortunately, we can't really know that until we look at Phase III studies. But I guess I would say first that, as has been discussed by others, most of the vaccines look as if they are going to be require a boost in order to produce high titer neutralizing activity against the spike protein. That seems clear. We don't know for sure, and maybe things will go better, which we can all hope for. With time, we'll see more of that. The second question, of course, is the production of immune response against the spike protein sufficient by itself? Or is it necessary to generate responses against other components of the virus, particularly the nuclear protein? And then, of course, there is the question of what contribution is made by T cell immunity. And a little bit that goes to the question of what we're actually trying to achieve. Finally, in the background is the question of whether the immune stimulation that we are producing could, in fact, contribute to adverse effects since it is widely believed that the severe pulmonary complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection include an overexuberant immune response that results in tissue destruction. So those are all open questions that can only be answered by large Phase 3 studies that extend for a considerable period of time. Those studies at least have begun now in a couple of cases. More will begin soon. And we'll have a chance to see exactly how these vaccines perform. I don't think at the moment, we can handicap it except to say that it is certainly a favorable finding that the spike protein in its various different forms, typically as a prefusion form or it's hoped it is a prefusion form, seems to be quite immunogenic, and there are reasonable titers of antibodies being produced. So that should give us considerable optimism. I should also say, I \u2013 we \u2013 the broader industry is collaborating and thinking about these problems in how to make sufficient doses available. And I think the community at large should be very encouraged by the enormous numbers of vaccine doses that are being planned for, for manufacturing, particularly as we get into 2021 and beyond. If these vaccines are effective, I think the industry is going to be able to produce enough material, ultimately, to provide vaccination for a substantial fraction of the world's population. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger. I think there is a second question on 4482. Roger Perlmutter : Right. So the second question is, would we see an antiviral benefit with MK-4482? It's important to note here that MK-4482 differs in mechanism quite a lot from Remdesivir. Remdesivir, of course, is a RNA-dependent polymerase inhibitor. It caused determination. Whereas MK-4482 is a cytosine analog that is incorporated, and as a result, causes misincorporation of bases into the nascent RNA. Those RNAs are produced, but they contain many, many errors, and the result is something called aero catastrophe, which is a very powerful means of preventing production of functional virus. So those are two quite different mechanisms. The expectation is that there would be production of virus at least for a period of time, but that virus would not be able to replicate. I think from, from a variety of in-vitro studies, it is possible to measure a dramatic reduction in virus production. And we may see the same thing in our clinical studies. We are, of course, looking for it. The Phase 2 studies are underway. So it won't take too long until we have a chance to see that. We are, of course, as well measuring clinical outcomes. Umer Raffat : Thank you very much. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Umer. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now live. Go ahead please. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks. Maybe two from me. Just one follow-up on the oral antiviral for COVID2. I was just wondering if you can comment on when we might expect to see some of the initial Phase II data and then how you're defining success on that front. And then the second question I had was for Rob. Just wondering the outlook for capital allocation for the rest of the year if the share program is still on hold? And if that, as a result, you're intending to be more active on the business development front here over the near term? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Right. For MK-4482, I think that the we \u2013 I don't really want to dribble out data on this. As we acquire meaningful data from the Phase II program, well, of course, let you know. But I should point out that we will be embarking probably in September on very large pivotal studies. And so those are going to be the important ones. And here, the goal has to be that with this orally active drug, that we can both reduce the duration of symptoms, but more importantly, key people who are symptomatic from becoming sick enough that they require hospitalization or if hospitalized, that they require intensive care unit hospitalization. The good news about MK-4482 is that it \u2013 because it is an oral drug given in capsules, it can be easily administered from the time that people have symptoms. And so that, I think, could mean that we could have a meaningful effect on the clinical outcomes. And that, of course, has to be the goal of therapy. Peter Dannenbaum : And Rob, on capital allocation. Rob Davis : Yes. Good morning. So, as you pointed out, we did stop this share repurchase after the first quarter, and all we did that really out of an abundance of caution because we weren't sure how do you would progress. I'm happy to report, and as I mentioned in the prepared comments, our cash flow actually remains very strong. And our access to capital is also very strong. I think we demonstrated that in a recent debt offering at record low rates. So from that position, we're in a good position. As we think about share repurchase for the remainder of the year, we continue to evaluate it. Business development is very important to us. So I obviously put a priority on making sure we have the capital necessary for business development to fund the business itself and the meaningful capital expansion were underway as well as all of the important programs that we've talked about. So we're looking at all of that and continuing to evaluate whether or not we will restart in the remainder of the year. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Terence. Next question please, Laura. Operator : Yes, sir. Thank you for that. We have your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So first question I have here is, in light of the pandemic and ahead of the 2020 presidential election, how did the environment for M&A look? How are valuations? And what is the willingness of sellers? And the second question I had for you is assuming you get approval of V114 and the rest of your PCV portfolio, how do you see Merck fitting into the treatment paradigm for PCV? Is this a winner-take-all market? And will things change if these PCV24 is actually make it to market? Thank you. Ken Frazier : So, I\u2019ll start off with the business development question, Louise. Thanks for the question. As Rob said, this business development remains a really important priority for us now and going forward. Right now, I think the environment which we are in is still a tough one in the sense that as you look at the first half of the year, the Biotech IPO market has outpaced last year, despite all the challenges associated with COVID, despite all the concerns that might happen with respect to the election. And of course, established biotech has also performed very well this year. So I think the challenge for us is to find the best scientific capability in a way that's value-creating for our shareholders. And right now, I think seller expectations are very high, notwithstand the issues around the political landscape, the executive orders and everything else. So I think at the end of the day, we still have to continue to search for the best clients commensurate with the need to create value for our shareholders. And I don't think the election is a critical factor there. Peter Dannenbaum : And Mike Nally, do you want to report. Mike Nally : Hi, Louise. On V114, I think what's really important here is for any future PCV vaccine, the first and foremost, continue to suppress \u2013 or continue to generate an immune response across all the 13 shared serotypes with current PCV13 vaccine and then add on additional serotypes. What we've seen with V114 is we've been very successful in doing so in both the adult and pediatric segment. As we look forward, we think there's room for multiple options within the PCV market. I think you can look at market like rotavirus is a good analog where despite having different profiles and different coverage profiles, we have basically a shared market with both Rotarix and with Rotateq. And so as we look forward, we think there's a big unmet need bill in this market. We think V114 will play a major role in that, and we continue to look at alternate options in the future with both V116 as well as V117. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Louise. Next question please, Laura. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions for Roger, please. First, regarding the Ridgeback Bio oral antiviral, what is your view on the risk of immunogenicity? And how do you plan to demonstrate to FDA that it has acceptable safety with respect to the action of the drug? And second, Merck has very sophisticated understanding of mRNA vaccines. Could you please discuss why Merck chose not to pursue mRNA vaccine development for COVID? And I know you touched on that a little bit, but just a little more color on that would be helpful. And between the two Merck candidates, maybe you could just highlight for us, which one we should be more focused on? Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Well, thank you, David. First of all, from the MK-4482 as you know that the compound is aims positive, that's in a way not unexpected given its mechanism of action, it is a cytosine analog. So that one could expect to see those kinds of things. The question is does the compound have mutagenic activities that's meaningful in mammalian cells and what we want to do about this. Ordinarily, of course, we don't want to take mutagens forward into clinical practice, although it has been done where the benefit risk profile makes sense. With respect to this compound, we should note that in other tests, for example, the in vitro and in vivo micronucleus test that the compound is negative. We're doing other in vivo tests for mutagenesis in mammalian systems. And we'll do the usual kinds of preclinical evaluations that are conducted in such settings which includes a development on reproductive toxicology studies and of course accelerated carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Those are the things that one customarily does and my expectation is that when you look at the totality of data, that benefit risk profile for a short term course in treating an acute pulmonary infection will be favorable. And of course, that has been seen before. So it is something that we pay a lot of attention to. But on the other hand, I think, something that we can overcome. With respect to MRNA vaccines you're right we have quite a bit of experience, which we gained from working with our colleagues at Moderna, in looking at MRA vaccination. And I think there are some great strengths to MRA vaccination in particular, it's quite fast as both Moderna and Beyontec now working with Pfizer had demonstrated one can move very quickly from knowing the sequence, the genetic sequence of a potential target to developing an immunogen. On the other hand, our concern from the beginning was that this was going to be a pandemic. We felt that way long before WHO declared it a pandemic. We had no idea it would be as severe and as widely dispersed as it has proved to be, it is a threat to the entire world. And none of us are safe until we're all safe, as everyone says. And with that in mind, the need will be to mount effective vaccination for a large fraction of human population. There are several aspects of that that are important to emphasize. The first of course, as I've said, is it is nice to have a single dose vaccine. It would also be nice to have a vaccine that could be administered orally in the way that, for example, not that this is directly relevant the same in oral vaccine and came to replace the original polio vaccine. And in addition, we should recognize that there are many different populations who are infected. Of course, everyone is ultimately infected, but we have an elderly population at extremely high risk, particularly those who have underlying cardiovascular disease. And those individuals, the elderly population, tend not to respond as well. So under those circumstances [indiscernible], and especially in potent immunogen that was a reason for wanting to choose a replicating viral platform, in addition to our desire to have a single dose. We also have children, and adolescents and those in their third decade of life who are currently being infected in very high numbers. And we have a lot of people in robust, early adulthood who are ending up in the intensive care unit. Those people have extremely potent immune responses, but that\u2019s important to get neutralization amounted quite early, I believe, in that population. So that could be a different kind of virus, maybe not the same one you would use in the adult population, as a vaccine, a different kind of viral vaccine. And the answer to the question of which one of these should we pay attention to, I think, I'm paying attention to both. We will get information from the measles platform earlier. And of course the measles platform, the measles vaccine has been used successfully in billions of people. So we have a lot of confidence in the way that will behave. We just need to see immunogenicity data. I would say, pre-clinically, it looks terrific. And then of course, we have a lot of confidence in the USP platform, which we've investigated extensively through the course of our registration program for Ebola virus vaccine. So I've watched them both. And I think that they're potentially quite important. Ken Frazier : Thank you. Next question, please, Lauer. And we're going to fix [indiscernible], to try to get as many questions in as possible. Thank you. Operator : Absolutely, thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of Seamus Fernandez form Guggenheim. Your line is now live please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much. So Roger I did want to just follow-up on EIDD-2801 or Merck\u2019s new number MK-4482. But more so as a potential treatment for other respiratory retroviruses, can you just maybe help us understand if you believe that this is a potential treatment in those setting and if there is broader, potential for this particular mechanism? And then second I did want to ask actually about your HIV program, MK-8591. I believe Merck was hoping to have another agent to marry the MK-8591 to optimize the treatment opportunity. Would you mind just maybe updating us on that in the context of identifying longer acting treatment regimen? And then separately just on the robustness of the data for some other agents in the prep regimen maybe you can just update us on your thoughts around MK-8591 as a potential best-in-class treatment choice for prep? Thanks. Ken Frazier : Take you chance Roger. Roger Perlmutter : Yes, Seamus thanks for the questions. For MK-4482, you're right, you're completely right, because of its mechanism-of-action, that it resembles a nucleoside base. It\u2019s in fact, just a derivatized version of a cytosine. It can be incorporated into any nascent RNA strain that is made by an appropriate virus. It's just a function of how well the viral polymerase is willing to accept the modified base. And just as one expects a virus is built for speed, typically viruses their RNA polymerases for RNA viruses are more accommodating of different structures than our mammalian DNA-dependent RNA polymerases involved in making messenger RNA, for example. And so it has good selectivity and good properties in that regard and should work very well for a whole variety of RNA viruses in vitro, it does exactly that. So a whole set of RNA viruses could potentially be treated, including, broadly speaking coronaviruses that we haven't yet made the acquaintance of. We don't really want to make the acquaintance of these, but our expectation is that this is not our last pandemic and probably not the last pandemic caused by coronavirus. So MK-4482 has broad activity and is potentially useful in a variety of different settings. Let's first see how it does with respect to SARS-CoV-2. Regarding islatravir, we have \u2013 of course, we remain enormously enthusiastic about islatravir Phase 3 studies are ongoing for the first set of combinations for islatravir for treatment of HIV infected individuals. And we've also, as you say, been looking for compounds to partner with islatravir, and we have such compounds. One of them moving forward right now is MK-8507. And we also have a group of others. So we believe that we're in a good place with respect to those. But we're moving forward in a variety of different directions. And then with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, yes, because the long durability of islatravir, the potential for a once monthly oral in particular, which could be used anywhere in the world, I think, is extremely attractive. But beyond that, as we've shown, islatravir can be formulated in a implantable form, which is a polymer that is positioned underneath the skin and can be active for potentially a year. And that provides, just about as close to perfect chemoprophylaxis as one can get, it's nearly vaccine like. So we're pursuing that as well, and we're optimistic about the ability of islatravir to make a big change in terms of the prevalence of HIV-mediated disease and the incidence of HIV infection. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Seamus. Next question, please, Laura. Operator : Absolutely, thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink. You can go ahead, please. Your line is now live. Daina Graybosch : Thank you very much for the question two from me. I wonder why you are so confident on both your COVID vaccine candidates that they could be a single dose, when, let's say, the chip adding a viral vector, which, I think, we also thought to be a single dose, looks much better with two doses in the early clinical data. And the second question just following-up on one from earlier is are you looking to choose between the two vaccine programs as you get clinical data, or do you expect to bring both of them all the way through to registration, maybe finding different places for them in the market? Thank you. Ken Frazier : Roger? Roger Perlmutter : Yes, thanks for those questions. So we have a lot of confidence in the single dose activity of both vaccines, because these are replicating vaccines. So they replicate in you, they are very potent immunogens and they have single dose activity, single administration activity in other settings. So of course, with V590, that's the vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine. That has been demonstrated for Ebola virus disease very effectively. A single dose provides in the field in the setting of civil strife of a large magnitude, greater than 97.5% efficacy in a single dose. Now, I can't tell you that that's exactly that it will behave when we put a different gene in this case SARS-CoV-2 spike protein spike protein encoding nucleic acids into the construct. But the interesting thing about the VSV platform is that this is actually a vaccine in which the spike protein becomes part of the vaccine, the replication of the virus is completely dependent upon the spike protein, it becomes the envelope protein that the vaccine which is different from simply expressing the protein, wherever one expresses it. So that has big effects. And pre-clinically the magnitude of the response on single administration is very impressive. Similarly, the measles platform has been shown in a variety of different settings most recently with respect to the chikungunya administration to be a very potent immunogen. We have a lot of competence in that. And with respect to Y2, as I've said, there is reason to believe that multiple different vaccines will be required in order to manage this extraordinary global pandemic. In particular, when one thinks about the heterogeneity of the population that we want to vaccinate, those with extremely robust immune responses, for example, teenagers or those in their 20s, those in the elderly population at greatest risk, but we have poor immune responses just to give a couple of examples. There is also reason in terms of just the ability to deliver the vaccine to different parts of the globe and to administer it successfully as part of a huge global vaccination program. And so our intention at the moment is not to choose, but to instead examine the special properties of each of these very good platforms and then to see which one needs to be taken forward first and in which population and which perhaps second, although both could be advanced simultaneous. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Daina. We're going to take one more question and apologies to those of you that we didn't get to today. Operator : Thank you sir. You next question will come from the line of Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live, go ahead please. Chris Schott : All right great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just a couple ones here. First on, KEYTRUDA, are you seeing fairly normalized new patients starts in major markets at this point, or is there still some disruptions there? And maybe it's part of that answer, you just give us a quick update in terms of where kind of market share and penetration stands in frontline lung? And then my second question was on the vaccine business and wellness visits. Are we also kind of at normalized levels as we move through July at this point? Are you anticipating any catch-up as we go later in the year for some of the missed vaccinations from 2Q? Thanks so much, Ken Frazier : Frank? Frank Clyburn : Yes, Chris good morning. For Keytruda, we are very encouraged, especially over the last month. We are seeing new patient starts get back to where they were almost pre-COVID. If you look at what happened in the quarter, Chris, April and May new patient starts were down somewhere in the range about 5% to 10%, depending on the cancer type, but that has improved. And we're seeing that pretty much around the world where oncologists are now figuring out ways to be able to get patients into their practices. That's going to vary by geographies. There will be some ups and downs around that, but all in all oncology has been very resilient. And probably most importantly, what we're encouraged about is the continued strong momentum, not only in non-small cell lung cancer, we still are seeing in the U.S. first about 80% of the eligible patients receiving Keytruda. But we're also very excited about all the other indications that Roger mentioned and we're seeing really good growth in head and neck, bladder, adjuvant melanoma and some of the other newer indications. So all in all, we feel very confident in Keytruda not only in the near term, but as we've continued to stay long-term with regards to vaccines, you heard from Rob's comments up front is that April and May wellness visits were down very significantly in particular in the U.S. market, approximately 70% in the month of April. They started to improve as you got to June. And we really saw some encouraging pick with wellness visits for our pediatric portfolio and for the pediatric patient population. Adolescents are lagging a little bit behind, which is why we mentioned we're keeping an eye on GARDASIL, but we are seeing encouraging signs there with wellness visits, picking up as well, which gives us the confidence, not only near term for GARDASIL, but as we mentioned, the strong demand that we continue to believe will come through for GARDASIL, not only in the U.S. but clearly outside the U.S. in markets, such as China, so very confident in that outlook as well Chris. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, thank you Chris. I\u2019ll turn to Ken for closing comments. Ken Frazier : Thanks Peter. As you\u2019ve heard today, we remain confident in our strategy, our execution and our prospects for strong long-term growth. We remain committed also to bringing Merck's mission alive by advocating for innovative approaches and partnerships that will be essential to bring an end to this pandemic, while also investing behind our promising pipeline. I want to thank you all for joining us today. And I hope that you and your family stay safe and healthy. Operator : Thank you, sir. Thank you so much presenters. And again, thank you everyone for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",

Q3 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks Laura and good morning. Welcome to Merck's third quarter 2020 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs; Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer; Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, Head of Discovery Research. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided reconciliation in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, today's earnings release and an investor presentation with some highlights of our results are all posted on merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Kenneth Frazier : Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. I want to start by acknowledging the extraordinary efforts of scientific experts across the biopharmaceutical industry who are rising to the challenge and working tirelessly to find solutions to help end the pandemic. We remain confident that science will prevail over COVID-19 and Merck is committed to contributing its scientific expertise and resources in support of these worldwide efforts. As we have mentioned in the development of medicines and vaccines to address the pandemic is a testament to the societal value of our industry's continuing investments in science and to the women and men who are working with urgency and dedication to make it happen. Merck has a special responsibility to apply its expertise given its long and productive history in antiviral and vaccine research and we are advancing our vaccine and antiviral programs through focused investment of effort and resources. We have made significant progress over the last few months across our COVID program and our learnings reinforce our confidence that the approaches we've selected are among the most promising. We are moving forward with dispatch and diligence, designing our clinical studies in a manner that is successful will provide physicians and patients confidence that our candidates are safe, effective, simple to administer and distribute, and capable of being used not just in millions, but billions of people. While we understand the importance of moving expeditiously in light of the pandemic, our experience with the natural history of other pandemic and epidemic viral diseases counsels us to seek enduring solutions that can be deployed globally now and for future generations. It is an exciting time at Merck and I am encouraged by our scientists enthusiasm for the innovative research happening in our lab, not just on the COVID front, but across our broad pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines that we are continuing to invest in. Our deep pipeline and the team of world-class scientists at Merck Research Lab is the result of the stellar leadership and many meaningful contributions made by Dr. Roger Perlmutter who will be stepping down from his current role at the end of this year. I am grateful for the extraordinary contributions Roger has made to science, medicine and the health and wellbeing of people around the world, as well as to all of us here at Merck. Roger leaves behind a strong legacy of historic breakthroughs in immuno-oncology and many other fields of medicine that have transformed clinical practice and improved patient outcomes. Under his leadership the company has received more than 100 regulatory approvals for its [indiscernible] and vaccines globally and he has revitalized the future of R&D at Merck. Dr. Dean Li, currently Senior Vice President of Discovery Sciences and Translational Medicine has been appointed to succeed Roger as Head of Merck Research Laboratories effective January 01. And I look forward to welcoming him to Merck's senior leadership team. I am confident that Dean's knowledge, energy and experience and his purposeful pursuit of new technologies and transformational discovery will help Merck sustain a successful execution of our broad portfolio during this important time, advance our scientific strategy and build on the strong momentum in our pipeline. Now, moving to our third quarter performance, we continued executing on our strategic priorities while once again delivering year-over-year growth in revenue despite some ongoing impacts of the pandemic and very strong EPS growth. Importantly, we exited the quarter with continuing business momentum. We are performing at a high level with production, supply and distribution of our medicines, vaccines and animal health products and clinical trials moving forward with minimal disruption. The underlying demand for our products remains robust globally as evidenced by the growth we achieved in oncology and animal health. We are also encouraged by the recovery we are seeing in vaccine and those parts of the portfolio most affected by the pandemic's impact on healthcare delivery. We are executing well in the marketplace to drive growth across our existing portfolio and in our lab by advancing our innovative research programs. Meaningful new data that we've recently disclosed in several areas of research including oncology, vaccine, HIV and others increases the confidence we have in our ability to introduce new innovations to the markets and sustain strong long-term growth, and our financial strength also allows us to execute on our capital allocation priorities including our ongoing investments in both internal R&D and external business development such as the recent oncology collaborations with Teijin. At the same time we are advancing our plans to spin off Organon, which is on track for completion in the second quarter 2021. We remain confident in our decision to create two more focused companies devoted to their respective strength and portfolios and better positioned to navigate in evolving healthcare landscape and enhance value for patients and shareholders. We continue to hire talented and experienced leaders who will help drive Organon's success as an independent company. Let me conclude by expressing my confidence in the business and our ability to advance our pipeline despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. Additionally, I express my sincere gratitude to the frontline healthcare workers and our employees who worked around the clock to help patients affected by COVID-19. Their dedication inspires all of us at Merck to remain committed to our mission and relentlessly pursue innovative science to help prepare for the greatest health threat both now and in the future. And with that, I'll now pass the call on to Rob to review the details of our performance and our outlook. Robert Davis : Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. As Ken noted, we continue to be encouraged by the strength and resiliency of our business as we once again delivered year-over-year growth despite ongoing impacts from the pandemic. Merck employees across the organization are continuing their important work, addressing the pipeline, and ensuring patients have access to our portfolio, medically important medicines and vaccines, while contributing to industry-wide efforts to develop solutions to the pandemic. In the quarter, we saw a strong recovery in our performance and the underlying demand for products across our key growth pillars turning us up very strong close to the year as reflected in our updated guidance. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy, including our capital allocation priorities. We are investing behind our deep pipeline including our COVID candidates and have been active on the business development front. Of note, this quarter we successfully entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Teijin to gain access to two oncology assets that further augment our pipeline. We are committed to investing in our business for the long-term and we will continue to do so in line with our mission of following the science to solve unmet needs of patients around the world. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.6 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year or 2% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. The pandemic negatively impacted our third quarter human health results by approximately $475 million, mostly in our vaccines portfolio. There was minimal impact to animal health. Our revenue growth excluding this estimated impact would have been approximately 5% or 6% ex exchange. The remainder of my comments will be focused on the underlying performance of our key growth drivers and near term trends and will be on an ex exchange basis. Our human health revenues increased 2%. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew sales grew 21% year-over-year, reaching $3.7 billion. In the United States grow in KEYTRUDA usage across all key tumor types remained strong and KEYTRUDA continues to be the leader in lung cancer by a widening margin. We are strengthening our leadership in IO, across a broadening array of indications outside of lung cancer, notably in melanoma, bladder and head and neck cancers, with momentum from launches in renal cell and endometrial carcinomas. It is worth noting that indications outside of lung now represent roughly 50% of our sales in the United States and will continue grow over time as we further penetrate these indications and continue to add new indications going forward. Uptake following the launch of our q6 weekly adult dosing regimen helped to offset the impact of reduced new patient starts caused by the pandemic. Outside of the United States, lung cancer indications remain the driver of KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 in the first line setting, where we continue to see strong penetration. In Japan, the combined impact of the two huge seller pricing adjustments in the first half of the year more than offset underlying volume growth. Lynparza and Lenvima continue to demonstrate strong growth and remain meaningful contributors to our broader oncology portfolio, growing 58% and 29% respectively year-over-year. Lynparza's performance in the quarter continues to reflect strong growth and leadership in the PARP class in the U.S. despite increasing competition with incremental contributions from and expanded indication in ovarian cancer and an early launch uptake in prostate cancer. Lenvima maintains market leadership in the first line hepatocellular carcinoma, and the combination with KEYTRUDA in the endometrial carcinoma, is now the leading regimen in the metastatic setting in the United States. Turning to vaccines. As mentioned, while our vaccines portfolio made a strong recovery from the second quarter, year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by continued below normal levels of wellness visits particularly in the United States. GARDASIL sales declined 10% year-over-year as growth in ex-U.S. markets was more an offset by pandemic driven impacts in the United States. Volumes in the key back-to-school season were below normal particularly among adolescents. Sales were also impacted by delayed public sector purchases. Ex-U.S., growth was driven by continued strong volume in China and the expansion of general neutral vaccination programs in Europe, partially offset by reduced demand in Hong Kong. PNEUMOVAX delivered 58% growth due to heightened awareness of the importance of protection against pneumococcal disease amidst the pandemic and heading into the flu season partially offsetting the GARDASIL decline. While our vaccines business and in particular GARDASIL is always subject to quarter-over-quarter variability, the longer term trends for underlying demand continue to strengthen. We remain confident in the future growth prospects of GARDASIL due to growing global recognition of its important role in preventing certain cancers, reinforced by recent data published out of Sweden. Our hospital performance also improved from second quarter levels. Most notably, the recovery in elective surgical procedures benefited BRIDION which grew 13% year-over-year. Our ongoing PROVAMES launch also contributed favorably growing 69%. Our human health business has sustained upward achieving sales of $1.2 billion and delivering 12% growth year-over-year. Companion animal grew 18% reflecting underlying demand for the BRAVECTO line of products and strength from our portfolio of companion animal vaccines. Livestock grew 8% reflecting contributions across our ruminants line and poultry products as well as growth from our technology products. We are encouraged by the resilience of our animal health business which has outperformed our expectations in this challenging environment. Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin were 74.8% in the quarter, a decrease of 110 basis points due to a combination of pricing pressure, inventory write-offs, collaboration amortization and foreign exchange offset in part by product mix. Operating expenses decreased 6% year-over-year to 4.5 billion. In total, COVID favorably impacted spending by approximately $115 million driven largely by lower promotional selling and administrative costs along with lower laboratory, travel, and meeting expenses, partially offset by increased spending to advance our COVID-19 antiviral and vaccines research programs. The significant year-over-year increase in other income was driven by unrealized gains in our security holdings primarily reflecting our direct and indirect investments in Moderna. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.8% and was driven by a lower assumed full year effective tax rate as a result of favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.74 per share, an increase of 18% reflecting strong operational performance that more than overcame COVID headwinds as well as contributions from our other income. Now, turning to the guidance, our updated guidance reflects our confidence in the underlying strength of our business. We now expect revenues of $47.6 billion to $48.6 billion, which reflects an increase of $150 million from our previous midpoint. Our guidance assumes roughly $2.35 billion of COVID headwind for the year, an increase from our prior assumption of $1.95 billion. We now assume a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 1.5 percentage points using mid October rates. Overall, our guidance implies 3% to 5% growth in revenues for the full year excluding the impact of exchange. Excluding the impact of the pandemic, our guidance range implies year-over-year growth of 8% to 10%, reflecting continued strong underlying demand for our products. Broadly, we're encouraged by the recovery of our business, which has been largely consistent with our original expectations, with GARDASIL being the primary exception. GARDASIL is trending in the right direction, but the phasing of the recovery is slower than we anticipated, largely due to the impact of the pandemic on the back-to-school season, particularly in the United States. We are also seeing some residual negative impacts of the pandemic extend into the fourth quarter, and some parts of the world, primarily in Europe and certain emerging markets. Most importantly, our operational performance remained strong and has enabled us to offset impact from the pandemic. As we end the year and head into 2021, our confidence is further reinforced by the ability of the healthcare systems around the world to adapt and deliver care and by the value of our medically important products delivery to patients. As a result, we continue to believe in our long-term growth prospects, which remain underestimated by the Street. We continue to expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are now expected to decline at a low single digit rate year-over-year, driven by reduced spending due to the pandemic and strong expense management. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 15.5% reflecting improved earnings mix. We now expect other income of roughly $750 million reflecting higher income from investments in equity securities. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.91 to $6.01, which reflects an increase of $0.25 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 2.5 percentage points. Our results continue to benefit from an improved tax rate and higher other income due to gains from our equity holdings. That said, our operational strength continues to drive leverage in the P&L through robust revenue growth and expense management, allowing for meaningful investments in our pipeline, while at the same time delivering margin expansion. We continue to make progress on our strategy to evolve our operating model in order to drive efficiency and productivity throughout the organization. This is occurring through process improvements, and the leveraging of new digital capabilities, which have become increasingly important as we find new ways to engage with patients and physicians in this pandemic. Our balance sheet remains strong and we are well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Fully investing in our key growth drivers and pipeline remains our top priority and we are committed to growing the dividend and to driving value enhancing business development that will help position Merck for long-term success. To conclude, the swift recovery we experienced in the third quarter, serves as an indicator of the true value our products provide to patients around the world and our ability to execute. We remain confident in the fundamental strength of our business and the significant runway for growth that our derisked portfolio of assets provides. Further the spinoff of Organon in the second quarter will enable it to realize the growth potential of its portfolio of medically important products and will allow us to focus our attention and investments more fully on our key growth drivers and robust pipeline to deliver innovative medicines and vaccines to patients around the world now and long into the future. Before I close, I'd like to also personally thank Roger for his many contributions to Merck, which will benefit our company and the patients we serve for many years to come. It's been a pleasure working alongside you and learning from you. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger Roger Perlmutter : Thank you very much, Rob. During the third quarter, our laboratories made important advances on many fronts, including regulatory approvals, filing of new drug applications, obtaining meaningful new clinical data, advancing new product opportunities into development, and forging new R&D alliances. Our press release tabulates many of these accomplishments, but cannot convey the rapid pace at which these programs are advancing. As an example, during the third quarter the United States Food & Drug Administration approved an expanded label for KEYTRUDA in the setting of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, based on our KEYNOTE-204 study that compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to treatment with brentuximab vedotin a standard therapy. But note that approval of this indication was received at just three months after acceptance of the file, a reflection of the high quality of the underlying work by our clinical development and regulatory colleagues. KEYTRUDA is also under review for the first line treatment in combination with chemotherapy of previously untreated locally recurrent in operable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer, with tumors expressing PD-L1, the combined proportion score of 10 or greater, based on the results of our KEYNOTE-355 study for the PDUFA date of November 28. And also for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of triple negative breast cancer, based on the results of our KEYNOTE-522 study with a PDUFA date of March 29, 2021. Results from these studies have been previously presented. In Europe, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP adopted positive recommendations for Lymparza as monotherapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic BRCA mutant, castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed following treatment with a modern androgen blocking agent. Lymparza also received a favorable opinion for the first line maintenance treatment in combination with bevacizumab of advanced homologous recombination deficient ovarian cancer based on the results of the TOWER I [ph] Phase 3 study. Meanwhile, in Japan we obtained approval for KEYTRUDA in the second line treatment of PD-L1 positive esophageal cancer, based on data from our KEYNOTE-181 study. We also received approval in Japan for the 400 mg every six weeks regimen for KEYTRUDA across all adult indications, an approach already adopted in Europe and in the United States. I mentioned each of these approvals because they document the continued progress of our broad based registration programs for KEYTRUDA and for our partnership with AstraZeneca on Lymparza which is conducted around the world, despite the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings in early September, we highlighted long-term data demonstrating the durable impact of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of malignant disease. For example, data from our KEYNOTE-024 study in the first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 on at least 50% tumor cells showed that after five years overall survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA treated group as compared with those who received traditional chemotherapy, this despite a high rate of crossover to KEYTRUDA in the chemotherapy arm. Similarly, a combination of chemotherapy plus KEYTRUDA, as compared with chemotherapy alone meaningfully improved overall survival at four years in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and especially in those whose tumors that combined proportion scores for PD-L1 expression of greater than 1, based on our KEYNOTE-048 study. And in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, following surgical resection, the long term data showed a 40% reduction in the risk of distant metastases in the KEYTRUDA treated population, as opposed to those who did not receive adjuvant therapy. Together these data speak to the durable improvement and outcomes, the attempts at the use of KEYTRUDA in otherwise difficult to manage malignancies. At ESMO 2020, we also presented data regarding potential new cancer therapies including vibostolimab, our anti-TIGIT antibody, which we hope may improve treatment responses when combined with KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer patients, whose tumors express low levels of PD-L1, including in patients who have progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Vibostolimab is one of three new agents that we have prioritized for combined therapy with KEYTRUDA, and we will advance this agent to pivotal trials in 2021. We also presented data for MK-4830 an ILT4 antibody that acts to block immune suppression imposed by elements of the tumor microenvironment. MK-4830 showed promising activity in multiple tumor types, including in patients whose tumors had progressed on PD-L1 therapy. Ongoing expansion cohorts will explore the activity of MK-4830 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer. More recently at the North American conference on lung cancer, we presented data on the combination of quavonlimab, our novel CTLA-4 directed therapy at a dose of 25 mg every six weeks in combination with KEYTRUDA in the first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Data obtained after 16.9 months of median follow up showed an overall response rate of 37.5%, and a median overall survival of 18.1 months. Importantly, the median duration of response in the responding population was not reached. The registration enabling study testing quavonlimab co-formulated with KEYTRUDA is planned for 2021. The third quarter gave us the opportunity to advance many other new drug candidates in a variety of other therapeutic areas. For example, we presented additional data on the activity of MK-6482, our HIF-2 alpha inhibitor in the treatment of von Hippel-Lindau disease, documenting shrinkage of tumors with MK-6482 therapy in the kidney, with the overall response rate, including only confirmed responses were 36.1%. For pancreatic lesions in this disease, the confirmed overall response rate was 63.9% and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system the confirmed overall response rate was 30.2%. These are meaningful responses, especially since current therapy for von Hippel-Lindau disease required surgical extravasation [ph] of tumors, often involving dozens of procedures extending over many years. In the infectious disease area, we continue to advance islatravir, our novel non nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor for daily administration in combination with PIFELTRO. Phase 2B 96-week data presented at the HIV Glasgow meeting, demonstrated sustained viral suppression in treatment-naive patients which augurs well for the future of this regimen. Phase 3 studies will began in February of this year. We also advanced MK-8507, a new long acting non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which we believe will partner well with islatravir in extended dose regimens. Meanwhile we announced positive immunogenicity results for four additional Phase 3 studies of V114, 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when dosed in adults. These data helped to complete the entire set of adult registration studies, which will be filed before the end of the year. Finally during the third quarter, we've made substantial progress in our COVID-19 directed programs. Turning first to molnupiravir, formerly known as MK-4482, which is a direct acting orally bioavailable antiviral drug that we're developing in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Phase 1 studies completed during the first quarter provided evidence of the compound as well tolerated as monotherapy in single doses as high as 1.6 grams and in multiple doses of 800 mg twice per day for five days. We believe that the concentration of the active [indiscernible] that were treated should be more than sufficient to terminate virus production. Three relatively small Phase 2 dose escalation studies evaluating the antiviral effect of molnupiravir in COVID-19 patients were initiated by our colleagues at Ridgeback and data from these studies will soon become available. Meanwhile we have initiated two large global Phase 2/3 studies, one in hospitalized patients and the second in outpatients. Together these studies will enroll more than 2700 patients, and will examine clinical outcomes, including both efficacy and safety. Based on its mechanism of action we are hopeful that this new therapy, which is administered orally in capsule form will meaningfully reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Along with this progress in clinical development, we have secured resources to produce millions of doses of molnupiravir before the end of 2020 with an even greater supply becoming available early in 2021. It should be mentioned that in preclinical studies, molnupiravir is active against numerous coronavirus species, including those responsible for SARS and MERS, as well as a wide variety of RNA viruses, including the influenza virus. Hence molnupiravir could prove to be a useful antiviral agent in a variety of settings. Our COVID-19 directed vaccine candidates were also advanced into clinical trials during the third quarter. As Ken mentioned, in developing a vaccine against COVID-19, we have pursued proven platforms, focusing in particular on replicating virus vector that could provide durable protection following a single administration. Our first vaccine candidate developed in partnership with the Institut Pasteur in Paris employs a modified measles virus vaccine that has been engineered to express the major surface protein SARS-CoV-2. During the third quarter this vaccine candidate V591 was advanced into two Phase 1 clinical studies involving nearly 300 healthy volunteers. The V591 Phase 1 studies have enrolled well, such that immunogenicity data should become available before the end of the year. A second vaccine candidate, V590 developed in collaboration with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative or IAVI makes use of a vesicular stomatitis virus vector, which is the same vector system that we use to develop Ervebo, the first successful vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease. The Phase 1 program for V590 is proceeding in much the same fashion as that for V591, albeit offset by several weeks. Here again, we are optimistic that the candidate vaccine will elicit durable immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein following a single dose, and that it will be safe and well tolerated. For both V590 and V591 we are developing facilities that will enable us to produce many millions of vaccine doses in the near term, and hundreds of millions of doses should those be required in the longer term. Our expectation is that these vaccines will be made available in a format that permits global distribution with appropriate Cold Chain Management, ideally at refrigerated temperatures. Our prior experience in developing vaccines against many other viral diseases gives us some confidence that we will succeed in producing an effective agent for prophylaxis against COVID-19. In this context, I would call your attention to new data from a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine the beginning of October that make use of Swedish demographic and health registries which capture health data on the entire population of Sweden. The study included 1.67 million girls and women, 10 to 30 years of age, evaluated during the period 2006 to 2017. In that group after adjustment for all covariates there was an 88% reduction in the risk of cervical cancer as a result of immunization with GARDASIL before the age of 17. These new data offer hope for the potential eradication of this disease, which, according to the World Health Organization claims the lives of more than 300,000 women each year. The new Swedish study adds further impetus to our efforts to expand production of GARDASIL 9 with the goal of producing enough of this vaccine, about 200 million doses per year to permit girls and boys around the world to be successfully vaccinated. Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to my colleagues throughout Merck, and especially to those in the Merck Research Laboratories, with whom I have worked on and off since 1996. It has been my privilege to join you in translating breakthrough research into medicines that improve and extend lives. Your success in developing new vaccines like GARDASIL 9, novel antibiotics, new antiviral drugs, new drugs that battle cancer, drugs that improve outcomes in heart failure, and others that offer hope for those suffering from metabolic diseases and chronic debilitating syndromes, your success has not only improved and extended life but has inspired the world. As I plan to assume an advisory role at Merck, I am confident that Dean Li, who will succeed me as President is well prepared to lead MRL to even greater achievements. We have orchestrated an orderly transition in leadership, pledging to ensure in the words of George W. Merck, that human life will earn still greater freedom from suffering and disease. I'll now turn the call over to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Roger. Laura, if you could assemble the queue for questions, please? And I'd like to ask the analysts today to limit themselves to one question. We're going to try to end right at nine because I know there's other calls that you're looking to get on. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Beginning the Q&A, we have your first question coming from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Steve Scala : Thank you and it's tough to limit to one question, but I'll comply. Can -- Merck has profoundly transformed under your leadership. In the wake of Dr. Perlmutter\u2019s retirement, I wanted to note that I believe two years ago, can you agree to stay on beyond 2019? May I ask whether or not you will stay on as CEO of Merck, beyond 2021 to see this further transformation that the company is undertaking? Thank you. Kenneth Frazier : Thank you, Steve. The Board will continue to evaluate the timing of CEO succession right now. There is no specified timeframe for CEO retirement. What I will say is that I am confident that we have internally strong candidates to take this job and I look forward to working with the Board to actively review our leadership and succession planning and to ensure that we have an orderly transfer when the Board deems it appropriate. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Steve. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. So I want to say congratulations to you, Roger and thank you for all of your contributions, including transforming cancer treatment for patients worldwide and your contributions will be missed. So my question is, with respect to the Phase 2 oral antiviral data from Ridgeback, could you provide some more color on how you expect that data to be communicated and what you would focus this on? Thank you. Roger Perlmutter : Thanks very much, David. Yes, the, the Phase 2 studies carried on in the United States and the UK, are relatively small studies that are focusing on neurological endpoints. That is understanding reductions in viral load and reductions in virus infectivity from patient samples. So these data, I'm hopeful that as the studies complete enrollment and they are dose escalation studies, that these studies will provide data over the next couple of months. And once those data are looked at, and there's enough data that have accrued, then presumably, we would provide a top line statement about those data. But of course, the full scientific results will be published shortly thereafter. We will certainly move expeditiously because, of course, we know the world is very interested in this as we are ourselves. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, David. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Tim Anderson : Thank you. I have a question on KEYTRUDA and adjuvant. Previously, Astra announced a delay in the readout of their adjuvant lung trial because of the ADAURA results that necessitated a design adjustment for EGFR positive patients on Tagrisso. And I'm guessing that's going to impact other companies' adjuvant lung trials as well. Can you comment on the timing of us seeing your first lung adjuvant readout? And more broadly in adjuvant, what's the timing of the next adjuvant readout for you? Thank you. Roger Perlmutter : I'm sorry. Kenneth Frazier : Yes. Go ahead. Roger, please. Roger Perlmutter : Yes, so our adjuvant studies in non-small cell lung cancer are proceeding as planned, where we are not at the moment undertaking any reevaluation of those studies. Again, it's difficult to comment on exactly when the studies will read out, because, of course, we're recruiting events. But we are anticipating that the first of an adjuvant lung study will be available sometime later next year and that's our hope, but time will tell. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Tim. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Chris Schott : Great, thanks very much and Roger, best of luck with everything and congrats on all the success over the years. My question was on GARDASIL in the U.S. What do you think it's going to take to normalize results here? I guess my question is, do we need to wait until we get another back-to-school season for this to normalize or do you think that trends can start to get back to normal even in a COVID environment like we're operating today? And I guess when things normalize, should we think about there being some sort of catch up bolus for the patients who missed their vaccination this year or is this going to go back to just kind of a normal cadence of what we've historically seen with that vaccine? Thanks so much. Kenneth Frazier : Frank? Frank Clyburn : Yes. Hi, this is Frank. With regards to GARDASIL in the U.S. I think I'll take the second part of your question first, with regards to the catch up. Our hope is that we will see some catch up over time. In particular, as we put more commercial efforts, making sure that the adolescent cohort in particular are well aware of the importance of getting vaccinated with GARDASIL, so that is our plan. With regards to looking at the timing, I think back-to-school, as you head into '21 will be an important timeframe. Just to give you some additional color of what is happening in the U.S., well visits were down in the adolescent cohort about 30% compared to three-year historical averages. As Rob mentioned, we are seeing a more positive trend, although not what we expected. So we'll have to see here over the next several quarters how things evolve, but we're still very confident in GARDASIL growth in the U.S. as well as globally. To Rogers point, the Sweden data is very important data, which I think reinforces the importance of the chance to prevent cervical cancer for girls and boys around the world. We also saw significant growth continue in China, as well as Germany, and many of our ex-U.S. markets. So I would say, we're going to look over, obviously the next couple of quarters, but our confidence in GARDASIL, both mid and long-term is still very strong and we still feel very strong about the overall demand prospects for the product. Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Chris. Next question please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mara Goldstein from Mizuho Securities. Your line is live. Go ahead, please. Mara Goldstein : Great, thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the COVID vaccine program, maybe if you could just discuss the clinical program in the context of the pending readouts from other vaccines and contingency plans to make sure that you're able to fully enroll those trials on a timely basis? Roger Perlmutter : Right, thanks Mara. The -- of course it's very difficult to speculate on what the results of other studies will be. Like everyone else, we're hopeful that there will be many vaccines that yield positive readouts, in terms of reduction in morbidity and ideally, mortality associated with COVID-19 infection and time will tell. But in reality, we'll be sitting at the end of the year with what we hope will be quite strong single dose of immunogenicity data and we have well designed Phase 2/3 protocols that we can begin at that point. Those are global protocols and my expectation, and unfortunately, given the very large impact of the pandemic, my expectation is that it would not be difficult to enroll those studies in a relatively short period of time, just as has happened for the other studies that have been conducted using, for example, the mRNA vaccines or the and the virus vaccines. So I'm not sure that there's anything there to respond to, except that we're eager to see the data just as everyone else is and we hope very much that there will be efficacy and a good safety profile. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Mara. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Roger, I noticed for the COVID antiviral, there was a dedicated Phase 1, Phase 2 trial, evaluating viral clearance. However, heading into the two Phase 3s we're seeing online, it doesn't look like the viral clearance is the primary endpoint or even a secondary endpoint, at least not on clean trials. And I also noticed you mentioned good safety. So just wanted to understand are you expecting a viral clearance benefit? And how do you see the efficacy look different or similar relative to what we've seen in Remdesivir so far? Roger Perlmutter : Right and thanks very much for the question. To be honest, I am expecting to see viral clearance improve and that's based on a whole variety of inputs and the fundamental mechanism of the drug. I do think that in terms of reduction of viral burden, that it is very likely that won't appear they will be superior to Remdesivir based on preclinical studies. Of course, that has to be demonstrated in the clinic, but we will have quite a lot of Phase 2 virologic data based on the [indiscernible] studies which of course were intimately involved with the dose escalation studies. From a certain perspective, ab initio, this is a virally mediated disease. If you get rid of the virus, you should get rid of the disease. The question is, can you get in early enough and is the effect strong enough? The good news is that this is an orally administered drug. It could in principle be given to individuals who either are symptomatic or who have been in contact with virally infected people. But in order to broaden the use, we need to understand both pre-clinically and clinically, that the drug is safe to administer to people who are otherwise healthy and just at risk. So when we speak about safety, that's really what we're concerned about and we're waiting for additional data from more subjects who have been treated with the drug. The drug has been used, it is in a five day regimen and across now several hundred people it seems to be extremely well tolerated. We're not aware of any safety signals at all with the drug right at the moment. So we will just wait and see. I mean, that's the important information that we need to have. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Umer. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Truist. Your line is now live Go ahead, please. Gregg Gilbert : Thank you and best of luck to you Roger and Dean for what's next. I have a question on V114 sort of a maybe an R&D and marketing question. Other than the timing advantages you might have versus Pfizer, particularly on the pediatric side, how do you envision having a meaningful share of this market over time if Pfizer successfully develops its 20-Valent product? Investors tend to view this as a winner take all type of market? I think you've made some comments to the contrary, may be you can put some more details on how that could be achieved? Thank you. Kenneth Frazier : Mike Nally? Michael Nally : So thank you for the question. When we look at the market, the first and foremost area that we're looking at, is making sure that we actually confer protection across the 13 shared serotypes of PCV13. And I think what we've been able to demonstrate in the Phase 2 results that you've seen in the pediatric population is that you see a robust immune response across those 13 shared serotypes. And that's after dose three, which I think is also an important factor, because the primary series completion is really an important time point. When you think about what's next, then it's about how do we add to those 13 shared serotypes. And for our program, we've been able to show a robust immune response on 22F and 33F, as well as a really robust response on serotype 3, which is a key contributing factor to residual disease. And so, I think when we look at the real effort on V114, it's always been about making sure that we provide the relevant level of protection in the core serotypes, but then add all the serotypes to it. I think the question on the first year of life will be an important one as well. And we're looking forward to seeing more data from both our program as well as Pfizer's program. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Gregg. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Navin Jacob : Hi, thanks for taking the question. My congrats as well to Roger. Roger, wondering if you think it's feasible for a COVID vaccine, specifically yours, but also just generally to achieve sterilizing immunity. Obviously the focus of most of the trials currently is reduction in symptoms, but given the discussion around herd immunity and the importance of herd immunity for opening the economy fully back open, what does that mean if vaccines aren't able to achieve a significant amount of reduction in infection? Roger Perlmutter : Right. Okay, thanks for the question. I think first and foremost, of course, what we want out of a vaccine is to prevent clinical disease. I don't think any of us would care that much if people were infected, but didn't develop any disease. If we could guarantee that, that would always be the case, of course, provided that enough people can be can be immunized. I think sterilizing immunity will be difficult. Just in the nature of things, in these respiratory infections, it is difficult to prevent any viral colonization. That will be challenging. But frankly, we are still in the early phases of understanding COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 the causative agent. So we really don't understand a lot about the viral dynamics here. The state of the immune response in the natural infection setting and the durability of that immunity either from natural infection or what we hope we'll see after immunization, there's a lot, yes, that we need to study. It is clear that at least in rare circumstances, individuals who have been infected and cleared the infection can be re-infected and that should be a cautionary note for all of us. Over time this could evolve in a fashion that re-administration of a vaccine is required in order to prevent recrudescence of disease after exposure to the virus or it may be the case that we're able to control it with a single administration, which is of course what we hope for. I just think we don't have that information right now and we'll learn a great deal over the next few months as additional data become available. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Navin. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Roger, congrats on the retirement. It's been great working with you both at Merck and at your time at Amgen. Question on molnupiravir, just wanted to see if you had any more details from the Phase 1 such as common AEs or SAEs? And given that it's an oral, it does seem ideally suited for newly infected but mild patients. I want to get your perspective on that. Thank you. Roger Perlmutter : Right, Geoff? Thanks very much. Yes, molnupiravir from the -- again, small number of subjects who have received the drug in Phase 1 studies and now are in Phase 2 studies it seems to be extremely well tolerated in a five-day course b.i.d. doses that are well above what we believe is required to suppress viral replication or actually result in aero catastrophe and essentially the elimination of the virus. So, all of that looks, looks quite good. As you say, because it's an orally administered drug, in principle, all other things being equal, it could be administered even prophylactically in individuals at high risk. At the moment, we are waiting for additional data because I pointed out that the drug is Ames-positive and bacterial mutagenesis assay, and although the drug did not score in eukaryotic micronucleus assays, and there are other reasons to believe that that won't be a problem. Nevertheless, we're performing a whole variety of studies to explore immunogenicity. Assuming that those studies are negative, then I think we could think much more broadly about prophylactic administration. At the moment, we're thinking mainly about the place where benefit risk is clearly the strongest, and that is in individuals who are infected, particularly symptomatic individuals early in the course of disease, an ideal place for an early administered drug to attenuate the effects of that infection. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Geoff. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question and best of luck, Roger. Thank you for everything you've done for the field. You guys are advancing a co-formulation of KEYTRUDA and your CTLA-4 into Phase 3 for lung cancer. Just wondering how broad your co-formulation strategy is and if it's also possible, you could co-formulate KEYTRUDA with your anti-TIGIT. Thanks. Roger Perlmutter : Right? Well, the reality is, we've been working on checkpoint inhibitors for a long time now as have many others, and KEYTRUDA in particular, but PD-1 directed therapies more generally have very dramatic effects that are easy to see. We hope to find something that would be even better than KEYTRUDA, but neither we nor anyone else has found such a thing. We are pleased that our agents have activities when administered by themselves, but the activity is modest. It's not KEYTRUDA like activity and where we see the greatest effect is in combination with KEYTRUDA. So it makes sense that these things should be administered with KEYTRUDA. That's the place where you're going to see the biggest benefit and where co-formulation is possible. That's kind of the ideal. That's what we would do because then with a single administration get both drugs, assuming that you don't add a substantial safety burden. So we've conducted our studies and looking at those kinds of questions. Clearly for our CTLA-4 directed therapy, that makes a lot of sense, but it makes a lot of sense for all of the agents that we're looking at and we are looking both at the physical compatibility for co-formulation, and as well, whether that makes sense from a clinical perspective. Where it does, it's kind of the right thing to do for patients. Peter Dannenbaum : Right, thank you Terence. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is live. Go ahead, please. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much, and Roger, best of luck, and it's been great working with you over the last many years. I wanted to ask a commercial question. We're starting to see a lot of promotional efforts by other pharmaceutical companies to kind of drive a return to growth and a return to physicians' offices, as it relates to primary care visits, and obviously impacting diagnosis of disease. I'm just wondering what Merck is doing on the commercial side, and believes is necessary to really kind of get us back on the right track in 2021? How much of that are you seeing in your business and what are you doing to drive growth in '21? Frank Clyburn : Yes, hi Seamus, this is Frank. I think that's really important and we're putting a lot of effort. As you can imagine, a lot of those activities right now are still virtually being done, especially in certain markets around the world. But if you look at what we're doing, in particular, in the vaccine area, I think you may be have seen some of our non-branded commercial activities to raise awareness about the importance of HPV vaccination. You can see that we are continuing to put a lot of effort behind KEYTRUDA with healthcare professionals, as well as with our consumer campaigns and activities. And we also are in many markets around the world, continuing to engage in educational programs to make sure that physicians are well aware of a lot of the new data that you've heard Roger speak about here this morning. So we have significant efforts around the world and that's why we're confident in our overall growth profile, as we look towards not only the rest of this year as we head into 2021. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Seamus. And thank you all for limiting yourselves to one question. Great questions. I'd like to turn it over to Ken for closing comments. Kenneth Frazier : Thanks, Peter. As you've heard, we remain extremely confident in our strategy and we're highly motivated by the opportunities before us. We believe our ongoing scientific leadership, promising pipeline, upcoming launches, and track record of solid commercial execution will drive long-term growth. We remain committed to bringing Merck mission alive by sharpening our focus on R&D and being at the forefront of life saving research that will be essential to solving for this pandemic, as well as other healthcare challenges. So thank you for joining us today. I hope that you and your family stay safe and healthy. Operator : Thank you so much, presenters, and again, thank you, everyone for participating. This concludes today's conference, you may now disconnect, stay safe and have a lovely day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Lara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Co. Q4 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Lara, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs; Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. We've also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. And the supplemental financials posted to our website include recapped 2020 quarters based on the reporting change we are announcing today. I would also like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2019 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, today's earnings release and an investor presentation with highlights of our results are all posted on merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. Before turning to our financial results and our future perspective, I'd like to make a few comments about this morning's other announcement. It has been a distinct honor and privilege to serve this great company as its CEO over the past decade. I thank all of my Merck colleagues for their extraordinary support throughout this period. We are making this leadership change to cure in the knowledge that Merck has the elements in place for a strong future of scientific innovation and profitable growth. Rob Davis is well prepared and well suited to help Merck capitalize on the many exciting opportunities before it as well as to take on the challenges that lie ahead. He and the Merck senior team will provide outstanding leadership for our company in the coming years. Given Merck's current position of strength, the Merck Board and I believe it is a good time to begin transitioning the company's day-to-day decision-making as well as a strategic direction to Rob, who will assume the title of President in April, at which point our operating divisions, Human Health, Animal Health, Manufacturing and Research, will begin reporting to him. I will retire as CEO at the end of June but remain for some period of time as Executive Chairman to assist Rob, Dean, and the rest of the senior team. I am extremely confident in the capabilities and commitment of Merck's people and Rob's ability to guide the company to an even brighter future. Moving on to our results. Despite challenges from the pandemic, Merck achieved solid growth in revenues and earnings in 2020, made meaningful advancements in our pipeline and added important assets through business development. Despite the particular impact to our portfolio, the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remains strong. And our initial guidance reflects our expectation for a return to strong growth this year, 2021. Looking out to 2024, we continue to believe our revenue potential is underappreciated. Longer term, the work we are doing in advancing our internal pipeline and in adding assets through business development gives us increasing line of sight to significant potential growth drivers later this decade and into the next. I'm amazed by the dedication of our employees who rallied to keep supply uninterrupted, regulatory filings on track, and clinical and commercial execution in line with our goals. And I remain continually inspired by what Merck accomplishes for patients around the world. I'm also encouraged by the progress scientific experts across the biopharmaceutical industry have achieved in bringing vaccines to market that will help address the pandemic and start to return the world to normalcy. These successes further underscore the societal value of our industry's ongoing investments in science and innovation. Merck remains committed to developing an effective response to COVID-19 also. We have discontinued development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, but our therapeutic research programs continue to move forward. We believe that our oral antiviral candidate molnupiravir could make an important contribution to treating COVID-19 patients, and we look forward to seeing the results of our pivotal trials. More recently, we acquired OncoImmune and have accelerated the development of MK-7110, a Phase 3 candidate with strong potential in the treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. I am encouraged by the innovative research happening in our lab, not just on the COVID front, but across our broad late-stage pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines, including in oncology, HIV, and pneumococcal disease. We remain highly focused on business development to enhance our internal pipeline. We completed 120 transactions in total in 2020, including important acquisitions, such as OncoImmune, VelosBio, and ArQule and collaborations including CGEN and Ridgeback. Our plan to spin-off Organon remains on track for completion late in the second quarter. As independent, more focused company, I'm confident Merck and Organon will have the ability to more effectively pursue their respective market opportunities and business strategies to bring more value to patients and to shareholders. Let me conclude by expressing my confidence in the leaders of this company and how proud I am of the Merck team's success in advancing our pipeline and maintaining business continuity in a challenging environment. Additionally, I'd like to recognize and thank the frontline healthcare workers, scientists, and government officials working together to bring the world back to normalcy.  And with that, I'll pass it on to my colleague, Rob, to review the details of our performance and our outlook. Rob Davis : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'm honored and humbled to be named as Merck's next Chief Executive Officer. I look forward to continuing the important work we do to bring our medicines and vaccines to the people who need them. Under my leadership, Merck will remain focused on scientific innovation as the source of sustained long-term value for both patients and shareholders. Ken's unrelenting commitment to excellence and scientific innovation with patients at the center of everything we do permeates the culture of the company and its employees. Under Ken's leadership, Merck has achieved improved growth, clinical success, most notably with KEYTRUDA, and a revitalized pipeline and discovery research capability that will benefit both the company and the patients we serve for many years to come. Ken has put us in a position of financial and operational strength, from which we will be able to pursue our important mission to save and sustain lives through ongoing scientific innovation. The company has benefited from Ken's leadership. I personally and professionally benefited from his mentorship and guidance and want to thank him for that. His shoes won't be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today. The talent and commitment of Merck's employees worldwide, however, make me extremely confident that we will achieve continued success through this transition and long into the future as we build on Ken's legacy. Now turning to the business. Our resilience in a year that brought us countless challenges amidst the global pandemic is a true testament to the talent, hard work, and dedication of Merck employees worldwide. Our performance in this environment reinforces the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our potential for strong growth in 2021 and beyond. Underlying demand for our key growth pillars allowed our business to deliver 2% growth year-over-year or 4% excluding the impact of exchange, while absorbing approximately $2.5 billion of negative pandemic impact to revenues. Were it not for the pandemic impacts, we estimate growth for the year would have been approximately 9% ex exchange. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year, both nominally and excluding the impact of foreign currency. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $400 million due to the pandemic. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter revenues would have grown by approximately 9% ex exchange. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our Human Health revenues increased 6%. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA sales in the quarter grew 27% to $4 billion and for the year by 30% to $14 billion. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types. We continue to see strong growth outside of lung cancer, including in renal and endometrial carcinomas, and further uptake in our Q6 weekly dosing regimen. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications. Uptake from KEYNOTE-189 in newly imbursed markets for KEYNOTE-407 remain the key growth drivers in the EU. In Japan, price adjustments in the first half of the year more than offset underlying volume growth. Lynparza and Lenvima continue to demonstrate strong growth and are meaningful contributors to our broader oncology portfolio, growing 53% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year. Our vaccines portfolio continues to be impacted by below normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States. GARDASIL sales grew year-over-year, mostly reflecting the impact from the $120 million CDC stockpile replenishment in the quarter and the initial $120 million borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2019, which had a combined positive impact of $240 million year-over-year. Our hospital performance showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter. BRIDION sales grew 13% year-over-year, driven by continued market share gains, offset in part by lower elective surgery procedures. Our Animal Health business again delivered a strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and 6% growth. Companion Animal grew 9%, reflecting demand for companion animal vaccines and parasiticides. Livestock grew 4%, primarily reflecting an extra month of sales from the acquisition of Antelliq, partially offset by distributor purchasing patterns. Turning to the rest of our P&L. My comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 73% in the quarter, an increase of 0.4 percentage points, driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher inventory write-offs due to a recall of ZERBAXA, pricing pressure and foreign exchange. Operating expenses grew 4% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. COVID had a largely neutral impact as operating savings were offset by incremental spend to advance our COVID-19 research programs. Operating expenses in the quarter reflect overall growth in R&D spending, as well as a donation to the Merck Foundation. Other income increased year-over-year driven by income from equity securities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from a year ago due to favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.32 per share, an increase of 17%. Now, before detailing our 2021 outlook, I want to highlight that our press release details reporting changes we will be implementing beginning in the first quarter that are reflected in our guidance ranges. These changes result in a better alignment between our non-GAAP results and the underlying operational performance of our company and improved unpredictable quarter-to-quarter volatility. While these changes will have an impact on our non-GAAP results going forward, there is no impact to cash flow. Turning to 2021 guidance. For Merck, we expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020, and excludes any potential revenue from our COVID therapeutics. This range assumes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 2 percentage points using mid-January rates. We assume full year pandemic impacts to be approximately 2% or roughly $1 billion, largely in the first half of the year. Our gross margin will be roughly 77% including a benefit of 1.8 percentage points due to the reporting change. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to mid-single-digits. We expect other expense of $400 million in our other income and expense line, driven largely by net interest expense. Under our prior reporting, we would have guided to an expected $400 million of income, resulting in an $800 million unfavorable swing. This difference is driven by an expected gain on the amount sale of Preventice, mark-to-market gains on our fund holdings, which include our indirect investment in Moderna, and other expected investment gains that will now be excluded from non-GAAP. We expect our full year tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. And we anticipate 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, which reflects growth of 12% to 15% versus 2020 recast EPS. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 3 percentage points. Our EPS growth under the new reporting convention benefits from the removal of the disproportionate mark-to-market equity gains we recorded in 2020. Importantly, however, under either reporting method, we expect strong operating margin leverage of 1 percentage point or more in 2021. The benefit to our 2021 EPS guidance is only $0.08 under new reporting versus previous reporting. We will continue to monitor the ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellness visits and delayed procedures as we move into and through 2021. We remain confident in our ability to grow both in the near and long-term, driven by our portfolio of derisked and innovative assets. Now turning to Organon. We are on track to complete the spin-off of Organon, which we expect will take place in the second quarter -- I should say, late in the second quarter. The strategic merits of this transaction are even more clear as we sit here today. In 2020, we brought the products we will spin-off as part of Organon, achieved revenues of $6.5 billion. The high level metrics for Organon that we provided a year ago remain largely unchanged. We expect Organon to achieve 2021 revenues of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Off of this base and as the negative impact of the loss of exclusivity on key brands diminishes, we expect Organon to achieve longer-term revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits. As a standalone company post spin, we continue to expect Organon's operating margins to be in the mid-30% range and to increase over time. This compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45% within Merck, with the difference reflecting additional costs Organon will incur to operate as an independent company. EBITDA margins are now expected to be in the high 30% range initially and are expected to grow over time. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance due to a lower proportion of capital assets transferred to Organon versus our initial expectations. We expect Organon to have initial debt of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. Merck expects to receive a special tax-free dividend of $8.5 billion to $9 billion prior to the spin. We continue to expect Organon to pay a meaningful dividend that will be entirely incremental to that of Merck. For Merck, spin-off of Organon is expected to enable incremental operating efficiencies of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including approximately $500 million in 2021, which is included in our guidance. We now expect to deliver operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, an increase of 2 percentage points versus our prior expectation of greater than 40% as a result of the impact of the reporting change. For modeling purposes, please be aware that Merck will continue to incur overhead costs previously allocated to the Organon products, which we estimate to be approximately $400 million on a full year basis. These stranded costs will be reduced over time and are netted into the overall efficiency target. To conclude, the strength and resilience of our business in 2021 -- in 2020 reinforces our confidence as we begin the New Year. Demand for our key growth drivers remains intact, and we are confident that we will deliver strong growth in 2021 and long into the future. We will continue to use our strong financial position to invest meaningfully in our pipeline, capitalizing both internal and external opportunities, and to make the right strategic decisions like the spin-off of Organon to position our company for continued success.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Rob. As I've underscored many times, innovative research is the cornerstone of Merck. This is why we planned carefully for Dr. Roger Perlmutter's retirement and the transition of leadership of the Merck Research Laboratories to Dr. Dean Li, who I'm pleased to welcome to today's call. Dean is a physician scientist who has a keen understanding of Merck's mission, dedication to science and our early and late-stage assets. He has hands-on experience leading key areas of research, including early discovery in translational medicine, while under Roger's leadership at Merck, as well as in his prior role where he exploited new technologies to found company and was a leader in an academic healthcare delivery system. We believe he is uniquely positioned to take on this important role and advance Merck's promising pipeline. I'm confident that under Dean's leadership, Merck's legacy of innovative R&D will continue and we will persist in successfully bringing forward breakthrough medicines and vaccines that make a real difference for patients and shareholders alike. Dean? Dean Li : Thank you, Ken. I'm delighted to be here for my first earnings call as Head of Merck Research Laboratories. And so for my remarks today, I will provide an update on our COVID research effort, cover key regulatory milestones, clinical updates and recent business developments, first in our oncology pipeline and then the broader pipeline. Regarding our COVID-19 research programs, Merck has made the decision to discontinue development of its vaccine candidate, V590 and V591. This decision was based on clinical finding from Phase 1 study showing that, while the vaccines were well tolerated, immune responses were inferior to those observed with natural infection and those reported for other authorized COVID vaccines. We are grateful to our collaborators and the volunteers who participated in this trial. Our COVID-19 efforts now shift, advancing our two therapeutic candidates, molnupiravir, often known as MK-4482 and MK-7110. Our orally available antiviral candidate molnupiravir, which we are developing in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, continues to progress in our Phase 2/3 trials studying hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. The primary completion date is in May 2021, but it is possible that we may have interim efficacy data in the first quarter which, of course, we would share publicly, if meaningful. Molnupiravir has the potential to play an important role in the current pandemic as well as other emerging novel coronavirus infections. We have been scaling production capacity and expect to have over 10 million courses of therapy available by the end of 2021. We recently added the second candidate to address COVID-19 through the acquisition of OncoImmune. This agent, MK-7110 is a recombinant fusion protein administered by IV infusion that targets the novel immune checkpoint. Final results are expected in our -- in the clinical trial in the first quarter. Turning to oncology. In the fourth quarter, KEYTRUDA received an additional new approval in the U.S. in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 at a combined proportion score of 10 or greater. The approval was based on progression-free survival results from KEYNOTE-355, and this marks the 17th tumor type for which KEYTRUDA has been approved. Also in the last quarter, the FDA accepted a supplemental New Drug Application with Priority Review for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. These results demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. The FDA target action date is April 13. Working with our partners at Eisai, we are pleased to note positive results from the KEYNOTE-581 trial for KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima versus sunitinib for first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and these data will be presented at ASCO GU next week. We also announced that KEYNOTE-775 evaluating KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima for treatment of second-line endometrial carcinoma was stopped early. The independent data monitoring committee reported that KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima demonstrated a significant improvement across all endpoints versus chemotherapy. The success of KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775 reinforces the opportunity presented by the combination of KEYTRUDA in the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima. We continue to explore this combination in 19 studies spanning multiple tumor types. Now looking ahead, we look forward to meeting with the FDA's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee to discuss data from the third interim analysis from KEYNOTE-522, evaluating neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer as compared with an alternative regimen. The BLA that includes data from this study is currently under FDA review with a PDUFA date next month. Business development remains a priority. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of VelosBio, whose lead candidate, VLS-101, known as MK-2140, is a ROR1 targeted antibody drug conjugate currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study of patients with solid tumor and in Phase 1 for patients with hematologic malignancies. This opportunity, along with the LIV-1 antibody-drug conjugate that we are developing in partnership with Seagen underscores our commitment to investigating tumor-targeted chemotherapy using next-generation antibody drug conjugate. Now as part of our strategy to explore new tumor targeting technology, we recently entered collaborations with A2 Biotherapeutics and Artiva Biotherapeutics aimed at evaluating opportunities for K and NK cell therapy and a third collaboration with Janux Therapeutics on their T-cell engager technology. These collaborations, along with work already underway with Dragonfly Therapeutics to design targeted NK cell engagers, support our commitment to tumor targeting technologies. Now turning to our broader pipeline. We continue to progress our suite of pneumococcal vaccine candidates, V114, V116 and V117. Each one is designed for targeted production against prevalent pneumococcal disease serotypes across different age groups. For V114, our 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine candidate was recently granted Priority Review by the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. The target action date is July 18. Adults administered V114 produced comparable levels of antibodies for all serotypes in the currently available conjugate vaccines with higher responses observed for serotype 3, one of the most common causes of invasive pneumococcal diseases in adults and in children. Robust response to unique disease-causing serotypes, 22F and 33F, were also observed. Now in the U.S., serotypes 22F and 33F have been linked, the 13% of invasive pneumococcal disease seen among adults aged 65 and older; and in Europe, 7% to 12% of adult cases. Our V114 Phase 3 pediatric studies are on track, and we anticipate results from these trials this year. In addition to V114, we are progressing our adult and pediatric next-gen vaccines, V116 and V117. The infectious disease space islatravir, our novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor for HIV continues to progress in both the treatment and in the PrEP setting. In the PrEP setting, we expect to begin recruitment soon for 2 new Phase 3 trials, IMPOWER 22 and IMPOWER 24 in different populations at high-risk of acquiring HIV infection. Now IMPOWER 22 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of islatravir as a once-monthly oral capsule in adult women and adolescent girls. IMPOWER 24 will evaluate the same regimen in men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men. Also, in the PrEP setting, positive interim results from the Phase 2 trial evaluating islatravir as a once-monthly oral PrEP regimen were recently presented at HIV Research for Prevention 2021. These interim results show that islatravir achieved the efficacy pharmakinetic threshold at each of the 2 doses study, 60 milligrams and 120 milligrams, and that these doses are well tolerated. These findings offer further evidence for the potential of islatravir to provide a monthly oral PrEP option for people at risk of acquiring HIV. Now in addition, as we announced previously, we are advancing MK-8507, our non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in combination with islatravir into a Phase 2 study as a potential once-weekly oral treatment option. This weekly islatravir MK-8507 combination builds on the once-daily islatravir plus doravirine combination currently in Phase 3, a Phase 3 study, which we expect to start to read out in the second half of 2021. Finally, we received FDA approval for Verquvo following Priority Review. This new option for patients who\u2019ve experienced worsening heart failure built on our commitment to develop therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease. We at Merck Research Laboratories are well positioned to continue to take full advantage of our [considerable] strength in oncology and vaccine while investing in other therapeutic areas, exploring new modalities and complementing and supplementing our internal pipeline with external opportunities. I will now turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. We recognize there could be additional questions today, and we're prepared to extend the call past 9 AM. But in order to get to as many analysts as possible, I ask that you please limit yourselves to one question. Lara, could you start the queue, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] So your first question will come from the line of Mr. Seamus Fernandez. Seamus Fernandez : So Rob, congratulations on the CEO appointment. Just wanted to get a sense of your thoughts in terms of Merck moving forward. You've talked about the underappreciation of the upside that you see for the company in 2023 plus relative to consensus expectations, but the obvious question that is going to continue is, how are you thinking about the evolution of the company in sort of 2026 to 2030 as KEYTRUDA basically approaches its patent expiration. What do you think the company really needs to do in that regard? And then just as a follow-up to that, just from a strategic perspective, can you just give us your thoughts around the Animal Health business as part of Merck? Could that be part of a future restructuring? Rob Davis : Thanks, Seamus, for the question. As we look forward, from a strategic perspective, obviously, there'll be a lot more time as we move into the months and quarters to come to continue to have the dialogue. But I think at the highest level, the important point is that the strategy we've been under, which is focused on scientific innovation as the core of who we are, driven first by really the revitalization of what we're doing in the drug discovery and from a clinical development perspective, which I think you're seeing the fruits of, and obviously, what we're achieving with KEYTRUDA and with what we see as a growing earlier stage pipeline, which we're excited about. So, as we look at 2025 and beyond, and into the 2030 timeframe, it really is to continue to focus first and foremost on investing behind the best science, whether it comes from inside the company or outside the company, execute on the pipeline we have. We have a lot of great -- near-term, late-stage launches coming. We've got islatravir, we've got our V114, the entire pneumococcal franchise that we're building. We have obviously a whole host of opportunities in oncology which I'm sure Dean and others would be happy to comment on. Looking at both what we can do to extend the breadth of KEYTRUDA's reach to the number of patients it serves as well as its efficacy through combinations as well as broadening into other oncology fields and broader mechanisms, which we have. So, that all will be continued to be where we will focus our efforts. As we look at that, we realize, though, we will need to continue to do business development to augment that, and we are committed to that. We've been pretty consistent in talking about the urgency we have around business development. That hasn't changed. That won't change. But what also won't change is we will do it when we see an alignment of strategy and value that is tied with our scientific endeavor and that -- so that is really the way we look. But as we started to highlight even at the JPMorgan Conference, I think people underappreciate what we have as growth opportunities as we start to move into that 2028 and beyond time frame. Clearly, we have a real opportunity to continue to grow between now and then with KEYTRUDA, but I think actually we will have an opportunity to grow beyond them through all of the things I mentioned. So more of the same from that regard.  And then with regard to Animal Health, we continue to see Animal Health as a strategic part of this business. If you look at the growth that business delivers, it's best-in-class within the animal health space. It's accretive to the overall position for Merck and we are investing in it, and I think it is positioned to continue to show very strong growth, both through the existing products it has, but also through a very good portfolio of pipeline products which is leveraging the synergies we have with the MRL function we have on the Human Health side. So, as we sit here looking forward, I continue to see Animal Health as a core part of our strategy. And as we've said, we always are looking at our portfolio, but everything I see tells me that this is something we will maintain and grow because we are the most advantaged owner, in my mind. Peter Dannenbaum : Next question please, Lara. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : A question on islatravir please. Roger was quite determined that cabotegravir was not the right dancing partner for fixed-dose combination in the treatment setting. But aside from the capsid inhibitor, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of other options. With a fresh pair of eyes under Dean's leadership, should we assume that the status quo remains intact or whether another look at cabotegravir as a combination may be interesting? And then secondly, perhaps you could comment on whether, in the PrEP setting, you can bridge -- you can bridge islatravir to explore different delivery formulations, including very long-acting without running separate trials? Dean Li : Yes. So, thank you for that question. I'll just make some comments that will sort of frame how one might want to think about islatravir. And one way to think about it is, is with the lens that we believe that this can be a foundational medicine, both in PrEP and in treatment. And the favorable attribute to recognize is PK dosing schedule, route of administration, resistant profile, tissue levels, and combinability. And so, the question in relationship to treatment is, I've laid out what we're doing once daily, once weekly, but if this molecule is as foundational as we believe it is, this is something that could combine with many different mechanisms and many different molecules. I can just tell you that integrase inhibitors, which is cabotegravir, that's an important class. It's an important class that's actually very dear to Merck, and so that needs to be looked at carefully. And then lenacapavir, which you allude to, that's a new mechanism, and we believe that islatravir as a foundational medicine should -- we should look at the full array of combinations that can be achieved because we believe it's foundational, and we believe that, that foundation can provide a lot of benefit for many different patients, and we should look at all combinations possible that would allow us to prove that and to show that. Peter Dannenbaum : Next question please Lara. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Terence Flynn. Terence Flynn : Congrats again, Ken, on a remarkable career and best wishes in the future. And congratulations, Rob, as well on the new role and responsibilities and best of luck. I just -- maybe a 2-part question. Rob, I was just wondering if you can provide your perspective on the share repurchase outlook for 2021. Obviously, you have the $8 billion to $9 billion dividend coming in from Organon. Maybe how aggressive are you going to be on that front? And then just a question for Dean on MK-4482, building on Ken's comment regarding an important contribution from this drug in the COVID paradigm, I was wondering if you guys already have some of that initial Phase 2 data in-house? Rob Davis : Maybe I'll go first and then turn it over to Dean. Thanks for the question, Terence, and thank you for the congratulatory comments. As you look at share repurchase, as we've been saying, we continue to prioritize business development as where we want to go. Obviously, first and foremost, it's about funding our internal R&D efforts and funding the capacity expansion efforts we have underway from a capital perspective. But really beyond that, as we've talked, we would like to see business development. And so we have been holding back on share repurchase for that purpose. But what we've also been clear to say is that we're not looking to just grow cash to grow cash, and we're not looking to drive up our credit rating. So over time, if we don't find those opportunities to utilize the cash for business development, eventually, we will return it to shareholders. And that's on an ongoing basis. And then you asked explicitly about the $8 billion to $9 billion -- the potential dividend we're getting coming from -- the dividend from the Organon spin. With that similar answer, our goal would, first and foremost, be business development. But we also will look if we don't have those opportunities to return that to shareholders, and we'll be able to make those determinations as we get closer to late second quarter and into the second half of 2021. Dean Li : Yes. In terms of the 4482 question, it's a Phase 2/3 trial. It has different interim analysis. The critical component of the Phase 2 different interim analysis is to sort of establish dose. And at this point, we have not fully taken a look at all of the data that is available to us in relationship to that Phase 2. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you Terence. Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Thanks for the questions and congrats as well to both Ken and Rob. I just had a 2-part question on capital deployment in Biz Dev. It's obviously been a big focus and remains a big focus of the organization. Should we think about any pauses or slowdown in activities, specifically as you think about larger transactions given the leadership transitions that are occurring in the organization? And then on BD, I guess all else equal, would your bias be towards a series of smaller transactions versus a larger one that brings multiple assets. So we think about issues of ease of execution, integration, et cetera. I know you're probably looking at everything, but if you had a choice, which direction would the organization lean? Dean Li : So let me just start by saying that the purpose behind this CEO transition is not to slow Merck down in any respect. The senior team and Rob have the responsibility and the autonomy going forward to evaluate the situation of the company faces and to make the right decisions to position this company for long-term growth. So I wouldn't read into the transition that there would be any hesitation at all about taking steps that we believe are the right steps for this company's long-term success. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Davis : Yes. Appreciate that. And Chris, to your question about our preferred composition of the business development, we continue to prefer to look for smaller opportunities where we can find great science earlier in its life and bring it into Merck Research Labs and then capitalize on that, and we believe bring competitive advantage and differentiation to those assets. So that focal point continues to be where we will look. As we've said many times in the past, it is -- we are agnostic to therapeutic area. We will be driven by science. Science will take us to the areas to look. But likewise, we've been clear to say we're not foreclosed to larger scale deals, always looking at the size, more in terms of its disruption and complexity than in dollar terms. We obviously recognize the need to continue to augment the pipeline, to augment our revenue potential. So we're looking at those as well. But one thing that remains completely consistent as we do not prefer and do not see a transformative deal driven mainly by synergies as a way forward, it will continue to be science led, science-based and driven by where we see an opportunity to bring differential value. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you Chris. Next question please Lara. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ms. Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : So Rob, what about your experience and skill set make you the right fit for where Merck is in its journey right now? And then, Dean, when you look into your pipeline currently, is anything there that you think could take the place of KEYTRUDA? Rob Davis : Yes. Great. Louise, thanks for the question. If you look back at my career and what I've done, I've spent my whole career dedicated to healthcare and to the pharmaceutical industry. And the time I began at Eli Lilly, where I spent nearly 15 years before moving on to Baxter and saw a different view of the business, running the diversified medtech side of that company before coming to Merck. So I have a broad base of experience in the industry and a lens that has really seen it from different views. And I think that is always important to challenge our internal thinking, to make sure we have an external focus and that we are looking externally. But as we look forward, while scientific innovation will continue to be the core of who we are, and I believe, is our best path to succeed in a world where you're going to face increasing margin pressure, we also have to marry with that side-by-side a continuing focus on how do we evolve the business to make it more nimble, to make it simplified and really more focused such that we can drive ever greater efficiency and productivity, not in terms of reducing spend, rather the opposite. We're going to invest in this business to grow, but we have to find a way to make every dollar we invest more productive so that we get a greater than the dollar of output, and that is really where our focus is going to be on how do we leverage new technologies, new capabilities to do that. And then how do we think about broadening our view long-term as you think about not only the drug, but we have to focus increasingly on the outcomes from our medicine, the value we demonstrate and how we ensure affordable access. So those are the cores of what we're looking at. And my experience broadly in the industry and being a part of the leadership team here at Merck has positioned me to, I believe, to do that. Dean Li : Let me grab the other part of that question. And if you don't mind, I would just sort of make 4 points. The first is immuno-oncology has essentially revolutionized all of cancer biology and medicine. And a quick way to point that out is, if one reads the book Emperor of All Maladies, one looks at it and say, this is outdated because the whole impact of immuno-oncology is not there. And the driver for this revolution has been pembrolizumab. And just so that we're very clear, we continue to want to expand indications by tumor type and by stage of cancer. We want to deepen responses with combinations that span agents with immunomodulatory mechanisms, which the internal pipeline is focused on and agents with direct tumor-killing mechanisms that we have largely done through BD. And we want to extend the value and access of pembrolizumab to patients through route of administration, dosing regimens, combinations, co-formulations and biomarkers. So that's IO, pembro and cancer. So the question that you ask is, do I have anything in my pipeline that has reshaped a whole field right now that I can see? I do not have one in our pipeline. And this is an important point that we should mention. We should remember that we were not in cancer, and IO allowed us the chance to make a huge impact on cancer, transformative cancer -- transformative impact. And one of the reasons why Rob and Ken and Roger for that matter have always talked about therapeutic agnostic, it is because we do not know that we have the foresight to know where that next revolution and where that next transformation occurs. So could that be in my pipeline? Yes. Could it be in the pipeline of others? Yes. But do we have it right now defined, whether it be in neuro, whether it be in cardiovascular, whether it be metabolism? I would say that, in general, the whole field has not seen. The whole pharmaceutical field has not seen something equivalent to KEYTRUDA or pembro at this point in time throughout the industry. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Louise. Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much, and I wanted to add my congratulations to Ken and Rob as well. So my question is, could you discuss the opportunity for weekly combination HIV treatment including your internal assets for a combination regimen and how you are assessing and seeing the opportunity to move that forward versus pursue an external partnership opportunity to bring forward a weekly combination treatment regimen? Dean Li : Yes. I'll take a first shot at that. This is Dean. Fundamentally, we're doing it step wise, right? We're doing it in PrEP, and we're doing it in treatment. And we're trying to demonstrate to ourselves and to others that this is what we think it is, that this is a really important medicine. And so we're stepwise doing Q day, Q week. But I do agree with you. We have to think about what's really going to be important for patients and their access to the medicine. And so less frequent dosing will be important and that less frequent dosing will be important for both treatment and for PrEP. And both of them are places that Merck needs to explore fully to create that full suite of options as we build the story for islatravir. But Mike, did you want to make some comments? Mike Nally : Yes. Thank you for the question, Dave. I think a couple of things just to add to what Dean said. I think first and foremost, islatravir is the best partner across a whole range of different mechanisms of action. And we think it will add a lot of value. And we do think the market will ultimately evolve to a longer-acting format. We see up to a majority of the HIV market ultimately being in a long-acting format. And so weekly would be the starting place, and then we look even further out in the treatment space. In the PrEP space, I think what I would add is that we don't need necessarily a partner with islatravir in the PrEP space. And so we think there through both in an oral route of administration and other forms of administration, we can go to long-acting format, potentially even longer than a week initially in the PrEP space. And so that's how we're looking at the market. Peter Dannenbaum : Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ms. Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink. Daina Graybosch : Thank you for the question and congratulations from me all around. I wonder talking about BD in oncology and KEYTRUDA. We've had a couple of negative trial readouts to competitors on TGF-beta and oncolytic virus approaches. I wonder if you could update us on your current perspective on the path forward for some of the early IO assets Merck has acquired in recent years, including Tilos, Viralytics and Immune Design? Dean Li : Yes. Let me take a stab at that. So I sort of separated how one might think about the IO space and related to pembrolizumab and especially related to solid tumors. And so when you look at our internal pipeline, we speak about having over 25 mechanisms in the clinic. And you're aware of 3 immune modulatory mechanisms are advancing into Phase 3 and they have the opportunity to be co-formulated, TIGIT, LAG-3, our CTLA-4, we also showed ILT4. The other sort of thing that I would also emphasize is that the word is sometimes overused, but it's caught orthogonal. But I simply say that KEYTRUDA, when mixed with tumor-killing mechanisms or standard-of-care mechanism like chemo, surgery and potentially radiation, there seems to be enhancement. And because of that, that creates a possibility for us from a business development standpoint. And that business development you saw with Eisai and AZ, but we are excited with Seagen with the LIV-1 ADC, the Velos with the ROR1 ADC because essentially, there -- we're confident that pembro plus chemo works really well, right? We're first-in-class, best-in-class and transformative-in-class in lung. And so Seagen, Velos, those are ADCs where you're essentially developing a chemotherapy that's a little bit more precise. But our interest is past that. I would call your attention to Peloton, which is essentially targeting an oncogenic nodal pathway, and we would hope that, that not only can we advance that Peloton with a potential 2021 filing, but we're also interested in looking at that HIF-2\u03b1 in relationship to pembrolizumab. But I also want to emphasize that that's focusing on KEYTRUDA as a foundational medicine that can combine with many internal and external assets. I would just end by simply saying, we are in a advantaged situation. And the advantage situation is that if you are developing a drug in cancer and you're a biotech company, you must ask what your molecule will do in relationship to IO. And if you're going to look for a partner, you're going to look for a partner who can give you that quickness, that speed and that rigor to advance that. And so when we say that we have 1,400 trials, including more than 950 combinations and more than 90 registrational trials, I would remind myself that, that most of those combinations are in combinations with other assets from other companies. So it allows us to do BD, not simply by looking at PowerPoint decks, but by actually getting our hands wet with the agents of other companies. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Daina. Next question please, Lara. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : My congratulations to Rob as well. I wanted to focus on the COVID and MRL. And my question is, is it fair to assume that the first upcoming trial is the hospitalized trial? And the time from symptoms to study enrollment is a little more loose in the hospitalized trial versus non-hospitalized. So should we assume that hospitalized setting is more difficult? And could you also update us on your progress for attempting to characterize in vitro activity against the new variants? Dean Li : Yes. So let me take both of those questions. The first thing is we're advancing it in both. And we think it's important to do it in both. And so there's no distinction between hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. We think we need to advance it for both because we believe that this will affect the viral application and viral load. In terms of the other question, let me just make sure, the other question was, the variants. We need to do those experiments, but the mechanism by which molnupiravir works would make it very -- we would predict that it would work for all the variants. I would remind everyone that molnupiravir doesn't just work for coronaviruses. It works for many RNA viruses and many respiratory RNA viruses. So the variant difference within a SARS-COV-2 is, there's variation, but that variation is much smaller than the variation that you see with whole different classes of RNA viruses. But to answer your question specifically, we need to test that to prove that, but every expectation is that the variants would be taken care of by molnupiravir based on mechanism of action. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you Umer. Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : And let me add my congratulations to Rob, and thanks to Ken for your many contributions. Ken, I think 2 of your more significant contributions to Merck were guiding it through the Vioxx litigation and buying Schering-Plough. The industry once again finds itself dealing with CV risk of oral arthritis drugs and you don't prefer big deals. On the former, what observations would you make on Vioxx 15 years later, particularly since I believe it's back on the market? And why do you not prefer big deals when it was perhaps your biggest contribution? Ken Frazier : So thank you for giving me the opportunity for retrospective here. Let me start by saying, I think if there's one lesson that I learned from Vioxx, it is that for a company like Merck, you have to stand strong on your heritage. And people see this as a litigation defense. But I think for every one of us inside the company, it was really about articulating to an audience, particularly in that case, jurors, what this company really stood for. And I thought we won repeatedly because we were able to remind people of the importance of what we do for the world and the integrity by which we do it. I won't go into any more details about the decision to withdraw the drug, but it was also based largely on this company's sense of what was in the best interest for patients based on what we knew at that time. On the issue around Schering-Plough, this company was in a very different situation at that time relative to its pipeline, relative to its growth prospects. And that deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were. We saw that as an opportunity that was appropriate for Merck back in 2009. And the reality of the world is, none of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab. So I would like to take a bow, but that's a classic example of the narrative fallacy when people say, \"Well, look at a great deal you did.\" I think the one thing that we learned from that deal is that when we bought that company, we actually had our eye on Organon and the work that was being done in the basic research labs at Organon. And so we knew that we were buying a company that not only gave us an opportunity for cost synergies, but gave us an opportunity for growth based on the quality of the science. And so at the end of the day, the problem with large transactions, and I think if you look at the history of this industry, is that they are really difficult for our research organizations to respond to and recover from. And so that's the main reason I opposed for those mergers. It's because I think they're highly disruptive. And then at the end of the day, when you get through your cost synergies, you still either have a pipeline or you don't. And what we're focusing on right now is developing that pipeline. So thanks for the question. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Steve. I realize it's 9 o'clock. We're prepared to continue on with some additional questions. So next question, please? Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Navin Jacob from UBS. Navin Jacob : I'll add my congrats to the course as well to both Ken and Rob. Rob, if I may ask about Organon, please. In the past, Merck had suggested that there are some pipeline assets that could furnish the Organon spin-off. Wondering if there's any more color to add as to what those assets may be, just to help us with trying to model out what revenues could look like for the next few years? Rob Davis : Yes. Thanks for the question, Navin. So as you look at Organon and the assets that will make up that spin, the key growth drivers that sit within that business is, first and foremost, the women's health business, anchored by NEXPLANON, which we continue to believe is going to be a blockbuster drug. It has patent protection for several years. It is growing globally. And as you look at the need for contraception, it continues to fill in a very important niche. So that is a core area of growth. And then obviously, surrounding that is the broader women's health business, including our fertility drugs and other drugs. So that business is the core growth driver. And if you could dissect within Merck and look at that business, excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of some key franchises, that has been growing and will continue to grow. So really, what is accelerating the growth will be further focused on investment in that. And then you layer upon that the biosimilars business, which is really a burgeoning business, very small now, but will grow very fast and will contribute meaningfully to the growth. So between those 2 pieces of Organon, they will comprise, I think as we get out over the next 4 or 5 years, they're going to be 30%, 40-plus percent of the total revenue of the company. Why the business has been declining over the last couple of years is really twofold. One, it is mainly loss of exclusivity. Most recently, we're experiencing the loss of [NuvaRing]. Before that, we had Zetia/Vytorin. So we've been hit by those LOEs. As we look forward, they really don't have those. Those should start to sunset as we get through 2021. So it is really going to allow those businesses, which have been good businesses to start to shine, and then they will accelerate that growth through focus and investment and more of a core formulation strategy and a business development strategy to augment those assets long-term. So I do think they will continue to look at the assets and ask how can they extend them, how can they broaden them, but that's really the focal point. There are no real key R&D programs being transferred over. It's more of how they will focus on those strategies moving forward across those growth businesses with the LOEs out of the base. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Navin. Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Gregg Gilbert from Truist. Gregg Gilbert : Congrats, gentlemen. Maybe 2-parter for the newer guys in the newer roles. Dean, what are some modalities you'd like to enhance or add to MRL? And Rob, I realize this decision has been made on Animal Health, at least for now, your comments are obviously in line with what Ken has been saying for a few years. And I certainly get that Merck is investing in that business and then it's performing well. But how do you bridge the gap between how helpful it is to Merck versus how valuable it would be if it stood alone and traded at 35 times earnings or more? I realize that's one moment in time, but it's not like these peers or just all of a sudden trading at a high multiple and are likely to change? So again, understand why it's helpful to Merck, but how do you bridge the gap to why it's not better served and better valued elsewhere? Dean Li : I'll take that first question. I'll say 2 or 3 things. The first thing is, modalities are important. They're platform. It's critical that we focus on products. But if you don't have the right platforms, it makes it more difficult for you to move quickly. In terms of platforms that we are building currently, clearly, we're a company that's really well-known for our chemistry. And over the last few years, we've become increasingly a more biologics company with KEYTRUDA. And so our continued evolution to use that from antibodies to bispecific immune engagers to TriNKETs to protein engineering, those fields are going to be very important. And as we build biologics, it will also help us in relationship to the space between chemistry and biologics, especially with target therapy. So that's a very important play. What I would also say is that I kind of group them in the nucleic acids, whether you talk about mRNA or sRNA or gene delivery systems. Those -- that group, we have to take a look at. But one can't willy nilly decide \"I want this platform because I'm really interested in the platform, that it's neat and cool.\" One has to say, \"What am I going to do with that platform? What is the product? How am I going to drive it from discovery to development to registration?\" So we look at modalities and we look at what is moving throughout the whole landscape, but we don't get enamored specifically on a platform by itself. Peter Dannenbaum : Okay. Rob? Rob Davis : Okay, great. And to the question on Animal Health. So we obviously -- I would start by saying, we look at this objectively. So you should not assume that there is some form of philosophical opposition to thinking about Animal Health differently. It comes from an objective analysis of what we think creates the greatest long-term value for the Merck shareholder. And that's our focus, is long-term value creation. As I look at the Animal Health business and if you really decompose what's happened and why we feel like we're the rightful owner for this asset, you have to start to challenge where is the growth coming from in that business and what would happen outside of Merck. I would start with the fact that we do see meaningful synergies coming from the collaboration with Merck Research Labs. As I mentioned, a big portion of the growth we're going to see in Animal Health long-term is coming from new products. And those new products are, in many instances, coming on the companion animal space through products that they've discovered, working with MRL and looking at the Human Health catalog. And there are also new products coming in vaccines. And obviously, we are the leader in vaccines on the human health side. We're a leader in vaccines on the animal health side. So across the pillars of our excellence, there's a nice alignment from a synergy, and that is driving their growth. It's not by accident that they're one of the fastest-growing businesses in the animal health space. It's because of our ability to focus on innovation and leverage those synergies. And then beyond that, I think you have to look at each company and the facts and take them one at a time. So if just maybe one example, if you look back at when Pfizer spun out Zoetis, Zoetis was a low-margin business that had not been invested in. Pfizer effectively said as much. They made a decision because they weren't focused to spin it out. That allowed that company to bring focus and investment and margin expansion that has allowed that multiple to really take off. We already have, in our own, in Animal Health business, a high-margin business where we're focused and invested. So there's not a big margin lift opportunity and there's not frankly a big growth acceleration opportunity because I believe we fully invest to drive both the margin and the growth today. So I think as you think in that regard, also, you have to look at it. And then you have to ask what is the contribution to Merck? It's accretive to our growth, it's accretive to cash flow, it's an annuity-like business that allows diversification away from the Human Health business, which we know is important. And it's one where, as we look forward, we continue to believe long-term value will be created. So that's just a few of the points that I would make. And I would note, we did where we saw a different set of facts, as we did with the consumer, we will make the right decision. But we continue to believe keeping this business as part of Merck is the best long-term value creator for us and for our shareholders, and that's what drives our thinking. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you Gregg. We have time for one more question. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ms. Mara Goldstein from Mizuho. Mara Goldstein : So Rob, I just have a question for you, and that is with the benefit of having occupying the CFO seat, what are you looking for from that position once you have transitioned to your new role as CEO? And if I could also just ask, with the incremental bump in the operating margin guidance post spin out, does that change the upper end of the aspirational dividend payout ratio as well? Rob Davis : Yes. So on the first question, with regard to the next CFO of the company, what I would expect from that person and what I think is an important role that the CFO can play is to, obviously, first and foremost, you have to be a strong fiduciary for the company. You have to focus and make sure that the controls are in place, the compliance is met and that the company is meeting its reporting responsibility. That's kind of table stakes and expected. What differentiates a CFO, in my perspective, is the ability to partner with the business to find solutions on how to grow strategically. And as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we're going to be investing for growth. But we know that there's going to be pressure. There's -- on margins, the world is transforming around us. We're going to have to find ways to drive productivity to get every dollar we invest more from that dollar. And I think that's an important area where a CFO can help.  The one thing that being CFO allowed me to do, I sat at the crossroads between each of the divisions, and it allowed me to see the whole company and to start to look at Merck as an integrated whole and to start to look to how can we challenge and drive optimization at the scenes that sit between the divisions because, frankly, those are always where, if you will, the corporate tax is paid. And the more you can eliminate those inefficiencies, the more productive and efficient you can go, and I believe that's what a CFO should do. On your question around the margin expansion, it does not change our view of the dividend payout ratio. We're still shooting for that 47% to 50% range. And obviously, we're looking at that both now, but even more importantly as we think post spin. And then we'll continue to reassess that as we go. But right now, that is -- continues to be our long-term goal that we would shoot for. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Mara. Ken, do you have some closing remarks? Ken Frazier : Thanks, Peter. As you've heard, we are executing on our clinical and commercial priorities while making the necessary changes in our business model, and importantly, investing in opportunities for future growth for the short, intermediate and longer term. I'm confident that if we continue to follow this strategy and with new leadership, charged with taking a fresh look at how we operate our business and our strategic opportunity and charge also with taking the right actions for Merck going forward, that the company will be positioned to continue to deliver important value to patients and shareholders in the future. It's been a privilege working in this job for 10 years. I'm pleased to be handing it over to Rob and the senior team at this time. And I want to thank you for joining us and for your continuing interest and support. I hope you have a healthy and Happy New Year. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, all. Operator : Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, presenters. And again, thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",

Q1 sales and earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Lara, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our President; Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs; Frank Clyburn, President of Human Health; and Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation in our press release. I would also like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2020 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, today's earnings release and an investor presentation with highlights of our results are all posted on merck.com.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken Frazier : Thank you, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. 2021 marks Merck's 130th year, which provides an opportunity to reflect on our company's heritage of bringing forward transformative innovation that changed medical paradigms across many therapeutic areas. Today, we are well positioned to achieve sustained future success given our highly talented employees, our scientific expertise, our promising pipeline and our financial and operational strength. We also are taking the right steps to evolve Merck's operating model to best position the company for the future as the industry landscape continues to evolve.  The upcoming spin-off of Organon will further enhance our focus on innovation and on our key growth drivers, and this will enable necessary investments in cutting-edge science. Merck's leadership progressions have been thoughtfully planned and seamless succession is well underway. Each of our newly appointed leaders have a proven track record of success and embodies the mission of the company. I am confident that this team, led by Rob, is more than ready to take the helm and lead this company into the future.  Reflecting on the results of this quarter. While the pandemic continued to impact both patient access and health care provider capacity to treat, we delivered solid performance, especially considering the high proportion of physician-administered products in our portfolio, particularly on that theme. And speaking of the pandemic, Merck remains committed to the development of molnupiravir as an important potential treatment for COVID-19, and we are proud to partner with Johnson & Johnson on the production of their vaccine.  This will be my final earnings call as CEO before I retire from the role on June 30. I want you to know that I appreciate the helpful and constructive input you all have given me over the year. And I look forward to serving as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and acting in an advisory role and importantly, to watching Merck achieve even greater success.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob Davis. Robert Davis : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. This is Ken's 42nd and final earnings call as CEO. And on behalf of all of us here at Merck, we thank him for his profound contributions to this company, to the scientific community and to our customers and patients around the world. We wish him much success and happiness as he embarks on life after his distinguished career as the CEO of Merck, and we look forward to his continuing counsel as he serves as our Executive Chairman.  As I transition to the CEO role, one of my immediate priorities is to ensure that our experienced and empowered leadership team continues building on the strong foundation and positive momentum we have across the company. To that end, I'm very pleased to welcome Caroline Litchfield to the Executive Committee as our new Chief Financial Officer. Caroline most recently served as Merck's Treasurer and prior to this, was Head of Finance for our Human Health business. She's had a distinguished 30-year career at Merck, serving in finance roles across different regions and businesses and is exceptionally well positioned to lead our finance organization and provide strategic insight as a member of our senior leadership team.  I'm also very pleased by the expansion of Frank's role to the President of our Human Health business, including both our commercial and marketing operations. Frank's insight and leadership have been critical drivers of Merck's success over the past decade, particularly as we've built out our oncology business and achieved extraordinary commercial success. In addition, I've been working closely with Dean to ensure that the connection between the commercial and research operations remain strong. R&D is the lifeblood of Merck. And Dean and his team are fully committed to driving scientific innovation and in efficiently allocating resources to our most promising pipeline opportunities.  While our portfolio continues to feel the impacts of the pandemic, we are confident that underlying demand for our products remain strong, and we are optimistic that a more normal environment is beginning to emerge. We've executed important business development transactions this quarter and we made meaningful advancements in our pipeline. Frank, Caroline and Dean will speak to this in a moment, but I'll first give you an update on where I've been focusing during this transition period.  I've been spending a lot of time with the leadership team and many others across the company to ensure we have open lines of communication and a clear path towards continued success. I'm using my time as President to listen to employees throughout the organization to help me flesh out further my own perspectives on our go-forward strategy and to begin to shape our priorities to deliver it. In the meantime, I'm focused on ensuring that we continue to execute on the significant commercial and development opportunities we have in the short term to realize our meaningful growth potential while also taking the necessary steps to transform our operating model to best prepare us for the evolving health care landscape over the long term.  To that end, we will continue to focus on delivering our late-stage pipeline and advancing programs out of our robust and growing early-stage pipeline. And we will continue to augment our efforts through internal business development focused on meaningful asset additions. The acquisitions of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset and the HIV collaboration with Gilead Sciences are great examples of transactions completed this quarter that each has significant value creation potential. Finally, we will continue to take the necessary steps to help shape Merck into a leaner, more focused and agile company such as the upcoming spin-off we're working on. We look forward to hosting an Investor Day on Monday, during which the full Organon leadership team will highlight its strategy and opportunities for growth. We expect to complete the spin-off on June 2, with trading on the new stock commencing on June 3.  In closing, we remain confident that our business is well positioned for strong long-term growth. Our mission will continue to be the fuel that drives our company forward and gives us purpose. Namely, we will continue to be focused on scientific innovation aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs that improve the lives of the patients we serve. I firmly believe that by keeping patients at the center of everything we do, we create the most value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call to Frank. Franklin Clyburn : Thanks, Rob. Good morning. I'm excited to expand my role as President of Human Health and to build on the commercial success we are driving. We are very confident in the underlying demand for our key products and we continue to anticipate strong growth for our business for the full year.  That said, the underlying strength in our Human Health business was impacted this quarter due to the increase in cases and additional lockdowns across the globe. These headwinds were, in part, the continuation of reduced patient access to physician offices and lower-than-normal wellness visits and were more pronounced early in the quarter given the wave of infections that occurred. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines and recommendations against co-administration have also impacted parts of our vaccine business. As a reminder, roughly 70% of our pharmaceutical revenue is comprised of physician-administered products.  It is important to keep in mind as well that our year-over-year growth was impacted by the particularly strong first quarter we had in 2020, along with quarter-to-quarter variability in sales of GARDASIL. As a result of these factors, our sales were roughly flat compared to last year, or negative 3%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. I'll walk you through some of our expectations for future trends in just a moment, but first, I'll turn to the first quarter performance of our key brands. My comments will be on an ex exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 16% to $3.9 billion, reflecting continued strong demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, including capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma or MSI high indication, triple-negative breast cancer as well as the Q 6-week dosing regimen. Outside the United States, growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and our ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma.  Lynparza grew 51% in the quarter, benefiting from ongoing launches and broader reimbursement that continue to solidify its position as the leading PARP inhibitor. Lenvima was essentially flat, reflecting competitive entrants in hepatocellular carcinoma and a onetime accrual related to the recent NRDL listing for hepatocellular carcinoma in China. Our vaccine portfolio was impacted by lower-than-normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States, along with headwinds related to the rollout of COVID vaccines in adults. GARDASIL sales were negatively impacted by the timing of shipments to China last year and the timing of U.S. public sector purchases in both periods as well as pandemic impacts in the United States and in Europe. PNEUMOVAX sales declined due to a challenging year-over-year comparison given strong demand for pneumococcal vaccination at the start of the pandemic last year and the impact of CDC COVID vaccine coadministration guidelines partially offset by higher ex U.S. sales. Our hospital business continued its recovery from pandemic impacts. BRIDION sales grew 11% year-over-year driven by broader usage along with updated operating room protocols that allow for more normal levels of elective procedures. We remain confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio given the meaningful values of our products to patients. With the strong rollout of the COVID vaccines, we expect that patients will be more comfortable to seek care in a timely manner. In fact, we are encouraged by the recovery trends we saw as we exited the first quarter, with March wellness visits in the United States tracking above prepandemic levels. In oncology, since the start of the pandemic, there has been an unfortunate reduction in the level of cancer screenings, which has resulted in fewer patient diagnoses and reduced new patient starts for many oncology agents, particularly in areas like lung cancer. With the rollout of the COVID vaccines, especially among the elderly where cancer incidence is highest, along with increased awareness campaigns, we believe screenings and diagnosis will soon return to normal levels. We expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, given its leadership position across many current indications.  In addition, we're excited by the recent launch in esophageal cancer and by potential additional indications in renal cell carcinoma, including in combination with Lenvima and as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. In vaccines, the recent improvement in wellness visits is encouraging as our awareness campaigns would help raise the potential for catch-up vaccinations across the portfolio as patient access improves. We expect COVID vaccines to be available in the adolescent population in the future.  And we will monitor the impact on GARDASIL, especially in the back-to-school season. That said, in the United States, in order to enable safe return to in-person learning in the fall, there is heavy attention being put on accelerating adolescents' physician visits to catch up on missed routine vaccinations and to schedule new vaccinations around the COVID vaccine rollout to this cohort. We will also monitor many ex U.S. markets where the rate of COVID vaccination has been slower than in the United States and where there have been renewed lockdowns that are expected to impact physician well visits and school-based vaccination programs. Overall, however, we believe there is strong global demand for GARDASIL, particularly in ex U.S. markets like China. We have seen improvements in our capacity to manufacture this year, which will also benefit our sales. Given this, we expect strong global growth for GARDASIL this year.  To conclude, we are confident in the strength and resilience of our portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines. We expect to return to more normal operations later this year and strong full year growth. There is underlying patient demand for our products, and we believe that once we move through the temporary market dynamics created by the pandemic, our business will resume to a strong growth trajectory long into the future.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Frank. Good morning, everyone. I am extremely honored to be Merck's new Chief Financial Officer and work more closely with the team of extraordinary leaders who share my deep passion for Merck's mission. I am excited by the opportunity to lead the finance organization and to help ensure that Merck remains well positioned to make the investments in science and innovation necessary to sustain our unique legacy of making a difference in the world and in creating value for patients and shareholders.  Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.1 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year on a nominal basis or down 1% excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. These results were broadly in line with our initial expectations. Frank describes the underlying strength in the human health business as well as the ways in which the pandemic affected the quarter, and we estimate the impact was approximately $600 million.  Animal Health delivered a particularly strong quarter, growing 15% year-over-year driven by demand across both companion animal and livestock, which grew 24% and 9%, respectively. In companion animal, growth was driven by higher global demand for our parasiticides, primarily the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as strength in vaccine. Performance in livestock reflects increased demand in international markets across ruminants, poultry and swine as well as strong growth of our Intelligence products.  I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.8%, driven largely by higher costs associated with COVID programs. Operating expenses increased to 10% year-over-year to $4.9 billion driven largely by higher clinical development costs, including our COVID-19 program, increased investment in our early-stage pipeline and higher provision costs in support of key growth drivers. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%, a decrease of 2.8% from a year ago driven by favorable earnings mix and discrete items. Together, we earned $1.40 per share, a decrease of 7%.  Turning to our updated 2021 guidance for Merck, including Organon. First quarter revenues were broadly in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, representing growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020. The underlying strength of our growth pillars provides us with confidence that we will see strong acceleration in revenues throughout the remainder of the year despite a slightly less favorable impact from foreign exchange and a higher projected impact from the pandemic.  Our revenue guidance does not include revenue from the potential launch of molnupiravir. Our gross margin is now expected to be roughly 76%, slightly less than prior guidance as a result of the impact of COVID. We now expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, a lower growth rate compared to our prior guidance largely driven by diligent management of SG&A expenses. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to a mid-single-digit rate. Our guidance for other income and expense, tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from last quarter. Taken together, we continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, reflecting growth of 12% to 15%. This range includes the positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 3%.  With respect to Organon, on a pro-forma basis, assuming it's operated as an independent company for the full year, Organon is now expected to achieve revenues of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. Assuming completion of the spinoff, Merck anticipates full year revenues from continuing operations to be $45.8 billion to $47.8 billion. We continue to expect operating efficiencies enabled by the spin of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including $500 million in 2021.  Due to the high profitability of the Organon products versus overall Merck, we expect Merck's operating margin from continuing operations to be slightly lower in 2021 versus what it would have been without the spin-off but to accelerate and be higher within 12 to 24 months versus where they would have been in the absence of the spin-off and to be greater than 42% in 2024. We remain confident the transaction will benefit the patients that both Merck and Organon serve and create value for shareholders.  Merck expects its revenue and earnings growth rate to be higher after the spin-off. Given the faster growth of Merck and the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, combined with the faster growth we expect the Organon products to achieve in an independent structure, we expect combined EPS of the 2 companies to be higher within 12 to 24 months versus what would have been achieved without the spin.  Upon the close of the Organon spin-off, we expect to receive a special tax-free dividend of $9 billion, which we hope to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunity. In the absence of meaningful business development, we intend to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. As always, we remain committed to ensuring appropriate investment in our business, both in support of our key brands but also to drive forward the innovation progressing in our pipeline. And we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time. In summary, I am excited to embark upon my journey as CFO and to be stepping in at a time in which our company is in such a strong financial position. We remain confident in the outlook of our business. And I look forward to doing my part to ensure Merck remains well positioned financially to drive sustainable value to patients and shareholders.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. For my remarks today, I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates initially in oncology and then in our broader pipeline. And finally, I will discuss recent business development activities.  In the first quarter, the FDA accepted and granted priority review for a new drug application for belzutifan, our investigational HIF-2 alpha inhibitor that we acquired from Peloton for the treatment of certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma with a September PDUFA date. We are evaluating this asset further in 3 ongoing Phase III studies in RCC. We initiated a Phase III study evaluating vibostolimab, our investigation on anti-TIGIT antibody in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor has expressed PD-L1. This is one of several co-formulated assets we are on track to advance this year from our oncology portfolio that builds on the success of KEYTRUDA.  Turning to FDA approvals. KEYTRUDA was indicated in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. This marks the 11th approved indication based on a clinical study that demonstrated overall survival. Now outside the United States, the European Commission approved new indications for KEYTRUDA for adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma based on the results from KEYNOTE-204 and for patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient previously untreated colorectal cancer based on KEYNOTE-177. Now earlier this month, we announced that following an interim analysis, KEYNOTE-564, our Phase III study evaluating KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant monotherapy treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma met its primary endpoint of disease-free survival. These data will be shared with regulatory authorities and presented at ASCO. This provides another proof point for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy, where we expect additional readouts in several other tumor types this year and it also supports our broad development program in patients with renal cell carcinoma.  We recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP for Q 6-week dosing across KEYTRUDA combination regimens for patients in the EU, which builds upon the 6-week dosing schedule already approved in monotherapy indications. And at the AACR Annual Meeting, initial results from KEYNOTE-555, evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of KEYTRUDA in patients with metastatic melanoma, were presented. We are continuing to study this new formulation and other innovative modes of administration and dosing aimed at providing increased benefit and access for patients.  Along with our partners at Eisai, we presented potentially practice-changing data, demonstrating the benefit of KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and in second-line advanced endometrial carcinoma based on results from KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775, respectively. These studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and we look forward to working with global regulatory authorities on these filings.  In February, in collaboration with AstraZeneca, we announced that following an interim analysis, the Phase III OlympiA trial, studying Lynparza as maintenance therapy in the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA-mutated high-risk HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer crossed the superiority boundary for its primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival versus placebo. The trial continues to evaluate the dual primary endpoints of overall survival and distant disease-free survival, and this data will be presented at ASCO. We are also pleased with the positive outcome of yesterday's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee review of our first-line advanced bladder cancer indication and recognition of the efficacy and safety that KEYTRUDA has demonstrated in clinical trials. We look forward to further discussions with the committee on other accelerated approvals under review.  Last month, we announced the decision to voluntarily withdraw an indication for KEYTRUDA for the third-line treatment of patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer. As announced, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for a supplemental biologics application for KEYTRUDA for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522. We anticipate the next interim analysis from this trial in the third quarter of 2021, and we look forward to further discussions with the FDA. Now turning to our broader pipeline. On molnupiravir, along with our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced interim results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients. After analysis of the data, we have decided to proceed to Phase III in outpatients with enrollment focused on higher-risk populations. We will be evaluating molnupiravir as a postexposure prophylactic option in a study starting later this year. As previously discussed, we have made the decision to discontinue the development of MK-7110 for COVID-19 and plan to focus our pandemic efforts on advancing molnupiravir and on producing Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine. In HIV, we continue to make good progress in our development program for islatravir, our potentially first-in-class nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Data presented at the CROI meeting last month supports the potential of islatravir in long-acting dosings regimens in both the treatment and in the PrEP settings. Of note was early data supporting the potential for the subdermal islatravir implant to provide drug concentrations above the target pharmacokinetic threshold for at least 1 year.  We are pleased to build upon our legacy of innovation in HIV through our collaboration with Gilead Sciences to co-develop and co-commercialize islatravir and lenacapavir. Both have unique properties that we believe have the potential to enable the creation of effective long-acting oral and injectable regimens that provide important new treatment options and address remaining unmet need for people living with HIV. Our pneumococcal vaccine, V114, remains on track for potential FDA approval for adults in July and a readout of pediatric data and associated filings by year-end. V114 is the first of a suite of promising pneumococcal vaccine candidates, which also include V116, our adult-focused vaccine, where a readout from our Phase I/II study is expected later this year. Finally, we announced that the FDA accepted our new drug application for gefapixant, a potentially first-in-class P2X3 inhibitor in adult patients with refractory and unexplained chronic cough. The decision is expected in December. This application will be subject of an upcoming advisory committee meeting. We continue to pursue business development across the most exciting areas of science. Our acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics expands and complements our internal pipeline of candidates targeting autoimmune diseases. Pandion's lead IL-2 candidate has the potential to be meaningfully differentiated based on high selectivity, and we plan to initiate the Phase Ib/II study this year. We continue to make strong progress with the pipeline. This momentum is due to the passion and commitment to the scientists within our research laboratories to bring life-saving medicines and vaccines to patients around the world. Now I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Lara, we're ready for questions, but I'd like to end the call today at 9 :00. We ask that questioners limit themselves to one question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Great. I guess I was just wondering on the KEYTRUDA KEYNOTE-564 study in RCC, if you believe you'll be able to file on disease-free survival. Or if FDA will also require survival data? And then regarding the commercial opportunity here, maybe a question for Frank. I think the current treatment rate here in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting for RCC is around 10% to 15%. Can you give us any thoughts on how much higher that might move if KEYTRUDA is approved here? Dean Li : So I'll address the KEYNOTE-564 question. In relationship to what the regulatory agencies will accept, we're clearly going to have discussions with them. But the endpoint that we reported is a registrational endpoint. And we hope to have further discussions with the FDA. Clearly, we are advancing the study to do the other endpoints that you outlined in terms of overall survival as well. Franklin Clyburn : Okay, Terence, and this is Franklin. The opportunity the majority of renal cell carcinoma patients do present in the adjuvant setting with the remaining in the metastatic setting, so think of it about 75% are presenting at the early stage. So it is a very nice opportunity for us. When we do look at our study, when we see and evaluate the eligible patients, it's probably about even turns between the adjuvant opportunity and metastatic opportunity. But we are very excited about this opportunity, if approved, going forward. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I just wanted to focus on the molnupiravir outpatient trial, if I may. And a couple of pieces to that. One, what percentage of the Phase II portion of this trial had older adults over 60? And I guess what would the Phase III portion -- what percentage of the Phase III has to be older to get to the number of events you have in mind over the target time frame? And also, I know the endpoints' focused on hospitalizations and deaths. But the trial sites are primarily in U.S. and Europe, where there's a lot of vaccination going on. So is there openness to perhaps adding sites like India, et cetera, where hospitalizations are high? Dean Li : So let me take that question. Thank you very much for that question. We're very confident in our molnupiravir program. As you outlined, we are advancing the outpatient. And I should also say that we are poised to start the Phase III portion of that outpatient study imminently. As you know, this is a global trial with a recruitment strategy focused in areas where we are looking at vaccination rates that are unfortunately low. So we are in Africa, we are in South America. Those will be very important sites. We anticipate that there will be more than 100 sites to contribute. This is a global study.  In terms of your question in relationship with India, we are -- we have entered into a voluntary license agreement with 5 Indian generic manufacturers to expand global access to molnupiravir. At this time, we are not extending our clinical trial for MOVe-OUT into India. And then finally, what I would say is our clinical safety and virologic data gives us great confidence to evaluate molnupiravir, not just in the MOVe-OUT study, but also for postexposure prophylaxis in a study starting later this year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : I just had a two part question on BD. You're getting $9 billion with the Organon spin. The company obviously generates a lot of cash. I guess if we continue the current pace of these tuck-in-type acquisitions, it seems like Merck at some point becomes overcapitalized. So I guess when you look at the BD landscape, are you confident that there are actionable opportunities to deploy this capital into transactions? Or does it reach a point where we need to think about further capital return to shareholders?  And maybe as you talk about the BD landscape and just sort of experience in the -- the environment you're seeing, I guess, is a string of smaller tuck-ins kind of more likely for Merck, given the environment we have? Or is there still the opportunity to think about larger or later-stage acquisitions over the near to intermediate term? Robert Davis : Yes. Chris, this is Rob. Maybe I'll address the question. As you point out, the company is very well-capitalized, and we are looking forward to getting the $9 billion special dividend as part of the spin-off of Organon. As we look at it, and as Caroline made in her prepared comments, we intend to use that capital both for business development and potentially share repurchase, but our clear priority is business development. We believe that's the most value-enhancing use of our capital, long term. To the question of whether or not I think there's enough assets out there, there are a lot of opportunities. So our goal is to deploy that capital to BD. And more time will have to pass to be able to see how that evolves. But that is our goal. But to your other question, if we do not ultimately use that capital for business development, I'm not looking to build excess cash or improve our ratings. We would return that to shareholders.  And then to the last part of your question about size, we've been very clear. We are open to any opportunity to add a meaningful asset. Size is not determined by dollars. Size is determined by complexity and the disruption it brings to our business. So as we look at it, we are open to all forms of deals, and we have the capital to go after all forms of deals. We continue to believe where we add a lot of value is in products that are in earlier stages of development, which is what's driven a lot of the deals we've done, but we're not limiting ourselves to that, and we're looking at all opportunity. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Thanks to Ken for the strong leadership within Merck more broadly. And a question for Rob. Our conversations with investors on Merck are surprisingly dominated by the KEYTRUDA concentration risk, particularly post-Organon. My question is do you believe the market is anywhere close to reflecting the revenue potential of the current pipeline products, drugs such as islatravir, belzutifan or TIGIT? Or would Merck ever think about giving an aggregate forecast for the existing pipeline, or even as GSK have intended to do, give a 2030 guidance just to help investors gain some visibility about the ability of Merck to manage the pending LOE associated with KEYTRUDA? Robert Davis : Yes. Well, I think to maybe just hit the nail on the head of the first part of your question. I do think that our belief and confidence in the overall value of our pipeline, both what we have in the mid- to late stage, and I can go into more specifics on what that is, as well as in the early stage on top of what we see as continued opportunities to expand in oncology, in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant spaces, in combinations, in co-formulation, if you look at the totality of everything, we continue to believe, and over time, I recognize we're going to have to demonstrate, but we continue to believe that, frankly, The Street is underestimating the potential in our pipeline.  And thus, while we are very aware of the potential LOE of KEYTRUDA, we do not see the cliff in the same way The Street does. I think we're very well positioned with what we have internally to address a meaningful part of that. And then obviously, as we said, we understand we need to continue to be urgent and looking at business development to continue to augment it. But I do think there is a disconnect. And over time, I'm confident we will be able to demonstrate.  As it goes to long-term guidance, I don't want to take a specific position today on whether or not we would ever do that, but I can tell you historically, I do agree with the position Merck has had, which is that can paint you into corners that caused you to make decisions that are not always in the best long-term interest. So I doubt you're going to see us giving 10-year guidance on what you've heard from others. But we'll have to see. I think, though, what is important to understand is I recognize also, though, over time, we're going to have to pull the cover back in a balanced way around our portfolio. I respect our science and I want to make sure we keep the integrity of our science pure, and that's very important. That's who Merck is. But I also understand that there is a balance to give some sense of understanding of what's in the pipeline to share our confidence over time. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : Just had a follow-up on molnupiravir. As you guys get closer to the Phase III results, how are you thinking about the commercial picture, assuming that it'll have a rest of world bias, especially given the with case burden in India?  And then when you guys look at the prophylaxis or the outpatient setting, what's the right way to stage patients from either a viral load or inflammation perspective? Just trying to think about the -- as the pandemic moves on, how can you more broadly address the -- maximize the number of patients that you could address? Dean Li : Yes. That's a great question. This is Dean. I'll try to give a scientific point of view and then I'll now send it to Frank to give a more commercial sort of point of view.  In relationship to molnupiravir, we think we are imminently going to do the Phase III trial in the outpatient setting, as was noted in the previous question. We're tightening up the inclusion criteria, reducing the allowable symptom duration for enrollment to be less than 5 days, and we're trying to enroll patients early in the course of disease who have a high risk for poor outcomes. That includes age and other risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. So we think that will be critically important to have a successful and timely trial.  In relationship to the postexposure prophylaxis, there's a number of ways one can design that trial. But if I can just take it as a higher elevation, we think that this MOVe-OUT and the prophylaxis studies is going to be very important, not just for Merck but for the world. As one sees the different places of vaccination, some of it albeit extremely low, it's creating a reservoir for variants -- the ability to have a small molecule that can easily be delivered orally is going to be really important for the world. So that's what we've been focused on. But let me turn it to Frank to focus on the framework that you've asked in terms of the commercial impact. Franklin Clyburn : Yes. I think you covered it well. Obviously, we'll have to see how the endemic phase evolves around the world in vaccination rates, but we see this as a really important therapeutic, to Dean's point, having a small-molecule oral option, especially in many markets outside the U.S. We have significant commercial experience, strong execution in getting our therapeutics vaccines to patients around the world, and that will be a significant focus for us. So we think this is a really important opportunity, especially in markets -- you think about what's happening now in India, but you think about the low- to middle-income countries, you think about what's happening in Europe. So upon -- if we're successful, we think this is a really important opportunity for us as we go forward. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Aaron Gal : A question over the mRNA technology. Can you let us know a little bit how you're thinking about integrating messenger RNA vaccine technology into your business or not? And can you speak specifically about GARDASIL? And do messenger RNA technology poses a risk to that? Can they reach the necessary polyvalency to develop those vaccines? And it seems to be simply a cheaper way of making the same vaccine from a cheaper cost of manufacturing perspective. Dean Li : Thank you for that excellent question. This is Dean. Let me give a little bit of framework for the mRNA. I would reemphasize that Merck has been very interested in mRNA and other nucleic acid technology and specifically in the vaccine in mRNA. For the past 5 to 6 years, Merck has partnered with Moderna on vaccines for infectious disease and vaccines for cancer. The validation of the mRNA technology in COVID is impressive and at least, personally, is deserving of admiration and thanks. We continue to be interested in mRNA and other nucleic-acid-based technologies, including viral-based platforms, for vaccines.  I would highlight, and specific to your question about GARDASIL, when you have multiple sort of antigens that you have to deliver, I think there is a role for those sort of platforms, protein-based. I think there's going to be many different platforms that need to be done specifically for the vaccine and the threat that you're trying to prevent. So RNA and other nucleic-acid-based technologies is important to us, including viral-based platforms. But we also think that broader speaking, there are other protein subunit, other vaccine platforms that will still be relevant moving forward. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Luisa Hector from Berenberg. Luisa Hector : It's on the PNEUMOVAX franchise, and I just wonder whether we should effectively look at 2020 as a peak for PNEUMOVAX, specifically. And then, how should we think about the competitive landscape here versus your own pipeline suite with V114 emerging very soon and then everything else behind that versus the competitors? Robert Davis : Yes. So on PNEUMOVAX, what I would say is that if you look at what happened in the first quarter of this year, we were down versus prior year because of the strong 2020 and the prioritization of the pneumococcal vaccination. We do anticipate, as you build around the rest of 2021, pneumococcal vaccination will start to be prioritized along with flu vaccinations. So we do anticipate, as you get to the back half of the year, you'll see PNEUMOVAX really have an important role to play.  We have also mentioned that we were supply-constrained as you look at PNEUMOVAX, especially in some of our markets around the world. But overall, we see it as a very important product going forward. As we introduce V114 and V116 and the initial introduction of V114, we still see PNEUMOVAX playing a very important role for pneumococcal disease going forward. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Truist. Gregory Gilbert : Ken, good luck and hope to see in Happy Valley from time to time. And for Rob, we've heard from Merck how the Organon spin will benefit Merck in terms of complexity and focus. But what are some of the tangible things Merck has done to set up that spin for success beyond the obvious stuff? And I realize we're going to hear more on Monday, but I know you've been familiar with separations in the past. So curious what some of those less obvious features are that you think Organon is poised to benefit from. Robert Davis : Well, as you look and, again, just to reiterate what you just commented, on our call on Monday is really solely focused on building out and helping explain the growth story for Organon. But if you look at where Merck has been over the last few years, we've been in a situation where we've been blessed with the benefits of what KEYTRUDA has been able to do. That has required us to do heavy investments to build out our oncology platform, to invest in the clinical studies for oncology and now more broadly, as we look at all of what we have going on in vaccines and even now with this islatravir in infectious diseases. So the challenge has been, in new ways, we had to prioritize, and we made a decision to deprioritize some of the assets that fit within the Organon portfolio. Many of those are still very good assets. And as you know, particularly in the women's health area, an opportunity for real growth.  So I believe through focus, through being able to actually drive their own capital allocation aimed at building those businesses and the focus they'll be able to bring, they will accelerate the growth across, not only the women's health business, but excitement around what they have in their biosimilars business. And then there are several areas, if you look that they'll highlight next week where I think they can get to a point of growth. So a lot of it is really about focus and capital allocation in a way that we haven't been able to do. While on our side, we believe with the spin, the simplification it brings will allow us to go after a lot of -- and I've talked about this in the past, a lot of the, as I've called it, if you will, think of it as the muscle. The fat that is chewing throughout the muscle in this company, given the complexity of our structure that's been built up over time, looking at those areas that sit between our divisions, as we think about manufacturing and commercial, as we think about supply chain and all of those are opportunities for us to simplify and to take out unneeded bureaucratic complexity, that simplification and focus will allow us to bring more resources to bear against our innovative portfolio and to drive faster growth that Caroline commented on.  So I think both businesses, you're going to see grow better as independent businesses than they would as a combined entity, and I'm confident in the story for both. And frankly, I'm excited about having a women's-health-focused business at this time in where we are as a society. I think there's a real opportunity for us to lead there. And that's what I'm looking forward to see Organon do. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : So just wanted to follow up on the 2024 42% operating margin target. Hoping you could just walk us through the pushes and pulls as it relates to the reduced royalty burdens as well as what's happening with the REMICADE, SIMPONI agreement at that point in time. I know that comes with a very high royalty burden as well. And it was our understanding that there are several sunsets in that period that will bolster margin meaningfully without necessarily coming from top line leverage. And then separately, a question as it relates to the type of business development that's occurring. Just wanted to get a better sense of when you feel we're really going to start to see some of the various smaller tuck-in deals start to produce data that's, let's call it, Phase II compelling from the earlier-stage deals that are really going to drive the next leg of growth. Is that sort of in a similar 2024, 2025 time frame? It's just that the visibility on the pipeline currently to The Street remains, I think, relatively modest. Robert Davis : Caroline? Caroline Litchfield : Seamus, thank you for the question. Let me first start with the near term. Our company's guidance for this year implies margins of 38%, a growth of 120 basis points compared with last year, and we're driving that growth as a result of the strong revenue and mix of revenue in our business as well as continued diligent but focused investments within our business. As we look out over the coming years, we will see margin improvement as a result of the $1.5 billion of productivity we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, and we are well on track towards that with $500 million included in 2021. As we move forward over time, the real strength for operating margin for Merck will primarily come from the growth opportunities we have with our assets in oncology, in vaccines. In addition, you will see continued investment in our business, but we are confident in achieving the 42%.  As you note, we also have the tailwind of a step down in the royalty rate as it pertains to KEYTRUDA and actually GARDASIL, and that will help in the achievement of the 42%, which we are very confident in. As it pertains to the product mix over time, our company has been diligent and focused in the types of business development we are doing. And Peloton is an ideal example, where we have the opportunity to see the fruit of that impact the top line of our company therefore, the bottom line, as well as support the patients that we serve. Your final point on REMICADE or SIMPONI, it's really not a major contributor to that bottom line expansion. Peter Dannenbaum : Dean, Rob, anything else to add there? Robert Davis : Maybe I'll just start, and then I'll turn it over to Dean. As you look at the opportunities, I do think you're going to see, in that '24 to '25 time frame, more information. The best example you can look at is what's happened with Peloton. And most recently, we're already seeing HIF-2 alpha move forward in important ways. There's many data coming out on that and see that as a meaningful opportunity.  But maybe I'll turn it to Dean to give a sense because I do believe you are going to see more information as we get in the time frame you're talking about from a lot of these business development deals, given the nature of a lot of the oncology assets. Dean Li : Yes. Thank you for that question. Let me just take a high level and then answer the temporal question that was asked. The sort of opportunities that we look for, both in our internal pipeline and external pipeline, we like -- or I like assets that give me concentration leverage, foundational drugs where clear monotherapy efficacy gives me a fulcrum for combination. And specifically in relationship to cancer, that allows us to expand, deepen and extend. And as we look for these foundational medicines and the recent discussions with Gilead and Pandion, it just shows that, that sort of attitude of how we want to sort of proceed where we're taking foundational medicines and we're matching them with internal and external pipeline so that we can diversify the pipeline. And specific to your question, I would look at the '21 to '24 range. There's a whole slew of Lynparza, Lenvima, KEYTRUDA study that you will see, a lot of it driving to adjuvant at earlier stages. I think there's at least 20 registrational trials. I sort of laid out maybe 4 or so that you'll see in the next year. In relationship to the business development, what you will see is in the '24, '25 time frame, things like the islatravir, Tilos, Seagen, that was also CTLA-4, LAG-3 TIGIT, all of them will be in striking range to not just see sort of Phase II studies but potentially interim analysis or even complete analysis of those assets in that time frame. So you'll see these different ways going through. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, everybody. We're right at the top of the hour. We appreciate the questions this morning and the discussion, and we look forward to any follow-ups in the coming days. Thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, presenters. And again, thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe. Have a lovely day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Mary Serran (ph), and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck and Co. Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2021 conference call. With me today are Rob Davis, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs, Frank Clyburn, President of Human Health, and Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, I'd like to point to a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2020 10-K, identified certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings today's earnings release and an Investor Presentation with highlights of our results are all posted on Merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks, Peter. And good morning, everyone. I'm deeply honored to speak to you today in my new role as CEO. Merck is a special Company, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by talented and dedicated colleagues who are intently focused on bringing important life-enhancing and life-saving medicines and vaccines to people and animals around the world.  This longstanding and unwavering commitment to our mission is real, is tangible, and is what drives us to perform every day. The prioritization of investment in research and development under Ken's leadership, and the focus of resources behind key growth drivers, has put us in a position of strength that I intend to build upon.  As I consider Merck's future, I continue to believe investment in the Research and Development, with patients at the center of everything we do, is core to who Merck is, and is our best path to sustainable, ongoing success and value creation. However, how we go about both delivering the best external and internal scientific opportunities, as well as how we bring those innovations to patients, must evolve. As I transition to the role of CEO, I solicited candid feedback from colleagues and external stakeholders.  What I heard reaffirms my convictions. There's a broad agreement that investment in R&D should remain our highest strategic priority. Employees are confident that we're on the right path. We have rebuilt and reinvigorated our discovery research engine and have a growing and robust pipeline.  We're successfully executing on clinical development And we're delivering strong commercial growth across both our human and animal health businesses now and will continue to do so, well into the future.  While we are on the right path, we need to work with more speed, urgency, and agility, more closely matching the pace of change in the broader environment. We need to accelerate the delivery of our innovations to the patients who need them, and to be leaner, nimbler, and more digitally-enabled.  We need to leverage the scale and reach we have as a global biopharmaceutical leader, while also embracing in commitment to evolve to address new challenges. And, we need to move with focus and intentionality, which is a priority for both me and my management team.  I know that it's not about promising, it's about performing. Actions speak louder than words. With that understanding, I pledge to do all I can to ensure that Merck remains a global biopharmaceutical leader long into the future, delivering value to current and future patients, and growth and value for our shareholders.  Now, turning to the quarter, we had very good performance with strong growth. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the pandemic on our business is lessening. Patient access to healthcare providers has improved, and we expect continued strong growth in the remainder of the year.  We're also making meaningful clinical advancements, which Dean will speak to in just a few moments. Our seamless execution during a period in which we successfully completed a complex spin-off, without business interruption, underwent leadership transitions and delivered accelerated growth only increases my confidence in what our organization can achieve in the future.  Organon is now an independent Company, an important milestone in our Company's history. And this transaction is a meaningful catalyst to Merck becoming a more focused, more efficient, and faster growing Company.  Let me spend a moment speaking about KEYTRUDA, which again experienced very strong growth this quarter. I'm confident that KEYTRUDA will continue to be a foundational cancer therapy and achieve strong growth for years to come. We are a leader in immuno-oncology, and are determined to leverage this into sustained success.  We are rapidly advancing a diverse set of oncology assets, many of which we highlighted in our recent ASCO investor presentation. Across our oncology portfolio, we expect over 90 potential new indications by 2028, more than tripling our current base.  We have a wide array of clinical partnerships, providing valuable insights into the biology of disease and into important potential external innovation. With our expanding oncology portfolio outside of KEYTRUDA, we will extend our leadership in cancer long into the future.  I also strongly believe we will successfully navigate the eventual KEYTRUDA loss of exclusivity, given the breadth of opportunity in areas both within, as well as outside of oncology. Internally, our leaders are intensely focused on this period and efforts are underway. Externally, I understand the importance of providing investors with increased transparency into the breadth of opportunities we see in our pipeline that will help us do this.  As we've done recently in highlighting islatravir, our broader HIV portfolio, and our next-generation oncology assets, we're planning deep dive investor events with our scientific and commercial leaders, focused on other areas of our pipeline, that we believe, are underappreciated, yet hold great promise, such as our suite of vaccine candidates, our cardiometabolic assets, as well as others.  Business development plays an important role, and we are putting increased emphasis on ensuring we are appropriately aggressive and accessing the best external science. Executing value-enhancing BD is the top priority, and we intend to add to our pipeline through acquisitions, partnerships, licensing deals and collaborations.  We will be unbounded by therapeutic area, though we are mindful of the need to have a balanced portfolio over time. We'll seek new products, modalities, and platforms that allow us to establish beachheads in important areas. Our recent acquisition of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset is a good example of this.  We will look at both early and late-stage opportunities, and we have the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes, particularly given the $9 billion distribution from the Organon spinoff.  And given our strong operational momentum, we are most interested in transactions that are easily integrated and less disruptive, where value is principally derived by the introduction of innovative new products that address patient needs instead of through cost energies.  Before I turn the call over to Frank to discuss second quarter performance in our Human Health business, I want you to know that I appreciate and applaud the increasing societal and investor demands in corporations to act responsibly. In fact, I believe our strong performance across environmental, social, and governance issues, has and will continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Merck has a long track record and history of strong corporate citizenship, and I'm committed to remaining a leader in this area. With that, let me turn the call over to Frank. Frank Clyburn : Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, our Human Health business continues to regain momentum and we achieved 18% growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of exchange.  Across our business, we've been engaging in investing with urgency to encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screenings, and vaccination rates, including catch-up for missed doses.  The agility demonstrated by our teams around the world, to quickly reallocate resources to drive these patient activation programs, has benefited our largely physician-administered portfolio. In the U.S., we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures have returned to more normal levels.  And on Oncology, we're seeing screening rates continue to improve. We're confident that these favorable trends, and the strong underlying demand for our products, will drive accelerated underlying business momentum in the second half of the year. Now, I'll turn to the second quarter performance of our key brands.  My comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 20% to $4.2 billion, reflecting continued strong global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate strong growth, and over the course of the pandemic, has increased its market share of new patients within the immuno-oncology class. KEYTRUDA also maintains its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients.  We continue to see strong growth across all key tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma, and our MSI high indication. Additionally, we are off to a very strong start with our launch of KEYNOTE-355 in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and we look forward to adding overall survival to the label.  We're also excited by the recent approval and upcoming launch of KEYNOTE-522 in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. Outside the U.S., growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Lynparza grew 34% in the quarter, and remains the leading PARP inhibitor. Growth continues to be driven by approvals of recent indications, and we look forward to a potential future launch in adjuvant breast cancer based on the OlympiA data presented at ASCO this year.  LENVIMA grew 15% in the quarter, reflecting increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma following the NRGL listing in China. We're also excited to launch the recently approved combination of LENVIMA plus KEYTRUDA in endometrial carcinoma.  And in the near future, to potentially launch in renal cell carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-5 KEYNOTE 581. Our vaccines portfolio recovered sharply due to the return to more normal level of wellness visits.  GARDASIL had a very strong quarter, growing 78%. In the U.S., higher sales were driven by a recovery from the negative impact of last year's lockdowns. Outside the U.S., growth was driven by increased demand in China.  Sales also benefited from increased supply due to improved manufacturing, which I'll provide additional details on in a moment. Our hospital business continued its recovery. BRIDION sales grew 67% year-over-year, driven by increased surgeries as patient's access to hospitals improved from last year.  Turning to our outlook. the recovery we saw in the quarter gives us confidence that we will have a very strong second half resulting from both market recovery and strong commercial execution.  Over the quarter, Merck quickly pivoted it's focus and resources to patient activation campaigns to ensure that patients are putting their health first and recognize the importance of returning to physicians offices for screenings, early detection, and routine visits. Our efforts in partnership with public health constituent groups, paired with the continued rollout of COVID -19 vaccinations, has resulted in meaningful improvements in patients accessing healthcare providers.  And in adolescents, we've seen more than one-third of teens in the U.S. vaccinated against COVID-19 with at least 1 dose. We assume that these rapidly growing vaccination rates and continued commercial execution will help to drive a near-normal back-to-school season.  Merck has also shown increased agility and efficiency across our organization. And importantly, we've made improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. Of note, we expect GARDASIL to significantly benefit from increases in productivity across our supply chain, which will allow us to fulfill demand that we were previously unable to supply.  Furthermore, as global demand for GARDASIL continues to outpace supply, our teams have been working to ensure we have the right regulatory approvals, and lead time to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly as the pandemic continues to force lockdowns in many geographies.  These improvements alone will drive very strong sequential and year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the back half of the year, especially in ex-U.S. markets such as China. In oncology, we are encouraged by the recovery we've seen to-date, and our overall performance throughout the pandemic.  We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio,, including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, LENVIMA, and if approved, belzutifan, and expect to drive strong and sustained growth across key tumor types and stages of disease.  Overall, the improvements in patient access we are seeing in major markets gives us increased confidence as we look to the second half of the year. Before I conclude, I would like to mention the strong execution of our commercial colleagues around the world that enabled our Company to drive strong growth in the first half of the year.  All the while, we're working to successfully complete the spin-off of Organon. We are confident that the spin-off results in meaningful benefits to the commercial organization, including the ability to drive even stronger growth through more focused commercial execution.  To close, our business has regained momentum, and we are well-positioned to achieve strong growth in the third and fourth quarters. Our portfolio has rebounded with strength, and demonstrated not only its resiliency, but its value to patients globally. [Indiscernible] confidence in the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines.  And we look forward to a return to robust long-term demand-driven growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Our business delivered meaningful growth in the quarter, driven by strong underlying demand for products across our growth pillars and the continued recovery of the business as patient access improved.  As we exit the quarter, we are confident that our position of financial and operational strength, will enable us to drive long-term revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, creating value for our shareholders by delivering on our mission to improve the health and wellness to people and animals worldwide. Now, turning to our second quarter results which reflect Merck on a continuing operations basis. Total Company revenues were $11.4 billion, an increase of 22%, or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange.  Further adjusting for the estimated impact of the pandemic, total revenues grew 8% year-over-year, evidence of the underlying strength of our business. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis.  As Frank highlighted, our Human Health business showed improving momentum, growing 18%, or 6% when adjusted for the estimated impact of the pandemic. Animal Health had an outstanding quarter, increasing 27% driven by very strong global demand across Companion Animal and Livestock, which increased to 38% and 20% respectively.  Animal Health sales grew 19% when adjusted for the estimated pandemic impact. In Companion Animal, growth was driven by higher global demand for vaccines as well as parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of products.  Performance in livestock reflects increased global demand across ruminant, swine, and poultry products, along with higher demand for our Animal Health intelligence products. I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.5% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6%, reflecting the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange, pricing pressure, and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix.  Operating expenses increased 13% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, driven largely by higher clinical development costs, increased investment in our early stage pipeline, and high er promotion costs in support of return ed care activities for our key growth drivers.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.6%, an increase of 1.3% from a year ago, driven by these three items last year. Taken together, we are at $1.31 per share, an increase of 27%. Before turning to our 2021 guidance, I want to remind you briefly of the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the spin-off of Organon. With the spin completed, Merck is now a more focused Company and better positioned to unlock the full potential of our growth pillars and drive accelerated profitable growth. We're very excited about our future. And as we look out to 2024, we continue to believe that our revenue potential is underappreciated. Now, for 2021.  Health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of the pandemic and we assume this trend will continue. We are narrowing and raising our expected revenue range to $46.4 billion to $47.4 billion, representing growth of 12% to 14%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 2% using mid-July rate.  The underlying demand for our growth pillars and our strong commercial execution provides us with confidence that we will continue to see strong momentum throughout the remainder of the year. As such, we expect total revenues to be sequentially higher in each consecutive quarter.  Our gross margin is expected to be between 76% and 77%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate, driven by increased investment in promotion, and patient activation programs to accelerate our near-term business momentum, and by increased R&D investment, to advance our exciting pipeline to support sustainable long-term revenue growth. As a reminder, our operating margin from continuing operations will be lower than what they were as a combined Company, as our guidance range implies significant operating leverage in 2021. In addition, we continue to expect operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, driven by our accelerated revenue growth and disciplined investment in our business.  In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $300 million. We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect non - GAAP EPS to between -- excuse me, to be between $5.47 and $5.57, reflecting growth of 21% to 23%.  This range includes the positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-July rates. As you consider your models and the allocation of revenues to various products, there were two areas to focus on : GARDASIL and Animal Health.  Frank described the strong acceleration in growth expected in GARDASIL, and we also expect continued momentum in our Animal Health business. Our updated guidance also reflects the benefits of the approval of KEYNOTE-522, and as a reminder, does not include revenues from the potential launch of molnupiravir. Turning to capital allocation. We received a $9-billion cash distribution from Organon, which we intend to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunities that align with the parameters Rob outlined. In the absence of meaningful business development, we will return cash to shareholders through share repurchases.  We remain committed to investing in support of our key brands, and progressing our innovative pipeline, and we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time. To conclude, as a leaner, more focused, and agile Company, Merck is prepared to capitalize on the meaningful opportunities that lie ahead, and is better equipped to succeed in an ever-changing landscape. Merck remains in a position of financial and operational strength, which we will leverage to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for our patients and shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. I'm delighted to be here today to provide an overview of progress made over the past quarter. I will cover key regulatory milestones in clinical updates, initially on oncology, and then across the broader pipeline. As Rob highlighted, we continue to show strong momentum in our oncology pipeline, which positions us well. And it's worth reiterating our goal; to potentially deliver 90 plus approvals and new indications by 2028.  A recent report from the American Cancer Society noted that there has been a rapid decrease in lung cancer and melanoma death from 2014 to 2018. One factor attributed in this -- to this decline is advancements in research, including targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.  The report also notes there is an urgent need to accelerate a decline in death rates for breast, prostate, and other cancers, where Merck is just beginning to make an impact. We are hopeful that our contributions, and the advances being made industry-wide, will continue to fuel this decline.  Notably, during the last quarter, we achieved several milestones for treatments targeting women's cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer, the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, which, historically, treatment options have been limited, I am pleased to announce several advancements which will improve options for patients.  The first is FDA approval for a new indication in high-risk, early stage triple-negative breast cancer based on results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-522 study, or KEYTRUDA, was evaluating combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then as monotherapy adjuvant treatment post-surgery.  These practice-changing event-free survival results were presented just 2 weeks ago, which demonstrated a remarkable 37% reduction in the risk of progression precluding definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death from any cause compared to chemotherapy alone in patients. Now additionally, we announced positive clinically meaningful top-line overall survival results, from the Phase III KEYNOTE-355 study, evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 with a combined proportion score greater than or equal to 10.  This positions KEYTRUDA to be the first anti-PD1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy to show statistically significant overall survival in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We will work with regulators to expand the existing indication to include survival benefits and we'll aim to share full results soon.  Also for early stage breast cancer, along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we presented results at ASCO from the Phase III OlympiA trial, evaluating Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA high-risk HER2 negative early-stage breast cancer.  These findings clearly demonstrated that Lynparza reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence, second cancers, or death, by 42%. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities and the trial continues to evaluate overall survival.  Now, also at ASCO, with our partners at Seagen, we presented additional encouraging data from the HER2CLIMB studying to Kaiser in patients with early stage HER2 - positive breast cancers. It is clear that Merck is establishing an [Indiscernible] check in breast cancer with multiple agents.  The progress we are making in this area of significant unmet patient need is one example of our strategy to expand into earlier lines of therapy and our strong conviction that our oncology assets have the potential to change the way early stage cancers are treated.  We are also making progress across women's cancer more broadly. We received an approval from the FDA for an expanded indication for the combination of KEYTRUDA and LENVIMA for the treatment of certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma, where along with our partners at Eisai, we showed results from the confirmatory Phase III KEYNOTE-775 study earlier this year.  And finally, we have positive results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-826 trial, investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic, cervical cancer, regardless of their PD-L1 status.  The trial met its dual primary endpoint of overall survival and progression-free survival. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authority. Additional FDA approvals this quarter included 2 new indications for KEYTRUDA. The first is in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on results from the Phase III KEYNOTE KEYNOTE-811 study.  The second approval was an expanded indication for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for patients with locally advanced disease that is not curable by surgery or radiation. This was granted under accelerated approval based on a Phase II KEYNOTE-629 study.  The FDA also granted priority review, based on Phase 3 data from KEYNOTE-581, and first-line treatment, advanced renal cell carcinoma. And we expect a decision in the third quarter. Now, outside the U.S., the European Commission approved a new indication for KEYTRUDA, plus chemotherapy, in certain patients with esophageal cancer or HER2-negative gastro esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, based on results from KEYNOTE-590.  And in China, Lynparza was granted conditional approval for certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who progressed following prior treatment with certain new hormonal agents.  This is the first PARP inhibitor to be approved for advanced prostate cancer in China. Now, also at the ASCO virtual meeting, new data supporting the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-564 trial for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma was presented.  KEYTRUDA given after surgery demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease recurrence, or death, by 32% compared to placebo. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities and the trial will continue to evaluate overall survival.  We are making progress on our strategy to extend the benefit of KEYTRUDA to more patients. This includes the initiation of a Phase III trial, evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We believe this new formulation could be an important additional option for patients.  This study will be unrolling soon with a readout expected in early 2023. And finally, belzutifan continues to make good progress with additional Phase Two data presented at ASCO and an expected FDA action date in September, and a development program with 3 Phase III studies in renal cell carcinoma that are gaining momentum. Now, turning to our broader pipeline.  In response to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in India, we made the decision to enable access to molnupiravir in low and middle income countries through voluntary license agreements with several Indian generic manufacturers.  While the ongoing studies in India are recruiting a different patient populations, we are encouraged by the data being generated and we look forward to continuing to help with the crisis.  We remain excited by the progress in molnupiravir and the data we've seen to date. Along with our partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced the presentation of full results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease 2021.  We look forward to the readout from the Phase III portion of this study in the October timeframe. Additionally, we posted a new Phase III study evaluating molnupiravir as a postexposure prophylactic option, and look forward to a readout in the first half of 2022.  In HIV, we continue to progress our islatravir development program, our investigation on nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Phase II data presented at the International AIDS Society meeting a few weeks ago continued to support the safety and tolerability profile of oral once monthly islatravir in the PrEP setting. We are continuing to enroll patients across diverse populations and geographies in the Phase III empower trials, and are moving forward with studies evaluating islatravir in treatment and prevention settings. In vaccines.  I am pleased to note the FDA approval of VAXNEUVANCE, the first in a suite, a promising pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults 18 years and older caused by 15 serotypes.  Along with immune response data showing that VAXNEUVANCE can maintain progress achieved to date, based on non-inferiority to stereotypes shared with PCVs 13, VAXNEUVANCE also induced superior immune response to PCV13 for shared serotypes 3 and for the 2 serotypes unique to VAXNEUVANCE, 22F and 33F.  These immunogenicity data position this vaccine to offer an important new option and protection of adults from invasive pneumococcal disease. We look forward to further engagement with the ACIP, including discussing the positive results we achieved through our robust development program studying a broad range of adult populations and clinical circumstances, including adults at increased risk.  Building on our clinical evidence for VAXNEUVANCE, we also announced that 2 of our Phase III pediatric study met their primary immunogenicity and safety endpoints in supporting potential use in healthy infants who may have previously started a pneumococcal vaccination series with PCV13, and in the catch-up setting for healthy children who have either not received pneumococcal vaccines, or have received a full or partial regimen with lower valency pediatric PCVs.  We continue to anticipate data from our Phase I/II program, evaluating V116, our adult focused vaccine to read out later this year. To conclude, I remain excited about the progress in our broader pipeline, and efforts stemming from Merck Research Labs, that contribute to improving options and treatments for diseases that affect people globally.  We continue to deliver on our strategy with speed and urgency to harness the benefits of our cancer therapies for as many patients as possible, while advancing a broad pipeline of promising vaccines and therapeutic candidates. Now I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Mary, will you please start the question-and-answer session? And to help to get to more questioners today, we ask that each analyst limit themselves to 1 question. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. For my 1 question here, just a bigger picture one for Rob. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the business development environment? If not your post the Organon transaction that you're highlighting, R&D is a priority, bringing more innovation to the Company is a priority. But how are you thinking about deals that would accelerate the Company's investment in oncology where they obviously have a competitive strength versus more therapeutic area diversification? And can you maybe just walk through the pros and cons as you consider and think about larger transactions versus a series of smaller deals?  I know you're looking at everything, but I'm just trying to get -- since if all else equal, is there a bias one way or the other at this point? Thanks so much. Rob Davis : Sure. Sure. No, I appreciate the question, Chris, and good morning. As we -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very focused on business development, and it's something that we recognize we need to do. We need to augment the pipeline.  But I also just want to reinforce, and I think hopefully you heard it through what Dean just walked through, we also have a strong internal pipeline, and I don't want to lose sight of that. And we really do have a lot of confidence in what we can bring forward across the breadth of both oncology assets, as well as assets outside of oncology and vaccines. Obviously in HIV, all the areas that Dean touched upon. But with that said, we know we need to add more and build upon that, and we're very focused there. Clearly, we see ourselves, and I made a comment about this in the prepared remarks, with the strength in oncology.  And we want to build upon that strength and actually see ourselves as a Company that, over time, can be a broad player across oncology, really leveraging the foundational position we have with KEYTRUDA to going well beyond KEYTRUDA, and we're already starting to do that.  As we think about business development, I always will look at that because if you look right now in the space of where there's still one of the largest unmet needs, despite the advances we've made with KEYTRUDA and other new agents, which are phenomenal in what they're delivering for patients, the truth is the majority of patients still don't have a solution yet for the cancers they face.  This is still an area of unmet need. There's a ton of science being done in this area -- focused in this area. And as I said, we have the strength to leverage the position of KEYTRUDA and the data we have within our oncology space, to really be a differentiated, and I think unique observer of the space to be able to select the best opportunity.  So that will be a focus. But I also recognize we have to do more than that, we need to be balanced, and we are looking to areas outside of oncology as well. And I would like to see us do things in both. Build the strong foundation, continue to lead in oncology, leverage the data we have there, but look to where can we balance that, and augment the portfolio on outside areas. On the second part of the question, on the pros and cons between large and small deals, in a perfect world we would -- where we think we bring the greatest value, is if you get assets that are a little bit earlier in development where we can bring the prowess we have from a clinical side to bring those through and really add value.  Those are the deals we've been doing historically. But we're not foreclosed to doing larger deals. And as we've always said, and I continue to believe, it's more about finding the right science. Driven first was science as the key component, informed by the portfolio impact where we believed we had value. And if we can find those deals, we will move on them, whether they are large or small. But clearly one of the areas we continue to believe we do not need to go, is to the very large synergy-driven deals.  I think we have enough firepower on our own pipeline. And through what we can add across the portfolio with deals focused on the science, we don't need to go to those large type of deals at this time. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Chris. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi guys, thanks so much for taking my question. I thought I'd focus a little bit on molnupiravir, since that's the trial that's coming up. And presumably, it's also the biggest needle mover on numbers for next year as we think about it.  My question is this, the 0.5 to 0.7 log antiviral benefit that you're seeing, what feedback are you hearing on that magnitude of viral load drop? And what's the feedback on the clinical benefit observed with that in the mobile trial?  And I ask because it looks like even though you are limiting your primary analysis to patients enrolled in less than five days, I still think there's a fair amount of seropositives embedded within the way you're looking at the data. And I almost wonder, if seronegative is probably that population where you've probably see n the most cleanest signal. I'd be very curious. Thank you. Dean Li : Yeah, this is Dean. Let me take that question. We are advancing molnupiravir in a Phase III clinical trial. It is focused on the outpatient setting, and we are focusing it on high-risk patients. The reason I emphasize that is, your observations in relationship to viral load and as such are important observations. But I would just call out that, at least with -- on the U.S. regulatory framework, the viral load is not the critical issue for the regulatory framework; it is whether or not we can affect clinical events. And so the need to focus on high-risk patients is the critical issue that we want to focus on.  In relationship to that trial, it has a primary completion date that's listed as October. And we are very enthusiastic of how this trial is progressing, and we hope to see data over the coming months for the trial. I would emphasize that this is a blinded global study and it is focused on high risk and many of the -- the pandemic keeps shifting, and so it's not just within the U.S. and the EU, but important countries like South Africa, Brazil, Colombia, those countries are extremely important for our ability to show not just the reduction of viral load, but a big impact on clinical effect. That's what we need to look for in this trial. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, thanks, Umer, next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question for you is just how we should think about your margin expansion opportunities. I know you've given some longer term guidance. But let's say over the next 12 months, how would that progress? Thank you. Caroline Litchfield : Louise, this is Caroline. Thank you for your question. First, I'll start with our pipeline is rich. And therefore as a Company, we are focused in growing expenses to support the near-term and long-term opportunities that we have, which will enable us to drive long-term revenue growth. That said, we are also expecting to drive margin expansion. And that margin expansion will come from a few different factors. It will come through from the revenue growth. It will also come from a change in our product mix.  And it will also come through efficiencies across our business and our commitment to deliver $1.5 billion of operating efficiencies over the 3-year period. Finally, we do expect an increase in margin in 2024 as a result of the step-down of royalties, specific to KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL.  So as I think about margin expansion, our guidance for this year at the midpoint of the range assumes that 2 percentage point increase in margin. And I expect that margin expansion to continue to grow as you look out to the coming year. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Louise. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Terrence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two-parter: I guess, Rob, just curious if you're setting any internal timelines for use of the Organon proceeds and would welcome your latest view of asset valuations.  And then for Dean, there's obviously been a tremendous amount of progress with new platforms over the last 12 to 18 months. And Rob, you touched on some of these, but any of that particularly stand out to you as having the potential to be as transformative as antibodies were 20 years ago? Thank you. Rob Davis : Terrence, thanks for the question. As we look forward, we're actively looking and want to move with speed. I don't want to put a time limit on how fast because, obviously, some of it is based on market factors, and where assets are in their own lifecycle, and in discussions we're having.  Right now, we're focused on trying to find the ways to deliver to the pipeline through BD, but it's not timed down. I think what Caroline's really trying to say is, eventually, if we don't find those opportunities, we're not going to sit on the cash forever. But I want to make sure that we put the priority on BD first before we make that determination. Dean Li : In relationship to your second question, it's almost -- there's such a laundry list of advancements in data and technology that whatever I say, I'm going to miss saying something. And I will just focus not so much in platforms.  There's a lot of movement in data platforms that I think are critically important, but also in what I would call it technology platforms that are important for making molecules, as you said, such as antibodies. Clearly, there's a lot of movement in protein engineering. Clearly, there's movement in protein degradation.  Clearly, there's movement in antibody-drug conjugates. And we are interested in all of them. I think one of the critical questions that often people think about, especially in relationship to us as a vaccine Company, is in relationship to mRNA.  And really the success of a monovalent SARS -CoV-2 vaccine is something that's demonstrated the speed which we've always recognized, but also scalability. And we were one of the first to invest in mRNA for vaccines, for ID, and for oncology. And so we're taking some of those lessons and we're prioritizing programs where we believe that mRNA will be implored. I do want to emphasize that those programs -- that said, programs such as pneumococcal vaccines, I don't think is a place where mRNA vaccines is a place to take it. And complex multivalent vaccines with profound and proven clinical benefits such as GARDASIL. I'm not so sure that that's where I would drive an mRNA vaccine.  Outside of infectious disease, we continue to have a very productive partnership with Moderna on oncology. Where we're a little bit more careful is outside of the use of vaccines. We watch with interest the progression of that technology. Rob Davis : And Terrence, my apologies. I recognized I didn't answer the last part of your question on valuations. What we are seeing in the marketplace are things tend to still be fully valued. And as we know, there's a lot of capital flowing into the biotech space. That obviously presents a challenge, but I would just point to you that we recognize we need to be appropriately aggressive as we go after these opportunities. And I continue to believe that if we apply where we see differential opportunity, based on our scientific read of what's out there, we can still create value while we're strategically adding to the pipeline. And that's really where we're focused. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Terence. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Baum : The market doesn't credit the pipeline that you're doing, including growth such as islatravir. Without stating [Indiscernible], I'm focused on [Indiscernible] at the end of the decade. The reason I say that is previously, Rob, you have highlighted Merck recognizes need to raise the curtains on a pipeline axis to a great degree with -- shown historically. You have very large safe spaces [Indiscernible] among others. When should we expect to see that curtain being raised? And then just an add on. Yes, [Indiscernible] question. Merck has a program of islatravir they're taking in to committ. Do you believe it infringes your intellectual property? Thank you. Rob Davis : Andrew, we will try to answer the question. To be honest with you, you came through very, very garbled. I think your question -- the first part of the question was about pipeline transparency and when are we going to be showing more information if we're on that. As I said, that is an area of focus.  We did that with what -- when we showed you the broader HIV Portfolio and the work we did recently to give some insights to our broader early-stage oncology portfolio outside of KEYTRUDA. Our thought and thinking is probably, as we approach probably closer to the end of the year, I think we're going to plan to have another session.  And then, obviously, we'll think about as we move into next year. But areas we want to highlight as we move forward, clearly, as I mentioned, cardiometabolic is an area where we have growing conviction and interest.  We're very interested in our broader vaccines portfolio and we see a lot of opportunity there. So those will be some areas where we'll be focusing in the future. And then I think you were asking if we saw a pro-drug IP issue with islatravir. I'll turn that over to Dean if he's aware of -- if I got the question right. Dean Li : Right. So first of all, Islatravir is a foundational element that one could build on and that's what our strategy is built on, monotherapy for prevention and combination in terms of treatment. So the interest in Islatravir, I kind of take it as validation of how strong we believe in Islatravir and this mechanism. In terms of the, the Legal status, we're very comfortable in where we fit in relationship with islatravir. I don't want to speak directly to freedom to operate and all of that in relationship to other people's compounds, until we see the details of the structure in all of this. But we are very confident in our investment and our patent position in relationship to Islatravir. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Daina Graybosch : All right. Thanks for the question. I just want to ask one on pneumococcal. I wonder if you could give us your base and best case for the October AICP meeting, given the June preview analysis. Didn't it consider some of the strengths of your vaccine around Serotec 3 and other strongs? Dean Li : Let me first take it and then I'll pass it on to Frank. We're very confident in the clinical program of our V114 vaccine event and the strength of the data that serves as the basis for the filing, which showed broad protection against disease-causing serotypes and improved immune performance for serious serotypes that persist.  This will be an important point. Not all serotypes are equal. There are certain serotypes that are far more important than others. And so, I think it will be very important at the ACIP to understand the epidemiology and how one thinks through that.  Now, we've demonstrated that the immune response data really shows that we have non-inferiority to stereotypes shared with PCV13, and that we have superior for 3 that are quite important from an epidemiologic standpoint.  I think the other issue that I just want to also elevate is that we also are advancing V114, or VAXNEUVANCE, not just in relationship to adults, but we're advancing it aggressively in relationship to the pediatrics. And we are also advancing a more bespoke adult - focused vaccine V116 that we hope to share data on over the next year or so. Frank? Frank Clyburn : And what I would say is, one, we're very -- we're excited about the opportunity we have overall for a pneumococcal franchise. To your question on the ACIP, we are waiting to better understand the future recommendations, really, of all the vaccines, PNEUMOVAX, VAXNEUVANCE, and PREVNAR 20.  You saw some of the information that came out in June. At this time, there may be a shift and some preference towards some of the newer pneumococcal vaccines, that they go with an age based recommendation, there are number of populations that they're looking at in their recommendations.  And right now we're focused on really making sure they understand our data and the benefits of our offerings across some are both PNEUMOVAX 23 and VAXNEUVANCE. So if there is some risk to Pneumovax, as I mentioned, we'll have to see how that plays out, but I would also highlight that this is for us expressively VAXNEUVANCE as being talked about in the beginning.  We think we have a very competitive offering in adults. We're very excited about the opportunity we have for pediatrics and you heard being mentioned our 2 Phase III trials in pediatrics as well, as we're continuing to develop V116 aimed for adults and also V117.  When we look at the overall pneumococcal franchise and, I would say, vaccines as a growth pillar for our Company, we're very confident in the continued growth for vaccines for the Company both near-term and in the long-term. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Daina. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. Rob, I want to ask another strategy question just coming off the completion of the spin, and to see what the guardrails are when you think about BD.  So the question is, would diversifying the revenue mix away from oncology take priority over the up margin expansion you're expected to have. And then to put a finer point on therapeutic areas.  I know you lead whereever the science takes you, but what are your thoughts on the orphan drug arena or expanding the footprint of neuroscience, now that there's apparently a more favorable FDA environment? Thank you. Rob Davis : Geoff, I appreciate the question. As we think about business development and how we think about that relative to our margin goals we have for the Company, a couple of comments. One, it's important to say we do believe over time, as I said, we need to have a balanced -- more balanced portfolio, and we'd like to bring that diversification.  I would make 1 clarification to your point. I see a difference in diversification away from KEYTRUDA versus diversification away from oncology. Obviously, oncology is a broad field. And as I said it earlier, with huge unmet needs still -- still rests there.  That's an area where we can leverage the strength that we have with KEYTRUDA, the foundational position we have, the data we have, the insights we get from basically being tested, either combined with, or against pretty much every agent out there. And so I see expansion and diversification across broader oncology as an important goal for us future -- into the future.  And then I do believe we also should look for other therapeutic areas. We have a strong position in vaccines. We are looking there. We've mentioned cardiometabolic as an area. And in fact, Dean can make a comment on neuroscience, where we actually have several ongoing early stage programs in the neuroscience space, so we're excited about that.  To your question on what do we prioritize. First and foremost, I prioritize long-term sustainable growth. And that, in our business, is about innovation and investment in science. And so we always will prioritize that. I believe we can both deliver that and bring operating margin expansion to the business. But if it's a matter of driving cost reduction or investing in growth, I always will invest in growth. Dean Li : Let me take a shot at that question that you had in relationship to orphan disease and neuroscience. I would highlight that if we're looking at rare diseases, I do like rare diseases because it's a very quick way to understand proof-of-concept and can move quickly.  And then once you're at that situation, the ability to expand from that beach head is very important. And the reason I want to emphasize that is deals [Indiscernible], although an oncology, is really a rare disease play with the possibility of expanding into broader cancers.  Whether we see that in cancer or in non-cancer assets and pathways and possibilities, that's something that we're very interested to replicate. In relationship to neurosciences, you're right. There has been movement recently of the FDA and the important biomarkers.  But I do want to level set that the importance of biomarkers must also be balanced by the importance of being able to show changes in important clinical events for patients. It has changed and we're very anxious to understand how we can best utilize that movement for biomarkers, and especially for example, our phospho Tau program, which we're very enthusiastic of advancing. How that should navigate, and how we should think about, for example, biomarkers such as Tau biomarkers in that clinical strategy is of intense interest to us, giving the shifting landscape. We have other neuroscience programs, MK MK-8189 is in Phase II for Schizophrenia, we have MK-1942 that we're advancing for treatment-resistant depression. The regulatory landscape changing in neuroscience is important. It is something that we've taken in account and it is affecting how we navigate the field and accelerate the programs that we have. And it also changes how we look at business development as well. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Geoff. We realize it's 9 o'clock. We're going to go a few minutes late to get to more questions. Next question, please, Mary. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open. Ronny Gal : Good morning, and thank you for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about -- more about using mRNA on a multivalent approach. You notice that it's a hard problem. Is this a theoretically impossible issue, or just an engineering issue of getting messenger RNA vaccines to be multivalent? Dean Li : I'll take that question. The issue with multivalency is, it's the more valence that you have in any vaccines, it becomes a more complicated issue. The other issue is the dose that you need, and what we would call the reactogenicity every time that you add something. I don't -- it would be remiss for me to say that anything's impossible. Science and technology changes. But the framework that I was trying to lay out is that there are places where I think the field would race in relationship to mRNA to have an impact clinically.  And then there are other parts of the field where I think more discovery and development of the technology, there will be an intense interest to overcome some of those initial barriers. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Ronny. Next question,please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. Your line is open. Mara Goldstein : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I had a question on pricing, as we came into the beginning of this year, one of the things that Merck had commented on, was that pricing was a potentially a major -- continue to be a major issue for the pharmaceutical industry and that pressure is only going to increase.  We saw a few days ago, a little bit of hand waving, I think on the part of the Biden administration, about something about settled government being able to negotiate pricing in Medicare systems. So I'm just wondering, as rounding out of 2021, and into 2022, what the Company's thoughts around pricing are? Rob Davis : Yeah. Thank you. I'll take that question. Clearly, we continue to expect to see ongoing pressure on pricing and I think the dialogue that you're pointing to the tapping right now with Congress. And then, also, with the Biden administration only reinforces that that threat continues to be there. But I think as we focus on it, a couple of points.  One, as we look forward, all of the expectations we have for our growth as a Company that we've communicated in the past does assume we face meaningful price pressure. So we continue to believe our growth will be driven more by volumes than price. And I think that's important as you think about the long-term risk position of the Company. As we look out over the next 5 plus years, we're largely be risked to our revenue goals. And I think we can achieve it regardless of price.  Putting that aside, as you think about it from a policy perspective, we're very willing to engage with the U.S. government in discussions about how best to achieve a goal of reducing the out-of-pocket costs for patients. That is our foremost goal. We actually recognize that need and are willing, and want, to work with them around that goal.  Understanding, we want to protect innovation, because we also want to be able to ensure we can bring the innovations for the next generation of patients that need them. I think the whole situation with COVID has shown why you want a robust and innovative industry because at the moment, you need it.  It's important that it's here in our country and we can invest and drive it. So that's our focus. But again, it's really about where it is that we can see reductions in out-of-pocket cost areas where they look either legislatively or otherwise, that don't shift any kind of savings to the patient in their pocketbook, we\u2019re opposed to. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Mara. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays, your line is open. Carter Gould : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the performance in China, you had a very nice quarter there. Was hoping to get a little bit more color on exactly what drove that -- the performance with GARDASIL, with LENVIMA.  I ask really in the context of your messaging around the GARDASIL performance you expect in the second half and the additional supply capacity coming online. So some color on those fronts would be helpful. Thank you. Franklin Clyburn : Yeah. Hi, Carter, it\u2019s Frank. Yeah, China grew very strong this quarter, I think it was 42% if you exclude foreign exchange. It was really driven by GARDASIL. Very strong growth as we mentioned and we anticipate that will continue as we move forward because of the significant number of patients and still the relatively small penetration that we have for GARDASIL in China.  So clearly we see opportunities there. I'd also like to highlight that we did see very strong growth, again within oncology, LENVIMA, Lynparza, KEYTRUDA grew very strong this quarter. So a number of our growth drivers, and in addition to that, we also are still seeing strong growth for Januvia in diabetes in China as well. So we anticipate that we'll continue to see growth. I think this ties very well to our strategy where we pivoted and focused more on our innovative portfolio of products for China and that\u2019s why we are very confident in the future growth within China. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Carter. We have time for one last question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Scala, with Cowen. Your line is open. Steve Scala : Thank you very much. Can you provide an update on the anti-IoT4 antibody? A number of new trials have been initiated recently. What is it that Merck sees in this target that is interesting? Thank you. Dean Li : Yeah, this is the -- IoT4 is a program that we\u2019re watching very carefully in our own pipeline. It is a program that was initiated by us looking at patient data from clinical trials with Pembrolizumab, and looking at those patients who are responsive, but more importantly, those patients who are not responsive and understanding what are possible mechanisms.  The other point that I would just empathize is IoT4 in some sense is a checkpoint inhibitor, but it is not a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor. And there's always been a discussion of whether another class of immune cells, such as myeloid cells, could be really important and so that's the second reason why we're very interested.  But quite frankly, the third point that I would make is all of that is interesting science and is a great hypothesis, but fundamentally, we have to have clinical trials that show that. We are advancing clinical trials for IoT4. And I think that the interest in other companies to follow our lead in IoT4 is based on the fact that they see us advancing it, and we believe that our data will support us advancing it. And we'll just have to see what that benefit is, but it is a highly differentiated first-in-class mechanism, not just in the molecule, but in the cellular approach of how we're attacking cancer broadly. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you Steve, and thank you all for your really good questions today. I\u2019ll turn it to Rob for some closing remarks. Rob Davis : Great, Thanks Peter. As we discussed today, hopefully what you get a sense of is that we do have significant opportunities for growth and value creation. I'm committed to make it happen and I know my team is as well, and importantly, we're confident we'll be able to do so.  Merck is a Company that matters. And as we think about that, we know we need to evolve, that we hold a special place in the world and we're committed to delivering for the patients who are counting on us.  And frankly to deliver the sustainable growth that I know our shareholders want to see and I'm confident we will do so. So I look forward to giving you updates on our progress as we move forward, and I wish you all to have a great rest of your day. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes this conference call, thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Q3 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir? Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Grace. Good morning. Welcome to Merck's third quarter 2021 conference call. Speaking on today's call, we will be Rob Davis, Chief Executive Officer. Frank labor and president of human health. Caroline Litchfield and Chief Financial Officer. And Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items.  You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2020, 10K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning, Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers prepared remarks. The presentation today's earnings release, as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm very pleased to report significant progress across our key growth and strategic priorities in Merck's first full quarter as a more agile and focused science-driven Company. We have strong momentum in our business. We've achieved notable clinical milestones, acted on a significant business development opportunity consistent with our strategy, and executed commercially to drive strong performance this quarter.  We're also working with diligence and urgency, which is reflected in the speed with which we were able to bring forward our investigational COVID-19 antiviral Molnupiravir and to rapidly file for emergency use authorization with the FDA. It's an exciting time at Merck, and we are determined to build on our recent successes as we pursue our mission to deliver innovations that save and improve lives and as we seek to create long-term value for both our patients and our shareholders.  Dean will speak to the significant pipeline advancements we are making in a minute. But I first want to congratulate him and our research colleagues, as well as our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics on the meaningful clinical results we recently reported regarding the development of Molnupiravir. From the onset of the pandemic, Merck has sought out opportunities to apply its scientific expertise in the global fight against COVID-19, and we are very pleased to now be in a position to make a meaningful difference.  As you are aware, at a planned interim analysis of our Phase 3 trial in at-risk, non-hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, Molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50% compared with placebo. Based on these results, and in consultation with the FDA, we stopped our trial early. We're now working with the FDA as the agency reviews our EUA application and we look forward to next month's advisory committee discussion. I'm pleased with the progress we're making to enter supply and purchase commitments with numerous governments and healthcare systems around the world and with the success of our efforts to rapidly build supply. I'm also proud that we will be positioned to provide access to patients around the world through voluntary license agreements, tiered pricing based on country affordability, and to our agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool. We've also taken a meaningful step towards augmenting our pipeline through business development, a key strategic priority.  The announced acquisition of Acceleron is a perfect example of our efforts to identify and bringing the strongest external science to supplement our own work. Acceleron's lead product candidate, Sotatercept, has the potential to become foundational as an add-on therapy in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension where there is a strong need for a new agent that can potentially address the underlying illness and not just the symptoms of this grievous disease. We look forward to the completion of our tender offer in the near future and to receiving the necessary regulatory approvals that will permit us to close the transaction. With its multi-billion-dollar peak sales potential and commercial exclusivity well into the next decade Sotatercept can contribute meaningful revenue growth in the KEYTRUDA LOE period, an important attribute of this and potential future targets. Dean and I will continue to work with our team to identify additional scientifically compelling business development opportunities, while also continuing to pursue our robust and growing internal pipeline.  Our business performed exceptionally well this quarter and the team continues to display superior and focused execution. We achieved very strong commercial and financial results with meaningful growth across our oncology, vaccines, and animal health businesses, and even greater growth in earnings. As expected, GARDASIL sales were particularly robust as we benefited from the sharp improvement in manufacturing output and availability of more doses to help address ongoing strong underlying demand.  We are confident that the momentum we are seeing will continue through the end of the year, setting us up for continued growth over the next several years. We remain focused on our efforts to transform the way we work by evolving our operating model to be leaner, nimbler, and more digital-enabled. My leadership team is fully aligned behind the need for Merck to work with more speed, urgency, and agility across all aspects of our business.  We must stay ahead of the evolving external environment to ensure we are able to make the significant investments required to deliver future innovations that will address unmet medical needs across the globe. In doing so, we aim to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients while continuing to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. Finally, I want to highlight the recent publication of Merck's environmental, social, and governance progress report.  This year's report highlights important updates on metrics and goals around our four ESG priority areas, which include access to health, our employees, including their health and safety, as well as engagement and diversity, environmental sustainability, and ethics and values. These ESG efforts are grounded in the core values that have always guided our mission and support our business strategy. We look forward to providing ongoing updates on these important efforts. With that, I will pass it to Frank to review the details behind our human health performance. Frank Clyburn : Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, the momentum in our Human Health business continued in the third quarter and we achieved 17% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We have continued to invest with urgency and patient activation programs that improve patient awareness and encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screenings, and vaccination rates. These actions while aimed at benefiting patient health also meaningfully benefited our largely physician administered portfolio in the quarter. In U.S., we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures remain at mostly normal levels. In oncology, while screening rates and diagnosis continued to improve, they are unfortunately still below pre - COVID levels. And this is impacting new patient starts. Outside of the U.S., our business performance remains strong despite lingering impacts from the pandemic in certain markets. Now turning to the Third quarter performance of our key brands, my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 21% to $4.5 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors, including growth from our recent launches, such as KEYNOTE-522, in neo adjuvant - adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer. KEYTRUDA is continuing to extend its very strong overall IO class leadership, improving new and total patient market share.  KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients despite continued competition. Outside of lung, key tumors contributing to growth include renal cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast, MSI High, esophageal, and head and neck. We're also excited by the recent approval, an upcoming launch of Keynote 826, which is a first anti PD-1 combination approved as a first-line treatment of cervical cancer. Outside of the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and the ongoing launches in head-neck and renal cell carcinoma.  We are continuing to see the opportunity to expand our reach into earlier lines of therapy materialize. We are very excited about the potential upcoming adjuvant launches of KEYNOTE-564 in renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-716 in melanoma. In fact, in the U.S. we expect over half of KEYTRUDA's growth to come from indications in early-stage treatment settings through 2025 and to represent roughly 30% of total KEYTRUDA sales by that time. Lynparza sales grew 25% and it remains the leading PARP inhibitor.  Growth was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including ovarian and prostate, and we look forward to the potential launch next year in a broader prostate population based on the PROpel trial. LENVIMA sales grew 30%. In the U.S., growth was driven by renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer. We're seeing very encouraging early trends from the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line renal cell carcinoma.  Outside the U.S., growth is reflective of increased demand following NRDL listing in China in March of this year. We're also excited by the recent approval WELIREG, for patients with certain VHL associated tumors. We've received very positive feedback from scientific leaders, providers, and patients about the benefits of WELIREG, which is off to a promising start and we are hopeful to extend the reach of WELIREG to broader RCC indications in the future. Our vaccines portfolio continued to deliver strong growth from GARDASIL, which grew 63% to $2 billion, and has grown 35% year-to-date. In the U.S., the increase in year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the timing of CDC purchases, which helped us overcome a below normal back-to-school season. Underlying demand for GARDASIL remained strong and we're seeing some benefits from recovery of missed doses due to the pandemic.  Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by strong under the outline demand in China, as well as increased supply and our ability to reallocate doses. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 15% driven by our ability to capture increased market share within the growing neuromuscular blockade reversal class. Turning to our outlook, the robust underlying demand for our products paired with our continued excellent commercial execution gives us confidence in the outlook for our business.  Merck has shown increased urgency and agility across our organization that has resulted in improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. On GARDASIL. We continue to expect robust ex-U.S. demand and increased supply to drive fourth-quarter performance. We expect to see more normal seasonality for GARDASIL with the third quarter reflecting the highest in sales. Our teams have been working to ensure we have the right processes in place to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly COVID variance continue to impact certain geographies.  These dynamics will drive very strong year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the fourth quarter, driven by ex-U.S. markets such as China. Given global HPV vaccination levels remain low, we continue to believe long-term growth opportunity for GARDASIL remains significant. And oncology, we are encouraged by our strong performance throughout the pandemic, with new launches more than offsetting the headwinds seen from reduced new patient starts.  We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio, including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and LENVIMA, and we'd expect to drive sustained growth across key tumor types and in earlier stages of disease. Next, let me provide a few comments on the outlook for Molnupiravir. As Rob mentioned, we are very excited about the potential to offer the first oral treatment option to at risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 in an effort to help combat the pandemic.  Merck is committed to providing widespread access to Molnupiravir globally and is implementing a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria. We have announced a number of supply and purchase commitments to date, and we continue to have discussions on similar agreements with customers around the world. We are also encouraged by the recent unanimous vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.  Upon adoption, as a final recommendation by the CDC, this sequence would offer patients the broadest coverage with a strong immune response against 0 types responsible for about 2/3 of invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults. As we think about our pneumococcal portfolio more broadly, we're excited about the potential opportunity for VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting, which represents a larger market segment.  To conclude, there is continued momentum in our business driven by demand and strong commercial execution and we are well-positioned as we move through the end of the year. The growth in the third quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and global demand for innovative medicines and vaccines, and we look forward to driving that growth long into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Our team drove exceptional financial performance in the third quarter. The investments we are making in our strong portfolio and pipeline, as well as in business development, are helping us deliver outstanding near-term performance, while also positioning us to continue to deliver important innovations and long-term value to patients and shareholders. Now turning to our third-quarter results.  Tesla Company revenues was $13.2 billion, an increase of 20% or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. As Frank highlighted, as Human Health business achieved improving momentum, growing 17%. Our animal health business also delivered robust growth with sales increasing 14% driven by strong global demand across both companion animal and livestock. Companion animal sales increased 18% driven by global demand in parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of product, as well as companion animal vaccine.  Livestock sales increased 12%, reflecting strong global demand for ruminant and poultry products, including our animal health intelligence products. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.8%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points, reflecting the favorable effect of product mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating expenses increased 11% to $4.7 billion.  This was driven by investments in our key growth pillars, particularly in supportive returns care activities and in our early and late-stage pipeline, including Molnupiravir. Other expense increased by approximately $200 million, reflecting higher pension settlement costs. The effective tax rate was 13%, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points driven by discrete items. Taken together, we earned $1.75 per share, an increase of 26%. Turning now to our 2021 non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic continued to impact many regions around the world, health systems and patients have largely adapted and we assume this trend will continue.  Our guidance assumes the Acceleron transaction will close during the fourth quarter, subject to the successful completion of the tender offer and regulatory approvals. And does not include potential sales or earnings from Molnupiravir. The underlying strength of our business enabled us to narrow and raise our expected revenue range to 47.4 to $47.9 billion, representing growth of 14 to 15%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1.5% using mid-October rates. Adverse margin is expected to be approximately 76.5%. We continue to expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate. In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $450 million. We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We assume 2.5 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are raising and narrowing our EPS range to $5.65 to $5.70, reflecting significant growth of 25% to 26%. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-October rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on, starting with Molnupiravir revenue.  We expect the global opportunity to be approximately $5 billion to $7 billion through 2022 including 0.5 to $1 billion expected to be realized this year. This assumes emergency use authorization in December. As a reminder, we will share any profit equally with our partner Ridgeback. Market responsible for recording global revenues and costs and will reflect the profit share with same cost of sales. For GARDASIL, we have had excellent momentum, driven by strong demand and benefits from the step function increase in supply we are achieving this year.  Fourth quarter sales will be lower than the third quarter due to normal seasonality and timing effects. However, we expect the growth in the quarter to remain very robust. Animal Health has had exceptional growth in the first three quarters of the year, driven in part by the pandemic effect on pet adoption and pet spending. In the fourth quarter, we will [Indiscernible] as we said, and we expect a more normalized year-over-year growth rate as a result. Our operating margin in the third quarter benefited from very strong revenue performance, including the normal seasonality of our vaccine business.  As we move through the fourth quarter, we expect operating margins to normalize due to this seasonality and phasing of spend. More broadly as we look out to 2024, we remain confident in our revenue potential and continue to believe it is underappreciated. And, we remain on track to achieve our 2024 operating margin target of greater than 42%. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in the business to drive the many significant net and long-term growth opportunities we see in our safe risk portfolio and rich pipeline. We also continue to execute on our business development strategy, including our announced acquisition of Acceleron.  We will pursue additional value enhancing and strategic business development opportunity. And we retained significant Balance Sheet capacity to do so. We remain committed to the dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, Merck continues to make exceptional progress on its commitment to drive growth and value for patients and shareholders. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength, which will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here to provide a summary of progress made since our last quarter call. I will provide an update on our oral anti-viral candidate Molnupiravir, highlight the proposed Acceleron acquisition, spotlight some recent progress with [Indiscernible] and finish with this synopsis of notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates from across the pipe block. The need for additional treatment options remains key and combating the COVID-19 pandemic.  Interim analysis from MOVe-OUT, our Phase 3 study evaluating Molnupiravir and at-risk, non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed an approximately 50% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death compared to placebo. [Indiscernible] grew day 29, no deaths were reported and patients who received Molnupiravir compared to 8 deaths on placebo. This is the first oral antiviral for respiratory virus to demonstrate benefit based on robust clinical outcome and the first to show a meaningful five-day window for therapeutic intervention after symptom onset.  Based on these positive results and as the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee and in consultation with the FDA, recruitment into the study was stopped early. In light of these findings and given the urgency to address the pandemic, our teams work tirelessly to submit a robust package to the FDA for EUA within 10 days of receiving data. We look forward to discussing the EUA submission at an upcoming meeting of the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committees scheduled for November 30th and [Indiscernible] Korlym, we continue to engage with the FDA to support its review.  Applications have also been submitted to multiple regulatory agencies around the world. I do wish to take a moment to thank the investigators, patients, and their families for their participation in the move-out study. I'm also grateful to our collaborators at Emory University Ridgeback, and Merck's internal teams with incredible work done in conducting this program during a very challenging time. A comprehensive vaccination strategy remains the best sustainable means to confront this COVID-19 pandemic.  Timely intervention following symptoms onset with an oral agent that can be self-administered at home may provide an additional meaningful option for patients, healthcare systems, and public health, which could make a significant and positive impact on the pandemic. Based on available viral sequence data, Molnupiravir showed consistent efficacy against the Gamma, Delta, and new COVID-19 variants. As a reminder, we continue to actively recruit participants in the MOVe-AHEAD trial, which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households as a post-exposure prophylactic with a planned readout in the spring of 2022.  Now, turning to the proposed Acceleron acquisition. Acceleron has an excellent scientific category, which had yielded an important treatment for Anemia and adult patients with certain rare blood disorder. Their lead clinical candidate [Indiscernible] has the potential to be a foundational asset as an add-on therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and provide a complementary addition to our growing cardiovascular pipeline. As such, following the close of the deal, our strategy would be to advance the wide-ranging Phase 3 clinical program.  Now onto the portfolio and pipeline starting with HIV. We continued to generate clinical data that reinforces the foundational potential is it's [Indiscernible] in HIV. At the European aids Conference in London this week, we presented data from the Phase II study evaluating the [Indiscernible] in previously untreated adults with HIV infections, which demonstrated continued maintenance of viral suppression through 144 weeks.  We also recently reported positive top-line results from two pivotal trials evaluating a once-daily oral regimen of [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible], and a switch setting, and adults with HIV infection who are virologically suppressed on other HIV therapy regimen. At 48 weeks, both trials met their primary efficacy endpoint for percentage of the participants with levels of HIV RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies per milliliter, demonstrating comparable efficacy with those receiving the comparator antiretroviral therapy.  We plan to present these findings in an upcoming medical congress and incorporate the data into global regulatory of medicine. This week we also announced the start of a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating a once weekly oral combination of the launch of beer and Molnupiravir Atlanta cap and people living with HIV who are for logically suppressed on an antiretroviral therapy. We have made great progress in our collaboration with Gilead and look forward to reporting our future development, including our long-acting injectable coal formulation.  Next, onto VAXNEUVANCE. We received a positive opinion for VAXNEUVANCE from the European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in individuals 18 years of age and older. And more recently in the US, the CDC's ACIP voted unanimously to provisionally recommend VAXNEUVANCE, followed by PNEUMOVAX as an option for pneumococcal vaccination in adults 65 years and older, as well as for adults aged 19 to 64 with certain underlying medical conditions with both patient population being studied in our clinical trial.  Vaccine performance is multi-dimensional and includes the listening a strong immune response, as well as providing coverage for important disease serotype. Our 2-dose regimen accomplishes the best of both by [Indiscernible] a robust immune response across the 15 sero -types VAXNEUVANCE, including serotype 3 as well as providing the broadest serotype coverage among current pneumococcal vaccine options of which 4 that are unique to PNEUMOVAX. Furthermore, VAXNEUVANCE as the most extensive clinical development program of the newly licensed PPV.  This includes completed or ongoing evaluation among those with certain chronic or an immune compromised conditions that increase affectability too, and severity of pneumococcal disease. We also announced positive top-line results for VAXNEUVANCE from the pivotal new [Indiscernible] study, evaluating immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability in the pediatric setting. NF submitted an application to the FDA. Evidence indicates the incorporation of serotypes 22F and 33F, as well as strong immunogenicity against serotype 3, has the potential to play an important role in the prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and children.  These 3 serotypes represent more than a quarter of all cases of invasive disease in children under the age of 5. We will present full results at an upcoming scientific congress. And finally, to oncology. The rich flow of data from our clinical development programs across tumor type continue. We maintain momentum in the development of new treatment options for women's cancer with the approval of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without Bevacizumab for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer based on data from KEYNOTE-826. This study showed a meaningful 36% reduction in the risk of death.  This is the first anti-PD-1 combination treatment option for patients in the first-line setting and together with our industry-leading Human Papilloma Virus vaccine, GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, we are uniquely positioned to address certain unmet needs in cervical cancer with a focus on both prevention and treatment. At ESMO in September, we presented final results from KEYNOTE-355, 355, our study of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for advanced triple-negative breast cancer, which showed a reduction in the risk of death by 27%.  KEYTRUDA is the only immuno -oncology agent approved in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This along with additional data presented across endometrial and ovarian cancers reinforces the remarkable progress being made in our broad women's cancer portfolio. We are also making inroads in new cancer types, including prostate cancer. With our partners at AstraZeneca, we announced positive results from the Phase 3 PROpel study for the frontline treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  This study demonstrated the Lynparza in combination with abiraterone significantly delayed disease progression regardless of biomarker status. Lynparza is a first PARR inhibitor to demonstrate clinical benefit and radio-graphic progression-free survival in combination with a new hormonal agent in this study. We are encouraged by this study and the potential to help the increasing number of men diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authorities globally.  Next, to renal cell carcinoma, which represents an important area of expansion. In August, we received FDA approval for [Indiscernible] a first-in-class HIF -2alpha inhibitor therapy for the treatment of adult patients with Bon FIFO Lindahl disease who required therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system, and Angio blastoma while pancreatic neuro -endocrine tumor not requiring immediate surgery. This approval provides a beachhead as we evaluate WELIREG potential in broader RCC indications and beyond. Also, in RCC in partnership with A5, following FDA priority review, we received approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA LENVIMA and the front-line setting based on results from a [Indiscernible] 518 trial. This brings forth an important new first-line treatment option for patients with advanced RCC. We are also rapidly expanding programs into earlier lines of therapy. During the quarter the FDA granted priority review for application for KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant therapy for patients with RCC at intermediate high or high risk of occurring following the effectively, or following nephrectomy in resection metastatic regions from the KEYNOTE-564 studies.  Additionally, we received priority review for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with surgically resected high-risk stage 2 melanoma, based on results from the KEYNOTE-716 studies that showed an improvement in recurrent pre -survival compared to placebo. Both of these studies demonstrate the benefit of expanding the use of KEYTRUDA to earlier stages of disease, allowing us to extend treatment benefits to more patients sooner. We look forward to decision on both studies by the end of the year. To conclude, I am proud of the progress across our broad pipeline, and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific progress in the future. Now, I turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Grace, can you please start the Q&A portion of the call? Operator : Absolutely. Peter Dannenbaum : And I'd like to ask the questioners to limit themselves to one question today in order to get to as many different questions as possible. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir. Umer Raffat : So, I will just ask on KEYTRUDA and adjuvant lung instead. Have you had an interim and does the stat plan allow for hierarchy where PD - L1 positives is first, and do you expect the benefit to show in patients that did and did not get adjuvant chemo? Thank you very much. Dean Li : Yes, thank you very much. I appreciate the question. First, I get want to elevate for just a second, we are excited by the emerging data, the role of PD-1 and PD - L1 in the early treatment in adjuvant space. For us, we are gratified that in renal melanoma, breast cancer is just [Indiscernible], there appears to be great effect and these are cancers where there are frequently employed methods for early screening. In relationship to lung specifically, we enjoy a dominant position in lung cancer and in lung cancer, the treatment of latter stage cancer is the predominant stage. As the data and you somewhat alluded to from other companies indicate that in lung cancer, the PD-1, PD - L1 class could be effective in early and adjuvant. In specific and relationship to, then we have a number of early and adjuvant stage lung cancers, and it was a [numerated then applied] (ph).  KEYNOTE-091 is also known as the PEARLS trial. KEYNOTE-091 PEARLS is a collaborative study with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and Merck is a collaborator on this trial. This is an event-driven study and we are in active communication with EORTC, and together, we are awaiting data from the [Indiscernible] before the end of the year. And I would hazard a guess that any public announcement from Merck would be announced at the beginning of the New Year. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you. Umer. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next up we have Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink, your line is open. Daina Graybosch : Hi, kind of maybe a 2-part question on Molnupiravir and how you're moving forward. The first is there's been some concerns publicly about the genotoxicity and I wonder if you could address the data you have that makes you not concerned about that and then the second concern is maybe with resistance and I wonder how you're thinking about the future and combinations and whether that will be needed to prevent any resistance, maybe from low compliance to Molnupiravir? Dean Li : Yes. Thank you for that question. This is Dean. I would just emphasize we are very confident in the safety profile of Molnupiravir based on our pre -clinical and clinical data. In relationship to the clinical data, I think most people recognize that in the interim analysis, we had a profound reduction in hospitalization and death -- or death compared to placebo. It was stopped early in -- by the guidance of the DSMB and in consultation with the FDA. In that interim analysis, the inter -- the incidents of any adverse effect was comparable in both Molnupiravir and placebo. And actually, if you look, there were fewer subjects in the Molnupiravir group who discontinue therapy due to an adverse event compared with the placebo group. In relationship to our confidence in the safety profile based on our extensive pre -clinical evaluation I think it's important to recognize that Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue that functions by creating [errors] (ph) in the genetic material of RNA viruses.  These nucleoside analogue are often used in many other antiviral treatments, including HIV and hepatitis. And we have done a comprehensive non-clinical program to characterize the safety profile of Molnupiravir. It's been written by other people. It's actually been written into scientific journals as well, and we will be presenting all of this data I believe in the AdCom that the FDA will be holding.  But, probably the most important pieces of information is that 2 distinct in vivo rodent mutagenicity assays, commonly called the Big Blue and the Big A, which are well-characterized and considered to provide a robust measure of the ability of a drug or chemical to induce mutations in vivo, in these studies we're administering Molnupiravir for longer and higher doses than those employed in the human clinical trial, and the totality of the data from these studies indicate that Molnupiravir is not mutagenic or genotoxic in these in vivo mammalian systems. Now, we have shared these results throughout with the regulatory agencies worldwide, and will continue to provide additional data as this process continues. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Daina. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next up, we have Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Baum : Questions for Frank on Molnupiravir. Just in relation to supply, it strikes me given some of the published improvements in manufacturing and full gram per patient dose. The 20 million looks like a very conservative estimate, given particularly the inclusion of third parties, what could be achieved given the dosing and the API. I'd like a comment, please, on where you think the 2022 real supply could be and second, perhaps you could just comment on the appetite of Merck to use direct-to-consumer advertising or other promotion on Molnupiravir. I understand that promotion and advertising is allowed under an EUA, if you could confirm or deny that would be great. Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Hey, Andrew, this is Frank. So, a couple of things that I want to highlight is first, we have a line-of-sight and we will produce 10 million of course this year, Andrew, in 2021. And as we have mentioned that we have line of sight and we will at a minimum double that in 2022. So, to your question, no, we're going to do everything we can to increase the supply for this product. In addition, we have voluntary license partners, you have seen, and we also have a number of partners that we're working with to provide global supply.  So, rest assured, Andrew, we're going to try to do everything on the supply front. On direct-to-consumer -- I think it's a little bit early for us on that. We have not made a decision around that. We are really focused on doing everything we can to sign up agreements with governments, get the product available globally. And we'll be providing additional information as we go forward, on Molnupiravir, but this is our number 1 priority for the Company and it's something that we're really looking forward to trying to help address the pandemic going forward. Rob Davis : Andrew, this is Rob and I just want to make sure because as I listen to your question, I think Frank hit it but just to emphasize in case others on the phone aren't catching this, the 20 million [Indiscernible] more than doubling what we can do next year. That is Merck's production. We are not including in any of those numbers the 8 voluntary licensed partners in India, nor anyone who the Medicines Patent Pool signs up. So obviously, global production of Molnupiravir will be significantly more next year, we were just speaking to what volumes we will produce within Merck. Dean Li : Let me just add one thing because I recognize that this question is also somewhat linked to the other question that -- and it relates to how we think about Molnupiravir scientifically in the pandemic's phase, and there's going to be an endemic phase. And potentially, there could be other phases after that. But for the pandemic phase, I just want to emphasize we have the move out trial, and then we'll have to see the potential in the move ahead to see whether we both have a treatment and a prophylaxis.  In the endemic phase, when the pandemic and what received, it's highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 will become an endemic infection, and we all have to recognize and that's related to the previous question during this phase, there will be a large reservoir of individual across the globe, with high copy numbers of virus -- viruses in many of these individuals that may lead to a constant brewing of variants. So, this question of resistance becomes very important. It is important to emphasize that Molnupiravir has an extremely high barrier to resistance. It has broad efficacy across all SARS-CoV-2 variants to-date and in our pre -clinical study and pre -clinical studies of others, it not only has a broad efficacy across SARS-CoV-2 variants, but a broad variety of RNA viruses. And probably the broadest than other -- than all other current mechanisms that we know being developed.  I should emphasize, this high barrier to resistance is critically important, both in the pandemic and the endemic phase, as has been highlighted. And I need to emphasize, for this reason, we prioritized Molnupiravir over other programs, including an internal protease inhibitor given the paramount importance we place on ensuring the highest barrier to resistance, given where we are in the world right now. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please, Operator. Operator : Thank you. First -- next we have Carter Gould from Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Hey, guys. I -- good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Unsurprisingly, I'm going to focus on Molnupiravir too. I guess maybe for Frank and Caroline. I'm just trying to understand exactly kind of what's baked into that guidance in terms of what's being distributed for next year between your supply crossing that with the -- to your point, the supplying sort of low and middle-income countries with through the MPP. I acknowledge that there's going to be tiered pricing, but it seems like you'd still becoming far short of distributing your full capacity. So, any color on that front would be helpful. Frank Clyburn : Yeah Carter, this is Frank. I'll start and see if Caroline wants to add anything. So, in our assumptions and in -- appreciate this is a very fluid situation. We do assume an early use authorization in December this year, and we are including the contracts that we already have in place as well as those that are underway.  So, we are comfortable with that $5 to $7 billion range through '22. And just to reemphasize, the number's based on the agreements we've signed, those in line of sight, and others that have high probability of execution. Couple of other things is we've mentioned, and Rob reiterated, we will produce 10 million courses of therapy by the end of '21 and are committed to at least doubling that in '22. Our focus initially for important that it's on treatment with COVID-19. You mentioned the broad global access which does come with global tiered pricing around the world.  That's an important aspect, that the pricing will be tiered based on affordability measures. If our post-exposure prophylactic trial is successful as Dean was highlighting with an expected readout in spring, there is potential outside to these estimates. Furthermore, throughout 2022, we do not assume to your question in all of the suppliers use. As such, we have the ability to fulfill additional demand. We also do assume that there will be other oral anti - viral in the market and we'll have to see how that unfolds and we'll look forward to providing you some additional detail and clarity is we want to earn more over the next couple of months. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Carter, next question, please, Grace. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Steve Scala from Cowen. Your line is open. Steve Scala : Thank you. Merck views its competitive position in Pneumococcal vaccines as strong, but ACIP did not appear to agree, viewing the cost benefit of the 20 valent as superior, even when assuming it was ineffective against 0-type 3. So where does Merck think ACIP errored, and how does Merck change that narrative? Thank you. Dean Li : First, we're very confident of our V1 for maximum events. There\u2019re 2 places that we're advancing. It's in adult and pediatric. As you know, the pediatric market and I'll let Frank speak to it is quite robust market and we're advancing our program. We have submitted to the FDA, and we hope to hear back from them in short order so we're very focused in the pediatric. In relationship to the adult, the critical issue for us in relationship to GARDASIL is that we -- as I said in the prepared comments,  I think it's very important to give the best coverage in terms of serotypes, but not just by immunogenicity, by actually studying clinical events, especially in those patients who are compromised or at risk or have some other condition that might increase their susceptibility to have invasive pneumococcal disease. And we think that clinical data and the way that we've studied it in these patient populations directly, we have not extrapolated from immunogenicity. We've actually studied it. It's something that's critically important as one looks at the true efficacy about vaccine. Frank, did you want to answer? Frank Clyburn : The only thing I'll add is actually we were very pleased that it was unanimous approval for the sequence of that events and PNEUMOVAX.A nd we need to feel as though that the sequence offers patients really with the broadest coverage with strong immune responses against several types that are responsible for 2/3 of Pneumococcal disease in adults, as well as the ACIP did highlight that the regimen was both cost effective as well as cost saving in the 65+ patient population. And then as Dean mentioned, we're also really excited about the opportunity for VAC events in the pediatric segment, which we believe is the larger market opportunity. So overall from our perspective, we feel really good about the ACIP recommendation. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Steve. Next question, please Operator. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Morning, guys. Thank s for the question. You touched on a little bit with Molnupiravir during the first oral, but how do you expect play out commercially versus the booster strategy for vaccines? Would you expect any more formal guidelines from CDC or other [Indiscernible] about how Molnupiravir fits into the algorithm? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : I'll maybe try this. Geoff, I apologize. You were kind of garbled. I'll repeat what I think your question was, and then you can clarify if I got it wrong. I think your question was, this is the first oral antiviral. But obviously, we continue to have out there vaccines that are important as really the first line, and do we think there is any discussion on how this will fit into the regimen. I don't think we can really comment on how advisory committees, the FDA or others, and the CDC would look at that.  But what I will tell you from our perspective, that first and foremost, people should be vaccinated. That it continues to believe what we think is the right answer. We see our therapy as something that is an important addition to the armamentarium. And obviously, there are places where people cannot get the vaccine or unfortunately as people get vaccinated and have breakthrough virus. So, there's definitely a need for this, but it is in collaboration as a complement to the vaccine and not in place of it. That's our perspective. We'll let the government speak to their own. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Geoff. Next question, please, Grace. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I'm just trying to get my hands around GARDASIL and the results in the quarter. So, can you clarify or quantify a little bit how much of the $2 billion in sales this quarter was stocking versus underlying demand? And maybe more broadly, are we still in a position where demand is exceeding supply, I guess on a global basis as we think about the recent capacity expansion?  And I guess I'm trying to get my hands around, will there be another step-up in sales for this franchise as we look out to 2023 and beyond with the new facility coming online or is the capacity efforts you've made so far addressing most of the demand that's out there? Thanks so much. Caroline Litchfield : So, Chris this is Caroline. I'll start and I'll hand over to Frank. So, in the quarter, as you note, we've had an exceptional quarter and that's driven by strong global demand and the step-up we have in supply. We also did benefit from CDC timing, and that was approximately 125 million of buy-in in the third quarter of this year. And that can trough to a buyout actually, in the third quarter of 2020. So, year-over-year, we feel we've benefited by approximately a 180 million to the results. Now in terms of how we see this going forward, we're very excited about the opportunity, We see opportunity for increased supply through '22 and beyond as we see the other capacity come online, but let me hand over to Frank to talk about the demand that we have. Frank Clyburn : Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. A couple of other things that I do want to highlight as you think about GARDASIL, and this is something we've been discussing for a while, is that both the near-term results, as you mentioned, with the long-term prospects. First, I want to highlight that only 9% of the -- we see the eligible cohort globally has been vaccinated. So, Chris, I'll start there and say this, we still have significant opportunity.  And if you think about markets such as China, if you think about the approval in Japan, if you think about the gender-neutral opportunities that we have in Europe, as well as other age cohorts in adult, mid-adult in the U.S. because we feel that there is significant opportunity for continued GARDASIL growth. As you saw, a step-up in our supply, we will continue to see that. It'll be a little bit more modest pace in next year, but rest assured as we bring on the 2 new bulk manufacturing facilities in '23. This is why we feel that the long-term growth prospects for GARDASIL, are very significantly. It'll to be a key growth driver for the Company going forward. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Chris, next question, please. Grace. Operator : Thank you. Next up, we have Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Tim Anderson : Thank you. Question on additional M&A. So maybe for Rob. On the Acceleron Investor Clay you held, I asked whether Merck would do more M&A even if it meant taking a rating debt downgrade. And you were very frank in your answer and you said yes. But the Company has not been willing to quantify what debt, additional debt that would potentially be that would trigger downgrade. My understanding is that another $10 billion cash deal would be enough to trigger a one notch downgrade. And if there's something like a $30 billion cash deal, that could be a two-notch downgrade. So, my new question here is, would Merck actually do the deal big enough to cause a two-notch rating downgrade? Thank you. Rob Davis : I appreciate the question. I would start more high level. Do we continue to pursue additional business development? The answer is yes. It will be driven as it has always been, based on what we see as a compelling scientific opportunity, where we see science addressing an unmet need that is strategically aligned with us and where we can bring value. So that is unchanged. As we look at capacity, I would just say, we believe we have the firepower to do, and frankly, any deal that's out there that we would have strategic interest in doing.  The balance sheet will not be a brake limiter for us; we have very strong balance sheet capacity. I don't think we want to get into trying to get specifics. Some of your numbers frankly, we're quite a bit off actually, but I don't want to start getting into those kinds specifically because it depends on rating agencies that depends on the target. Cash flow is coming from the target. So, with that, I think the important messages, Balance Sheet capacity is not going to build it 100 for us. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Tim, next question, please Grace. Operator : Next up we have Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Seamus Fernandez : Great. Thanks for the question. So just a quick one on the earlier stage pipeline, I'm a little surprised you guys are presenting your first oral PCSK9 inhibitor in a late breaker at AHA in 2 weeks. But it isn't included in your pipeline summary. Could you just help us understand why not? And just as a follow-up to that. When might we hear more about the earlier stage pipeline? Will it be at an R&D day in 2022? What's the right time to start showing a little bit more of the earlier stage pipeline that Merck's been building over the last 3 to 4 years via acquisition and then internally? Thanks. Rob Davis : This is Rob. Maybe I'll let Dean just comment specifically on the oral CPF, the oral PCSK9 than I can give a comment on the additional transparency question-and-answer. Dean Li : Specifically in relationship to the PCSK9, it is going to American Heart Association. It is slipping into Phase 2 and that's why we opening our pipeline leave it at Phase 2, but we're trying to demonstrate increased transparency by showing something that's about to enter that, the presentation at the American Heart Association, I think will be well attended. I think trying to create an oral PCSK9 has been a holy grail in the Cardiovascular field for some time and has not been achieved, and we believe we have achieved it. It is about that product, but it's also about the ability of Merck to do things that other people can't do. And when one looks at how we created that molecule, one can immediately ask yourself, wow, what is their capacity? What's that technology that allows them to do that for PCSK9? What other targets could they be doing as well? Rob? Rob Davis : Thank you, and as Dean highlighted, we turned our views as things move from Phase 1 into Phase 2. That's when we will start discussing it. So, this is just in that process and I would highlight what Dean did get into, but there's a lot of -- we've other assets and Cardiovascular space that are also either have moved or are moving into Phase 2. That's why we really see our Cardiovascular pipeline as a growing area of excitement and strength and why we were so excited about the complementary nature that Acceleron is to that pipeline.  And as you asked about the transparency, our intention, the next area we'd like to highlight is Cardiovascular, because I can tell you I'm excited about what we have. We've got a lot going on, but I don't think it's appreciated. Obviously, we would like to wait to see the Acceleron deal completed so we can include their assets in that discussion. And that'll come as soon as we can figure out when that will happen, either later this year or early next year. Beyond that, I was very pleased with what we did when we gave added visibility to our HIV pipeline, the excitement we have around [Indiscernible].  That's a foundational drug. oncology continues to have just multiple shots on goal, both with KEYTRUDA and a growing number of new mechanisms. We've highlighted that. And once we get past the Cardiovascular, I assume we will start to talk about our CNS portfolio because we also have a lot in the neurology space. I think it's pretty exciting. So, our view is to do it area by area as things start to move into the space to a realm. And we'll bring it forward as quickly as I can with the Cardiovascular being first once Acceleron has done. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Seamus. It's a little past 9. I think we have time for 1 more question. Next question, please. Grace. Operator : All right. Your last question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor. Your line is open. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question here. So, there are several players trying to bring lower-price checkpoint inhibitors to the market. Do you believe that these discounted pricing strategies will have any traction, why or why not? Thank you. Frank Clyburn : Hey Louise, this is Frank. I'll take that from a couple of different angles. I know there's been discussion there and I first want to make sure that we really continue to emphasize that oncology we see, is really data-driven, and the importance of strong clinical data, and I think you have seen that position as well, and also the wall of data that we've established with a product like KEYTRUDA, with 33 indications right now, and just the familiarity and the growth that we're seeing across so many different cancer types that I was highlighting, we feel we're very well-positioned.  We also think that the regulatory hurdle for new entrants increases with additional KEYTRUDA approval., And is positioned to contain you to gain experience. We think that also you would have to have a broader structural change would be required in the U.S. to adopt broadly. So, our view is we'll continue to monitor the competitive landscape as we always do, but we feel very confident in contributed and our growth prospects going forward. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, thanks, Louise. Rob, any final points? Rob Davis : Maybe just a couple of points. First, I want to thank and recognize our Merck employees across the globe for their hard work and dedication. With the pandemic the way we've been able to execute that really. I think shows the best of who we are and I couldn't be more proud across all elements of our business, clinically, commercially, manufacturing, it's really phenomenal, so I do want to first recognize them because I think that's important. And hopefully what you took from the call is this is an exciting time at Merck.  We really have growing momentum and I can tell you growing confidence that we have the ability to grow not only in the near-term, but a growing portfolio of assets that set us up to sustainably be an important contributor to human health and to continue to deliver significant value for our shareholders. We're more focused Company or a faster growing Company. We're working with urgency to achieve our mission and over for patients and shareholders. So hopefully that came through.  And I'm also quite pleased with the amount of progress we've made in a short period of time. You've heard today good developments across businesses, but development, good developments in delivering an incredibly strong quarter, moving fast with what we're doing with Molnupiravir. Great results coming with Islatravir and our broader oncology portfolio. So, we're firing on all cylinders and I am confident and proud of where we are and I thank you for your time Operator : Thank you, presenters. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. 2021 has been a year of significant achievements and meaningful progress for Merck in the face of what has been a challenging environment for all of us. We delivered on our strategic priorities and took important steps to set a foundation for success in 2022 and beyond. We achieved strong operational performance, accelerated our broad pipeline, including molnupiravir, completed the spin-off of Organon, and acted on key strategic business development activities. We enter 2022 with strong momentum, and are pleased to reflect this in our initial revenue and EPS guidance. We continue to evolve with a more focused, more efficient and faster growing company, with an increased urgency to bring forward innovations to address critical unmet needs. This remains the core of our strategy to benefit the patients we serve, and in turn, create long-term value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. Our business achieved strong revenue and earnings growth. Total revenues increased 24% in the quarter and 17% for the full year. Commercially, we have executed extremely well across all of our key performance drivers, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. We delivered initial molnupiravir shipments to customers around the world, and following the FDA Emergency Use Authorization that was granted in late December, made meaningful progress towards our commitment to the U.S. government. Our dedicated teams worked diligently, including through the holiday season, to deliver 1.4 million courses of therapy to the United States, United Kingdom and other countries by year-end. Throughout 2021, we invested in the discovery, development, production and commercialization of medicines and vaccines, furthering the long-term sustainability of our business, all while delivering meaningful operating leverage and strong EPS growth. In total, 2021 was a year of strong execution of our strategic priorities across all fronts : operationally, commercially, clinically and financially. As we look at 2022 and out to 2025 and beyond, we expect to achieve continued strong growth. Our oncology portfolio will benefit from the uptake of numerous recent approvals and the expected launch of many additional indications, including in earlier lines of therapy. Underlying global demand for GARDASIL remains robust, and further growth will be realized through the investments we are making to increase manufacturing capacity. And, our Animal Health business remains very well positioned to grow faster than the market, well into the future. Overall, we expect another year of strong revenue growth in 2022. While we will continue to make investments in our pipeline, we are confident that we can achieve a leveraged P&L and significant long-term operating margin expansion. Longer term, we are intensely focused on successfully navigating the headwind created by likely biosimilar competition to KEYTRUDA at the end of the decade. We aspire to grow through and beyond this period. But, at the very least, we will look to minimize the headwind and shorten the time it takes to return to strong growth. We have multiple levers to achieve this task, driving sustained growth well into the next decade. First, we intend to strengthen our leadership in oncology broadly and leverage that position for sustained long-term success. We\u2019ve done an excellent job of establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundational therapy, and we intend to maximize its opportunity and patient impact. In addition, we have an expanding portfolio of commercial and developmental oncology assets beyond KEYTRUDA, which offer meaningful growth opportunities beyond 2028. Second, we have many important franchises beyond oncology that we expect can drive durable growth into the next decade, including GARDASIL, which we believe can potentially double by 2030, as well as our pneumococcal portfolio and our Animal Health business, to name a few. Third, we expect to generate very strong cash flow, which we intend to deploy into value-enhancing business development to augment our pipeline and bring additional drivers of longer-term growth. And fourth, we will advance our internal pipeline and the opportunities we see in vaccines, cardiometabolic, neuroscience and other disease areas. We are making extensive investments in discovery research as well, which we believe will be the source of longer-term innovation. As part of our commitment to provide more transparency into these efforts, we will host an investor event focused on our cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline in the spring. In addition to accelerating our internal pipeline, as I noted, a key part of our strategy will be to deploy our cash flow towards the value-enhancing business development. We will continue to be appropriately aggressive in pursuing compelling external innovation. And we will supplement our pipeline with an approach that is science-led, but portfolio informed. Last year\u2019s acquisitions of Pandion and Acceleron are good examples of our approach. We are taking calculated risks and we\u2019ll continue to focus on creating value in areas of unmet need. We have the operational capabilities, financial capacity, scientific prowess and sufficient runway before the end of the decade for business development to play an important role in our goal of achieving long-term sustainable growth. While we have a strong track record of business development, we know we need to do more. Finally, we\u2019ve taken further steps to integrate important environmental, social and governance goals into the core of our business. In December, we completed the inaugural issuance of a $1 billion sustainability bond. We intend to use the net proceeds to support projects and partnerships in the Company\u2019s priority ESG areas and to contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. We\u2019ve also acted to accelerate global access for molnupiravir through our groundbreaking access strategy, including a recent agreement with UNICEF for up to 3 million courses of therapy to supplement supply available for distribution in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, this morning, we announced plans to host our initial ESG investor event on February 23rd. We believe that strong performance across key ESG metrics aligns well with Merck\u2019s core values and mission. And we look forward to providing insights into our commitment to this space. Now, before I turn the call over to Caroline, I want to take a moment to recognize Frank Clyburn. Following 14 years of significant contributions, Frank will be leaving Merck to become CEO of IFF. I want to thank Frank for the strategic vision and operational excellence he\u2019s provided in helping establish Merck as a global leader in oncology and for his strong leadership of our Human Health business. We wish Frank and his family all the best as he embarks on his new endeavor. While Frank will be missed, we are well positioned to continue our strong momentum with the deep and talented team we have in place, and we expect to announce new leader shortly. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Caroline to provide details into the performance of our business as well as our financial results and outlook. Caroline? Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2021 was a year of exceptional performance for our business. We drove robust top line growth of 17% and bottom line growth of 33%. Our teams performed with agility and executed with excellence, despite challenges from the ongoing pandemic. We are also very proud of the significant efforts to bring molnupiravir to patients worldwide. These results reinforce the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our outlook for strong growth. We will continue to invest in our portfolio and pipeline as well as in business development to maximize growth over the near and long term and to create value for patients and shareholders. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.5 billion, an increase of 24% or 23% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange. Molnupiravir contributed $952 million in revenue or 9 percentage points of growth. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its strong momentum, growing 23%, driven by our key pillars and contribution from molnupiravir. Our Animal Health business also delivered robust performance with sales increasing 8%, driven by companion animal products. Now, turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 16% to $4.6 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors and is benefiting from the recent launches in neo-adjuvant and adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and in cervical cancer. KEYTRUDA continues to extend its strong IO class leadership and maintain its position in non-small cell lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients, despite competition. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck and RCC. We continue to expand our reach into earlier lines. We were very pleased to receive two additional adjuvant approvals this quarter in RCC and in melanoma. With these approvals, KEYTRUDA has now received 5 indications in earlier-stage cancers. If approved, we also look forward to expanding into adjuvant lung cancer following the encouraging top line results from the KEYNOTE-091 trial. We are confident that along with strong clinical data, KEYTRUDA\u2019s reputation and familiarity among physicians will be a benefit as we move into early stage disease. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Growth of 33% was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including prostate. Our expected launch in a broader prostate population based on the PROpel trial represents a significant opportunity. Lenvima sales grew 31%, driven by RCC and endometrial cancer in the U.S. We have seen very encouraging early trends in new patient share following the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line RCC. We are also excited by the recent launch of WELIREG for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. WELIREG continues to generate strong interest among scientific leaders, providers and patients and is off to a promising start. We expect to extend its reach to broader RCC indications in the future. Our Vaccines portfolio again delivered strong growth, driven by GARDASIL, which grew 50% to $1.5 billion and nearly 40% for the full year. Outside the U.S., he U.S., robust growth was driven by strong underlying demand across all key geographies and particularly China as well as increased supply. This growth more than offset the decline in the U.S. due to timing of CDC purchases as well as the replenishment of the CDC stockpile in the fourth quarter of 2020. Also impacting HPV immunization levels was the prioritization of COVID vaccinations in younger age cohorts. Underlying global demand for GARDASIL remains strong, as it is increasingly being recognized as a vaccine that can help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both, females and males. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 24%, driven by increased usage of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and BRIDION\u2019s growing share within the class. Our Animal Health business delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales increasing 8%. Companion animal sales increased 26%, driven by global demand in parasiticide, including the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as vaccines. Recall that we experienced changes in distributor purchasing patterns, which negatively impacted last year\u2019s results. Livestock sales was flat, as strong global demand for poultry and swine products was offset by a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the recording of an extra month of sales relating to Antelliq in the fourth quarter of 2020. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 74.8%, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points. As a reminder, we share profits from molnupiravir equally with our partner, Ridgeback, which is reflected within cost of sales and reduces our gross margin. This impact was largely offset by favorable mix and lower discards. Operating expenses increased 3% to $5.3 billion as we continued to invest behind our growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $50 million. Our full year tax rate was 11.2%, which is lower than our prior guidance due to a more favorable mix of income and expense than previously estimated. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 4.3% reflects the impacts of the lower full year rate as well as foreign tax credit. Taken together, we earned $1.80 per share. It is worth noting that our underlying operating results were towards the upper end of our expectations and the contributions from molnupiravir and the favorable tax rate resulted in EPS that exceeded our price guidance. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. We believe the strong underlying momentum in our business will continue, and we will also benefit from increased molnupiravir revenues. We expect revenue to be between $56.1 billion and $57.6 billion, representing growth of 15% to 18%, including a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 74%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, driven in part by the addition of R&D expenses related to the Acceleron acquisition. In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $350 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 13% and 14%. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.12 to $7.27, reflecting growth of 18% to 21%. This range includes the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1% using mid-January rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on. First, on molnupiravir. We are excited by our regulatory authorizations to date and believe molnupiravir will be an important treatment option to combat the ongoing pandemic. We have announced a number of supply and purchase agreements, providing approximately 10 million courses of therapy. Based on agreements now in place, we are confident in our ability to achieve $5 billion to $6 billion in revenues in 2022, weighted to the first half of the year. Next, we expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, which would benefit from increased expansion in ex U.S. market and the continued ramp of recent launches globally. On GARDASIL, we continue to expect robust demand along with increased supply to drive strong year-over-year growth, albeit not at the same pace as in 2021. In the U.S., increased uptake in the mid adult cohort as well as catch up from missed doses due to pandemic will drive growth. Outside the U.S. we continue to expect strong demand across regions, particularly in China and from a relaunch in Japan. Global HPV vaccination levels remain low, and we continue to believe GARDASIL\u2019s opportunity for growth is significant. In pneumococcal, we are excited by the recent launch of VAXNEUVANCE in adults and the potential opportunity for approval in pediatric, which represents a larger portion of the pneumococcal market. We expect some offset however from the impact to U.S. sales of PNEUMOVAX23 as the market continues to shift towards newer pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We also expect to experience modest LOE pressure on JANUVIA in the second half of 2022, as we lose exclusivity in some of the larger ex-U.S. markets. For Animal Health, given our broad and innovative portfolio, we are well positioned to again drive above-market growth in 2022 and beyond. Finally, as we look out to 2025, we remain confident in our ability to achieve strong revenue growth, driven largely by our derisked portfolio and operating margins in excess of 43%. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to prioritize investments in our business and pipeline to drive near- and long-term growth. We also continue to augment our internal pipeline through strategic business development. We were active in 2021, including the acquisitions of Acceleron and Pandion, and we intend to pursue additional value-enhancing opportunities. We remain committed to the dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, our growth in the fourth quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and in the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength. And our continued execution will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dr. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. I will provide a brief summary of notable achievements in 2021 and then report on progress since the last earnings call. In 2021, we made meaningful advancements across our broader pipeline with approvals for new molecular entities, including VAXNEUVANCE, Verquvo and WELIREG, and an EUA for molnupiravir. We also made strides in women\u2019s cancers with U.S. regulatory approvals for KEYTRUDA in cervical, endometrial and triple-negative breast cancer. In total, we received more than 30 approvals and filed more than 20 NDAs and sBLAs in the United States, EU, Japan and China. In 2022, we look to build on this progress and momentum. I will now cover notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates for our molnupiravir, oncology, pneumococcal, HIV and cardiovascular programs. As we enter the third year of the pandemic, the Omicron variant continues to wreak havoc on our communities and health care systems. In the United States alone, we are now seeing approximately 2,000 deaths a day. Vaccines and treatment options have the potential to help combat this pandemic. Since the first authorization for molnupiravir by the UK in November, we have received authorizations in 9 additional countries, including an Emergency Use Authorization in the United States and a special approval for emergency in Japan. In addition, other countries have provided authorizations to our voluntary license holders. Findings from the MOVe-OUT clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of last year showed molnupiravir significantly reduced hospitalization or death in adult patients most in danger of progressing to severe disease. Importantly, for physicians and patients, approximately 90% fewer deaths were seen in those taking molnupiravir. These results reinforce that molnupiravir can provide an important oral treatment option for certain adults at high risk for severe illnesses. The Director of the United States CDC has indicated the need to prioritize therapeutic interventions for people with the highest risk of progression, such as those with certain comorbidities. We believe molnupiravir\u2019s low propensity for drug-drug interactions make it a meaningful and important option for appropriate patients with COVID-19 who are receiving treatments for underlying conditions, such as heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, and for those with impaired liver or kidney function, consistent with local recommendations. To date, this pandemic has consisted of successive waves of SARS-CoV2 variants, most recently, Omicron. Last week, we announced data from multiple independent studies indicating that molnupiravir is active against the Omicron variant in vitro. Each surge comes with distinct public health and disease characteristics and corresponding treatment and prevention challenges. The potential threat of rapidly emerging variants reinforces the need for treatment options with high barrier to resistance that target evolutionarily conserved aspects of viral biology. Recognizing the importance of an oral antiviral, we committed to manufacturing molnupiravir and have it ready for supply to patients within the U.S. upon emergency use authorization. As Caroline noted, we were able to fulfill that promise and ensure delivery of this important treatment. We are working with governments and partners around the globe to stay ahead of the curve and to further Merck\u2019s contribution in fighting this pandemic. Next, we continue to fortify our position in oncology. Several recent milestones highlight our strategy of targeting earlier-stage cancers where there is potential for improved outcomes by reducing risk of recurrence. We received FDA and European Commission approval for KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting for renal cell carcinoma and FDA approval for certain stages of melanoma. In RCC, approval was based on KEYNOTE-564. KEYTRUDA is the first and only immunotherapy treatment option for certain patients at intermediate, high or high risk of recurrence in the adjuvant setting. And in melanoma, the approval was based on KEYNOTE-716 and provides for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with stage IIB and IIC disease, following complete resection. Both approvals provide patients with important new options shown to help reduce the risk of recurrence. Similarly, we recently announced a positive finding from the KEYNOTE-091 or PEARLS study, evaluating KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage IB to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection. At an interim analysis, the trial met one of its dual primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival in all comers when treated with KEYTRUDA compared to placebo. The trial will continue to analyze DFS in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, the other dual primary endpoint, which did not meet statistical significance at the time of the planned interim analysis, as well as overall survival, a key secondary endpoint. We are continuing to make progress in women\u2019s cancer based on data from the Phase 3 OlympiA trial. The FDA granted priority review for Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negative, high-risk early breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy, either before or after surgery. We anticipate FDA action during the first quarter of 2022. Moving to the broader portfolio. The FDA issued a complete response letter for the new drug applications for gefapixant and have requested additional information related to the measurement of efficacy. There were no safety concerns for gefapixant. And we will continue with the FDA to discuss next steps as we look to address the significant unmet need in patients with chronic cough. In Japan, we are pleased to announce the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LYFNUA, the trademark for gefapixant for adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Momentum continues in our pneumococcal disease program, following the U.S. approval in July 2021, the European Commission VAXNEUVANCE in individuals 18 years of age and older in December. Also in December, we announced the FDA granted priority review of our supplemental application for VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting. Importantly, VAXNEUVANCE incorporates serotypes 22F and 33F up and provides robust response on other key disease-causing serotypes, like serotype 3, therefore, offering the potential to prevent additional invasive disease in children. We anticipate regulatory action in the spring of this year. Merck has a proud legacy of HIV research, and we remain committed to those impacted by this virus. Following the announcement of the FDA clinical hold for ongoing trials evaluating islatravir, we are working to understand the data and the principles of the finding. We believe in the potential of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase and translocation inhibitor mechanism for both the prevention and treatment of HIV. And we intend to share updates in the future. Looking across our broader pipeline. As Rob noted, in the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Acceleron. Its lead candidate, sotatercept, is an excellent complement to our pipeline and has the potential to provide a novel approach to treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. The integration is proceeding according to plan, and the Phase 3 program is on track. We plan to provide further details on our cardiovascular pipeline at an investor event in the spring. In closing, 2021 was a tremendous year where we demonstrated our ability to advance both our internal and external pipelines. We are well positioned to continue our momentum into 2022, with a dual focus : becoming the leading oncology company by 2025 and sustaining that position beyond 2028, while also extending our impact across other therapeutic areas. I look forward to providing further updates in the coming year. Now, I turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Grace, would you please start the Q&A? And we\u2019d like to ask analysts to limit themselves to one question this morning, in order to get to as many questioners as possible. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : I guess, one for Dean or for Rob. How strategically important is molnupiravir? Is the goal to maximize the revenue this year assuming that resistance doesn\u2019t emerge, or are you guys making investments in a potential combination to turn this business into maybe a longer contributor? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So, as we look at molnupiravir, we\u2019re obviously -- you heard from Caroline, the guidance we\u2019re giving for this year, but I think you\u2019ve hit upon an important point, which we do see the potential for molnupiravir beyond the current situation with COVID-19 and the pandemic, given the fact that it does have such good activity more broadly in mRNA viruses, and as we believe, it can be pan-coronavirus effective. And as we showed recently with six preclinical studies, working well against the Omicron variant, and we believe we\u2019ll continue to work against future variants. But maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Dean to expand upon what we\u2019re thinking about from a developmental perspective for longer term. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So, if I may, let\u2019s just frame how many deaths we have a day in the United States. I mean, it\u2019s quite staggering where we are at this point. Now, I would just emphasize molnupiravir is an oral drug as all know. It\u2019s effective in reducing hospitalization and death. And I really think when we think about the death rate in the United States and throughout, having access to medicines that can reduce mortality greater than 80%, 85%, 90% is going to be really important. And molnupiravir is one of such drugs that can do that. And I think that needs to be sort of emphasized throughout. Now, in relationship to molnupiravir directly, those people who we have to be concerned about drug-drug interactions or renal insufficiency or liver insufficiency are often those people at the highest risk. And the fact that molnupiravir has a profile that is really useful in those patients is important. I do want to emphasize that by first principle, the whole mechanism and the molecule is designed to be as variant proof as can be theoretically possible. And what we\u2019ve seen with the Omicron and potentially what we will see with other variants is that theoretical becomes real. With Omicron, for example, all of a sudden, there\u2019s a series of antibody treatments that are no longer effective. And then the other point that I would make is, when we sent our EUA in October, we also held hands that we would be able to produce, supply, distribute this drug immediately. And I think that\u2019s been shown that when we send our EUA in October, we were in that position. And we demonstrated when we got an EUA in late December how fast we could distribute. And I just want to emphasize that I think that when one looks at the death rate when we sent in our EUA and what the death rate now is, it\u2019s threefold higher. So, I just want to emphasize that. When you think about the future, I suppose there is different bookends with one can think through. And the different bookends would be, okay, maybe we could get a really lethal sub variant. Then that issue of us having a resistance profile that we\u2019re very confident about could be really important. The other possibility of a bookend is that this becomes sort of more endemic. So, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s getting it. It\u2019s not necessarily that lethal for healthy people. But in that situation, like in flu, it is the most vulnerable patients are the ones who need to get treated. And that most vulnerable population are often those people you have to worry about drug-drug interactions, renal and liver insufficiency. So, in that context with just COVID-19, that\u2019s how we think about molnupiravir. In relationship to your question about eventually, does the field have to really think about combination? I do think. And I do think it\u2019s important that we have an arsenal of multiple mechanism-of-actions, because in every viral disease that I know, the virus is pretty good at evading different mechanisms of action. And I think we may have to think about this combination issue that you\u2019ve talked about. And we have invested both in internal resources and other mechanisms of action. And we\u2019re in conversations with other people with different mechanism of action. So, the fundamental thing is I think we need to have a view that we need to be prepared that we\u2019re going to need multiple options, and molnupiravir is an important part of the arsenal that this -- the United States and globally will need to have. Caroline Litchfield : And if I may add, this is Caroline. We have guided to $5 billion to $6 billion of revenue this year. That\u2019s on the basis of approximately 10 million courses. To Dean\u2019s point, our company remains focused on ensuring there is enough supply depending on how things move forward. So, we are still committed to the 10 million courses we did manufacture in 2021 and more than double that in 2022. So, we will have in excess of 30 million courses to support how the pandemic and how the use of molnupiravir progresses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : On KEYTRUDA, important part of that leadership strategy is the adjuvant opportunity as both combinations with the adjuvant. Can you just comment a little bit more in terms of what you think you\u2019re seeing so far and how that\u2019s progressing? And with the combinations, it looks like the data is scheduled to read out more in the \u201824, \u201825 time frame. Dean perhaps, is there an opportunity that we might potentially be able to get a look earlier than then on any of the combination efforts? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Right. So, I just want to emphasize, there are two types of combinations that we have. We have an IO-IO combination, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to, in relationship to KEYTRUDA, whether it\u2019s with our TIGIT LAG3, CTLA-4 and that. And you\u2019re right, those readouts are event-driven and such. And that will be -- we\u2019ll see where it is, but I think your timing is a reasonable sort of timing in terms of Phase 3 readouts. In relationship to other combinations, I want to draw your attention to the combinations of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy, with other ADCs that we\u2019ve worked with other companies with. But I would also focus your attention also on the readouts of KEYTRUDA with Lenvima, that continue to spool up, [ph] and KEYTRUDA with Lynparza. And the reason why I think that\u2019s important is, we think about how to raise the immuno-oncology profile of KEYTRUDA with other I-O agents. But also, as we see Lynparza and Lenvima, they are -- they give us readouts of how to think about DNA repair and recombination in second and third generation of different sort of compounds in that place. And also, in relationship to Lenvima, where you\u2019re looking at blocking vascular endothelial growth factor, RTKs, it gives us a thought as to how to think of drugs such as WELIREG, which also plays in that sort of same sort of place. And so, we\u2019re very interested in seeing how WELIREG plays out in sporadic renal cell carcinoma. And then, we will ask ourselves outside of renal cell carcinoma where else should it play where an anti-angiogenesis agent has been shown to be effective. Rob Davis : Yes. And maybe, Chris, just to answer the first part of your question, how are we seeing the adjuvant space? Obviously, we are very excited about moving into earlier lines of therapy. We think this is a real area of growth. Obviously, the strength we\u2019re seeing in KEYTRUDA is about how we\u2019re able to expand into new indications and continue to broaden. If you look, we had just in 2021 alone 21 approvals of new or expanded indications for KEYTRUDA. Three of those were in the adjuvant space, with adjuvant, triple-negative breast cancer, adjuvant renal cell carcinoma and moving into a stage 2 cancer in adjuvant melanoma. So, important growth there. And if you look at that combined with the remaining other indications we already have and the other ones in adjuvant mel and what we hope to have soon with KEYNOTE-091 in adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer, we\u2019re looking at movement into the earlier spaces, driving approximately 50% of the growth for the drug for KEYTRUDA through 2025. And we think by 2025, it will be about 30% of our total revenue coming from the adjuvant indications we have. So, this is an area where we\u2019re starting to put runs on the board. And I think we\u2019re going to show that the breadth of what KEYTRUDA could do both in maintenance as well as in the metastatic space is going to be very important as we build the leadership for the long term. Peter Dannenbaum : And to be clear, Rob\u2019s referencing the U.S. markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve Scala : I\u2019d like to ask about a more obscure pipeline agent. Sanofi believes that there is no discernible evidence of benefit of the Merck RSV monoclonal antibody versus the Sanofi monoclonal antibody, and that Sanofi is so far ahead that Sanofi unquestionably will dominate. So, I\u2019m wondering what Merck thinks. And if you disagree with Sanofi, then why is your antibody better than theirs? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. I want to be a little bit careful that I\u2019m answering questions about another company\u2019s drug. I think that having monoclonal antibodies that can treat RSV in a really important patient population is critical. We have data that will be coming out, and we\u2019ll have to see what that data looks like. But we do think that there is opportunity to have a really effective drug that really is easier to provide to that patient population. So, I\u2019m a little bit hesitant to comment directly. But we are very confident in the profile of our RSV antibody studies, and we will just have to see what the clinical data looks like as the clinical data comes through. Operator : Next, we have Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Jon Miller : Hi, guys. This is Jon Miller on for Umer. Thanks so much for taking the question. On islatravir, is there -- obviously, the long duration and the long PK here is a major selling point. But is there any chance to avoid CD4 monitoring or maybe to get around some of the potential product issues that you\u2019ve been looking at or evaluating. If you stick to sub milligram daily dose rather than trying to push for the weekly or monthly doses, is that a potential path forward for islatravir in the HIV franchise? Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So, let me take that. So, we are evaluating a considerable body of data. You mentioned trends of lymphocytes that have been observed in different trials that we\u2019ve had. I would point out that our Phase 3 with islatravir doravirine demonstrated the efficacy and just the highly efficacious nature of islatravir in that combination, which is QD. We will have a near-term evaluation of the future options, but we are still very committed to this longer acting sort of point of view as well. So to get to your question, we have data in relationship to QD islatravir, doravirine and it\u2019s highly efficacious. We are going to look at the body of data in relationship to are there ways to continue to make that long sort of resident time, be able to have a less frequent either prep or a treatment. And we\u2019re evaluating that data as we speak. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein from Mizuho. Mara Goldstein : I\u2019m wondering, in the last couple of weeks, there have been a number of comments made by some of your competitors around valuations in M&A. And since you did discuss acquisitions as part of strategy, I\u2019m wondering if you could maybe opine as well as to where you think valuations are relative to the overall strategy of continuing to supplement the Company\u2019s pipeline? Rob Davis : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mara. So, as you pointed out, we are seeing in the biotech space, valuations have pulled back quite a bit of late. I think it\u2019s too early to see whether or not this is a permanent rebasing in the market or if it is just a temporary change in the marketplace. We need to see how that plays out. And the other thing that\u2019s going to be important is what happens with the investment flows into the space. You are seeing IPOs start to slow. And it would be interesting to see if cash investments start to also slow down as people look to invest into the space with a lower valuation in the market, as you point out. Whether or not that drives to sellers being willing to see the restatement of value that will allow us to do deals at different levels, we\u2019ll have to see. But it doesn\u2019t change the importance we see of doing business development for the Company. Obviously, we\u2019re very focused, first and foremost, on driving and accelerating our own pipeline, but we know we have to augment it. And we are going to continue to focus in this area, and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re going to find the opportunities where the scientific opportunity match to our capabilities and where we see good value, will allow us to do value-enhancing deals regardless of the market situation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : This is Adam on behalf of Tim Anderson. On your oral PCSK9 program, you say that you\u2019re going into Phase 2 in 2022. Assuming that this takes two years to wrap up, what would a Phase 3 trial look like in terms of length and comparator? Guessing that this might not take until the late 2020 to report out. Thanks. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. Thank you for that question. So the question is about our oral PCSK9 drug. We presented the Phase 1 sort of readouts in relationship to that. The Phase 2 readouts will be very important. As everyone recognizes, cardiovascular risk is just a tremendous risk throughout. It\u2019s actually -- you could view it as an epidemic that continues. And there will be two sort of important considerations to take. One is, as we advance the oral PCSK9, the biomarker of reducing LDL is a powerful biomarker that has been established as an important biomarker that has provided a path for registration based on that, even prior to having sort of readouts in terms of cardiovascular outcomes in terms of death and heart patient end points. So, we believe that we\u2019re going to have to do both. But we\u2019re very eager to see how well this agent works in our Phase 2 trials in driving the levels of LDL down. And that will give us the confidence to really advance this for patients. But again, driving the LDL down will be an important registrational point that has been a path for other drugs as well. But we will also have to do outcome study in addition to that. Operator : Next up, we have Matt Harrison from Arris. [Ph] Unidentified Analyst : This is Charlie Young for Matthew. Thanks for taking the question. Can you provide, in terms of your launch expectation of VAXNEUVANCE this year and perhaps even next year, especially after the pediatric indication approval? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. So, obviously, we\u2019re very excited about what VAXNEUVANCE, the opportunity that this presents, starting with, as you point out, the adult indication, which we received. And as you probably know, we did do the MMWR come out and validate the ACIP recommendation. So we\u2019re at a point now where reimbursement is established in the marketplace, and we are beginning to ship product. As we look at this, we see a real opportunity, because if we look at what is the profile of VAXNEUVANCE in combination with PNEUMOVAX23, you\u2019re looking at an agent that has the broadest coverage. Between the two, we have 15 serotypes in VAXNEUVANCE. We\u2019re adding 9 additional serotypes, 4 which are unique to PNEUMOVAX23. And as we look at the coverage, obviously, in things like serotype 3, we showed with VAXNEUVANCE that we are very competitive, if not superior to competition in the marketplace. And we know that serotype 3 is an important contributor and driver of disease, as is serotypes 22F and 33F, which are in ours as well. So, as we look at it, you\u2019ve got very broad coverage. You\u2019ve got important coverage in high disease-causing serotypes. And we have important data showing how the drug works in at-risk and immunocompromised patients, which will be in the label -- is in the label. So, we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019re going to have to obviously fight it out at the commercial level, but we think we\u2019re well positioned to do that. And we already are starting to look forward to what we see in the pediatric space. Right now, hopefully, we\u2019re going to see -- with the PDUFA in April, we\u2019re going to see hopefully the opportunity to get that drug into the marketplace. But obviously, we\u2019re going to build on the momentum from the launch in adults to then carry that forward into the pediatric setting. So, so far, all started well, good contracting underway, and we\u2019re off to a good start. Thanks. Operator : We have Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : A question on islatravir. Are you in a position to disprove mitochondrial toxicity as the cause for the lymphocyte compression, or would you file for approval for the once-a-day combination if you have no clear line of sight on a longer dosing period formulations? Dr. Dean Li : You broke up just a little bit. In relationship to the mechanism by which the lymphocyte trend that we disclosed is going down, we\u2019re looking at the mechanism of action. I would say just two brief points. One is, there\u2019s a question of whether or not there are ways to get around it by looking at the dose that was provided. And then, the second sort of question is the mechanism. The mechanism, we\u2019re still evaluating. I believe your question was in relationship with mitochondrial toxicity. That does not list as the first place that we would go in relationship to the data that we have right now. But I don\u2019t want to rule out anything right now, as we\u2019re evaluating all the data as we speak. Operator : Next, we have Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise Chen : So, I want to ask you if the headlines about the logistical obstacles for oral antivirals, how accurate are they? And if they are, how are you working through them? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. I appreciate the question, Louise. So, if you look at the situation, and I think you\u2019re probably focused mainly in the United States, we are in a situation where we did deliver to the United States doses of courses of therapy before the end of the year, a little over 900,000 courses of therapy were delivered to them. Since then, we continue to add to that. And by the end of this week, we should be to the full 3.1 million courses delivered to the distribution hubs that they have. Obviously, at that point, it\u2019s us working with the government. But it\u2019s up to the government on where and how they distribute it from the hubs out into the pharmacies and the local markets. I think, the real thing we\u2019re focusing on in discussions with the government is how do we increase the messaging to help people understand how they can find out where they can go to get to antivirals. And there\u2019s locator sites that the government has on the web. And we\u2019re trying to make sure as much as we can to help people know to go look there, because the drug is in the marketplace, you just have to be able to find out where to go find it. And we will continue to partner with the government any way they need to ensure we can get access as quickly and as affordably as possible. Obviously, we\u2019re very focused beyond the U.S. as well, and I feel very good about what we\u2019re doing. You probably saw we announced that we had a deal with UNICEF for 3 million courses. Now, that really us trying to help make sure we could accelerate access to the low and middle income countries as we wait for the generic manufacturers, so we have the licenses with as they ramp up production. So hopefully, that will help fill in the gap in those markets as we wait for the generics to be able to ultimately come on line. Operator : Next, we have Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink. Daina Graybosch : I\u2019m going to go back to KEYTRUDA in oncology and IO combination. So, we\u2019re going to see this year, I think, multiple randomized readouts of TIGIT from Roche. And I think as somebody mentioned earlier, you guys have multiple trials of TIGIT and LAG3 coming in the future. I wonder if you could talk to how your development strategy could be differentiating for these IO-IO combinations. In particular, can you highlight anywhere where your base position of KEYTRUDA may give you an advantage? Dr. Dean Li : Let me take the scientific question in relationship to that. So, thanks for that question. I would emphasize just the general principle that we have, which is we believe that there are ways to improve the immuno-oncology sort of access of PD-1 by adding another checkpoint inhibitor. We believe that that is going to be potentially a different checkpoint inhibitor or a different addition to PD-1, given a different tumor cut. So, we\u2019re not so sure that there is one additional checkpoint inhibitor that you could add to PD-1 that would have as broad of a impact as P1 has itself. So, our strategy has been to invest in CTLA-4, to invest in TIGIT, to invest in LAG3, to invest in ILT4. I think the strategy of some of our other colleagues is to place a larger bet on each of those combinations more broadly. So I think that\u2019s something that I think is really important. The second point that I would also emphasize is you want to show contribution of components. And you want to show that what you\u2019re added on to the PD-1 is really better than the PD-1. And the reason I want to emphasize that is that one should also look at what the base of our PD-1 response is compared to others in relationships. So, it is my belief that targeting the PD-1 axis is, in general, more effective than, for example, a PD-L1. So, that gives us a distinguishing position as well. And then the third issue is, especially in lung, where physicians are very comfortable in relationship of where we stand in relationship with PD-1, with our PD-L1 monotherapy sort of differentiation as well as PD-1 plus chemo in relationship. And also, we\u2019re driving our PD-1 into earlier stages of cancer, for example, in lung and others. I think that gives us sort of a leg up as well. So, three things : One is, how we think strategically about IO-IO combinations; and then, the second sort of thing is, in relationship PD-1 versus a non-PD-1 sort of position, so PD-1 versus a PD-L1; and also, our ability to sort of paint the whole from adjuvant all the way to later stage is something that I think gives physicians enormous comfort in our base drug. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Daina. And thank you all for your good questions today. We realize there is a peer call starting right now, so we want to be mindful of that. If you have any follow-ups, please reach out to the IR team at any time, but we appreciate the good questions today and your interest. Thank you. Rob Davis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",

Q1 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Grace, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2022 conference call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these items from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers' prepared remarks. The presentation, today's earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. Before I get started, let me take a moment to speak about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. We're hopeful for an immediate and peaceful resolution to the Russian and Basin of the country, and we support the Ukrainian people and stand with them, and recognize what a terrible tragedy this represents. Merck is making every effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and to ensure essential medicines and vaccines continue to reach patients. In addition, we are dedicating meaningful resources to address the humanitarian crisis in the country through multiple channels. Turning to our business. We continue to deliver across our key strategic priorities in the first quarter. We're sustaining the strong business momentum we delivered in 2021 with robust top and bottom line growth. We've also achieved significant clinical advancements across our research pipeline and successfully integrated Acceleron. Now moving to our results. We've had a strong start to 2022, achieving very strong top and bottom line growth. Commercially, we continue to execute well across a broad set of key growth drivers most notably, KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. Our performance reflects robust underlying demand for our derisked innovative portfolio and reinforces the importance of our science-led strategy. LAGEVRIO, our COVID-19 antiviral treatment, was a significant contributor as well. But even excluding these sales, our top line growth was still overtly 19% versus last year. On LAGEVRIO, we've accelerated broad global access, and it's now established as an important tool for patients and health care providers to address the ongoing pandemic. Since receiving emergency use authorization in December, we've delivered approximately 6.4 million courses to more than 30 countries. The success we are achieving is reflected in our updated 2022 guidance, which demonstrates our expectation for another year of strong growth and overall business momentum. Our oncology business is benefiting from the continued rollout of new and important indications, including in earlier lines of therapy. Global demand for GARDASIL remains strong and growth will benefit from increased supply as a result of the significant investments we are making to expand manufacturing capacity, and our Animal Health business remains positioned to grow at above market rates. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion through 2025. We're preparing for the post KEYTRUDA LOE period by continuing to strengthen the levers we have and building upon them in order to deliver long-term growth. In oncology, we remain committed to building on the foundational position that we have achieved with KEYTRUDA and we aim to expand our presence in this key therapeutic area and to establish an enduring leadership position. In addition, we'll continue to maximize the opportunities we see for our durable growth drivers, such as GARDASIL, our pneumococcal portfolio and Animal Health through our proven commercial execution. Beyond our existing portfolio, business development remains a key priority. We remain highly focused in our pursuit of the best external innovation and will be appropriately aggressive when great science and value align. We have a strong track record of business development, but we know we need to do more. And we believe we are well positioned to quickly deploy capital towards the right strategic assets as they present themselves. And finally, we'll continue to advance our broad pipeline across key therapeutic areas in order to deliver medically important innovations to patients. We've taken important steps to provide increased transparency into the opportunities we see in our portfolio and our business, including through two recent investor events. Earlier this month, we provided a detailed description of our growing cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline. And Merck, we're focusing our efforts where the needs are greatest and where we have the best opportunity to positively impact patients' lives, including in heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombosis and atherosclerosis. We've made significant advancements across our CV pipeline and believe our broad differentiated portfolio can have meaningful impacts on patients' lives with at least eight potential new approvals by 2030. We're confident that these important innovations have the potential to be meaningful growth drivers for Merck well into the next decade. And in February, we hosted our inaugural ESG event which highlighted our activities in our four priority areas of access to health, employees, environmental sustainability and ethics and values. Our ESG efforts are grounded in our company's values and we look forward to building on Merck's legacy of operating responsibly going forward. Before I close, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Roy Baynes, who has announced his retirement after eight years at Merck. Roy has been instrumental in helping Merck become a leading oncology company, particularly through his leadership in the development of KEYTRUDA. We wish Roy the best in his future endeavors and we're confident that he leaves behind an outstanding team and program. I'm pleased to report that Dr. Eliav Barr was appointed to succeed Roy. Eliav not only has deep experience having served in several research capacities throughout his more than two decades at Merck, but also has an unwavering commitment to patients consistent with Merck's purpose to save and improve lives. In summary, we've begun 2022 with strong operational momentum, and I want to express my sincere thanks to our employees worldwide for their continued folk commitment. We remain confident in our fundamental strategy, our growth prospects and in our ability to deliver significant benefits for patients and value to shareholders well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we have had a very strong start to 2022 with exceptional performance in both revenues and earnings. These results further demonstrate that our focus on science and innovation at the core of our strategy, enabled by excellent execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe, is delivering value for patients, customers and investors. Total company revenues were $15.9 billion, an increase of 50%. LAGEVRIO contributed $3.2 billion in revenue. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the base business delivered very strong growth of 19%. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business continued its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the human health business grew 21% driven primarily by our key pillars as well as the reduced impact of the pandemic. Our Animal Health business also delivered above-market performance with sales increasing 9% driven by growth across both companion animals and livestock segments. Now turning to the first quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 27% to $4.8 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand and the expansion into new indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate strong growth across all key tumors and is benefiting from recent launches in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA is currently approved to treat five indications in earlier stage cancers, and we are excited about the potential opportunity to expand into adjuvant lung cancer based on the encouraging data from KEYNOTE-091. We continue to be confident that KEYTRUDA's robust clinical data, combined with physicians' familiarity and experience with the product, will support expanded use and patient benefit in early-stage disease. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA's growth continues to be driven by lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Our alliance revenue grew 20%, driven by uptake in metastatic breast cancer. We are also excited by the expanded opportunity in early stage breast cancer, following the recent FDA approval based on the OlympiA study. Further, we look forward to potentially reaching a broad prostate population based on the PROPEL study. Lenvima alliance revenue also had very strong growth driven by uptake following the launches of KEYNOTE-581 in advanced renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-775 in metastatic endometrial cancer, where we are seeing encouraging new patient share trends across each of these tumor types. Lenvima growth also benefited from increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma in China and certain onetime items. We are also excited by the launch of WELIREG for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. WELIREG continues to generate strong interest among scientific leaders, providers and patients. Although still early in its launch, WELIREG has had strong uptake, providing a treatment option to the significant unmet need for these patients. We are working to potentially extend its reach to broader RCC indications in the future. Our vaccines portfolio again delivered excellent performance led by GARDASIL, which increased 60% to $1.5 billion. Outside the U.S., significant growth was driven by strong underlying demand across key geographies and particularly in China as well as increased supply. In the U.S., sales increased due to the timing of CDC practices. Global demand for GARDASIL remains robust support strong clinical and real-world data as well as efforts to increase the recognition of GARDASIL as a vaccine that can help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both females and males. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 20%, driven by the ongoing recovery in surgical procedures during the quarter and continued strong leadership of the neuromuscular blockade reversal agent class. Our Animal Health business delivered another quarter of robust growth, with sales increasing 9%. Companion animal sales increased 13%, driven by global demand in parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of products as well as vaccines. Livestock sales increased 7% due to higher demand in ruminant and poultry. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 70.7%, a decrease of 5.9 percentage points, driven primarily by higher LAGEVRIO sales. As a reminder, we share profits from LAGEVRIO equally with our partner Ridgeback, which is reflected within cost of sales and reduces our gross margin percentage. Gross margin this quarter also reflects favorable impact of product mix, offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating expenses increased 7% to $4.8 billion as we continue to prudently invest behind our growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $140 million. Our tax rate was 14%. Taken together, we earned $2.14 per share. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. As a reminder, at the request of the SEC, certain companies in our industry, including ours, have made changes to non-GAAP reporting. We will no longer exclude significant expenses for upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements as well as transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions from non-GAAP results. As a result, $1.7 billion of R&D charges primarily related to the acquisition of Pandion are now included in our recast 2021 non-GAAP results. This increased R&D expense by $1.7 billion and decreased non-GAAP EPS by $0.65. There was no impact to the first quarters of 2021 and 2022. Our 2022 guidance does not assume any significant transactions that would have previously been excluded from non-GAAP. So this could change in future quarters if we execute business development which is a strategic priority. The underlying strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $56.9 billion and $58.1 billion, representing growth of 17% to 19% or 11% to 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and the impact from foreign exchange. The projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of approximately $200 million using mid-April rates, resulting in a full year negative impact of just over 2%. We are increasing our gross margin expectation to between 74% and 74.5%. We expect operating expenses of $20.3 billion to $21.3 billion. At the midpoint, this is consistent with what was implied by our prior guidance. We expect other expense of approximately $350 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 13.5% and 14.5% due to an increase in estimated U.S. taxes to be paid on foreign income. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we have increased our expected EPS range to $7.24 to $7.36, representing pull-through of the operational strength from our key pillars and operating expense leverage, offset in part by a slight reduction in the top end of our LAGEVRIO sales assumption, the increase in our tax rate and an incremental 1% headwind from foreign exchange using mid-April rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on. First, on LAGEVRIO, we are narrowing the range of our full year guidance to $5 billion to $5.5 billion. We have entered into supply and purchase agreements for approximately 10 million courses of therapy. Since authorization, we delivered 6.4 million courses of therapy, including 5 million in the first quarter. We expect approximately half of the remaining full year revenue from LAGEVRIO in the second quarter. We continue to expect strong annual growth for GARDASIL, especially in ex-U.S. markets, including China. Finally, as a reminder, our other revenue line contains several items, including supply sales to Organon, which we began recording upon the completion of the spin-off last year and to Johnson & Johnson for its COVID vaccine. Also included are our revenue hedge and royalties. Other revenue in the first quarter also benefited from approximately $100 million in receipts relating to out-licensing agreement. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to prioritize investments in our business and pipeline to drive near- and long-term growth. We will continue to be appropriately aggressive in augmenting our internal pipeline through strategic business development, and we intend to pursue additional value-enhancing opportunities. We remain committed to the dividend with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent, we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, we remain very confident in the growth of our business, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We are in a position of financial and operational strength and our continued execution will enable us to deliver value to patients and our shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dr. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. It is good to be here to provide an update on our progress. In the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate progress in our pipeline. We made advances across multiple therapeutic areas including oncology in both advanced and earlier stages of cancer as well as in cardiovascular disease and vaccines. I will also provide an update on LAGEVRIO. In oncology, we continue to build upon our strong position and execute on our strategy to expand, deepen and extend benefits to patients and diversify our imprint on cancer. This past quarter, we achieved milestones from several tumor types as well as different stages of disease. Notably, we continue to expand our treatment impact in earlier stages of disease where we now have six approvals from the FDA, five for KEYTRUDA and one for Lynparza. At the European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual plenary session last month, data from the KEYNOTE-091 or PEARL trial, evaluating KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage Ib to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection were presented. At an interim analysis, KEYTRUDA has significantly improved disease-free survival in all comers, one of the study's dual primary endpoint. The trial will continue to analyze the other dual primary endpoint of disease-free survival in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, which did not meet statistical significance at the time of the planned interim analysis. These latest data provide a strong signal for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant treatment study. Additional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer include KEYNOTE-671, which is evaluating neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy for patients with resectable 2, 3A and 3B disease; KEYNOTE-867, which is studying stereotactic body radiotherapy with or without KEYTRUDA in adults with unreflected Stage 1 HER2 disease, and PLN12 where we are studying KEYTRUDA in combination with Lynparza in Stage 3 disease. Following the approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma following complete resection based on KEYNOTE-716, we announced that at a prespecified interim analysis, the study also met its secondary endpoint of distinct metastasis-free survival and showed continued improvement in recurrent free survival compared to placebo. The data from KEYNOTE-716 reinforces the evidence for KEYTRUDA as adjuvant therapy for appropriate patients with Stage IIB and IIC following surgery that help prevent recurrence of disease. Now similarly, in the earlier-stage setting, along with AstraZeneca, we announced Lynparza was approved by the FDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with germline BRCA patients with HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy either before or after surgery based on the OlympiA study. Further, in women's cancer, we received FDA approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with microsatellite instability high, or mismatch repair deficient advanced endometrial carcinoma based on new data for KEYNOTE-158. Now this approval is a fourth gynecologic cancer approval for KEYTRUDA and marks the fifth approval derived from the KEYNOTE-158 trial, an innovative trial designed to evaluate the use of predictive tumor biomarkers in patients receiving KEYTRUDA for advanced solid tumors. Next, the prostate cancer. Along with AstraZeneca, positive results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancer Symposium for the PROPEL trial evaluating Lynparza in combination with abiraterone as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic casted resistant prostate cancer with and without mutations and a group of homologous recombination repair gene. At a planned interim analysis, results showed an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival versus the standard of care. These early results also showed a trend towards improved overall survival. The trial will continue to assess these key secondary endpoints when we plan to engage with health authorities to discuss the findings with the aim of bringing this important option to appropriate patients. Prostate cancer represents a significant unmet need, and we are continually gaining important insights into the biology of the tumor. We are keen on making an impact for patients with late-stage disease. Last month, we announced the discontinuation of the KEYLYNK-010 study, evaluating the combination of KEYTRUDA and Lynparza for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. At an interim analysis, this study showed no evidence of superiority to abiraterone enzalutamide with respect to overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival. Our attention in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer now shifts to KEYNOTE-921, a study exploring the combination of KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy, and KEYNOTE-641, which is evaluating the combination of KEYTRUDA and enzalutamide. Outside of the United States, we continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy. Notable actions include positive CHMP opinions for cervical, MSI high and early stage breast cancer in Europe and approvals for the combination regimen of KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima for advanced renal cell carcinoma in Japan. And finally, to coincide with ASCO, in early June, we are planning to host an investor event in Chicago. At our recent cardiovascular investor event, we showcased our growing portfolio of programs targeting a range of conditions, including atherosclerosis, heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension and thrombosis. Following the completion of our acquisition of Acceleron Pharma, we are making strong progress in advancing the development of sotatercept, a potential first-in-class valuable activin receptor type 2A fusion protein. We recently completed enrollment for the STELLAR trial ahead of schedule. STELLAR is the first of four ongoing Phase III studies evaluating sotatercept. This progress reflects enthusiasm from investigators regarding this novel investigational mechanism. For the first time, the 2022 American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology and Heart Failure Society of America, guideline for the management of heart failure included Verquvo, which we collaborate on with our partner, Bayer, as a Class IIB recommendation for the treatment of Stage C heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The guideline highlights this mechanism of sGC such as Verquvo and the potential benefits of stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase and increasing cyclic GMP. Based on evidence from the pioneering VICTORIA trial, Verquvo is the first drug specifically studied and approved for patients with worsening heart failure and the only drug recommended in the new guidelines for these patients. Our ongoing VICTOR study is designed to expand on the evidence to date by evaluating Verquvo in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who have not experienced a recent worsening heart failure events. Merck is uniquely positioned to meaningfully impact the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease with at least eight potential approvals by 2030, including Verquvo and stable heart failure and sotatercept as well as our pipeline of candidates, including an entailed soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, a Factor XI inhibitor and an oral PCSK9 inhibitor. Next, the COVID-19 and LAGEVRIO. As the pandemic evolve, there continues to be regional surges in infection rates with the emergence of new COVID-19 variance. Now some of these strains are resistant to specific monoclonal antibody regimens and appear able to evade some vaccine protection, highlighting the importance of testing and the availability of antiviral option. At the recent European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, we presented Phase III virology outcomes data for move out, adding to the growing body of evidence for the antiviral properties of LAGEVRIO. The panoramic trial evaluating novel antivirals for early treatment, which is being sponsored by the University of Oxford and funded by the U.K. government and the MOVe-AHEAD trial evaluating LAGEVRIO for post-exposure prophylaxis are both ongoing. We are working collaboratively with the European Medicines Agency to provide additional data from these trials in order to secure an approval. We remain confident in the safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO in appropriate patients. In particular, we believe it's low propensity for drug-drug interactions makes it an important option for patients. Next, on our pneumococcal program. Earlier this month, the FDA extended the PDUFA date for the supplemental biologics license application for VAXNEUVANCE, our 15-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infants and children to July 1, 2022. The agency requested additional analyses of data, which we provided. Importantly, no new studies were requested. Also in our new pneumococcal program, we received breakthrough therapy designation for V116, our investigational PCV that is designed to target serotypes responsible for approximately 80% of the residual invasive disease in the older adult population and includes eight unique serotypes not in currently licensed vaccine. We look forward to providing deeper updates. In closing, I would like to thank Roy Baynes for his many contributions to Merck over the past eight years. As we build upon his legacy, I'm constantly reminded of wisdom and teaching and I'm grateful to work with a remarkable team he has trained and mentored. One of those mentees, of course, is Eliav Barr. Eliav's experience commitment to Merck's purpose of saving and improving lives makes him the ideal leader of our global clinical development program. Eliav has a wealth of experience, holding leadership roles across an array of therapeutic areas during his 27 years at Merck, including vaccine, infectious disease, and oncology. I look forward to continuing to partner with Eliav to build upon Merck's legacy of innovation and breakthrough size. And now back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Grace, if you could please begin the Q&A. And we request that analysts limit themselves to one question each to get to as many questioners as possible. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Your line is open. Ed Carter : This is Ed Carter on for Carter. We wanted to ask about GARDASIL. If you could talk about any impact you're seeing in China, either from a demand perspective or disruptions to manufacturing? And in that context, should we think about cadence -- or should we think about cadence over the year being notably different than in the years past? There's just a lot of different crosses play. So any color there would be helpful. Caroline Litchfield : Carter, this is Caroline. Thank you very much for the question. GARDASIL continues to be a great growth driver for our company globally, including China. Specific to China, we saw strong performance in the quarter, and we expect continued strong performance as we go through this year. We have significant demand in China. And as they're off flares, as a result of COVID and potentially lockdown in one part of the country, we have the ability to ensure that we're supplying more of the GARDASIL doses to other parts of the country. So we're, therefore, not anticipating a significant impact to our GARDASIL performance in China as a result of what we're seeing in Shanghai at this moment in time. As it pertains to our supply chain, our company has a very robust supply chain. And we have Plan A and Plan B, if there are any interruptions in the supply chain. So we, again, have no concern for the reliability of our supply chain, but we remain vigilant and focused on the situation at hand. Operator : Thank you. Next up, we have Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Congrats on the quarter. So one question we're getting a lot is, how do you feel about potential challenge from a competitor or for PDL1 and TIGIT combo, potentially looking better than KEYTRUDA first-line PD-L1-high lung cancer? Do you see this as a major threat, especially looking at the Phase II data from that competitor TIGIT? Dr. Dean Li : Thank you for that question. So I just wanted to emphasize the question focuses on the addition of another checkpoint inhibitor TIGIT on top of PD-1. And this is a strategy to sort of deepen the response of PD-1 and PD-L1. I think it will be very important to see that data and look at the contribution of components. And really, we're -- we have a TIGIT program that we're also advancing in non-small cell lung cancer and small lung cancer. So, the field will have to sort of see as the data evolves, how much does TIGIT add to PD-1 in the lung space. But I do want to make a broader sort of comment, which is you'll see movements in TIGIT that was recently movement in PD-1, and CPLA4 and PD-1 and LAG-3. What you recognize as each of those combinations, what they do is if you're able to show a benefit of the additional agent, it doesn't have as broad of an impact as PD-1 has in many different tumors. And so, one of the things that I think is important to highlight is our strategy is not to just be invested in LAG-3, not to be just invested in CPLA4, not be just invested in TIGIT, but to be invested in all three and to focus them in specific tumor types. Operator : Thank you. Next up, we have Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Seamus Fernandez : So, just really wanted to focus in on sotatercept and the six-minute walk test as the primary endpoint. If you guys could just help us understand what is being done in the clinical trial to really manage closely the risk that sort of a subjective endpoint represents? Or is your confidence that the magnitude of the difference that you saw in the Phase II will comfortably cover the challenges of the six-minute walk test that we've seen in some other studies given some placebo responses that raised levels of concern? So just love to get your thoughts there. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So thank you so much for that question in relationship to sotatercept. So just to reemphasize, we have three different trials, all driving towards somewhat different outcomes, the six-minute walk, which is the STELLAR trial. There's also time to clinical worsening, and then there's also even harder outcomes past that. And as you point out, each one of those is sort of ratcheting up what sotatercept can do. In relationship to the first one, which is STELLAR, which is related to what you said, the six-minute walk test, where we saw actually quite impressive data and relationships to the Phase II, we have very committed patient groups as well as sites who are very well trained in how to do these trials. And the Phase II was really nice data. And the fundamental issue is that we are confident that many of those same sites that were involved with the Phase II are involved with Phase III. So I think we're confident we'll see what that data is. But the best predictor of how well we can manage those trials is really the best indicator is the Phase II, and we're using very many sites and the investigators. So, we have great confidence in that. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Maybe just a two-parter around kind of corporate structure. I guess first, business development landscape. I know you talked about this as a priority. I guess it's been another kind of quarter of weak equity market performance in the biotech side. So, I guess, are you seeing any change in willingness on the part of some of the targets to engage or any resets in valuations that could enable some of these business development kind of activities to move forward? And then Rob, just a kind of a tangential question on that is broadly across the pharma group, I think we've been seeing asset divestitures of nontraditional pharma businesses. I know you viewed Animal Health as more core to the Company. But have your thoughts evolved at all, I guess is your time as CEO and when you look at your implied kind of core form valuation given where some of the animal health multiples trade? So, so any incremental perspective there would be appreciated. Rob Davis : Great. Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, on the BD landscape question, the short answer is we are not seeing a fundamental shift in seller expectations as of this point. I think as time continues, if we see the market reset to become more permanent and more importantly, if the IPO market continues to be challenged for biotech companies, that might change over time as companies become more cash constrained. There are some smaller players that do have cash challenges. So I think that's where you could see movement first. But fundamentally, we've not seen a change in the landscape yet. We'll have to continue to watch. With regards to the Animal Health business, our view continues to be that the Animal Health business, as you said, is core to the Company. It's core to our strategy as part of a growth driver for the Company. But as we've always said, we look at this regularly. We always are challenging ourselves to ask, what is the long-term value creation opportunity of this business in our hands relative to what would be outside of the Company? And on a long-term view, we continue to believe it is best in our hands as part of the Company. But if that situation evolves, we obviously will continue to be objective in how we analyze that. But we do not look at the short-term the arbitrage opportunity for us. It's more about the long-term value creation, and that has not changed as of now. Operator : Thank you. Next up, we have Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Shibutani : If I could ask a question on KEYTRUDA, the strength, particularly out of the U.S. this quarter, if you could help us with some of the underpinnings there? And relatedly, longer term, 2025, I think you framed how KEYTRUDA, your objective is to have -- I guess the wording changed slightly. You were previously looking for 30% coming from adjuvant with your focus framed around the U.S. If I'm reading it correctly, you brought in the framework here to now think about it as 25% on a global basis. Maybe update us on where you feel you are in terms of making progress towards achieving those objectives of the adjuvant revenue contribution? Rob Davis : Yes. So Chris, this is Rob. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question then Caroline can jump in for the second part. On the strength of the growth we're seeing in the United States, this is really a testament to what we've been talking about all along, which is as we continue to roll out new indications, we are continuing to see our share grow as the leading I-O agent. And importantly, I would highlight that the growth we saw among other things in the quarter, continuation of our position in renal cell carcinoma, continuation of the growth we're seeing in head and neck. In RCC, obviously, being a first-line treatment in the metastatic setting as well as now having adjuvant therapy as well, we've covered pretty much the waterfront of RCC, and we have the opportunity to continue to grow there. But the standout frankly, for the quarter, and it's, I think, really important to understand is triple-negative breast cancer, both in the metastatic setting and in the adjuvant setting. We are seeing incredible growth in that space and it's something that we feel very proud of because I think we're going to have a meaningful difference there. The reason I highlight that is both -- if you look at the adjuvant opportunity there and the growth we're getting as well, as I mentioned, in adjuvant RCC, I think it just reinforces what we see as the future, which is the growth contribution from the earlier lines of therapy long term. But with that, maybe Caroline can be specific to some of the guidance we've provided. Caroline Litchfield : So to Rob's point, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we have for adjuvant and the impact that, that has on patients. We initially shared that we expected 50% of our growth to come from adjuvant, representing 30% of the U.S. business. We have now extended that to say 50% of the growth will come from adjuvant, representing 25% of our global business in the year 2025. And to Rob's point, our early introductions into the earlier-stage cancers with five indications now in KEYTRUDA are putting us on a very good course to have this impact. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Maybe let me touch up on molnupiravir real quick. I think the total utilization to date is about 200,000 courses through mid-April. And it looks like, at least based on third-party data sets that the Pfizer regimen is getting used 8 to 10x more than molnupiravir. So I guess my question is, if only a couple hundred thousand courses have been used through mid-April and 3.1 million courses were contracted to U.S., is there any recourse for U.S. to return a chunk of these courses back? And I'm asking because some of these sales have been recorded in P&L. I just want to make sure they're permanent sales. Rob Davis : Yes. I'll let Caroline maybe address this. Caroline Litchfield : So Umer, thanks for the question. First, let me start. We're proud of molnupiravir, LAGEVRIO and the impact that it can have on the world. And it has impact to the comments that Dean made given its importance, especially in patients that have drug-to-drug interactions. The data that we have access to suggest that we have actually had utilization by 500,000 patients globally at this stage. We have shipped 6.4 million courses as of now. Both shipments represent expectations for utilization over a period of time. And we're actually seeing extremely strong utilization, especially in ex-U.S. markets, where the statistics you quote are actually reversed in some of the markets. We have a very strong market share. So as we sit here today, we've guided on the $5 million to $5.5 billion based on the contracts that we have in hand, and we are confident in that in our financials. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Daina Graybosch : I have another one on KEYTRUDA in early stage. Can you guys talk to how the success of Opdivo plus chemotherapy in neoadjuvant lung cancer changes your expectations or strategy for the early-stage opportunities in lung cancer and in the other tumor? Dr. Dean Li : Yes, thank you very much for that question. In relationship to sort of just earlier stage in lung cancer, I think it's really important to emphasize there's a series of different ways to approach it. One is neoadjuvant, adjuvant. One is adjuvant. And I just think all of these signals just demonstrate throughout a variety of different studies just the impact that PD-1s can have. So our point of view of it is it shouldn't change our strategy. It should just make our strategy pretty comprehensive. The fundamental thing is we have KEYNOTE-091, which is in the adjuvant, so that's post-surgery, and that's usually given by a medical oncologist, the disease-free survival was positive in all comers regardless of PD-L1. There was a trend to TPS greater than 50%, but not statistically significant. And OS, it was a favorable trend regardless of PD-L1. So we'll be letting that data mature as we continue to discuss with the FDA. But going -- to your point, it's not just KEYNOTE-091. It's KEYNOTE-671. It's KEYNOTE-867. It's KEYLYNK-012. It's all in the earlier stage. So our desire to really push that earlier stage is going to be -- if anything, our commitment towards that is even greater. The one thing I would just add in relationship to some of the comments that Caroline and Rob made is that I think it's very important to think about melanoma renal cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer, where at least my experience being in the hospital, there's a concept of really looking at that earlier stage. And I think uptake may be sort of built in the medical system. I think all of us, including us and other companies as well as patient advocacies and medical centers are going to have to require diligent investment to really, really maximize the important scientific impacts of KEYTRUDA and PD-1s and PD-L1s in the early lung space. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Baum : I'd just like to thank Roy for all the contributions and insights over the years. The question is on your Factor XI monoclonal. Given your background in cardiology, and I'm sure you keep familiarity with hemostasis, there's clearly been a number of indications where the DOACs were unsuccessful compared to warfarin for both efficacy and safety, potentially speaking to different underlying mechanisms for thrombosis and a different indication as I'm thinking about [ESS] I'm thinking about mechanical heart valves. Given what you know about Factor XI biology and the intrinsic pathway nature of the inhibition, what indications would you actively avoid or be somewhat cautious about taking a Factor XI inhibitor into be it yours or someone else's? Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So let me just step back for just a moment. The benefit risk of whether its platelet or coagulation factors in terms of clotting is something that's actually very topical in the news. I would just emphasize for years, for probably a decade or more, aspirin has been just everywhere. And recently, people realize the benefit risk one has to be very careful. There's been a major change in the guideline. So that impacts how I think about it. The other sort of thing the impact is, if you look at Factor XI, the fundamental advantage of that is that you can get blockage of the coagulation cascade with, by genetic, very little impact in relationship to adverse effects. And so for me, the critical thing is to prove that as quickly as possible. So, we immediately go, where's the problem, where thrombosis and bleeding is both impacted there. And so, that's why we ran the end stage renal disease. But I could see in the future mechanical devices, one of my favorite sort of things is left ventricular assist device, I think that will continue to need to be monitored in the future. So that's a place where the risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombosis is really high, where we have chosen to be a little bit careful is, for example, broader sort of things such as atrial fibrillation and the risk relationship to stroke because we look at the Factor X as very effective. There are bleeding complications, but to make a safety argument for it, you're talking about a very, very large trial. So, we are racing to places where the benefit risk of thrombosis and clotting and bleeding, where that differential would make something like a Factor XI have the biggest impact. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Louise Chen from Cantor. Your line is open. Louise Chen : I wanted to ask you about your pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. And how you think your more targeted approach will be a competitive advantage versus the one size fits all that we're seeing now? And is there any precedence to what you're doing with V116 and 117? And maybe just lastly, how will you make that message clear to physicians since if everything goes as planned, you'll have several PCVs on the market? Dr. Dean Li : Yes. First of all, we need to get the data to demonstrate that we have an advantage in the different patient populations. But I think you point out a really important point, which is essentially what we're trying to do is for, lack of a better word, we're -- if you want to call it, precision-targeted vaccinations, right? So the fundamental thing is B114 is adult approved and we're driving towards a pediatric approval for the 15 valent. And so, that will be in the pediatric population. In the V116, where we have a breakthrough designation, we're trying to demonstrate that we can target 85% of the residual serotypes. And I would just sit there and tell you it would be eight unique serotypes in relationship to all the different currently approved ones. And I think that patient population, I reflect a little bit about COVID, but it's that older population that especially has the risk factors who you really want to make sure that, that whole population, that adult population is covered. And so, I do think the fundamental thing is we'll have to have the data, but our concept is the adult have a different set of serotypes and they need to be protected, and we'll have to get the data to demonstrate that. But I think if we can demonstrate it, the uptake will be quite good. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Mara Goldstein from Mizuho. Your line is open. Mara Goldstein : I'm just hoping maybe we can return for a second back to the question of novel targets in combination with KEYTRUDA. And maybe if you could just give us a very high level, perhaps rationale for which targets you're looking at and which indications, and I'm referring here, obviously, two things like TIGIT, LAG-3, ILT3 and the like? Dr. Dean Li : All right. So, let me just sort of separate. So we always talk about expand, deepen and extend. And when we talk about deepen, we're trying to get a deeper response with PD-1s. And there's a series of things that we do with what I call non-I-O agents, which is chemotherapy, we're doing stuff with many other people as well as ourselves with ADCs. There are RAS programs that are advancing. So, we think that sort of combination, there's large precedents throughout our portfolio already, and there will continue to be. And that's also true with Lenvima and Lynparza. The specific question I think you're driving to is combinations of I-O with I-O agents and LAG-3, CTLA-4 and TIGIT. So at least in our mind, we do recognize that there was demonstration of LAG-3 adding to PD-1 in melanoma. And I think that's an important signal for us. Where we focused our efforts to LAG-3 is in MSS CRC. So we know that PD-1s work in MSI high, and no one's really been able to crack MFS CRC. So, that's very important and also in classic Hodgkin. I would say, in relationships with CTLA-4, there was recent data with HCC. I would make a comment that I think would make some of the people from Merck smile a little bit, we were the ones who actually did the study with PD-1 and CTLA-4 in relationship to lung. And we could not show a clear contribution of component of CTLA-4 over PD-1. So, that is not a place that we think is an important place for patients, and that is not a place that we're going because we have -- we did this study to demonstrate that. Where we think there could be is, clearly, other people have recently released HDC. We're focused in, for example, in renal cell carcinoma. And then PD-1 and TIGIT, our initial focus is in non-small cell lung cancer and also small cell lung. And we're advancing a series of trials in that. So, I hope that gave a comprehensive view of LAG-3, CTLA-4 and TIGIT in relationship to ILT4, other checkpoint inhibitors, such as CD27 or in relationship to cytokines. I think the data that we're doing in earlier stages will have to play out for us to be able to answer that more completely. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Mara. I think we have time for one more question, and then Rob will have a few closing comments. Operator : Thank you. Last question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS. Your line is open. Colin Bristow : Congrats on the quarter. And I also wanted to say all the best of Roy. It's been really great working with you and also congrats to Eliav. So, I just wanted to piggyback on a GARDASIL question. Could you maybe just give us a little more detail on how you expect the GARDASIL supply to increase? And then maybe just help us think through what is the supply-demand mismatch right now? Some of your prior comments suggested that there may not be such, but I know you said supply has been an issue over the past sort of couple of years. So would love to get to expanded thoughts there. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you for the question. This is Caroline. So let me start first with the supply, demand. There is significant demand for GARDASIL. This cancer-preventing vaccine in the HPV area has only reached today 9% of the global eligible population. So, there is significant runway ahead of us to protect lives and to drive growth for Merck. Indeed, we've stated that we expect the revenue in year 2030 to be double the $5.7 billion we achieved in 2021. So, we have significant opportunity ahead of us. In order to achieve that opportunity, we are building new facilities that will be coming online from 2023, 2024 and 2025. So we're going to have a step-up in the level of supply to the market that will happen over that period. Specific then to this year, we will see a continuation of the supply into the market as we did in 2021, albeit not quite at the same step-up that we achieved in 2021. So, we remain really confident in our ability to drive strong growth for GARDASIL both in 2022 and the years to come. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Colin. Rob? Rob Davis : Well, just let me say thank you for your time and your interest today. And I'd just like to conclude by again thanking the Merck team globally for their focus and commitment and really in driving the results you've heard about today, but continuing to ensure when we keep the purpose of the Company front and center, which is to deliver for patients. Hopefully, you get the sense, we are very confident in the business momentum we have. And I'd like to say as well we are feeling better and better about the evolution of our pipeline and things you've heard today, we're starting to expand. We're doing all of the things we need to do. We have more to do, but we're making great progress. And that's why I have such confidence in the sustainability of our business long term. So, we look forward to continuing to share these results with you to deliver for the patients that count on us and in turn bring value to the shareholders. So with that, I'd say thank you and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Company Q2 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Dannenbaum, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Peter Dannenbaum : Welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Lee, President of Merck Research Labs.  Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You'll see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2021 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to imply update any forward-looking statements.  During today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speaker's remarks. The presentation today earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm proud to report that the business continues to perform extremely well. We remain firmly guided by our strategic priorities to bid long-term growth and deliver value to patients and shareholders. We're executing on the opportunities in front of us today, while simultaneously making the necessary investments to sustain our success long into the future. I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we achieved robust top and bottom line growth and made additional important clinical advancements in our pipeline. Turning first to our results. We again achieved exceptional performance this quarter led by strong growth of key products, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and BRIDION. Our results rated by revenue from LAGEVRIO, which is helping to in fighting COVID-19. We're confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio as we continue to see momentum in our business, which we are pleased to reflect our updated guidance.  Moving to research organization. We continue to advance our pipeline most significantly across our suite of pneumococcal vaccines. VAXNEUVANCE received an expanded approval from the FDA for pediatric case, providing an important option for sort in prevention invasive in pneumococcal disease.  We also presented by the results from clinical studies of V116, our vaccine, designed specifically to address remaining of in adults, and we've initiated difficult phase III studies. These milestones reinforce the confidence we have in our population specific approach to address the needs of children and adults.  We've also taken additional taste understand the significant opportunities we see in the pipeline. In June, we hosted an investor event at ASCO. We highlighted the depth and breadth of our oncology program. At the event, we reiterated our ambition to become the leading oncology company by 2025 and our goal of sustaining this success well into the next decade.  As I reflect on my first year as CEO, I'm pretty pleased by the significant progress we've made in advancing worth position as a global pharmaceutical leader and the interim momentum starting across our business. The unwavering focused indication of our employees worldwide is driving strong execution on significant opportunity in front of us. We're demonstrating impressive resilience across all aspects of our business in a every challenging global environment. We're achieving market levels of production in our manufacturing operations, delivering exceptionally strong revenue growth, making meaningful bands in our pipeline and taking important steps to expand our outlook. Our strategy is working and our future is bright. I was very confident a year ago, and I'm even more confident today that we are well positioned to achieve our near and long-term goals, anchored by our commitment to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients and value to all of our stakeholders, including shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we are maintaining this year's strong momentum with another quarter of exceptional performance in both revenue and earnings. These results further demonstrate that our personal science as the core of our strategy is working. Our success is being enabled by the excellent execution of our dedicated products across the globe and continue to deliver value for patients, customers and shareholders. company revenues were $14.6 billion, an increase of 28%. LAGEVRIO contributing $1.2 billion in revenue. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the business delivered very strong growth of 18%.  The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its strong momentum with growth of 33% or 21%, excluding LAGEVRIO driven by our key pillars. Our Animal Health business also delivered strong performance, with sales increasing 5% driven by growth across both our livestock and companion animal products.  Now turning to the second performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 30% to $5.3 billion, driven by the vast global demand as well as continued expansion into new indications and to reflect the preponed impact it is having more patients across the globe.  In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate momentum in metastatic indication and is experiencing strong growth from recent launches in early stage transfers, including triple-native breast renal-cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA is now approved in 6 indications in earlier stage cancers. We've seen strong utilization and are confident in its continued success as physician and patient experience growth. We have seen a particularly strong uptake in neoadjuvant adjuvant high-mileage triple-net breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522, offering a distinct treatment patients in an area of significant unmet need.  In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintained the leadership position in non-small lung cancer capturing 8 out of 10 patients. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA was driven by continued uptake in non-small cell lung cancer and the ongoing in neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Initial indicators also point to encouraging trends in the United States indications, including breast cancer and renal carcinoma in key European markets. The Lynparza remains a market-leading part inhibitor. Our revenue grew 17%, driven by uptaking patients with high-risk early stage breast cancer following FDA approval by [indiscernible]. We look forward to potentially expanding leadership by reaching the digital prospect cancer patients based on study.  Lenvima revenue grew 33% due to strong demand following the launch of in advanced renal cell carcinoma and PMOT775 in metastatic endometrial cancer. New patient target tumors remain strong. Lastly, we continue to be encouraged by \u2022 WELIREG which is tracking in line with expectations. Portfolio again delivered excellent growth rate by GARDASIL, which increased 40% to $1.7 billion. Outside the U.S., GARDASIL significant growth was driven by strong underlying demand, particularly in China as well as increased supply. In the U.S. that decrease primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns, although we continue to be impact from [indiscernible]. We continue to invest behind activation campaign to ensure that parents recognize the importance of routine division to their children, particularly during the [indiscernible]. We remain confident in the growth trajectory of GARDASIL given the proven ability to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both females and males.  In our hospital acute care portfolio, sales was 15%, driven by greater share among and the increase in surgical procedures. Our animal health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 5%, grew 6%, driven by higher demand in and poultry. Companion animal sales increased 3% due to global demand for line of product. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 74.7%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points. The decrease was due to the impact of [indiscernible], higher inventory baseline increased manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix across the remainder of the portfolio as foreign exchange.  Operating expenses decreased 19% to $5.2 billion, reflecting charges primarily related to last year's $1.7 million acquisition of which is reflected in our second quarter 2021 R&D expense. Operating expenses excluding these charges incline our plan, driven by investments in our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $200 million, reflecting higher-than-expected pension settlement effect.  Our tax rate was 13.8%. Taken together, we add $1.87 per share. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. The underlying strength of our business enables us to rate and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $57.5 billion and $58.5 billion. Our increased revenue guidance range represents growth of 18% to 20% or 13% to 14%, excluding LAGEVRIO and the impact from foreign exchange.  The projected impact from burn exchange includes an incremental headwind of more than 1% using this July rent resulting a net impact of approximately 3%. We are maintaining our gross margin expectation of between 74% and 74.5%. We are increasing our operating expense projection to $20.5 billion to $21.5 billion, primarily driven by the $219 million upfront payment from the recently announced collaboration with Orion Corporation. As an ongoing practice, our finance does not include significant potential when we development transaction. We increased our expectations of other expense to approximately $100 million, reflecting higher-than-anticipated pension settlement expense. We continue to assume a full year tax rate between 13.5% and 14.5%. We assumed 2.54 billion shares outstanding.  Taken together, we have managed our expected EPS range to $725 to $7.35. The operational front in our business would have led with approximately 20% increase in our guidance. This strength is being offset by the upfront entry to Orion, by pension settlement expense and an incremental headwind on foreign exchange more than 1% due in [indiscernible].  Overall, that guidance reflects our confidence that the strong underlying momentum of our business will continue into the second half of the year. As you consider your models, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the pandemic as a tailing to growth in the first half of the expect the benefits to yearly reset over the remainder of the year. Also, we actively managed the impact of foreign exchange through our revenue saving program. To the extent we see further negative impact from foreign exchange, we will see additional benefits from our hedging in other revenues as we did in this quarter.  Other revenue also includes supply to Organon and the Johnson & Johnson for its COVID-19 vaccine as well as we see related to our out licensing arrangements. In total, we expect other revenue to be higher in the second half versus first half of 2022.  With respect to our products, for [indiscernible], we continue to expect a negative impact to U.S. sales, given the shift towards new adults pneumococcal vaccine. On Animal Health, we're seeing normalized industry growth rate as we adverse favorable trends in ending resulting from pandemic and experience foreign exchange headwinds. However, given our broad innovative portfolio, we are well positioned to continue to drive the market growth in 2022 and beyond.  Finally, we continue to expect to look at full year sales of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, with second half sales weighted to the fourth quarter.  Adaptation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to clarify investments in our pipeline and business to realize the value of the many near and long-term opportunities in [indiscernible]. We continue to pursue compelling with strategic business development to augment our internal pipeline. Our recent collaboration with Orion is another example of our execution of this strategy.  We remain committed to our dividend, which we expect to increase through the time. Finally, to the extent we have extra cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, at the end of the second half of the year, we remain very confident in business, driven by global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. Our excellent execution will enable us to continue to deliver value to patients and shareholders well into the future.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. It's my pleasure to provide an update on our progress since the first quarter call. We continue to execute on our pipeline strategy. We are advancing the latest signs to generate medicines and vaccines that provide clear benefit for patients.  Today, I will highlight recent progress in our vaccine pipeline and provide an update on our oncology program as well as LAGEVRIO.  As Rob noted, we have made significant progress across our pneumococcal portfolio. Building upon the approval in the adult indication we received a year ago. Last month, we received FDA approval for our 15 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, VAXNEUVANCE an important new option to help protect pediatric populations against invasive pneumococcal disease.  VAXNEUVANCE is the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine approved for pediatric populations in almost a decade. VAXNEUVANCE provides comparable immunogenicity for 12 shared compared to the currently available 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, improved immunogenicity for serotype 3 and expanded coverage for serotype 22F and 33F.  Serotype 3, 22F and 33F are key invasive disease using serotypes known to be responsible for more than a quarter of all invasive pneumococcal disease in children.  Following FDA approval, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted unanimously to endorse VAXNEUVANCE as an option for children under 19 years of age. Additionally, the ACID unanimously voted to include VAXNEUVANCE and the vaccines for children program. We await publication of the final CEC recommendation in the morbidity and mortality weekly report.  Also in June, at the International Symposium on pneumococi and pneumococcal diseases in Toronto, we presented positive results from our Phase I/II study evaluating V116, our investigation 21 delink pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in pneumococcal vaccine naive adult. V 116 is designed to significantly expand coverage compared to currently licensed pneumococcal vaccines by targeting serotypes that account for 85% of all invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults aged 65 and older in the United States as of 2019.  As a strong indicator of our progress, we recently enrolled the first patient into the STRIDE 3 trial evaluating V116 in vaccine-naive adult, the first of 4 current Phase III trial. We have taken a thoughtful and tailored approach to establishing a pipeline of pneumococcal vaccine candidate designed to forward production by targeting strains posing the greatest risk to specific populations.  I look forward to providing additional updates on the progress of our pneumococcal program for VAXNEUVANCE, V116 and V117, our investigational candidate, specifically targeting pediatric disease.  Turning to oncology. We continue to build on the momentum in earlier-stage cancers. We announced that the FDA has accepted our application of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer following surgical reduction based on the results of the ongoing KEYNOTE-091 trial. The FDA has set a prescription drug user date of January 29, 2023. However, further data may be provided during the review process that may delay the state.  At the American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting in June, we provided expanded analysis and presented data on new endpoints in key subgroups 4, KEYNOTE-716 and for the adjuvant treatment in Stage IIb and IC melanoma, KEYNOTE-522 in neoadjuvant high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and KEYNOTE-564 in adjuvant RCC.  We are also delivering on our regulatory strategy outside the United States. Notable actions include 4 approvals for KEYTRUDA from the European Commission based on KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIb or 2C melanoma; KEYNOTE-522 in high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158 in MSI high and/or mismatched for tumors in 5 different cancer types; and KEYNOTE-826 and certain types of persistent recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. In addition, we received a positive EU CHMP opinion for adjuvant treatment with LYNPARZA for patients with serotypes of high-risk early-stage breast cancer based on the Phase II OLYMPIA trial.  And finally, we are encouraged by the positive readout of KEYNOTE-869 or EV-103 and first-line urothelial cancer, which is in collaboration with SGI.  Next, I want to discuss our ongoing efforts to treat prostate cancer. Prostate cancer impacts millions of men and those with advanced disease at low rates of 5-year survival. We continue to generate insight about prostate cancer from our ongoing work, and we remain focused on improving patient outcomes. Business development and licensing remains a key element of our strategy to build and maintain a strong and diverse pipeline.  Earlier this month, we announced a global development and commercial relation agreement with Orion for investigational oral steroid synthesis inhibitor, ODM-208, which is currently in Phase II development for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  ODM-208 targets cytochrome P450 1181, a novel approach that is complementary to our broad-based prostate cancer program, which includes the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-091, KEYTRUDA with antiandrogen therapy based on KEYNOTE-641 and KEYNOTE-991 and LYNPARZA with anti-androgen therapy based on the PROPEL trial.  Next, to COVID-19 and LAGEVRIO the pandemic persists and SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. There are solid emerging evidence for the threat of resistance to antibody therapies from Omicron variants, notably B4 and B5. The rate of transmission and increased hospitalization with these variants reinforces the need for multiple effective antiviral treatment options, especially for those most vulnerable. For high-risk patients, evidence continues to show that prompt therapeutic intervention improved outcome.  Importantly, a large proportion of high-risk individuals, including older adults, are likely receiving additional medications for chronic conditions. LAGEVRIO's low propensity for drug-drug interaction avoids the need to adjust existing dosing regimen and monitor liver and kidney functions during treatment, which can facilitate timely intervention for appropriate patients.  Recently, data reported from Denmark, Hong Kong and Poland have provided support for the utility of LAGEVRIO in real-world settings. We plan to share more data as they become available.  To conclude, I am proud of the advancements across our pipeline to date and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific primaries in the future.  And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Alan, we're ready for the Q&A session. If you could please assemble the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Maybe a 2-part one here. Just wondering if there's a pathway to extend the IP on KEYTRUDA via either subcu formulator maybe some other type of formulation patents? And then is there anything from a technical perspective that would prohibit a co-formulation of KEYTRUDA with an antibody drug conjugate? Dean Li : I guess I will take this. This is Dean. In relationship to different routes of administration, I think you've highlighted that, especially as we go into early stages of cancer, there will be a demand, demand by the patients and the providers to really come up with other formulations besides intravenous formulations where you have to go to an infusion center. So subcutaneous pembrolizumab could be very important to serve that need. And the innovation required for subcutaneous KEYTRUDA is viewed through the past history, and I would imagine the current situation is novel, useful and nonobvious. So I think there is a path to think about how to think about that innovation. In relationship to co-formulations. In general, co-formulations work well with, for example, when we do IO-IO with PD-1 that CTLA-4 TIGIT or LAG-3. The issue with chemo-based or antibody drug conjugate basis, I would be a little bit hesitant to do that. Oftentimes, they're based on weight base, and so I think that coal formulations of, for example, any IO agent with any chemotherapy or antibody drug conjugates could be challenging to take that clinically. Operator : That will be from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : So with the widespread news reports of a potential deal with Senators management and Schumer, can you provide us with your thoughts on kind of the structure for Medicare to directly negotiate with manufacturers for drug reimbursement and the potential impact on R&D going forward? Robert Davis : Yes. Evan, thanks for the question. This is Rob. As you said, there is reports out really just came out yesterday of a potential deal with the Senator and in that is elements of what have been part of the build back better plan related to drug pricing. So as we look at that, I think it's important to understand, first and foremost, we do have significant concern on one very important element of the provision, which is the fact that there is what we see as price setting, it's termed in negotiation. But in effect, what it is, it is price setting on drugs after a period of time. And we do believe that will be highly chilling on future innovation because, especially if you think about an area like oncology, oncology is an area that the development of the drug continues long after the first approval. If you take KEYTRUDA, the launch in 2014 between 2014 and 2022, we had something like 30-plus indications approved. We expect to have well more than double that between 2022 and 2028. And our concern is that if you start to have the threat of discounts, mandatory discounts that could cause companies to question that innovation because you'll have to question whether or not you're going to see the return. So we see a higher chilling effect of that, and it's something that we will continue both at and as the industry to make sure that we communicate our concerns there.  And the only other thing I might add is, as you think about how we think about this to our business going forward. It's important to understand that as we look at this, while obviously, it will have an impact, importantly, as we've planned for the future of the business, we have always assumed some form of price pressure coming, including in the United States. I think we've communicated that in the past. So as we look at this, and you think of a relative to the guidance we've given in the past of expectations for strong growth through our long-range period. That continues and includes the assumptions around this. So while I think we will manage it, I do worry about what it will do to innovation in the industry. Operator : Will come from Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : A couple of questions. Firstly, you've announced a couple of licensing from China of ATC. I think one of them is in late-stage development. It's obviously widely reported that you're in talks with Seagen, which has Phase III data from another ADC molecule, which would compete with in HER2. In general, I'm just interested, Dr. Pastor seems to have closed the doors on seeking approval in the U.S. using data from Chinese trials. But operationally, how fast does it enable you to go, knowing that you have efficacy and safety signals in a Chinese population in expediting the move into Phase III i.e., is there an advantage here that you could enable you to catch up with the market leaders and the respective categories? And then second question on islatravir, perhaps you care to update us how your discussions with Gilead in terms of and the FDA in terms of resuming trials. Is this drug alive as a prophylactic, in PREP as a treatment, both or neither? Dean Li : So this is Dean. Thank you very much for those questions. tackle your first question related to our recently announced partnership with Kelyn. I should just emphasize this was recently announced, but we've had a productive, a really productive partnership for the past 2 years. And most recently, they have announced progress in 2 programs. One that they've declared, which relates to Trop-2 ADCs, and they're advancing it in China in relationship with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.  In relationship to what you've said in moving those molecules for example, in the United States, I think the FDA and we support this. The FDA has been very clear of the importance of doing those trials, not in a single geography such as China, but to have global studies that include the United States. And so the ability for our partners to give us a signal in a human population is really important and allows us to navigate how to think about it at a global level. And so we are hopeful that this partnership will allow us to accelerate the benefits of this stroke to ADC to as many patients as possible.  To your second question in relationship with [indiscernible]. As you've noticed, is our nRTTI. It's extremely potent that has a resident time and tissue has a high barrier to resistance. And we had 2 Phase III studies that have excellent results. Nevertheless, we also had reduction in lymphocytes across a number of our programs, most of it a symptomatic, but in a combo trial with MK-8507, there was clinically meaningful reduction that's still dependent. We have spent the last 6 months understanding that. We understand it far better. We believe that there is a potential path forward to maintain and to have that efficacy and also reduce the effects on the blood cells. We are in active discussions with the FDA. So I don't want to get ahead of myself there, and we clearly have active discussions with our partners.  In relationship to the question of treatment and PREP, I just want to make sure that everyone recognizes we have always thought that this class of molecules NRTTI and islatravir is just 1 compound within this class could be broadly used in treatment and in PrEP, and we are interested in applying both of those -- advancing both of those possibilities, but we are in the midst of discussions with the FDA that I think we should provide them the data that they will need. Operator : That will be Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : So I wanted to ask you about the checkpoint inhibitor strategy. What are your thoughts on the changing treatment paradigm for checkpoint inhibitors in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant cancer setting. How do you think about adoption and uptake in this setting? And do you think doctors are convinced of the opportunity yet? Or is there more work to be done? Dean Li : Well, let me answer it from a scientific standpoint. Maybe we'll have Carolina or Rob answer it from a market standpoint. I do think it's really important to just highlight, at least for me, PD-1s have been incredible and metastatic through a broad range of tumor types. And we keep growing for earlier stages. And it's not apriority that a medicine that works in the metastatic patient who has a very different benefit/risk ratio will be truly effective in the early stage. And it's been impressive. We have 6 approvals, whether it be in breast, in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. And we have a positive trial in relationship to lung, and we have many others advancing.  So I think that part of it is I think the uptake has been good, but the most important thing is that scientifically, the data has been very good. And I think the field will adopt it. I think one of the things that will be critical as the field adopts it is that oftentimes, you're now talking not necessarily about a medical oncologist. So there will be work for us to do, but I think the results speak for themselves. And I would recommend that people look at that data, and I think that it's an important advancement in the field. But in terms of the uptake, Caroline, do you want to take with that? Caroline Litchfield : Yes. Thank you, Dean. So Louis, we are really excited about the opportunities that we have moving into earlier stages of cancer. Clearly, if we can impact patients then, the possibilities of better outcomes are greater. We have seen in our early-stage cancers impressive performance. We're seeing very strong performance in triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. And if I just touch on triple-negative breast cancer, we had the KEYNOTE-522 approval here in the United States July of last year. During the second part of last year, we saw tremendous uptake in the first segment of treatment, the neoadjuvant treatment ahead of people then getting their surgery some 24 weeks later. What we're now seeing is not only patients coming on to KEYTRUDA for neoadjuvent triple-negative breast cancer. We're also seeing them return to treatment following their surgery. So we're very optimistic about the opportunities we have in the adjuvant setting and the impact that we can have on patients. Operator : We will go to Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : I have 2 here, if I may. First, Rob, I know you've mentioned M&A is critical to further diversification of the business away from KEYTRUDA. And you could explore M&A in basically in a non-oncology bucket like Acceleron or in oncology. And I guess that brings me to my first question, which is in oncology, it's a very high-quality problem of KEYTRUDA being this foundational treatment across so many different tumors. And how do you approach that given the increased FTC focus on looking at a lot of deals based on market shares on individual markets, considering KEYTRUDA basically has a market share in solving different tumors. And how do you think about oncology deals in general given KEYTRUDA's roll in. I'm sure you guys have thought about that at length to the extent you're thinking about any capital deployment.  Separately, Rob, also, you mentioned drug pricing and mandatory discounts. And I'm sure you've run exercise internally attempting to quantify how much in discounts. And what I'm getting at is for key franchises like KEYTRUDA, considering the price of U.S. and ex-U.S. is fairly comparable, wouldn't there be not much mandatory discount at all? I just want to make sure I'm not off track there despite KEYTRUDA being a top part B drug. Robert Davis : Yes. I appreciate the questions. And on your first question around the M&A space and what we see in the oncology field. No, I would just start by saying, obviously, we are very proud of the success we've had with KEYTRUDA and the fact that it's been able to impact so many people's lives, as you say, across so many different tumor types. But I think it's important to understand that oncology continues to be an incredibly competitive field, and importantly, it's not monolithic. You have to look tumor by tumor and even modalities, whether it's I/O or targeted therapy. So there are multiple different approaches, multiple modalities and it is a very tumor specific. And as you know, we have to develop these drugs indication by indication of investing in the science to bring each of those forward. And in that regard, as we look at it and as we thought about it, we continue to believe that while the environment is more complex. And obviously, we'll have to be very thoughtful on how we navigate it I believe, we believe, as long as we are doing deals that are science-driven, where we accelerate innovation, and we can show that we can expand access to patients around the world and in the United States to medicines that there are still deals to be done and that there's a path to move forward.  And so that's very much where we're focusing and why we continue to believe the opportunity exists to continue to expand treatments for patients and and for the benefit of, frankly, all stakeholders, including shareholders.  On your second question, and I think it depends on the way you look at it. as far as the upcoming regulation. Obviously, if you look across what is being proposed, if you're speaking specifically to the potential for mandatory price discounting at some point. Obviously, the language has to be finalized. But if you look at where it is today, the way it is being proposed is that for a period of time after a drug is approved during its period of exclusivity for -- right now, it's roughly 7 years for negotiation for slow molecules, 11 years for large molecules, you were able to operate with no discount.  At that period of time, there would be a discussion and opportunity for HSS to select the drug depending on their determination of which drugs to look at. Right now is the language as discussed, we'll pick 10 drugs a year and up to the HSS to determine which drug they pick. But importantly, then the negotiation itself once it is done and the discount is determined and that discount is outlined in the legislation would take effect at year 9 for a small molecule year for a large molecule. So as you think of something like KEYTRUDA, we're really talking about periods of time that are out around the time of loss of exclusivity in 2028. And obviously, there's other language that's being proposed potentially to allow for an exception if there are biosimilar products in development coming that then you would not be subject to it.  So the reality of it is it's unclear what the impact will be in the short term, we don't see impacts from that specific part of the regulation. It will be longer term as it relates to our important drugs, KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. And then obviously, we have to see how the final language comes out. But in the language or then the specified discounts that will be set. So it's not reference price in the way they're setting it up right now. And then obviously, beyond that, there is what they have around the Part B reforms, which actually we support because we believe that will reduce the out-of-pocket costs for patients at the counter, but our -- the reason we continue to oppose the overall legislation is a strong belief that, that focus on mandatory discounts after a period of time as chilling innovation. So I'm not sure I got your question, but I think that's what you were trying to get at. Operator : That will be from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : I just had a couple of quick ones. Dean, I wanted to ask you on KEYNOTE-412, the recent -- it didn't hit significance. Did CRT add complexity to the study in terms of your assumptions? And more broadly, if you look at other indications, does a CRT backbone present any particular challenges when you look at other keynote studies? And then on COVID, the recent infection trends just over the course of this year or the emergence of any new variants, does that change the strategy about the future investments you guys are going to make in LAGEVRIO or even other orals? Dean Li : All right. I'll take both of them, I'll take the Keynote-412. So you're speaking about the -- us trying to go into early stage at a neck and you're speaking about the -412, as you've emphasized, there was improvement in event-free survival who patients who received the KEYTRUDA regimen compared to the placebo plus DRT.  However, these results did not meet statistical significance based on our statistical plan. So there's clearly a positive signal, but it did cross the line. In relationship to -- how to think about CRT or radiation and other indications in this. I would not say that it gives you extra complication. We'll have to see in these other trials when -- not just us but other people in relationship to the combination there.  But I would just emphasize that it was an improvement in EFS. So I wouldn't say that it was a complicating issue for us. We just did need statistical significance.  I do want to make sure that everyone recognizes that this isn't our only foray into a neck early stage. We have a KEYNOTE-689 that's also in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment as well. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can break in into early stage at a neck despite the fact that KEYNOTE-412, it had a positive EFS did not lead to statistical significance.  In relationship to the pandemic, I need to be a little bit careful because everyone who's predicted what will happen with the pandemic have all had one common thread. They've all been not so right. And so we'll have to see what happens with the pandemic. We'll have to see what the emergence of resistance is, but I would emphasize the importance of having multiple mechanisms of action is clear. I would just emphasize that it is quite surprising to me how quickly this virus can mutate around those therapies, for example, focused on this like protein. That's actually it takes many amino-acid changes to do it. And it might take very few amino acids changes to get resistance to, for example, other therapies, but we'll have to see what it is. But I just want to also emphasize that, especially outside of the United States, there's been a great use of it and uptake, and it's really based on the fact that if you have a patient population where you believe that they're extremely vulnerable and you can give this drug and you're most interested in reducing mortality, which this drug has an impressive impact on mortality and you want speed such that you can really see the patient and who may be on multiple medicines, have other complicating medical issues and feel free that you can give this, if those are the important sort of attributes then we have found that LAGEVRIO does quite well and the real-world evidence throughout the world has begun to substantiate. Caroline Litchfield : And Jeff, this is Caroline. The only thing I would add in terms of further investments is our belief in the molecule as being a molecule that could be impactful not only against COVID-19, but also pan coronavirus, RSA and flu. And as a result, we will invest in appropriate programs to try and prove that out. Operator : That will be from Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. Mara Goldstein : Firstly, I just wanted to understand the statement about KEYTRUDA supplemental PDUFA for neoadjuvant and adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer? And have you been asked for additional data? Or are you planning for a major amendment?  And then secondarily, I just wanted to also get some clarity on the comment about excess cash for share repurchase. And at what threshold should we be thinking about that if you're also committed to raising dividend? Dean Li : Yes. So I'll -- this is Dean. I'll take the KEYNOTE-091 that's the lung adjuvant. And just to remind everyone, that had dual primary endpoints. And the reason I want to emphasize that is a dual primary means that if you hit on one of the endpoints, you have a positive trial. And this is a distinction from those trials that are co-primary where you have to hit on both. So this is a positive trial because in the disease-free survival, it's positive in all comers regardless of PD-L1.  The dual primary of DFS in terms of those with a TPS greater than 50%, there is a positive trend, but it's not significant. And the OS has got a trend as we move forward. I would imagine, as data matures people may want to see those data, and I just want to emphasize that in relationship to early-stage lung cancer, we have other trials as well, which is KEYNOTE-671, KEYNOTE-867 and KeyLink 012. So I could imagine that as people deliberate on this, they will be interested in understanding how the data is maturing. These are event-driven and they're part of our FDA discussions and the PDUFA date, as you said, is January 29, 2023. But we could see a situation. There's nothing formally that's been asked of us, but we could see a situation where evolving data is asked for. Caroline Litchfield : And Mara, in response to your question on our utilization of excess cash, the capital allocation priorities of our company are unchanged. We continue to invest first and foremost in our business and the great opportunities that are in front of us. Business development is a strategic priority for us, and we will invest in business development as we have done in the past. We intend to continue to raise our dividend over time and we will then return any excess cash to our shareholders via share buyback. We do not intend to sit with multiple capacity on our balance sheet for periods of time and not use that cash in this regard. So I hope that addresses the use of our cash. Operator : It will be from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : So maybe just 1 M&A question. Can you just clarify whether any acquisition plans or that Merck will consider is likely to be all cash or if there would be a potential use of equity that would be or could be considered in a potential transaction.  And then separately, just wanted to get a little bit of the vision for V116? And where and how you see V116 competing in the overall market? Are we really just looking at that as a potential opportunity solely for adults? Or do you envision the '21 balance actually being a high-use target opportunity in the pediatric patient population as well. And then just trying to get a sense of timing of when we could see V116 actually competing in market and how you see the overall market evolving over time? Robert Davis : Yes. Thanks, Seamus, for the question. Obviously, business development remains a priority for us, as we've discussed. And importantly, we look to add wherever we can find the best science and innovations that enhance our pipeline and drive long-term growth and value for shareholders. I don't want to speculate on specific future transactions or the specific combination of cash or equity we would use because it really would be fact specific to the deal at hand. And so in that sense, I think we'd have to wait. The broader point, I think, that I want to enforce and we've said consistently is we have the capital and the balance sheet strength to go after anything that we feel is strategically important that brings that scientific innovation that I mentioned that will allow us to continue to augment what we have in our own internal pipeline. So we have the capacity and the flexibility to structure it, how we see best to optimize the business, how you do that between cash, debt and equity is really deal-specific. Dean Li : Yes, in relationship to the questions that you had about V116, I just want to reiterate or reemphasize the strategy that we think, which is in different age groups or different populations, the stereotypes that are most troublesome for different populations is very different. So the whole focus of V116, the whole focus of the V116 is to recognize the serotypes that are specifically important for adults and to target that. And that's what V116 is, and that's why we had the first of 4 current Phase III trials that have to run its course. There is not a view from my standpoint, scientifically, that this is a vaccine that I would drive into the pediatric population because the epidemiology as of right now would suggest that, that would not be the right place to put this vaccines. We want to put the vaccines where the serotypes match what is happening to that patient population. Robert Davis : Yes. I might just add to that. If you look at it as we think about the future commercially, we see a real opportunity when you think about this bespoke approach where you have actions that we think will be highly effective in combating the serotypes that cause disease in infants and children as our pediatric approach. And then you have a separate approach with V116 aimed at the adult market. We will go after 85% of the residual disease, understanding that if you've treated it in children, you obviously have a different set of serotypes that are driving it in adults. And we are focusing on both of those as bespoke therapies aimed to what is most aligned with the needs in those populations. I think this will be highly effective and will allow us to be very competitive, in fact, cover more than what the competitor products cover in the disease-causing serotypes than you see today either in what they have in both the pediatric and adult market.  So I think this is something we're very excited about. And in fact, we see V116 as really fruition -- a strategy. So we're excited about it. and we're going to drive it with speed because I do think this is going to be an area where we can definitely be highly competitive and successful. Operator : That will come from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Dean, just real quick, I want to ask you, come back to the subcutaneous formulation of pembro. Is that Phase III in non-small cell still on track to read out early next year? And how should we think about sort of the clinical measures in that study, not just sort of -- I think the primary end points are around some of the biomarker endpoints? And should that study alone sort of be warranting a filing? Or should we be thinking about it differently? Dean Li : Yes. So I just want to emphasize that trial is on track, and that trial should -- our intention is it should support filings? I should also emphasize that we have more than just 1 subcutaneous program and different images and different subcutaneous because we think that there may be a different patient population that will be important for different sort of formulations, the group formulations.  I should also emphasize that just like we have Q3 weeks and weeks Q3 weeks and Q6 weeks were intravenous. I think it's also important that we open up that possibility in the subcutaneous range as well. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you very much, Carter. Rob, any closing comments? Robert Davis : Yes. Well, I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today, and maybe I'll just conclude by reiterating my appreciation for the tremendous efforts of the Merck team and really, we're continuing to perform exceedingly well in a tough environment to advance our science and ensure our important medicines and vaccines reach the patients around the world that are counting on us.  So I appreciate that, and I can tell you, I remain very confident in our underwriting momentum, and I look forward to continuing to give you updates on our progress as we move forward. With that, have a great day.",

The presentation, today\u2019s earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck\u2019s website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. Our strong performance this quarter reflects sustained momentum across our key growth drivers and steady progress in our pipeline. We are well positioned to successfully close out the year and we look forward to building on this momentum in 2023 and beyond. We are delivering across our strategic priorities and executing well scientifically, operationally and commercially. As a result, our pipeline is advancing, our business is healthy, our growth pillars are intact, and our financial performance is strong. We remain keenly focused on sustaining the success by driving continued growth and delivering long-term value to patients and shareholders. With that, let\u2019s turn first to our results. We are pleased to report exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth again this quarter. We continue to see robust demand for our innovative human and animal health portfolios, including for products such as KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL, BRIDION and BRAVECTO. Our updated guidance reflects our expectation of truly standout full year growth. Moving to our research organization, we have made considerable progress across multiple therapeutic areas. In cardiovascular, the top line results of the STELLAR Phase 3 trial evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension achieved successful outcomes across both the primary and almost every secondary endpoint, suggesting the potential to transform the treatment of patients suffering from this devastating disease. I am proud of the way our research organization has moved swiftly following last year\u2019s acquisition of Acceleron to advance sotatercept\u2019s development. We continue to advance other programs across our broad cardiovascular pipeline, including our Factor XI inhibitor, which recently received an FDA Fast Track designation for patients with end-stage renal disease. Turning to oncology, we presented encouraging results at ESMO across our broad portfolio and promising pipeline. Long-term survival data reinforces the durable benefits of KEYTRUDA and Lynparza for certain patients. We remain enthusiastic about the potential of KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of cancer as well as in combination with other agents. In vaccines, we launched VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting and are progressing our Phase 3 trial of V116 in adults, an important component of our population-specific approach to invasive pneumococcal disease and part of our broader efforts to provide strong protection to both infants and adults. And finally, in HIV, we are pleased that there is a path forward for islatravir clinical trials in the treatment setting. We remain committed to helping address unmet needs in both treatment and prevention. Moving to our efforts around sustainability, we continue to execute on our priorities, further demonstrating our longstanding commitment to delivering value to society, which in turn, creates value for shareholders. In August, we published our annual ESG progress report, which provides a comprehensive review of our sustainability strategy, initiatives underway and progress against our goals. Consistent with our mission, we are focused on access to health, ensuring that our inventions reach as many patients as possible. To enable access, we are committed to responsibly discovering and manufacturing our medicines and vaccines, to bringing our best ideas forward through the empowerment of our talented and diverse employees and to always operating with strong ethics and values. Some of our initiatives include a commitment to providing 91.5 million doses of HPV vaccines in Gavi-supported countries, advancing our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and supporting projects and partnerships in our priority areas through the issuance of an inaugural $1 billion sustainability bond. Our approach to sustainability helps propel and enable our business strategy in ways that align with our operating priorities. This makes us a better company and global citizen, creating value for society and for shareholders. Yesterday evening, we also announced that Ken Fraser will be retiring from his role as Chairman of Merck\u2019s Board of Directors at the end of November. I know I speak on behalf of the entire company and our Board in expressing our deepest appreciation for Ken, his principal leadership, respect for science, passion for engaging with employees everywhere, commitment to patients and health equity and contributions to communities around the world. Speaking personally, I am deeply grateful for the inspiration, mentorship and support Ken has provided to me. Moving ahead, I look forward to working with the Board in my new role as Chairman as we continue to build on Ken\u2019s legacy and drive core to our purpose of using leading-edge science to save and improve lives globally. I am confident that we have the fundamental building blocks in place to achieve sustainable growth and value creation. This is exemplified by our talented team of scientists and our colleagues all around the world who are dedicated to discovering, developing and delivering life-changing medicines and vaccines. I am very confident in the short and long-term outlook of our company and I look forward to continuing to share progress as we move into the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2022 continues to be a year of excellent performance for our business. This quarter, we again achieved exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth driven by demand for our innovative portfolio. These results reinforce our commitment to our science-led strategy, enabled by the flawless execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver in the short-term, while we make disciplined investments to maximize long-term value for patients and shareholders. Total company revenues were $15 billion, an increase of 14%. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the business delivered strong growth of 10%. Underlying growth was 4 percentage points higher given the growing headwind from foreign exchange. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its momentum with growth of 19%, or 15% excluding LAGEVRIO, driven by strength across our key pillars. Our Animal Health business delivered a solid quarter as sales increased 4% in both our companion animal and livestock products. Now, turning to the third quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.4 billion driven by strong global demand as well as continued expansion into new indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continued to benefit from uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Intervening earlier in cancer progression provides the potential for better patient outcomes, which is why we remain excited by the impact KEYTRUDA is having on patients with these early-stage cancers. Notably, there continues to be very strong demand in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer a testament to the profound effect KEYTRUDA is having for patients with this aggressive form of disease. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA is maintaining its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Recently approved earlier stage indications, including certain types of high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, are off to a strong start following launches in key European markets earlier this year. Lynparza maintained its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Our alliance revenue grew 23% driven by continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA study. The outlook for Lynparza remains strong. And if approved, we are confident in the potential to reach patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the PROPEL study. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 11%, a strong demand in the U.S. driven by continued uptake in advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer was partially offset by shipment timing in China. Lastly, WELIREG is performing consistent with our expectations, providing a treatment option to the significant unmet need of patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Our vaccines portfolio achieved excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 20% to $2.3 billion. Growth is being driven by strong underlying demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. We recently received approval from China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration to expand the use of GARDASIL 9 to girls and women 9 to 45 years of age, which will further expand our opportunity in this important market. Growth in the U.S. was due to timing of CDC purchases, which will negatively impact fourth quarter sales. We are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth of GARDASIL given its proven effectiveness in preventing certain types of HPV-related cancers and other diseases. Global immunization levels remain low, which provides us a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients. And we have invested aggressively in manufacturing capacity, which positions us well to supply the demand we expect to see now and over the long-term. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 22%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. As mentioned earlier, Animal Health sales increased 4%. Livestock sales increased due to poultry products and ruminant technology solutions. Companion animal sales growth was driven by the BRAVECTO line of products, partially offset by supply challenges for certain vaccines. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77%, an increase of 0.2 percentage points, reflecting favorable product mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by the impact of lower margin LAGEVRIO and supply sales. Operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes $619 million of payments related to certain collaborations and licensing agreements. Excluding these payments, operating expenses grew 13%, driven by increased investments to support our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $100 million, which reflects lower pension expense compared to last year. Our tax rate was 13.6%. Taken together, we earned $1.85 per share, which includes $0.22 of charges related to significant collaboration and licensing agreement. Excluding these charges, we had exceptional underlying growth. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $58.5 billion and $59 billion, including LAGEVRIO sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion. Our increased revenue guidance range represents growth of 20% to 21%. The projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of nearly 1% using mid-October rates, resulting in a full year negative impact of approximately 4%. Excluding foreign exchange and LAGEVRIO, we expect growth of approximately 16%. We are maintaining our gross margin expectation of between 74% and 74.5%. We are increasing and narrowing our operating expense projection to $21.3 billion to $21.7 billion, principally driven by a $250 million payment related to the recent exercise of our option to jointly develop a personalized cancer vaccine as part of our ongoing collaboration with Moderna. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We continue to assume other expense of approximately $500 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 14%. We assume 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we have increased and narrowed our expected EPS range to $7.32 to $7.37, an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint. The operational momentum in our business would have led to an approximately $0.20 increase in our guidance. However, it is being partially offset by the option payments in Moderna and an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of nearly 1% using mid-October rates. Our guidance reflects confidence in the underlying strength of our business. We continue to demonstrate strong momentum and expect durable underlying demand across our key pillars, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. As you consider your model, there are a few items to keep in mind. While we actively manage foreign exchange through our revenue hedging program, it continues to be a headwind to growth, particularly across products with a larger portion of international revenues, such as in our Animal Health business. The hedging program mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. And to the extent we continue to see foreign exchange headwinds recorded at the product level, we will see a benefit in other revenues. In addition, other revenue includes the supply sales to Organon. As you saw in our results, PNEUMOVAX23 is experiencing pressure, particularly in the U.S. as the market continues to shift towards newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to prioritize investments in our pipeline and business to drive near and long-term growth across our portfolio. We have made significant progress across our pipeline which Dean will speak to that has the potential to drive sustainable revenue growth. We are augmenting our pipeline by steering the best external science through value-enhancing business development, which we will invest in to realize the promise of these products. We continue to consider the full breadth of the business development landscape. We have ample balance sheet capacity and we will act only when science and value align. Should meaningful business development not materialize and depending on the pipeline of potential transactions, we will opportunistically buyback shares. We remain committed to our dividend with the goal of increasing it over time. To conclude, as we finish the year, we remain confident in the continued growth of our business. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remains strong and we continue to demonstrate the operational momentum and commercial execution that will enable us to deliver value to patients and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide an update on our progress since the second quarter call. We have growing momentum in our pipeline across therapeutic areas, across modalities, across stages of development and across the spectrum of internal programs, established partnerships and recent business development opportunities. In cardiology, we are making strong headway in pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as our PCSK9 and Factor XI program. In vaccines, we are moving with rigor and speed to build on the VAXNEUVANCE approval and established a suite of tailored pneumococcal vaccines. In oncology, we are expanding our portfolio in partnerships with Orion, [indiscernible] and most recently, Moderna. This progress strengthens my confidence in the pipeline and reinforces to me the opportunity presented by several candidates poised to positively impact patients\u2019 lives. As Rob noted, we see significant opportunity to make an impact in cardiovascular disease. Earlier this month, we announced top line results from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sotatercept, added to currently approved standard of care, had a profound effect on the primary efficacy outcome measure of improvement in 6-minute walk distance from baseline at 24 weeks. Of note, 8 out of 9 secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistical significance, including the outcome measure of proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement and the outcome measure of time to death for the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event. We look forward to sharing the results with regulatory authorities and plan to present the findings at a scientific congress in 2023. The data from the STELLAR trial is an important milestone as we work to establish a beachhead in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Looking ahead, the ZENITH trial is evaluating sotatercept for morbidity and mortality and will enable assessment of the potential to reverse progression of disease and will be followed by the HYPERION trial, which is designed to evaluate whether administration of sotatercept earlier in the course of PH can help improve outcomes and delay time to clinical worsening. And we also have a Phase 2 CADENCE trial, which is exploring the potential for sotatercept in left heart failure. In addition to sotatercept, we are studying MK-5475, an investigational inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator designed to provide selective pulmonary arterial vasodilation with limited systemic exposure for the treatment of PAH. We remain confident in the promise of our investigational portfolio to fundamentally change the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Next to LAGEVRIO. Approximately 2. 5 million people have now received LAGEVRIO for the treatment of COVID-19, and studies are continuing to show the impact this oral treatment option is having on patients and on healthcare system. Real-world evidence of high-risk, older population conducted in Israel and Hong Kong found a reduction in hospitalization and death, consistent with the Phase 3 move-out clinical trial. Unsurprisingly, a large study in the UK evaluating a broader highly vaccinated population conducted during the omicron era found no difference in hospitalization versus standard of care. Nevertheless, there were important observations from certain secondary analysis, including quicker time to recovery and to symptom alleviation as well as reduced physician visits. LAGEVRIO continues to demonstrate a safety profile consistent with our findings in move-out. The pandemic continues to evolve and vaccination rates still vary substantially from country to country. More reason variants, such as omicron, are generally associated with less severe disease. But the elderly and those with comorbidities remain at high risk of poor outcome. Insights from real-world studies are important in this context as we try to understand how LAGEVRIO is being used and the potential benefit for various patient populations. LAGEVRIO continues to be an important tool in the armamentarium to treat COVID-19, especially with uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new variants and continued global surges. In addition to COVID-19, we are now taking steps to harness the broad antiviral potential of LAGEVRIO. We have initiated a Phase 2 trial evaluating its use in the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and will provide further updates as they become available. Shifting to our HIV portfolio, since last year\u2019s setback to the islatravir program, we have gained tremendous learning and insights through the evaluation of data. Following consultation with the FDA, we are pleased we have a path forward. We initiated a new Phase 3 clinical program evaluating a once-daily oral combination of doravirine and a lower dose of islatravir for the treatment of people with HIV-1 infection. In addition, the Phase 2 study with Gilead evaluating a weekly oral combination treatment regimen of islatravir and lenacapavir in adults with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed is resuming with a lower dose of islatravir. We continue to see significant potential in the nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor mechanism and remain committed to addressing the unmet need in both treatment and in prevention of HIV. In the PeEP setting, we are prioritizing an internal novel NRTTI compounds for development. Next to vaccine and specifically GARDASIL-9. As Caroline noted, last month, the National Medical Products Administration in China expanded the authorization for GARDASIL-9 to broader age rates. The authorization reinforces the strong clinical profile of GARDASIL-9 and its effectiveness in preventing certain types of HPV-related cancers and diseases. In addition, we were pleased with the recent approval of VAXNEUVANCE, our 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by the European Commission in the pediatric calculation. This approval brings an important treatment option to vulnerable populations, including infants less than 1 year of age, who typically experience the highest rate of disease. I would also like to touch on the recently announced collaboration with Orna Therapeutics. We have made significant investments and gained important insights into the use of RNA technology. The compelling circular RNA platform that Orna has developed allows us to explore the potential for a new generation of vaccines and therapeutics. Turning to oncology. Strong momentum continues in our oncology portfolio across tumor type and stages of disease. Last month, at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting, we showcased long-term survival benefit data for KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and head and neck cancer as well as for Lynparza in ovarian cancer. In addition, we presented data that continues to support the potential of KEYTRUDA in earlier-stage disease. Our expansive research efforts in treating in earlier-stage setting reflects our ambition to treat cancer when the potential of curing cancer may be high. Also at ESMO, in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, first-time data was presented from the Phase 1b/2 EV-103 for KEYNOTE-869 cohort K trial. KEYTRUDA plus enfortumab vedotin-ejfv demonstrated encouraging objective response rate as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, metastatic urothelial cancer who are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There remain a high unmet medical need for new medicines for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, and we look forward to the potential of this combination. This quarter, we received priority review for Lynparza in combination with abiraterone as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer regardless of their genetic mutation status based on the PROpel study. the PDUFA date has been set for the fourth quarter. Outside of the U.S., we continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. There remains significant opportunity for us to help improve patient outcomes and address unmet need in Japan and in China. We received four new approvals in Japan based on KEYNOTE-522 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-564 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma following surgery; KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage 2b or Stage 2c melanoma; and KEYNOTE-826 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in certain patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. For Lynparza, we received approval in the EU and Japan for the adjuvant treatment for patients with certain types of high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA A trial and in China as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Finally, we exercised our option to jointly develop a personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, or V940, which our partner, Moderna, is currently evaluating in combination with KEYTRUDA in a Phase 2 study for patients with locally advanced and resected melanoma. The primary objective of the Phase 2 study is to assess efficacy of a personalized cancer vaccine plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone in a randomized study of early-stage melanoma in the adjuvant setting. We are energized to continue our collaboration with Moderna, a pioneer in mRNA vaccine technology. To conclude, there has been substantive progress across our pipeline, and I look forward to providing further updates on our progress in the future. And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Leo, will you please start the Q&A? [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Pleas go ahead. Chris Schott : Hi, great. Thanks so much. I guess my question was on capital deployment. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that if BD doesn\u2019t materialize based on the progression of the pipeline, you\u2019d consider repo at some point down the line. So I guess on that front, how are you thinking about the overall business development landscape at this point? And has your preference on \u2013 or I guess actionability of kind of larger deals versus Acceleron type tuck-ins evolved at all as we have gone through this year. I know it\u2019s obviously a big kind of point of debate on the Merck story. So I just love to hear your kind of latest thinking on kind of BD landscape. And are we getting closer to a point where maybe repo makes sense just given the cash that seems to be kind of accumulating at the company? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. Great, Chris. Thanks for the question, and I\u2019ll ask Caroline to comment specifically on the share repurchase side of the question. But just for the BD landscape, we continue to, frankly, see a portfolio of opportunities we are interested in and are continuing to look at. So as we sit here today, our focus, our urgency on business development has not changed. We do see a list of potential places to play. Obviously, we got to bring them through to fruition which we\u2019re working to do. That is our priority because we continue to believe the best thing we can do for long-term value creation is to invest in the sustainability of our business, which is investing in the pipeline of the future in both what we do internally and through BD. So that\u2019s our priority. And I do see opportunities. But obviously, we remain committed also to not hold cash. So with that, maybe I\u2019ll let Caroline comment specifically on the share repurchase. Caroline Litchfield : So Chris, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We seek to provide a competitive return to our shareholders through both the dividend that we pay and we expect will grow, as well as through share repurchases, while we balance the need to invest in our business in driving growth, as well as in our business development strategies, as Robert just outlined. Given where we are, with our focus on business development, our desire to not create excess cash on the balance sheet, we will look opportunistically at share buybacks based on our assessment of that BD pipeline. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Leo. Operator : Next question is from Daina Graybosch with SVB Securities. Please go ahead. Daina Graybosch : Yes. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your novel pneumococcal vaccine strategy, V116 and V117 and how you think that will compete ultimately with competitor vaccines that continue to increase in their serotype 3? Dean Li : This is Dean. I\u2019ll take that, and thank you very much for the question. So the top line is, I would just emphasize that our view is that more serotype is not always better and one size does not fit all. Our view and the view that I\u2019ve had when I practice medicine, it\u2019s the right medicine or, in this case, the right vaccine for the right patient at the right time. So when you look at VAXNEUVANCE, which is our 15 valent, which has recurrent responses for serotype 3, but also 22F and 33F. If you look at that and you have to look at the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease, it\u2019s a bimodal curve where really in the first 2 years of life, especially in the first year of life, is really important. And then in the adult section, you realize that there is increasing at 45, 55, 65. So there is a bimodal curve. If you also lay down the different serotypes, the serotypes are quite different between the two. So that\u2019s why we believe it\u2019s the right vaccine for the right patient at the right time. Now we have a pediatric V114 that has ACIP that\u2019s gone through. And in terms of differentiation and relationship to pediatrics, we don\u2019t have clear view of other vaccines, but we are very confident in our ability to give coverage in the first year. And data to date might suggest that, that is an important differentiation in a pediatric study. There is some questions in relationship to top line serotypes that\u2019s been sort of laid out. There has been some discussion of 6 serotype 2 substantial which we can\u2019t really comment on that differentiation, until we know exactly what serotypes and what the real detailed data. In relationship to the adult market, this gives us great insight and great enthusiasm for V116, our 21-valent vaccine. Now that one is specifically targeted for the serotypes that are important for the adult. So it\u2019s 21-valent, but I would just emphasize that 11 serotypes in the 21 valent for V116 is not shared by PCV20. And the reason is that we\u2019re focused on the adult disease, and we are targeting 85% of residual invasive pneumococcal disease. And I would \u2013 if I look at the vaccines that are in Phase 3, but also Phase 2 or Phase 1 with recent data, I don\u2019t know that anyone else has a vaccine that\u2019s targeting 85% of the residual invasive pneumococcal disease. So more is not better, one size does not fit all the right vaccine, the right patient at the right time. Rob Davis : Thank you, Daina. Next question please, Leo. Operator : Next is Colin Bristow with UBS. Please go ahead. Colin Bristow : Hey, good morning, and congrats on the results. A great quarter for GARDASIL, but you talk about the sort of the one-time impact of CDC purchase timing. Can you just quantify the level of impact that had? And then I just wanted to touch base on the additional supply coming online in \u201823 \u201824, and \u201825. Is this still on track? And could you just specify where the supply is coming from geographically? Thank you. Caroline Litchfield : This is Caroline. I\u2019ll take a shot at answering your question. So GARDASIL continues to be a very strong growth driver for our company and will be long into the future given to date only 9% of the world\u2019s eligible population are vaccinated. In terms of the quarter results, we saw growth in the U. S., which was largely driven by the CDC timing. In the third quarter of 2021, there was an approximate $125 million buy-in by the CDC. In the third quarter of \u201822, there was an approximate buy-in of $250 million. So year-over-year, that contributed to growth to the tune of approximately $120 million plus. We do expect the majority of that buy-in by the CDC in the third quarter to come out during the fourth quarter. As we look at our opportunity to satisfy the global demand and protect as many lives as we can going forward, we will be supported by the increased supply and capacity that we have coming online commencing 2023. And we expect that, that additional supply will come online over the course of \u201823, \u201824 and \u201825. And therefore, we remain very confident in our ability to protect more lives, to drive growth long into the future, including doubling the revenue of GARDASIL in the year 2030 compared to where we were in 2021. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Colin. Next question please Leo. Operator : Next is Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks so much for the question. So, I really wanted to ask a question on sotatercept and perhaps the endpoints that surprised you the most. The feedback that we are getting from thought leaders is that the benefit on clinical worsening actually coming as early as it did was a genuine surprise and suggests upside. Just wondering, Dean, where you fit in that point of discussion and perhaps what you are looking forward to in some of the earlier-stage clinical studies for sotatercept? Thanks. Dean Li : Thank you very much for that question. So, yes, we gave top line results. We are moving with speed to present those data to regulatory authorities throughout. But just to step back, I just want to remind, at least myself and every \u2013 and others that we were drawn to the sotatercept mechanism because it was a unique mechanism of action. It\u2019s the rebalance activin and BMP signaling. The other mechanisms of action could largely be viewed as vasodilatory, and we have a very strong program in trying to make the best [indiscernible] medicine. But the mechanism of action you would expect for sotatercept, you would expect it would potentially reprogram the cellular response and essentially be disease modifying. We are excited about the results. We know that there was a profound effect on six-minute walk. But as you emphasized, time to clinical worsening, these multi-components are all really important and they came in clinically meaningful and statistically significant. So, we are hopeful that we can potentially reshape the treatment of PAH. I would emphasize that we talk about HYPERION, venous and CADENCE. But VICTORIA, which is the follow-on program. And the reason why that is really important to me is given the results that I see, I very much want the individuals who were on the STELLAR trial have the opportunity to get into VICTORIA, which is an open-label trial, because the effects that we see that will be reported in a meeting likely in 2023 are ones where we must make sure that those individuals who were recruited to STELLAR have continued access to sotatercept. That\u2019s how important we think the results are. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Seamus. Next question please Leo. Operator : Next is Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. Rob, you have been CEO for 16 months and now you are going to be Chairman. What do you view as your greatest accomplishments during this time? And what have been the greatest disappointments? I think given the comments you made when you took over, we might have expected more to be done more quickly to build the pipeline, especially since Merck\u2019s pipeline is the second smallest in global pharma. Do you think this is a fair assertion? And if so, why haven\u2019t things changed more quickly? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously, it\u2019s been a fast six months \u2013 or 16 months in the role. But I would say what I am most proud of, several things. One, the way the organization has come together as one team and really brought more focus in the business. Obviously, the spin-off of Organon, I think was very successful, has given us more simple structures, more focus that I feel very good about. Our progress on business development, obviously, the fact that we moved so quickly with Acceleron and then you heard what are just really exceptional results coming out of the STELLAR study, feel very proud about. But I would say also just overall the way our team has continued to just execute really flawlessly, scientifically, operational, commercially, I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what everyone is doing. We have come together and we are really delivering for all of those things I would say I am very proud about. On the pipeline itself, I actually think we are making a lot of progress. The fact that a year ago won\u2019t even give us credit for having a cardiovascular pipeline. And today, we talk about the fact that by the \u201824 to \u201828 timeframe, we could be having as many as eight new approvals driving revenue that could be in excess of $10 billion by the mid-2030s across the whole suite of assets, some developed internally and obviously some brought into business development, like what we did with Acceleron. So, I feel very good about that. The progress we are making in vaccines, what we are seeing. I think VAXNEUVANCE is underappreciated. There is a notion that Dean laid out of really having a bespoke approach where we were able to cover more of the serotypes that cause disease, whether it be in infants, and then selectively and differently, those in adults. We think that\u2019s a real game changer. Our growing pipeline in neuroscience and immunology, I could go on and on, and the strength that we are continuing to have in adding to our oncology pipeline. So, do I think we have everything we need, no. But do I think we have made great progress in a year, I actually think we have, and it gives me confidence that we are going to continue to drive progress. The fact that we did three important business development deals this quarter alone, spanning mRNA technologies, into circular RNA technologies, personalized cancer vaccines and then more traditional oncology agents with a really novel mechanism, those all are adding to the future promise we have in this company. So, I actually feel very good about that. More to do, but confidence in what we have done so far. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks Steve. Next question please Leo. Operator : Next is Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Mara Goldstein : Great. Excuse me. Thanks so much for the question. I wanted to ask about the cardiovascular business actually since it was just mentioned. And given the pending applications for sotatercept, where you feel that, that organization from a commercial perspective needs to go, or are you right-sized to be able to launch and maximize sotatercept in the near-term? Rob Davis : Yes. Maybe I can start that and Caroline or Dean can add on. If you look \u2013 if you go back in history, Merck has actually had a strong history and legacy in cardiovascular. And a lot of the \u2013 if you will, the muscle memory still exists in our organization. So, I am very confident that we have what it takes. But more importantly, we are already out there right now in PAH. We have Adempas. We have Verquvo. So, we have people calling on these doctors. Recall what drove us to think about Acceleron was what we saw in our pipeline, but also what we saw commercially through that experience. So, we do have the capabilities. And also the other thing I would point out is this is a little different than the way we used to think about the world. This is \u2013 in many cases, a lot of these drugs are still specialty drugs. They are not necessarily the true traditional primary care drugs of what we have seen in the past. And I think we are very well positioned. So, I have no worries about our confidence and ability to deliver this commercially. We have done it in the past, and we will do it again. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Mara. Next question please. Operator : Next is Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch up on oncology trials, two of them in particular. There is an ongoing subcu KEYTRUDA trial versus IV. I just \u2013 I was curious to gauge your confidence on that and if it\u2019s reasonable to assume that vast majority of the franchise that gets switched to subcu. And also this KEYTRUDA plus KRASG12C trial, curious if the early experience implies such a combination is feasible or not? Thank you. Dean Li : I will take a shot at both of those questions. I will just emphasize that there is a continuing move to early cancer throughout the field, but especially at Merck. We have talked about the approval that we have in the early stage, both for Lynparza and KEYTRUDA. And this recent Merck-Moderna collaboration is to extend that. It\u2019s essentially an IO-IO combination, initially in melanoma, but with the possibility to expand, deepen and extend throughout other tumor types in different stages. So, given that, the critical thing for patients, especially in the early stage is to be able to have really excellent access to our medicines, and there is a need for scientific innovation. That is why we are advancing the subcu program. And we are confident that, that will not only be important and successful, but it will be really critical as we move into early phase because the ability cannot be linked to an infusion center. So, we are confident in our strategy of moving into early phase, and it is linked. Each scientific innovation required to improve access. In relationship with the RAS program, I have said previously that the RAS program of all of those who are advancing will require a combination. And the ability to move those programs such that you can have a dose and an ability to combine with other medicines is important. We have early data with our RAF inhibitor and many of the attributes that we think are required for that. We are big that the cards are looking like they could positively reflect on our KRAS program. But we will share that data, both in monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, at an appropriate time when we present that at a Congress. Rob Davis : And Umer, to the specific question of the conversion, it\u2019s probably too early to get into the specifics of that. But I would say, generally, we do see this as bringing meaningful patient benefit. If you think about quality of life, as you move especially in the earlier stages of cancer, to be able to deliver the drug subcutaneously, we think is both innovative and will bring real value to the patients. So, that is part of the strategy as we look at the totality of how is it that we continue to deliver for patients as we extend our franchise. So, that\u2019s something we are looking at, but more details as we get further down the road. Umer Raffat : Great. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks Umer. Next question please. Operator : Next is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question. And staying on sotatercept, especially with the CADENCE study. So, we spoke to a doctor and he was very excited about the study given that there are no approved therapies in the subset of patients you are going after. Could you help us frame expectations of this study, because a lot of these endpoints are very similar to STELLAR. So, would you expect the similar level of efficacy or bar could be lower given there is no standard of care there? Thank you. Dean Li : Yes. So, let me just speak to, we look at both our both sotatercept, and I would just also emphasize our inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase are the same sort of general sense, which is we are willing to drive it into PAH. But when you look at the mechanism of action, you ask yourself, is there other places that you can affect diseases, that aren\u2019t pulmonary arterial hypertension, but diseases where you have pulmonary hypertension, such as diastolic heart failure or, for example, in lung disease. Our expectation is that we want to explore whether sotatercept and its unique mechanism of rebalancing certain molecular pathways could also be applied to those patients who have diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. And given the impact that sotatercept has that we have seen already with PAH, that gives us a little bit more confidence that that mechanism may be applicable to those people with diastolic heart failure. Equivalent is as we moved our in-house soluble guanylate cyclase. Operator : I am sorry, your conference will end in five minutes. Dean Li : In PAH, we are also evaluating whether that molecule could also be used in those patients with lung disease who have pulmonary hypertension. So, the results give us more confidence at the next step. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Mohit. Next question please Leo. Operator : Next question Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. One moment here and you may go ahead Chris. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. To follow on Steve\u2019s question to Rob in terms of the response about what you are most proud about. You talked about the successful implications of spinning off the Organon business and having an organization have a little bit of a simpler structure and focus. I want to juxtapose the question of the animal health business. Talk a little bit about your views these days in terms of how that fits the capital allocation priorities, whether you envision potential for that to be a strategic step that you would consider to perhaps separate that business. Thank you. Rob Davis : Sure. Chris, thanks for the question. As we have said in the past, we are always looking at the portfolio. We were always asking what is the best structure to develop and generate long-term value for our business and for our shareholders. And with that view, we continue to believe that the animal health business is a key growth driver for us. It brings a lot of synergies, frankly, in both directions. Obviously, they are benefiting from their ability to access the science on the human health side. We are benefiting from the value they bring and, in some cases, frankly, on the vaccine side, some of the manufacturing technologies are actually being brought over into the human health side. So, we do see synergies in these two businesses. We continue to believe that our ability to invest fully to optimize the opportunity in animal health is there. I think we have demonstrated that to the capital we have deployed and that capital is paying off. And I don\u2019t believe that business would have the capital it\u2019s had to grow if it wasn\u2019t part of Merck. So, it\u2019s benefiting from what we can bring to them. We are benefiting from what it brings to us and as of now we continue to see it as a strategic asset. So, no plans to look at spinning it. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks Chris. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Luisa Hector : Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a little bit more on islatravir, given your confidence to continue development. Can you say any more about the impact the drug is having on lymphocytes at the lower dose? Clearly, you are able to move forward to the regulator is happy. Is there some level of lymphocyte reduction that the regulator will accept? And how should we think about the risk of resistance development with the lower dose? And when might we see some Phase 3 data? Thank you. Dean Li : Thank you very much for that question. So, I just want to emphasize that islatravir is one molecule in our suite of NRTTI molecule. And as you mentioned, we are very interested in the importance of this body of molecules and mechanism, both for the prep setting and for the treatment setting. And it has the possibility of really transforming the longer-acting space. Specifically to your question, we have a large range of clinical data as many\u2026 Operator : We are sorry, your conference will end in one minute. Peter Dannenbaum : Excuse me, Dean. Leo, our conference will continue past 9 :00 a.m. Operator : We are attempting to make sure that happens, sir. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you. We are prepared to go a few extra minutes. Dean Li : And so we have a plethora of clinical data. We are very confident that the 0.25 milligrams will be effective. We are confident that the effects on lymphocytes and CD4 T-cells will be comparable to any standard antiviral. And so that\u2019s in the Q day. We are also very interested in moving to the Q week with our partner, Gilead. And hopefully, that will begin to get posted more, but we are focusing on amending the protocol and the dosing regimen under the guidance of the FDA. And I also want to emphasize that we will continue to be committed on the two-month oral. I mean just think, 12 pills a year, 12 pills a year for patients who are high-risk take with PREP. We have MK-8527, it is a different molecule in our suite of NRTTIs. End of Q&A: Operator : We are sorry your conference is ending now. Please hang up. Peter Dannenbaum : Okay. So for those that are still on the line, thank you very much. We\u2019ll have to close the call there because of those technical difficulties. For those that were in the queue, please follow up with IR and we\u2019ll hope to get your questions answered. Thank you all very much.",

At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Merck\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2021 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today\u2019s call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. The presentation, today\u2019s earnings release, as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck\u2019s website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. 2022 was an exceptional year for Merck. Our science-led strategy is working and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what our team has delivered scientifically, commercially and operationally. We are focusing on what matters and keeping the patient at the center of everything we do. We made significant progress in 2022 advancing our broad pipeline, with important internal success complemented by a portfolio of strategic acquisitions, collaborations and partnerships. We have moved with speed and urgency to drive strong progress and we have provided increased transparency into several of our long-term opportunities, including for GARDASIL, for our cardiovascular pipeline, and more recently, from newer assets that leverage our leadership position in Oncology. We enter 2023 with even greater confidence that we are creating a sustainable engine that will bring forth innovation and generate value for both patients and shareholders over the long-term. Turning first to our results. The business is performing extremely well. The growth we have experienced in 2022 reflects a sustained track record of fundamental strength from our de-risked key growth pillars. We begin the year with confidence that we will maintain this strong underlying growth, after taking into account the significant impact LAGEVRIO had during the height of the pandemic last year and are pleased to reflect this in our 2023 initial guidance. Importantly, our pipeline is advancing with significant progress across several late-stage programs. In Oncology, we have expansive research efforts, including our ambition to move treatment into earlier stage settings where there is higher potential for more favorable longer term outcomes for patients. In December, along with our partner Moderna, we were pleased to announce highly encouraging Phase 2 results for a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine in combination with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of adjuvant melanoma. We are excited by the potential that this combination may have for patients across a range of tumor types. And last week, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy, which Caroline and Dean will speak to. In Cardiovascular, we are exploring candidates across a broad range of diseases and have made substantial progress from just one year ago. At the American College of Cardiology conference, we will present data from the STELLAR trial evaluating sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension and from the Phase 2 trial of MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor and we will also host an investor event to discuss these programs. In Vaccines, Instituto Butantan in Brazil, with whom we are collaborating for vaccine development, reported very encouraging topline results for their candidate for the prevention of dengue. These data will inform future development of our dengue vaccine, V181, and our efforts to address this critical public health challenge. Finally, through our business development efforts, we brought in four programs which will have phase three trial starts in 2023 and which have the opportunity to contribute meaningful growth during the latter half of this decade and into the next. We are following our disciplined approach to business development and we will act when scientific opportunity and value align. We have more to do, but I feel very good about the progress we made in 2022 and we believe that all of these efforts will lead to real benefits for patients and in turn for shareholders. We enter 2023 with confidence in the innovation engine we are building and our ability to deliver sustainable value for patients well into the next decade. We will continue to execute on our de-risked assets and act with urgency to advance and grow our pipeline. We are doing all of this with an approach to sustainability that is closely aligned to our overall business strategy. I am very confident in the short- and long-term outlook of our company, and I look forward to providing future updates.  With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, 2022 was an exceptional year for our company. We delivered excellent topline growth of 22% driven by strength across our key pillars of Oncology, Vaccines and Hospital, as well as a significant contribution from LAGEVRIO. Our Animal Health business delivered strong operational growth, which was offset by foreign exchange. These results are a testament to the profound impact our medicines and vaccines are having on patients globally, which are enabled by our dedicated teams who are executing with excellence to deliver these important innovations. We are confident in the health of our business and in our outlook for continued strong underlying growth. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange, the business delivered strong operational growth of 8%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses continued their strong growth increasing 9% and 6%, respectively. Now, turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.5 billion, driven by strong global demand for in-line indications, as well as continued global expansion from new approvals. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from uptake in earlier-stage cancers, including triple negative breast cancer, as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA continues to have a profound impact on patients, including in earlier-stage cancers, where there is greater potential for better outcomes. We are excited by the recent approval of KEYNOTE-091, which represents KEYTRUDA\u2019s seventh indication in earlier-stage cancers. Early lung cancer detection and screening remain an important unmet need. It is our ambition, along with others to improve lung cancer screening rates to levels similar to other tumor types, such as breast, where screening programs are more routine. While we are committed to addressing this unmet need, we anticipate a more gradual near-term uptake from this indication. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintains its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, which gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to positively impact patients in the earlier setting. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in metastatic indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma, as well as recent launches in earlier-stage cancers, including certain types of high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Lynparza maintains its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Alliance revenue grew 14% primarily due to continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 9%, driven by increased uptake in the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced endometrial cancer in the U.S. Lastly, WELIREG is performing in-line with our expectations and we are proud of the impact it is having on adult patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered growth, with GARDASIL increasing 6% to $1.5 billion, driven by strong demand in major ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. In the U.S., sales decreased primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns. Vaccines sales also benefited from the pediatric launch of VAXNEUVANCE, which is off to an encouraging start, with revenues also benefitting from inventory stocking. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 7%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. Hospital Acute Care sales also benefitted from the resupply of ZERBAXA, which started in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 6% reflecting strategic price actions and volume growth. Livestock sales grew 12% driven by increased demand in ruminants and poultry products. Companion animal sales were negatively impacted by supply challenges for certain vaccines and a reduction in vet visits in October, which improved during the quarter. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 0.9 percentage points due to favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Operating expenses increased 8% to $5.7 billion, reflecting increased investments to support our portfolio and growing pipeline. Other income was $86 million, reflecting the return on pension plan assets and capitalized interest, which was largely offset by net interest expense. Our tax rate was 15.6%. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.62.  Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The strength across our key pillars is expected to continue into this year. We project revenue to be between $57.2 billion and $58.7 billion, including approximately $1 billion from LAGEVRIO. Excluding the negative impact of LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-January rates, we expect strong underlying revenue growth of 7% to 10%. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 77%.  Operating expenses are assumed to be between $23.1 billion and $24.1 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of research and development expenses related to our acquisition of Imago and the expansion of our collaboration with Kelun Biotech. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other Income is anticipated to be approximately $250 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 17% and 18% and approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $6.80 to $6.95. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4% using mid-January rates. Our guidance reflects confidence in the continued strong growth across Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. On revenues, we are confident in our ability to drive strong growth of GARDASIL, particularly in international markets. Global immunization levels remain low, which creates a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients and we are improving supply, which positions us well to support the significant demand we are experiencing today and expect over the long-term for this vaccine that prevents HPV-related cancers. Other Revenue is projected to decline significantly, primarily reflecting a smaller planned benefit from revenue hedges following the U.S. dollar strength last year, which resulted in an approximate $800 million benefit in 2022. Other revenue is also expected to be lower due to the discontinuation of third-party manufacturing sales to Johnson and Johnson. On the rest of the P&L, we project a shift from other expense to other income, which is primarily attributable to an assumption that there will be no pension settlement cost, as well as an expectation of lower net interest expense and higher joint venture equity income. This benefit is more than offset by an increase in the estimated tax rate due to the unfavorable impact of the R&D capitalization provision, as well as an approximate 1 percentage point impact related to Imago. Now shifting to capital allocation, where our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are excited about the significant progress our team has made to advance and augment our pipeline in 2022. In 2023, we will continue to invest in opportunities that will address important unmet medical needs and drive the next wave of growth for our company, including the initiation of many late-stage clinical trials across a broad set of novel candidates. We remain committed to our dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. We will continue to pursue the most compelling external science through value-enhancing business development to augment our internal pipeline and will invest appropriately to maximize the potential of our R&D programs. Given the strength of our business and balance sheet, we plan to resume share repurchases, while ensuring we maintain ample capacity to pursue additional business development, which is the higher priority. To conclude, we enter 2023 confident in our ability to execute on the important opportunities we have to deliver innovation to patients and sustain the strong underlying growth of our business well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dr. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Today, I will provide notable updates since our last earnings call. We continue to make significant advancements and achieve important regulatory milestones. The fourth quarter marks the end of a successful year with progress made across Oncology, Vaccines, Infectious Diseases and Cardiology. Let me start with Oncology. We remain committed to transforming the landscape of cancer therapy with an ongoing focus on treating earlier stages of disease. We are pleased by the recent approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with Stage Ib, II or IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy based on the results of KEYNOTE-091. This approval provides for the very first time an adjuvant immunotherapy option for this patient population with Stage Ib disease and regardless of PD-L1 status. Beyond KEYNOTE-091, we have additional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer including, KEYNOTE-671 evaluating KEYTRUDA with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant therapy in resectable Stage II, IIIa and IIIb disease, KEYNOTE-867 evaluating KEYTRUDA in patients undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy with unresected Stage I or II disease, and KEYLYNK-012 studying KEYTRUDA in combination with Lynparza in Stage III disease. These trials are all part of our broader effort to treat earlier stages of cancers and further improve patient outcomes across tumor types, such as melanoma. Together with Moderna, we announced positive Phase 2 results for V940/mRNA-4157, in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage III and IV melanoma in patients with high risk of recurrence following complete resection. The combination demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in recurrence free survival versus KEYTRUDA alone. This investigational personalized neoantigen therapy utilizes mRNA technology and is specifically tailored to target the unique mutational signature of each patient\u2019s tumor. We plan to discuss the results with regulators and initiate Phase 3 trials in multiple tumors this year. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. We also announced positive results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-966 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy. This trial demonstrated an improvement in overall survival for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable biliary tract cancer. In addition, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In November, we announced the acquisition of Imago Biosciences, which closed last month. Imago\u2019s lead candidate, bomedemstat, is a potentially first-in-class orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor. It is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. The combined team is now focused on continuing to advance the ongoing clinical development programs. At the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, data were presented from multiple pipeline candidates including, favezelimab, our anti-LAG3 antibody, zilovertamab vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate, targeting ROR-1, nemtabrutinib, our oral reversible, non-covalent BTK inhibitor, as well as KEYTRUDA. Updated Phase 2 data for bomedemstat in essential thrombocythemia and advanced myelofibrosis were also presented. We continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy. In the European Union, along with our partner, Astra Zeneca, we announced the approval for Lynparza, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone, for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the PROpel trial. In China, based on the results of KEYNOTE-522 and KEYNOTE-394, we received approvals for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant / adjuvant high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. With our partners, Astellas and Seagen, we announced the FDA has accepted supplemental biologics license applications for KEYTRUDA with PADCEV, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4, for the first-line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The agency set a PDUFA date of April 21, 2023 for each application. Building on the clinical benefits observed with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and antibody drug conjugates, we have focused on augmenting our tissue targeting candidates through business development. We announced the expansion of our agreement with Kelun Biotech with the addition of up to seven preclinical antibody drug conjugates. The collaboration leverages technology with the potential to yield a new generation of candidates designed to precisely target and deliver potent anticancer agents to the tumor site. This follows previously disclosed agreements for two clinical stage candidates, including MK-2870, an investigational TROP2 targeting ADC we are planning to advance into Phase 3 trials this year. We also expanded our collaboration with PeptiDream to include the discovery and development of peptide drug conjugates. This technology potentially provides for improved permeability and drug selectivity in targeting tumor tissue. Next to our Vaccines portfolio. We were encouraged by the progress scientists and clinicians at the Instituto Butantan in Brazil made in developing a single dose dengue vaccine candidate for registration in Brazil. We are collaborating with the team there to conduct a detailed analysis of these positive, topline Phase 3 results to determine next steps for our own dengue vaccine candidate, V181, currently in Phase 2 development. Merck\u2019s goal is to make V181 available outside of Brazil for populations at-risk for dengue. As Caroline noted, we are receiving positive feedback from the field regarding the recent launch of VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting and remain confident in our population specific strategy for the prevention of pneumococcal disease. VAXNEUVANCE offers strong protection, including in the first year of life, with robust immunity across all shared and unique serotypes. This is important because the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is greatest in the first year of life for children. Also, we are on track and look forward to the Phase 3 results from our V116 program for the protection of adults this year. We, along with others in the industry, are making a real impact in our goal to help reduce cancer incidence. It was noteworthy that the American Cancer Society\u2019s recently published annual report on cancer facts and trends included the remarkable observation that there has been a 65% reduction in cervical cancer incidence in women 20 years old to 24 years old from 2012 through 2019. It is this type of finding that further reinforces Merck\u2019s commitment to bringing forward treatment and prevention options to help patients with this devastating disease. As part of this commitment, we are encouraged by the role GARDASIL continues to play in helping to prevent certain HPV related cervical cancers. Turning to the broader portfolio. With the continued impact of COVID-19 in China, treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce the incidence of disease and burden on healthcare systems. We were pleased LAGEVRIO was granted conditional marketing authorization by China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration in December, for use in adult patients who have mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and a high risk of progressing to severe cases. I wish to reinforce something Rob mentioned. Please mark your calendars for March 6th where we will present detailed findings of the Phase 3 STELLAR trial evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Phase 2 results for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, at the American College of Cardiology in conjunction with the World Congress of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans. We will also host a live investor event to answer your questions. We look forward to bringing sotatercept as an important treatment option to patients and are currently working towards submission of the data from the STELLAR trial. We are in discussions with the FDA about submission of the data on a rolling basis, which is likely to result in a potential approval in early 2024. As we close out 2022, it is important to highlight that over the course of the year we made strong progress across therapeutic areas, modalities, stages of development and multiple business development transactions. In Oncology, we obtained several important regulatory approvals globally for KEYTRUDA and Lynparza, as well as advanced a number of programs evaluating earlier stage cancer regimens. In Vaccines, we received an important approval in pediatrics for VAXNEUVANCE. In addition, we were granted expanded authorizations in China and active recommendations were reinstated in Japan for GARDASIL. In HIV, we resumed our clinical development program for islatravir. And finally in cardiovascular disease, we made significant progress across our pulmonary arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia programs.  Taken together, we continue to deliver on our strategy of advancing promising candidates across multiple therapeutic areas. We have strong momentum across our pipeline and look forward to providing further updates on our progress in 2023. And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Dean. Kelly, we are ready to take questions now. We intend to end the call at 9 sharp this morning, so request that analysts limit themselves to one question, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is open. Carter Gould : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just you made some comments around sort of uptake in the adjuvant setting after the most recent label update. Can you maybe just sort of set expectations there and does that comment reflect any sort of assumptions around when we might see mature data from the PEARLS study potentially this year? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. So I believe you are speaking about KEYNOTE-091. So I just want to take a broad view and then today view and the tomorrow view. So I would just count that the American Cancer Society in 2023, it\u2019s really remarkable. They suggest that for between 1991 and 2023, there\u2019s a massive reduction in lung cancer of 58%, 36% and KEYTRUDA has been critical in that story and now we are moving to early lung. The label is broad. It is regardless of PD-L1 and it reflects the clinical trial, where we demonstrated a 27% reduction. We are pushing into these earlier lines with other trials. But I think for what we need to set for is two things. We need to make it much more easier with scientific innovation other means to get subcu, I mean, to get KEYTRUDA and that\u2019s why we are very eager to push our subcu pembrolizumab with [inaudible] to face through this year. But we also need to do a lot to improve adherence to established guidelines, which currently only have 6% or so of individuals actually who should be screened in the United States. So, I think, with that, we have work to do in relationship to really taking this important advance and making it broadly available through to individuals who should be getting screened. Rob Davis : So, Carter, maybe I can just add on a little bit about the commercial opportunity. As Dean said, this will be a slower ramp, because we have to drive more people to get diagnosed early so that we can get them the care they need. But just to give you some sizing of this. If you look at 2023, there are about 230,000 people who were diagnosed with lung cancer in U.S. and the majority of that group was not diagnosed until they were in the metastatic setting. So if you think about it from a minority perspective, we would estimate about 120,000 people in the early-stage setting, of which only a quarter will have a section or have surgery and be in the Stage Ib to IIIa, which is what our label indicates. So you are looking at about 30,000 patients who would be the addressable population and then obviously, of that group, historically, only about half of those patients have gone on to receive treatment in the form of chemotherapy or IO. So that\u2019s obviously something we hope to change as we go forward, because we think the outcome will show that if you are resected, you should pursue KEYTRUDA in that setting and it\u2019s our goal over time not only to drive more patients in that segment. But, obviously, the more people we can get diagnosed early pre-metastatic, then actually we will expand the population over time. So we see this as a meaningful opportunity long-term that is going to take us time to ramp as we work to change the paradigm that\u2019s existed in the past. Thank you, Carter. Next question, please, Kelly? Operator : Our next question is going to come from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew Baum : Hi. Thank you. A couple of questions, could you please address the demand on Merck\u2019s business to the hole associated with the KEYTRUDA LOE post-2028 or alternatively instead just build the exit growth rate and focus less on finding revenues to plug the hole as you think about your strategy? And perhaps quickly for, Dean, could you just give us some guidance on the timing for the PFS analysis and the PD-L1 high, greater than 50 cohort from KEYVIBE-003. Should we expect it in the next 12 months? I know the total PFS reset for the whole trial is somewhere in 2024, but it strikes me you may have a mere separate analysis for that greater than 50 subgroup? Thank you. Rob Davis : Great. Well, maybe, Andrew, I will start off and if Caroline or Dean want to jump in. But to give you a sense, obviously, we haven\u2019t given specific guidance to the LOE period. But just to ground everyone into facts, KEYTRUDA and our expectation will lose exclusivity in the United States in 2028 and in China in 2028. It leaves it in Europe in 2030 and in Japan in 2032. So, obviously, by shorthand, we refer to 2028, but the reality of it is over most of the markets and KEYTRUDA increasingly is becoming, as you know, a global product, it\u2019s spread out. But as we look at where we sit today, I would say, we feel good about the progress we have made. We are confident that we are on a path to sustainable growth into the next decade. Obviously, we have more work to do, but I would just point to you to a few proof points that I think support that. First of all, as we talked about in the last 18 months, we have made meaningful progress in our cardiovascular pipeline. We have eight potential approvals between 2025 and 2030. Obviously, the centerpiece of that is sotatercept and what we are seeing from the STELLAR data, which really was just quite phenomenal. If you look at that, we expect those products, that portfolio of opportunity on an unrisk adjusted basis to be in excess of $10 billion as you approach the mid-2030s. We recently discussed the fact we see the business development deals we have done. We have brought in new assets apart from KEYTRUDA, apart from Lynparza, Lenvima and WELIREG, that themselves, these new mechanisms, I would point you to things like Orion and Imago, those products, along with what we see in the ADC space as a portfolio, we think themselves have the potential for $10 billion or more of revenue as you get into the early to mid-2030s. So today we sit there with the expectation that we are starting to make meaningful progress and that excludes all the work we are doing to bring an incremental value to patients on KEYTRUDA. Obviously, as great as KEYTRUDA is, it still only has an overall response rate averaging around 30%. We need to deepen and drive better response. We are looking to do that through combinations and through other means to find ways to improve on KEYTRUDA. We are looking to continue to expand into new tumor types as well and clearly move into earlier lines of therapy where we believe we can start to move to a point that we can actually give people an extension of life, and hopefully, someday get to a point that we talk about cancer a chronic disease, not a fatal disease. Obviously, we have more to do there, but that is the aspiration and we have a lot of efforts underway to do that through what we are doing in IO combinations, IO/ADC combinations with our subcutaneous offering. And then, obviously, we are very excited recently about the deal we did with Moderna for the personalized cancer vaccine, which is really a therapeutic that we think, in combination with KEYTRUDA, while we are studying in first in melanoma, obviously, we believe, has the potential to move into broader tumor. So that in and of itself gives us a lot of confidence and we are doing similar activities with Lynparza, with Lenvima, and obviously, WELIREG it\u2019s in early days. So if you look at the total of that and I have even gotten into our Vaccines portfolio and what we see as excitement there, we feel like we have made a lot of progress. We have more to do, but that\u2019s why you hear me talk more about how do we build the sustainable engine to drive growth well into the next decade and that really should be a focus point, because I am confident, if we do that well, the LOE of KEYTRUDA will take curve itself. So Dean? Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. So there was a question on our TIGIT program, KEYTRUDA plus TIGIT. Just to remind everyone, we have nine ongoing trials. We have five Phase 3s. In fact, just recently, we opened up KEYVIBE-10, which is Phase 3 in early melanoma. In relationship to KEYVIBE-003, which I think is the question, we added the TPS greater than 50% as an endpoint. These are event driven, and as the events drive to statistically and clinically meaningful data, we will announce it appropriately. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please, Kelly. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO. Evan, your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. I would love for you to talk to what might make MK-2870 better TROP2 targeting ADC versus those that we have seen from Gilead and Astra and Daiichi. Also, do you still believe that it\u2019s too difficult to combine an ADC plus IO in a fixed dose combination? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. So let me just state, I -- we will be starting a whole series of Phase 3 trials this year. I really appreciate your question. For me, the critical thing is, whether it be an ADC or whether it be a RAS inhibitor in solid tumors, especially as you want to advance them in solid tumors where IO has been important, the combination benefit of the two becomes really important. So we are very excited to be pushing forward our TROP2 ADC. I can get into the details of the molecules and the linkers and the payloads and the darts. But really, the better sort of thing is, I believe that this year, we will be presenting our Phase 2 studies, and at the end of the day, that will be the most convincing data to provide to you as to why we think we have been important play with our TROP2 ADC, but it\u2019s also the play of that TROP2 ADC in relationship to adding it to an IO agent. We think that is an important considerations when thinking about any cancer killing mechanism in solid tumors. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Evan. Next question please, Kelly. Operator : Our next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise, your line is open. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So wanted to know how you are thinking about your Phase 3 trial design for your oral PCSK9 and how will that design really highlight the competitive advantages of your product? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Thank you very much. So, first, I don\u2019t want to get ahead too much of our March 6 Investor meeting where we are least showing the data that we have in relationship to the oral PCSK9 and sotatercept. I will just sort of emphasize what we are trying to accomplish and what we are trying to accomplish is we are trying to accomplish the most potent LDL lowering oral pill for lowering cholesterol. There should be no co-chain, there should be very little need to interact with the healthcare system, which makes it reach very easy and very accessible, not just in the U.S. but globally. And we need to do it at a price point of what I would call a branded oral medicine would be not in order to maximize the access. In relationship with Phase 3, there\u2019s a general set sort of view of how that is. One is you would drive it, because LDL lowering is such a clean biomarker. So that\u2019s something. But one would also have that, at the same time, drive towards outcomes, which is also going to be important. So our Phase 3 trial design is informed by the history of the field has been and what the FDA\u2019s regulatory sort of outline have been for others. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Louise. Next question, please, Kelly. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is open. Tim Anderson : Thank you. If I could ask you a question on V940 cancer vaccine, what tumor types outside of melanoma, do you already have any positive human data and even if those are earlier stage? And if you don\u2019t have any human data in nonmelanoma tumor types, can you talk about animal data? I am trying to obviously think about what Phase 3 trials you may be starting in 2023 with that product? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Thank you very much. So you are speaking about the wonderful partnership that we have with Moderna in the personalized cancer vaccine. I just want to preface everything. What we have released is topline data in melanoma. That data will be presented sometime in the near-term where we present the data that we have for melanoma and we have work to do to move that into Phase 3. So I -- we have a lot of work to do just in melanoma. I am not going to speak ahead of a human data we have outside of that. But I would say two things that are really important. One is one can watch which of the tumors have sensitivity to an immune approach and one can watch about the clinical development with KEYTRUDA to sort of map out where you would think about doing that. The second issue that I would emphasize is that, when we are talking about an IO-IO strategy, which often people speak about, I view this personalized neoantigen therapy as an IO-IO strategy with KEYTRUDA. And the reason I want to emphasize that is, there is a view that we are beginning to develop that IO-IO strategies may be especially useful in early cancer stages and you see that in our interest in our combination projects related to checkpoint inhibitors, but also in relationship to personalized neoantigen therapy. And so we think that, that\u2019s around that we are going to advance and the critical component for us to be able to advance that is to advance KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy in indications, because it creates us to actually do these clinical trials. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Tim. Next question please, Kelly. Operator : Our next question comes -- Geoff from Bank of America. Geoff, your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Dean, on subcu feature, can you talk about the cadence of data this year and what you are ultimately looking for from a risk/benefit perspective, as you evaluate different technologies? And Rob, I wasn\u2019t sure where this program ranks on kind of your strategic priorities across IO? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : So thank you very much for that question. I think it\u2019s on -- we will be -- when we talk about starting 10 to 15 Phase 3 clinical trials, just in Oncology, this subcu program is a critical component to that and we will be starting those Phase 3 this year. What are we seeking to achieve? I have talked about the early cancer space. Early cancer space, I think, is really important just from a medical standpoint of where we can intact really the outcomes of patients. We can markedly improve that. If you are going to go in the early space, whether it\u2019s neoadjuvant or adjuvant, from my clinical training, working with lung cancer doctors and oncologists, our ability to limit the need for individuals to constantly come to infusion centers is very important and we need to have the scientific innovation to do that. In doing that, we have to think carefully about how do we give as much optionality to three weeks to six weeks in that subcu regimen and that\u2019s what we are trying to drive through in our Phase 3 trials. Rob, did you want to answer anything else? Rob Davis : No. I appreciate the question, Geoff. I think Dean covered it well. This is a very important part of our overall strategy as we think about moving into earlier lines of therapy and then to drive convenience and access for patients, which is very important. So it\u2019s meaningful and it\u2019s something we are going to pursue as fast as we can. Thanks, Geoff. Next question please, Kelly. Operator : Next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I think I have a big picture question regarding IO-IO combinations and the development strategies there, because the common criticism is that, many of these big Phase 3 studies were started with after less than robust Phase 2 data and that\u2019s why they failed to show benefit in Phase 3. I mean looking at your data in Phase 2, they are single-arm data as well. So can you just help us understand what gives you confidence that this is the right strategy to move forward and wouldn\u2019t it be better to do some kind of Phase 2 trial where you are -- you have pembro as a control? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. Thank you very much. I will just emphasize that as a general rule the way that I have begun to develop my view of IO-IO strategies, is that IO-IO strategies are very important to pursue. I think that IO-IO strategies plus other therapies that kill cancers may be especially important in the metastatic, but IO-IO strategies in the early stage could be quite impactful. And so, as I have just said, we have advanced our IO-IO strategy. We have advanced it with TIGIT CTLA-4 and LAG-3, so another component part. But I would just say this, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s one single addition to KEYTRUDA that will have the breadth of KEYTRUDA. So we have been a little bit selective there and I think the movement of IO-IO, not just in the metastatic space, but especially in the early space will become important. And the ability to do that requires your first IO of that IO-IO to be approved in the early space and that is why we are so excited about moving into earlier spaces with KEYTRUDA, because that allows us to execute in an IO-IO strategy in early-stage cancers. Rob Davis : Thanks, Mohit. Next question please, Kelly. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. I think you mentioned that you are looking to review share repo and it does seem like maybe, Rob, some of your recent business development commentary has been skewed towards smaller deals or collaboration. So can you just put into context what you view as an appropriate level of leverage for Merck and should we be thinking about kind of the cash generation beyond that level as maybe going towards repo going forward? And I just have really quick second one, just help me on FX. I think you are talking about a 2% headwind, most of your peers aren\u2019t seeing much given the recent weakening of the dollar. Are there any currencies that stand out we should be keeping in mind there? Thanks so much. Caroline Litchfield : Yeah. Chris, this is Caroline. First to talk to share repurchase, as we have stated previously, it\u2019s our goal as a company to deploy our cash, first and foremost, behind the business opportunities we have within the company, as well as augment that with business development. We have turned on the share repurchase program, given the strength of our business and our balance sheet, but we will be ensuring we have ample capacity to pursue business development, which is the highest priority and is a better generator of growth and value creation. We have a portfolio of BD that we are reviewing and we will continue to do some test have news that we will be sharing in future. So priority remains really investing in the business, but to the extent, there is excess cash, we will return that to shareholders through the share buyback. We will maintain an appropriate leverage for our company. We are very comfortable operating at the credit rating we are at and we would expect to sustain that kind of level as we go forward. From a foreign exchange perspective, in 2022, we were extremely successful as a company in blunting the impact of foreign exchange with our revenue hedging program. The underlying impact of foreign exchange to our business in 2022 was approximately 6% on the topline, 10% on the bottomline, but with our expected hedging program, which brought revenue on the other revenue line of approximately $800 million that blunted the impact to 4% on the top and 4% on the bottom. As you rightly note, as we look at 2023, we expect the underlying impact of foreign exchange to be around 1 percentage point on the top and the bottomline. What is impacting the guidance that we have given is we obviously don\u2019t expect as significant hedge gains in 2023, which means that the overall impact from foreign exchange year-over-year is expected to be 2% on the top and 4% on the bottom. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Kelly. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is open. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I know you guys typically don\u2019t give product level guidance, Caroline. But I was wondering if you can speak at a high level about your Vaccine franchise this year. Obviously, you have new capacity coming on for GARDASIL, but you also talked about the pediatric opportunity for VAXNEUVANCE. So just wondering how we should think about those this year. And then one follow-up for Dean on sotatercept, I know you are talking to the FDA now. Are you still confident that, that single trial will be sufficient for approval or is there a possibility you could need data from the other ongoing studies? Thank you. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you for the question. So the guidance that we provided for 2023 is underpinned by very strong revenue growth of 7% to 10% when you exclude the impact of LAGEVRIO as foreign exchange. The drivers of that growth are our key pillars of Oncology, where we expect continued impact to patients and growth driven the portfolio of indications we have in KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and Lenvima. Vaccines, as you rightly note, driven by an acceleration expected in the growth of GARDASIL as we have new supply coming on line, as well as an acceleration in our VAXNEUVANCE performance, especially given the strong data we have for the pediatric setting. And we expect continued growth strong growth in our Animal Health business. There are some headwinds against that that we have talked about with LAGEVRIO with foreign exchange and with an increased level of pricing expected, especially in Europe with the changes we have seen in U.K. and also in Germany. But, overall, very confident in the underlying growth of our business anchored to Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health. Dean? Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. So, again, March 6th, clinical trial data for sotatercept will be more fully discussed. I think it will be very impactful data and I have no indication at this point that we will need a readout from any other trial from a clinical standpoint to support our filing to the FDA for 10%. Rob Davis : Thank you, Terence. Next question please, Kelly. Operator : Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin, your line is open. Colin Bristow : Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I guess I will piggyback on a couple of the others. On TIGIT, we have obviously seen some competitive data recently and then we have some Phase 3 competitor readout this year. Just what is your level of enthusiasm for this class currently and just what underpins that in terms of the data we have seen? And then just second on GARDASIL, are you able to give any more granularity on the timing and levels of additional supply that will be coming online with respect to the new manufacturing facility? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. Well, thank you for that question. In relationship to TIGIT, I mean, we are very confident on our molecule. As I have said, we have nine ongoing five Phase 3 trials. Pushing the boundaries of what pembro can do or PD-1 can do with another IO agent has been something that\u2019s very important for the field. And the way that I can simply answer your question about the confidence the molecule is, we just opened an additional KEYVIBE study, a Phase 3 study in the earlier stages of cancer for this IO-IO combination. Caroline Litchfield : And for GARDASIL, we -- as you know, we have driven productivity in the existing manufacturing facilities we have and we have two new facilities coming online over the course of 2023, 2024. So it will be a progressive ramp, but I will reiterate we are expecting an acceleration in our growth during 2023. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Colin. Next question please, Kelly. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer, your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. There was a story in New York Times last week, which mentioned Merck has a patent state of 180 patents on KEYTRUDA, and I am curious, since your 10-K only points to the earliest patent expiry date of 2028. Can you speak to the types of patents encompassed in this 180 patent estate and is it reasonable to assume that your true patent estate on KEYTRUDA goes well past 2035? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. So I would just want to elevate the question a little bit. The focus of what we are trying to do is we are trying to drive the concept of inhibition of checkpoint inhibitors can really have a profound effect throughout cancers in all stages in all tumor types. We talk about expand into different tissue types and stages, deepen in combination and extend with routes of delivery, roots of indentation and frequent safety and these innovations are critically important to make sure that this life saving sort of treatment is available. And we are confident in those innovations providing benefit to patients and we have filed where appropriate intellectual property for it -- for that. Rob Davis : Thank you, Umer. Last question please, Kelly. Operator : Our last question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve, your line is open. Steve Scala : Thank you. Novartis said yesterday that it believes the treatment of cardiovascular disease is moving towards infrequently administered injectables as opposed to orals citing very poor compliance with orals. They probably have a good point because the Merck PCSK9 could be associated with GI issues and other issues, which may make oral delivery a challenge. So I assume you disagree is that because indeed, your oral PCSK9 is very well tolerated and clean or do you disagree for other reasons? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : We will be talking about the detailed data from the PCSK9. We believe that it\u2019s very clean. But I will just step back as a cardiologist who trained in the late 1980s and 1990s, the ability to have an oral drug that lowered LDL cholesterol was impactful for the world. Yes, every oral drug, regardless of what therapy it is, has a compliance, so it\u2019s very important to maintain clients. What we are trying to do is to create the most potent LDL cholesterol lowering pill ever made that does not require constant interactions with a healthcare system, we think that, that axis is actually one that\u2019s very important, not just in the U.S., but also globally. And this is personally speaking, as someone who practices early, as of late, as recently as five years ago. If I had an oral PCSK9 LDL lowering pill back then, I would be prescribing it with the other three to four oral pills that I am prescribing an individual. Rob Davis : Thank you, Steve, and thank you everybody for your thoughtful questions. Please follow-up with me and the IR team if you have anything additional and we look forward to staying in touch. Take care. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2022 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers' prepared remarks. These slides, along with the earnings release, today's prepared remarks and our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We began 2023 with significant advancements across key areas of our pipeline and with continued strong performance of our key growth drivers. I remain very pleased with the consistency and excellence of our team's execution, and I'm confident that our strategy is leading to sustainable success. We remain grounded in our shared purpose to bring forward bold science that delivered solutions, which address serious unmet medical needs and importantly, save and improve lives around the world. Our priorities remain consistent. By focusing on our science-led strategy, we intend to bring forward important innovation from our internal discovery pipeline and via strategic business development targeted at accessing the most compelling and complementary external science, leveraging our best-in-class clinical development capabilities. We aim to sustain the momentum in our pipeline in 2023 and beyond, and we're confident that this will lead to strong commercial and financial performance as well as value creation for patients and shareholders over the long term. Speaking of accessing important external innovation, we're very pleased with our announced acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences. Prometheus brings us a potential best-in-class novel treatment that could transform the standard of care for patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, potentially debilitating conditions as well as a broader pipeline and a technology platform that enables a precision medicine approach. It accelerates our presence in immunology, increases the diversity of our pipeline and brings us a potentially significant revenue growth driver through the next decade. This transaction is also another example of Merck acting decisively when science and value align. Turning now to our first quarter results. We delivered very significant underlying growth, excluding the expected year-over-year decline in LAGEVRIO sales. This reflects continued fundamental strength and momentum across our key growth drivers particularly in oncology and vaccines. These results reinforce our confidence in the robust demand for our innovative portfolio and in our outlook for the remainder of 2023, which Caroline will speak to in a moment. Moving to our research organization. We've made significant advancements. In cardiovascular, we shared the remarkable work of our research colleagues at the American College of Cardiology Conference in March. The strength of the data from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial studying sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension reinforces our belief in this important new mechanisms potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients. In addition, impressive results from the Phase 2 trial studying our oral PCSK9 inhibitor suggests that this could be a globally accessible treatment option for patients in need of LDL-cholesterol reduction. The successes we are achieving across our cardiovascular pipeline have created excitement across our company and a belief that Merck will build on its strong legacy of bringing forth breakthrough therapies for the benefit of patients suffering from cardiovascular disease and that these programs will contribute significantly to our long-term growth. In oncology, we were pleased to share the positive top line results from KEYNOTE-671, which showed a significant improvement in event-free survival in certain patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to potential approval later this year. In addition, we are working with our partner, Moderna to rapidly expand our efforts to study the combination of KEYTRUDA with an individualized neoantigen therapy, which we previously referred to as a personalized cancer vaccine therapy in adjuvant melanoma and potential additional tumor types. I'm very encouraged by the substantial progress we've made across our broad pipeline. We're now working on a greater number of late-stage programs across more therapeutic areas and modalities than at any time in recent years. In summary, we've begun 2023 with scientific, commercial and operational momentum and expect strong full year growth across both our Human and Animal Health businesses. I'm proud of the progress we've made, but as always recognize the need to move with speed and urgency to do even more. I want to thank our global team for their steadfast dedication as we build a sustainable innovation engine that will deliver value for patients and shareholders well into the next decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we are off to a strong start to the year with robust underlying performance across our key growth pillars. These results further demonstrate but our focus on science and innovation as the core of our strategy is working. Our success is enabled by the excellent execution of our team of dedicated colleagues who are delivering our important medicines and vaccines to people and animals across the globe. We remain very confident in our ability to continue to deliver in the short term while we make disciplined investments to maximize long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $14.5 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered very strong underlying growth of 15%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our human health business continued its strong momentum, excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 18%, driven by oncology and vaccines. Our Animal Health business also delivered solid performance with sales increasing 5% and driven by growth across both livestock and companion animal products. Now turning to the first quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 24% to $5.8 billion, driven by robust global demand for metastatic indications as well as increased utilization driven by approvals in early-stage cancers. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We continue to anticipate gradual uptake from KEYNOTE-091 in earlier stage lung cancer as we are working with the medical community to increase adjuvant treatment rates for diagnosed patients receiving surgery. We, along with others, are also working to improve upon the low level of lung cancer screenings and follow-up through diagnosis which we anticipate will increase over time. We are encouraged by the positive feedback received thus far. Furthermore, we are excited by the potential to bring an additional treatment option to patients following the positive results of the KEYNOTE-671 study. Together, these studies position us well to extend our leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. We also look forward to providing a new treatment option to certain adult patients with bladder cancer following the recent approval of KEYNOTE-869. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. Growth was driven by uptake in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer as well as in earlier stage cancers, including certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, which continues to launch in additional markets. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Alliance revenue grew 8%, primarily due to increased demand in key European markets in certain patients with ovarian cancer. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 5% due to increased uptake in the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in key European markets. Our vaccines portfolio delivered excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which grew 43% to $2 billion. Performance was driven by strong demand in major ex-U.S. markets particularly China as well as increased supply. Growth also benefited from an acceleration of shipments to China from the second half to the first half of the year to ensure the availability of product to meet heightened demand following the approval of the expanded indication of GARDASIL9 for girls and women, 9 to 45 years of age. Vaccine sales also benefited from the increasing demand for VAXNEUVANCE following the ongoing pediatric launch, particularly in the U.S. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 27%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents. Our Animal Health business delivered another good quarter with sales increasing 5%, reflecting strong demand across our livestock portfolio, particularly in ruminant and poultry products as well as strategic price actions. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.9%, an increase of 6.1 percentage points due to favorable product mix, which reflects a benefit from the lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $6.7 billion, reflecting $1.4 billion of charges related to the acquisition of Imago and our license and collaboration agreement with Kelun. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 12% driven by increased investments to support our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other income was $70 million. Our tax rate was 20.4%, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the Imago transaction, for which no tax benefit was recognized. Taken together, we earned $1.40 per share, which includes a $0.52 impact from charges related to the acquisition of Imago and our agreement with Kelun. Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now project revenue to be between $57.7 billion and $58.9 billion, including approximately $1 billion from LAGEVRIO. We expect strong underlying revenue growth of 8% to 10%, offset by the decline in LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-April rates. Our gross margin is still expected to be approximately 77%. We have narrowed the estimated range of operating expenses to be between $23.3 billion and $24.1 billion. As a reminder, this range includes $1.4 billion of upfront research and development expenses related to the acquisition of Imago and our agreement with Kelun. This guidance does not assume the proposed acquisition of Prometheus or any additional significant potential business development transactions. Other income is anticipated to be approximately $250 million. We continue to assume a full year tax rate between 17% and 18% and approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are increasing and narrowing our expected EPS range to $6.88 to $7.00. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4 percentage points, using mid-April rates. It is important to note that this guidance does not include the impact of the proposed acquisition of Prometheus, which is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. We expect the transaction will result in a one-time charge that will increase research and development expense of approximately $10.3 billion, or approximately $4 per share. The impact of this charge will be reflected in both our GAAP and non-GAAP results. In addition, ongoing investment to advance the pipeline assets as well as the cost of financing will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.25 in the first 12 months following close. As Rob noted, we are very excited by Prometheus\u2019 compelling science and confident that this transaction has the potential to create meaningful value for patients and shareholders. Our guidance reflects our continued confidence in the underlying strength of our business driven by our key pillars in Oncology, Vaccines, and Animal Health. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA has achieved exceptional growth over the past several quarters driven by recent launches, particularly in early-stage indications, such as triple negative breast cancer. While we continue to anticipate growth from these earlier stage indications, the year-over-year growth rate is expected to moderate as we anniversary their very strong initial uptake. Outside the U.S., we continue to expect strong volume growth for KEYTRUDA; however, pricing is an increasing headwind, particularly as we launch new indications in key European markets, which will temper ex-U.S. growth.  Finally, we are confident in our ability to drive strong growth of GARDASIL, particularly in international markets. We are well positioned to protect many more people from HPV-related cancers now and over the long-term and given the strong global demand for the vaccine, we see an acceleration of growth for GARDASIL in the full year 2023 relative to 2022, though not quite at the same level of growth achieved this quarter.  Now shifting to capital allocation, where we remain committed to our priorities following the announcement to acquire Prometheus. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business and growing pipeline to realize the value of the many near and long-term opportunities we see. We remain committed to our dividend, and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a high priority, and we maintain the ability within our strong investment grade credit rating to pursue additional, science driven, value enhancing transactions going forward. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases this year.  To conclude, we remain very confident in the outlook of our business driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We are in a position of financial and operational strength, and our continued excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients and shareholders well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dr. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Hello, everyone. Today, I will provide notable updates since the last earnings call, starting with our progress in cardiovascular disease, oncology, then infectious disease and subsequently immunology with our recently announced acquisition of Prometheus. As Rob mentioned earlier, at the American College of Cardiology in conjunction with the World Congress of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans, results from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept for pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as data from the Phase 2b trial for our oral PCSK9 inhibitor candidate, MK-0616, in development for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, were presented.  In the STELLAR study, sotatercept, in combination with stable background therapy, met its primary endpoint with a substantial improvement in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks compared to placebo in combination with background therapy. The trial also met 8 out of 9 secondary measures, including a compelling reduction in time to clinical worsening or death versus placebo. These findings were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. We are working diligently to submit filings from the STELLAR data to regulatory agencies and at this time, anticipate filing in the U.S. in the third quarter of this year followed by the EU.  We are advancing the broad sotatercept program, including the HYPERION, ZENITH, SOTERIA and Phase 2 CADENCE trials which are actively recruiting. Also at the ACC meeting, detailed Phase 2b results for MK-0616 were presented showing a reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels from 41.2 up to 60.9% versus placebo. Up to 90% of patients receiving MK-0616, at the highest dose studied, were able to reach their LDL-C goal. An oral PCSK9 inhibitor could provide the opportunity for broad, global access. We are initiating multiple Phase 3 studies including in secondary prevention; intermediate to high-risk primary prevention; and for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In parallel, we will conduct a cardiovascular outcomes trial. We are making progress towards our goal of developing medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients with cardiovascular diseases and look forward to providing updates in the future.  Turning to oncology. As I have mentioned previously, a key area of focus and execution has been the development of treatments for earlier stages of cancer where there remains significant unmet need. We announced FDA acceptance of our application for KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant, followed by adjuvant therapy in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA and IIIB non-small cell lung cancer, based on the findings to date from the KEYNOTE-671 study. The Agency has set a PDUFA action date of October 16th and detailed findings will be presented at ASCO in June. Together, with the approval of KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting for certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer, based on KEYNOTE-091, the KEYNOTE-671 study builds on the wealth of data we have generated. Relevant additional ongoing studies include KEYNOTE-867 and KEYLYNK-012. This comprehensive development program, underscores our commitment to an area where there is significant opportunity to improve patient outcomes. Importantly, it also reinforces the need for early detection through lung cancer screening.  At the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in collaboration with Moderna, we announced detailed results from KEYNOTE-942, a Phase 2b study evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with V940 also known as mRNA-4157, an individualized neoantigen therapy, for the adjuvant treatment of stage III and IV melanoma in patients with high risk of disease recurrence following complete resection. These results are the first to demonstrate improvement of recurrence-free survival over adjuvant standard of care PD-1 blockade in resected high-risk melanoma, and provide the first randomized evidence that an individualized neoantigen therapy has potential benefit. The FDA has granted this combination Breakthrough Therapy Designation and the European Medicines Agency has awarded PRIME designation for high-risk stage III and IV melanoma following complete resection. Merck and Moderna plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in adjuvant melanoma this year, and rapidly expand to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. Together with Astellas and Seagen, we announced the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate, for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This accelerated approval followed Priority Review and is based on data from the KEYNOTE-869 trial. This is an important advancement as this is the first U.S. approval of a regimen combining an anti-PD-1 therapy with an antibody-drug conjugate in these patients. The approval adds to the success of our foundational work evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and provides promising evidence for combining immunotherapy with tissue targeted anticancer agents. We are well positioned to build upon this work, with a portfolio of next generation antibody drug conjugates through our collaboration with Kelun Biotech.  Planning is underway for an expansive global clinical development program and we look forward to initiating Phase 3 trials for MK-2870, our TROP-2 targeting ADC, as both monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA. We also announced that the FDA has accepted our application for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. This filing is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival, reducing the risk of death by 22% compared to chemotherapy alone in these patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The agency has set a PDUFA action date of December 16th. This provides us the opportunity to expand upon our approval for patients with HER2 positive disease based on KEYNOTE-811.  We recently announced positive data from the Phase 3 NRGGY018 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with stage III to IV or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. This is an important advancement for women with endometrial cancer building on our approvals from KEYNOTE-146, 775 and 158.  Earlier this year the American Cancer Society\u2019s 2023 annual report on cancer facts and trends, noted that survival for uterine malignancies had not improved over the past four decades due to a lack of treatment advances. We continue our work to provide better treatment options in women\u2019s cancers. And finally the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains a significant and growing unmet need and therefore an area of ongoing commitment. We have gained important insights to date from our trials evaluating KEYTRUDA and Lynparza and are planning to initiate Phase 3 studies of MK-5684, a novel oral, nonsteroidal inhibitor of CYP-11A1, from our collaboration with Orion, by the end of this year. Also, with AstraZeneca, we look forward to the discussion regarding the PROpel study at the upcoming oncologic drugs advisory committee meeting. We are proud of the progress we are making and look forward to hosting an investor event at ASCO in Chicago. Please mark your calendars for the evening of Monday, June 5th where we will provide an update on our oncology strategy and development program. Turning to the progress of our infectious disease program. We are now actively enrolling multiple new Phase 3 studies for once-daily islatravir in combination with doravirine and, with Gilead, have resumed the Phase 2 study of an oral once-weekly combination treatment regimen of islatravir and Gilead\u2019s lenacapavir. We are committed to advancing the science to offer new treatment options for the treatment of HIV. On LAGEVRIO, we continue to prioritize global access during surges of COVID-19 around the world, including in Japan, where the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare recently granted full approval for the treatment of COVID-19. We are proceeding with the evaluation of LAGEVRIO for the treatment of other viral respiratory infections and will share more as studies read out. Finally, to our recently announced acquisition of Prometheus. Prometheus offers a strong scientific pedigree with a candidate that has shown exciting potential in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. TNF-like 1A is, a novel target, which provides the potential opportunity to transform standard of care in a disease area where current therapies are often inadequate and high unmet need remains. Prometheus' anti-TL1A antibody, PRA023, is a potential first-in-class late-stage clinical candidate with a unique dual mechanism of action including anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. PRA023's Phase 2 results in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s Disease demonstrated strong efficacy. Further, at an interim analysis, the data in the biomarker positive sub population suggested even greater efficacy with patients more likely to achieve clinical remission. By combining Prometheus' deep understanding of inflammatory bowel disease and Merck's deep expertise in developing and implementing biomarkers, we hope to usher in a new era in Immunology where patients are matched with the right therapy based on a precision medicine approach. Prometheus' biobank of IBD specimens has yielded deep molecular insights that formed the foundation for the discovery of PRA052 and we look forward to building on that knowledge to gain further insights which will enable the identification and prioritization of additional targets.  In closing, we continue to make progress towards our goal of creating innovative medicines that will improve the outcomes for patients.  And now I turn the call back to Peter Peter Dannenbaum : clinical candidate with a unique dual mechanism of action, including anti inflammatory and anti fibrotic properties. PRA023 Phase 2 results in both Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease demonstrated strong efficacy. Further at an interim analysis, the data and the biomarker positive subpopulation suggested even greater efficacy with patients more likely to achieve clinical remission. By combining Prometheus' deep understanding of inflammatory bowel disease, and Merck's deep expertise in developing and implementing biomarkers. We hope to usher in a new era in immunology, where patients are matched with the right therapy based on a precision medicine approach. Prometheus's biobank of IBD specimens have yielded deep molecular insights that form the foundation for the discovery of PRA052 and we look forward to building on that knowledge to gain further insights, which will enable the identification and prioritization of additional targets. In closing, we continue to make progress towards our goal of creating innovative medicines that will improve the outcomes for patients.  And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Michelle, we're ready for Q&A. I'd like to ask analysts to limit themselves to one question today, we'd like to complete the call by the top of the hour. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Robert Cusick] on for Terrance. You and your partner Moderna are conducting a Phase 1 basket trial of the PCV. Can you elaborate on the design of the trial? And if you have any of the data in-house at this point? Thanks. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. Thank you. This is Dean. I probably want to just focus really on the Phase 3s that we're advancing in melanoma and likely in others. There is a basket trial that's going through to look at the extent of the tumors that a joint sort of KEYTRUDA plus a personalized or individualized new antigen therapy will work. I can just give you a general sense. We have a little bit of a roadmap as to where immune sensitive tumors are, and we would likely prioritize those in our basket trial. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, next question, please. Operator : Our next caller is Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : So my question is actually on the Kelun Bio opportunity. Dean, just hoping if you could update us, I believe, previously, it was stated that we may see some longer-term data later this year. Just hoping to see if that is still the case or if competitive dynamics have kind of changed that commitment? And maybe if you could just help us understand your enthusiasm for that particular product and where you feel it would be likely differentiated from other products in the category? Dr. Dean Li : I'll just answer by the competitive dynamics make us more enthusiastic to push our programs harder and faster. We will be providing data from the data that we have in a series of cancers at ASCO on June 5th. We'll have an investor, but it will also be in the ASCO, I believe, already accepted for presentation there as well. So we're very interested in that. And we're also very interested in the fact that -- as we know, the first evidence of anti-PD-1 with an antibody drug conjugates and our collaboration with Seagen has shown good effect, and we postulate that, that may be a broader impact, not just with one ADC or one indication, but more broadly, through multiple antibody drug conjugates and therefore, our interest in advancing not just the TROP2 ADC but many other ADCs that we haven't provided data as of this point. Peter Dannenbaum : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Luisa Hector from Berenberg. Luisa Hector : I wondered if you could give us an update on KEYTRUDA. Your -- how it's looking in the adjuvant lung setting and relative positioning against your competitor and how any subcutaneous formulation might change that either from the competitor or you? And when might we have that Phase 3 data on your newer former of the subcutaneous? Dr. Dean Li : Let me just grab the question about the early-stage lung. As we've talked, the earlier stages are really important. We've already seen it in triple-negative breast cancer. We've seen it in RCC. We've seen it in melanoma. And I think the aperture of being able to do it in the lung is going to be substantial. Again, for our KEYNOTE-671, which is the first perioperative trial to announce a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS and statistically significant improvement in pathologic complete response. Those will be presented in June as well. I would also emphasize that event-free survival and overall survival are the primary endpoints of our study, and most competitors do not have OS as a primary endpoint I would also emphasize that this is also in the setting where we have perioperative, but we also have adjuvant as well. So we provide a broad treatment choice in relationship to moving forward in the earlier stage. In all earlier stage, whether it be lung, triple-negative, RCC, melanoma, I think it will be increasingly important to provide innovation that allows patients to have \"more normal\" ability to stay on these treatments long-term, there are different profiles than a metastatic patient. And so we believe that giving other routes of administration will be important. And we're advancing our subcu pembrolizumab, especially with higher round of base because that gives us an ability to do both a 3 weeks and importantly, also allows us to do a Q6 weeks because that frequency, I think, will be very important for patients. Robert Davis : And Luisa, I might just add from a commercial perspective, the early stage launch and lung with KEYNOTE-091 is off to a good start. We're actually seeing good uptake. As you know, the challenge here is that the overall screening rates are lower. So it's going to be a slower climb than what we saw, for instance, or we have been seeing with triple-negative breast cancer. But as we sit here today, the launch is going well. And as we look forward, and hopefully, once we -- with the potential approval of KEYNOTE-671, we'll be the only company that has both adjuvant and neoadjuvant offerings as well as, obviously, a leadership position in the metastatic setting. So as we sit here today, we continue to see this as a meaningful opportunity and long term will continue to drive growth for us in long. But obviously, we've got to get that going to do that in the adjuvant setting. From a metastatic perspective, we're continuing to hold our leadership position. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Luisa. Next question, please. Operator : Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Great. For sotatercept, certainly, a broad scope of potential not just from the stellar results, but in earlier and later line, you have HYPERION and ZENITH. Can you remind us if there's potential for interim readouts and if so, potential what time line? And relatedly, what are you thinking about in terms of your overall sort of PH -- PAH strategy? You have assets now with Prometheus as well that have potential to be used in the systemic sclerosis ILD population, a lot of opportunity. If you can just help frame some strategic thinking? Dr. Dean Li : Yes. I would just focus on the pulmonary artery hypertension. I would kind of keep that a little bit distinct from other forms of lung disease, one is a primary vascular. The other one is, I could say, primary parenchyma. So I kind of separate diseases like IPF and interstitial lung disease from scleroderma as distinct from those like pulmonary arterial hypertension. You're right. We believe that sotatercept will be important. We are pushing forward with that sotatercept with STELLAR. We have ZENITH, HYPERION. There are interim analysis, but I don't actually want to sort of lay out, many of them are event-driven. The ZENITH, as you well know, is really in a more advanced situation in HYPERION is really trying to get it more in the front line. We also believe that it will potentially reshape how people think about the treatment of PAH largely people thought about vasodilation or dilation. I think this mechanism is active in signaling inhibitor with the mechanism that it has, which remodels, the tissue will reshape the field and in reshaping it, it will potentially reshape the dynamics of the vasodilatory pathways and that's why we're so excited with our inhaled SGC program, MK-5475 because we think that could be a very important combination agent with other vasodilatory mechanisms that are already approved as well as in combination with sotatercept. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please. Operator : Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Hardik Parikh : This is Hardik Parikh calling in for Chris Schott. Just one question on the BD front. So when you're thinking about the progress that you guys have had in internal pipeline and then now you have the Prometheus deal, is there a priority or a bias when you consider business development from either early or later stage deals or from therapeutic areas, oncology, CV or maybe some emerging therapeutic areas in your portfolio? Robert Davis : Yes. No, I appreciate the question. So obviously, in our view of this is really unchanged despite what you've seen us do both recently and to the fact you made -- point you made, we're seeing good progress in our internal pipeline. It starts with asking the question, where do we see the most compelling science that we think we can use to make a difference for an unmet need and it has a strategic fit and where we see value aligned. And that's where we move. As we sit here today, we continue to believe there are opportunities for us to continue to do business development. We are very, I would say, pleased with the progress of the internal pipeline. And as you look about the therapeutic areas where we have been adding, obviously, areas where you continue to see great science happening in oncology. There's a lot of science in oncology, immunology and we've seen in cardiovascular. So what's been driving us to the therapeutic areas has been the scientific opportunity we've seen. And as we think about early versus late, it really will depend on the confidence the scientific team has and the particular opportunity. So we don't target 1 versus the other. Although I will tell you, we continue to not believe that going after commercialized assets just for the sake of revenue is not our strategy. We're focused on building the pipeline, both near and long term, and we do deals across the full spectrum. We talk about the acquisitions in the Phase 2, Phase 3 area, but we don't talk a lot about the fact we're doing a lot of collaborations and other licensing deals in their early phase.  So we really look at the phase of development and always will be driven by the pipeline. If it brings with it a commercial opportunity, great, but it always will have to have a pipeline element for us to want to go there. Peter Dannenbaum : Great, thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : I guess for Rob and Caroline, would love to kind of hear your latest thoughts on sort of the EU proposed legislation and how that potentially changes how you think about launching drugs in Europe? And I guess also, I guess the read-through would be also to how potential business development as well? And as you think about the timing of the revenues and potentially shorter exclusivity periods? Any thoughts on that front would be helpful. Robert Davis : Yes. So if you look at what the EU just put out, obviously, the high-level message is overall on balance, we are concerned that it continues to put innovation at a disadvantage in Europe and puts Europe at a competitive disadvantage as we think about where to invest our dollars and where to bring new products. Now that said, on balance, there were elements of what were proposed that actually we support. There are elements that we think need to be changed.  On the side of the support, clearly, the fact that they have made some efforts to simplify and modernize the regulatory framework, which has the potential to accelerate approvals. That was very much something the industry pushed for, and we feel good about. But as you point out, the area that balances that, that is very concerning is the fact that they have reduced the data exclusivity period and made it largely contingent upon you're launching in across the member states, whether or not you're doing comparative studies and whether or not you have launches. So we need to understand that. We're going to continue to try to make sure people understand the implications that can have as we think about where we would launch products, and that's work we will do. We have a couple of years probably before this is put in place. So we have time to do the negotiation. As I sit here today, I wouldn't say that I see specific implications to our business development strategy, it's more of just the general theme of what is a push against innovation that concerns us because Europe is an important market, getting access to our medicines to the people in the European Union is important. We want to be there. We just have to make sure it's sustainable from a business perspective. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Carter. Next question. Operator : Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : I have a question on GARDASIL and China. So the GSA contract from your Chinese distributor published a couple of months ago shows really big purchase orders consistently for the next few years and it kind of trails off and declines. And it's interpreted literally it could suggest there was kind of a bolus effect going on where growth isn't linear. It goes up for a while, then it contracts as you work through warehouse patients. Is that how we should think about the longer-term uptake of GARDASIL in that particular market that it might not be linear? Robert Davis : Yes. Just -- so if you look at the GSA contract, it's important to understand that the levels put in that contract are minimums. And in fact, we have shown and our history has been that actually we have supplied well over the minimum. So I wouldn't interpret that as the literal forecast of the business in China because there's opportunities with the expanded age cohorts as we continue to drive penetration in what is still a large unmet population, there is opportunities to do better than what's in that contract. And if history isn't indicative of the future, we would expect to see that move forward. So I would not interpret that as implying a decline in GARDASIL in China over the coming years. Caroline Litchfield : The only thing I would add is from a research perspective, we remain focused on studies in China to support gender-neutral vaccination, which could be a great opportunity to protect more lives and provide growth into the future. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Tim. Next question, please. Operator : Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Ng Ma] hopping on for Evan. We wanted to ask with the sotatercept Phase 3 data, the Prometheus deal and novel assets like the oral PCSK9, does the team now think that this will be enough to grow through the KEYTRUDA LOE? Robert Davis : Yes. I'll take the question, Evan. Obviously, I would start by saying we feel very good about the progress we've made in a very short period of time. So if you look at the opportunity to be in a situation to have sustainable growth well into the next decade. We feel like we've made significant progress. Whether it's -- as you point out, the deal with Acceleron and then I would add the broad and strong internal pipeline we have in cardiovascular that as you know, we've indicated has 8 potential launches in the '24 to '28 timeframe, which has the potential to generate more than $10 billion as we move into the mid-2030s. We talked about the fact from an oncology perspective. If you look at what we have from an ADC portfolio and a lot of the small molecules, we've brought in through business development, excluding anything from the individualized neoantigen therapy, formally what we used to call the personalized cancer vaccine with Moderna. So that's not even counted. We see greater than $10 billion of opportunity from those assets in that same time frame. So as we sit here today, we've made a lot of progress. I don't want to predict to I think we're in a position to grow or not. We're not giving specific guidance. But I would say I feel, given the rate of progress we've made in such a short period of time and given the timetable we have and our resources going forward and the progress that Dean is driving with his team in our labs, I am no longer focusing on 2028. I am looking at how do we have sustainable growth well into the next decade? Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Andrew Baum with Citi. Andrew Baum : Question for Dean. Could you talk to the planned cardiovascular outcome trial for your oral PCSK9, in particular, how you balance some of the historic data supporting the idea that in trial treatment duration is closely tied to efficacy and the parenterals were probably dosed for too short a time suggesting that you need to have a longer trial versus, on the other hand, the impact of the IRA contending returns at least in the Medicare population in the U.S.? Dr. Dean Li : Thank you very much for that question. First of all, I just want to emphasize that we're in active discussions with regulatory agencies in relationship to our program as we define the Phase 3 trial. So that will put out there. The second point I would just emphasize is there is an evolving view that I think the field is coming to grips with. It's not just that LDL is an excellent biomarker. It's not just that PCSK9 is an excellent pathway. It is the fact that our 0616 interdicts exactly in the same place as some of the antibodies how 1 interprets that and how it thinks about biomarker data in that setting, I think it will be an evolving discussion with the regulatory agencies. The second question that you point out is the historic in the previous. I think you're referring to the fact that there is a view that if those studies with the antibodies had gone out a little bit longer, that they would have had a more profound impact in terms of outcomes. Those are things that we are speaking to the regulatory agencies as they think about the difference between the biomarker and the outcomes trial. But I do -- I would echo your point of view, which is one doesn't want to go too short that one risks the full maximum impact that you can have on the label. But that, as you said, needs to be balanced with whatever the IRA looks like how many years from now. So those are the balances. But your observation about the other trials is 1 that we observed as well. And my general thinking is we should try to maximize the impact that we have on patients because whatever that label is, that label will stay forever. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please. Operator : Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. Mara Goldstein : I wanted to also ask a question on the personalized cancer vaccine with Moderna. Coming out of AACR, the response rate for the monotherapy arm, the KEYTRUDA arm seemed low relative to some of the sort of historical comparisons. And I'm wondering if you could speak to that, particularly in light of what we have seen for other therapeutics that are being tested against KEYTRUDA monotherapy comparators? Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So let me just state that it's always something that we do and everyone else does, which is this cross-trial comparison between companies, but also within companies and their own agent. What I will say is that some of the issues that have been discussed was the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm performed comparably to KEYNOTE-054 in the high-risk subgroups, which is 3C and D. and those were also included in the KEYNOTE-942. And in general, the KEYNOTE-942 had more advanced disease than those in KEYNOTE-054. So there is a way for us to sort of probabilitized given the same stage. So we're very comfortable with the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm in the trial that Merck and Moderna proceeded with. I just want to just reemphasize that this to us is an important development scientifically. This is really the first time that I can recall seeing the impact of a personalized or individualized neoantigen therapy or a personalized cancer vaccine that has that profound of a readout in a Phase 2. So we're excited to advance that to Phase 3 for melanoma and to spool up other trials in Phase 3 as we look to see how far we can push this strategy. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Mara. Next question, please. Operator : Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : Dean, on TIGIT, we know the doublet arm was not going to meet the PFS. So by extension, the triplet may have a shot at meeting PFS. And my question is, what is your confidence in getting to at least a 20% benefit or so on PFS? And if that plays out, you just wait for Phase 3? Do you speak to regulator? Like what happens next, considering the second line trial? Dr. Dean Li : So I would just emphasize that I think you're speaking about the Phase 2 trial. And those Phase 2 trials do provide us sort of views of how to think about the 5 Phase 3 trials that we have ongoing. I will just say that those 5 Phase 3 trials are going to be the thing that the FDA looks at. That's what they're going to look at and we're advancing those. And we're advancing them not just in metastatic situations. We have a series of them in lung. But I also just want to emphasize something that I've said previously. It relates to what people have said about KEYNOTE-671. It relates to the question about individualized neoantigen therapy, and it will relate here. When we think about IO strategies and especially IO plus IO strategies, increasingly, our eyes are turning into the earlier stages of diseases both because it's very important for patients. It's a time where we can really interdict early, but we also think that, that's an important place for us to relook on all of our assets that are IO-IO in that earlier stage. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Umer. Next question, please. Operator : Daina Graybosch with SVB Securities. Daina Graybosch : Related to the previous two in your answer, Dean, in early-stage melanoma it looks like you're going to be pursuing 2 Phase 3 combinations in parallel, adding on your TIGIT vivo and adding on the individualized neoantigen therapy. I wonder if you could talk to why you're taking two large shot goal in the same indication? And should we expect a similar strategy generally? And for these two add-ons specifically and other early-stage indications? Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So I would just step back for just a moment. Our ability to go into earlier-stage cancers were just unlocked maybe a couple of years ago, right? And in order to do combinations, it's very important that your base molecule actually has an impact because that allows you to do contributions of components. So we're very comfortable moving our IO-IO strategies in earlier stages. We are doing it, as you said, both for pembro and TIGIT and as well as pembro plus the individualized neoantigen therapy. We're very confident that the desire of patients to be there is substantial. And our ability to recruit and do an important trial there is also important. I would also say that as you see more readouts of earlier-stage cancer for any of our assets, whether it be Lynparza, whether it be an ADC or whether it be KEYTRUDA, it will be likely that we will target multiple combinations in those spaces. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Daina. We're going to try to get to two more questions, please. Operator : Colin Bristow with UBS. Yihan Li : This is Yihan on for Colin. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the quarter. So another question on KEYTRUDA. So how much of a protective strategy in terms of the exclusivity could the subcutaneous formulation of the KEYTRUDA would afford you? Robert Davis : Yes. So I appreciate the question. As we look at the subcutaneous formulation and where that can be utilized, obviously, it's focused more where we have monotherapy as we look at earlier lines of therapy. So as we continue to advance our adjuvant and new adjuvant strategy across multiple tumor types and then where we are combining KEYTRUDA with small molecules. Based on what we see, as we look out, we would expect about half of what we have as KEYTRUDA would be addressable through the subcutaneous route based on that definition of those areas. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you. Final question, please. Operator : Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse. Trung Huynh : Just a quick one. Given your renewed interest in immunology, I just wanted to ask about gefapixant. GSK recently bought a product with a similar mechanism of action for around $2 billion. They had described peak sales in the single billion dollar range. So perhaps can you just give us an update of where gefapixant is post the CRL that you have? And what's your expectations for this opportunity? Dr. Dean Li : Yes, I'll start with that. So as you recall, gefapixant, we had positive Phase 3 trials. We had a CRL. The CRL has nothing to do with the safety or really any major concern that would require another clinical trial. The focus was on the way that the analysis was done in the way that costs were counted. We have submitted additional analysis and will be submitting additional analysis to the FDA in the first half of this 2023 in general, I believe that the timing is that on submission of all of that data, generally speaking, the FDA then readdresses CRL in within 6 months. We have it already approved in Japan and Switzerland. And as you said, there is a renewed interest given the recent transaction, and I don't know if Caroline, would you like to answer that? Caroline Litchfield : So I would just add that today, this is a population that is very underserved, one in 10 people here in the United States have chronic cough. So it's a market that will need to be built. But should we be successful with our work with the FDA, we look forward to bringing forward an option that will be beneficial to patients and will drive revenue for our company. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Trung, and thank you all for your very good questions today. We look forward to hearing from you and engaging with you in the future. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2023 conference call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2022 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers' prepared remarks. These slides, along with the earnings release, today's prepared remarks and our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. We continue to make great progress in bringing forward compelling science to help address the world\u2019s most urgent unmet medical needs. Thanks to the unwavering commitment and discipline of our global teams, we\u2019re advancing our innovative pipeline and executing operationally in support of our key growth drivers. Our science-led strategy is generating innovations that save and improve the lives of patients and animals around the world and is delivering strong underlying growth for our business. We\u2019re building on our strong track record and advancing our strategic priorities. We\u2019re progressing our deep pipeline, including sotatercept for which we have completed our FDA submission, and augmenting it with further strategic business development where we can add value by applying our clinical expertise and leveraging our global scale to accelerate broad access to patients. An excellent example of this is our acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences, which we completed in June. We\u2019re now actively integrating the talented team and are moving with speed toward initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial. The addition of Prometheus significantly strengthens our presence in immunology, an area with substantial unmet medical need and builds on the significant scientific insight we have gained in immuno-oncology. It also brings us a potential first-in-class, best-in-class novel TL1A inhibitor, which provides us the opportunity to transform the standard of care in a patient population suffering from debilitating immune-mediated diseases with a foundation of great science and a legacy of commercial excellence, we\u2019re well-positioned to deliver sustainable value over the long-term. Focusing now on the short-term. We delivered strong underlying growth, excluding the year-over-year decline in LAGEVRIO sales, led by robust demand across key growth drivers in Oncology and Vaccines. We remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of 2023, which Caroline will address in a moment. Moving to our research organization, our promising late-stage pipeline continues to demonstrate tangible and impactful benefits for patients across a broad range of diseases. In oncology, we highlighted data from our expansive pipeline at ASCO, including for KEYTRUDA in earlier stage lung cancer. The strong results of KEYNOTE-671 for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer support our aspiration to fundamentally shift the way cancer is managed by developing treatment regimens in the earlier stage setting, where the potential for better outcomes is higher. Additionally, we\u2019re leveraging KEYTRUDA\u2019s wide-reaching benefit across a range of cancer types to identify and bring forward promising new candidates. At ASCO, we shared positive data for KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, our investigational individualized neoantigen therapy in collaboration with Moderna, in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma. And promising data was also presented by our partner Kelun Biotech for MK-2870, our TROP-2 ADC in non-small cell lung cancer. Each of these novel candidates offer a glimpse into the future of cancer care and the potential to meaningfully improve outcomes for patients. We have also made progress outside of oncology. We\u2019re advancing our population specific approach to pneumococcal vaccination and are very pleased to have announced positive topline results for our adult vaccine candidate V116. If approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults. And Dean will speak to our progress in cardiometabolic disease including positive data we recently presented for our GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonist. I commend Dean and his team on the significant work being done to advance our broad pipeline and their commitment to Merck\u2019s purpose. Innovation is the core of who Merck is and it\u2019s what our company strives to achieve every day. We\u2019re grounded in the relentless pursuit of advancing science and raising the bar of innovation to deliver value for patients. With that in mind, I\u2018d like to speak for a moment about the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ve consistently communicated our support for elements of the law that improve patient affordability and access, such as the Medicare Part D reform, but which do so without damaging the very promising long-term innovation potential of the biopharmaceutical industry. Through the complaint we recently filed in U.S. District Court, Merck is taking a principled stand against the negative long-term impacts of the price negotiation provision of the IRA which we believe amounts to unconstitutional price setting that violates several provisions of the U.S. Constitution. This misguided policy does not strike the right balance between incenting investment in innovation and improving affordability and access. That said, we remain committed to working with the U.S. government to find a better approach to improve affordability and access while protecting further drug breakthroughs that benefit patients facing unmet medical needs. We know it is critical that we provide broad access both to our current portfolio of medicines and vaccines, and to our future innovations, in order to serve the greatest number of patients possible, now and for years to come. Our upcoming annual Impact Report will highlight accomplishments across our four priority areas, including access to health, where a portion of employee compensation will now be driven by metrics linked to our progress. In summary, our science-led strategy is working. We\u2019re driving significant scientific, commercial and operational momentum which we expect will enable strong full-year growth. I want to thank our talented, dedicated and diverse global team for their hard work and commitment to delivering value for patients, shareholders and all of our stakeholders. With these efforts, I\u2019m confident we will continue to drive sustainable success well into the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we delivered another very strong quarter, with underlying growth driven by demand across our innovative portfolio. These results reflect the profound impact of our medicines and vaccines globally and reinforce the confidence we have in the health of our business, and in the outlook for continued strong underlying growth. Now, turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $15 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered very strong growth of 14%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 17%, driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 2% across both companion animal and livestock products. Now, turning to the second quarter performance of our key brands. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $6.3 billion driven by increased utilization from approvals in earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from usage in earlier-stage cancers including triple negative breast cancer, as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We are encouraged by the positive feedback from healthcare providers and initial uptake of KEYNOTE-091, reflecting the significant impact KEYTRUDA is having on patients with earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA is maintaining its leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. Growth was driven by demand in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer, as well as in earlier-stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, which saw continued uptake in recently launched markets. Lynparza remains the market leading PARP inhibitor. Alliance revenue grew 15% driven by increased demand in certain international markets. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 6% due to increased demand for the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales in China. Our vaccines portfolio delivered exceptional growth, led by GARDASIL, which grew 53% to $2.5 billion. Performance was driven by strong global demand, especially in China, where we are benefitting from the expanded indication of GARDASIL 9 for girls and women 9 to 45 years of age. Vaccine sales also benefited from increased uptake of VAXNEUVANCE following the ongoing pediatric launch, particularly in the U.S. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 19%, driven by increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 2%. Livestock sales growth reflects price actions as well as higher demand for swine and poultry products, partially offset by lower demand for ruminant products, due in part to reduced herd sizes. Companion animal growth reflects price actions, including for the BRAVECTO line of products partially offset by supply challenges for certain vaccines. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.6%, an increase of 1.9 percentage points due to favorable product mix, including a benefit from the lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $15.9 billion, including a $10.2 billion one-time charge related to the acquisition of Prometheus. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 10%. This growth reflects increased investments in support of near-term opportunities for our in-line portfolio and disciplined investments for the future as we advance our exciting early and late-phase pipeline. Other income was $19 million. Our tax provision was approximately $800 million. As a result of the Prometheus one-time charge, we had a pre-tax loss this quarter. This one-time charge is not tax deductible. Our tax rate is therefore a negative 18.4%. Taken together, we reported a loss of $2.06 per share, which includes a negative impact of $4.02 per share from the one-time charge related to the Prometheus transaction. Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The underlying strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $58.6 and $59.6 billion, an increase of $800 million at the midpoint. This range reflects strong underlying year-over-year revenue growth of 10% to 11%, offset by the expected lower sales of LAGEVRIO, which we continue to estimate to be approximately $1 billion this year, and an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-July rates. Our gross margin assumption is unchanged at approximately 77%. We now estimate operating expenses to be between $34 billion and $34.6 billion. This range includes $11.6 billion of acquisition and upfront collaboration research and development expenses associated with Prometheus, Imago and Kelun. Our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We now assume other expense of approximately $100 million, which includes incremental financing costs related to Prometheus. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 30.5% and 31.5%, reflecting an increase due to the Prometheus transaction of approximately 15 percentage points. We continue to assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $2.95 to $3.05, which includes the one-time charge for Prometheus and a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 5 percentage points versus 2022, using mid-July rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $6.88 to $7, which we noted at the time excluded Prometheus. Had we included the $4.02 one-time charge and an estimated $0.14 to advance the assets and financing costs, our prior guidance range would have been $2.72 to $2.84 with a midpoint of $2.78. Our current guidance midpoint of $3 represents an increase resulting from the strength in our business of approximately $0.24, partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.02. Our guidance reflects our continued confidence in the strength of our business driven by our key pillars, enabling us to deliver robust underlying growth while investing in our promising pipeline. As you consider your models, there are a couple of items to keep in mind. KEYTRUDA growth has been exceptional in recent quarters, outperforming our expectations, driven in part by robust uptake of recently launched earlier stage indications. We continue to expect strong year-over-year growth of KEYTRUDA, but not quite at the levels experienced in recent quarters, as a result of lapping launches and the impact of continued pricing headwinds, particularly as we launch new indications in key European markets. In addition, there was a small benefit from wholesaler purchase timing in the U.S. in the second quarter, which we expect to reverse in the third quarter. As we look out to 2024 and beyond, we continue to expect strong growth including the impact of additional approvals. And as a reminder, while we expect the pace of growth of GARDASIL to be higher in 2023 than 2022, the rate of second half growth is anticipated to be below the first half, due in part to the timing of shipments to China. Now turning to capital allocation. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business and growing pipeline to drive near and long-term growth across our portfolio. We remain committed to our dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. Business development remains a priority. We remain well positioned to pursue the most compelling external science through value enhancing business development to augment our pipeline. We continue to expect to execute a modest level of share repurchases this year. To conclude, as we enter the second half of the year, we remain very confident in both, the strength of our underlying business, driven by global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines, and the excellent execution of our dedicated teams across all areas of our business, which will enable us to continue to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide an overview of the significant pipeline progress across multiple therapeutic areas since the first quarter call. Today, I will start with oncology, followed by vaccines and infectious diseases and finally onto our broader pipeline. Starting with oncology. The development of meaningful treatment options for patients with earlier stage disease, where there is greater prospect to improve outcomes, continues to be an area of significant progress. Last week we announced, the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-756 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, in patients with high-risk, early-stage estrogen receptor-positive, HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, met one of its dual primary endpoints of pathological complete response following the neoadjuvant part of the neoadjuvant/adjuvant study. This is the first Phase 3 study to demonstrate a positive result for an immunotherapy-based regimen in early-stage breast cancer for this patient population. Further, in women\u2019s cancer and building on our progress in earlier-stages of disease, we announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A18 trial met one of its primary endpoints of progression-free survival for treatment of newly diagnosed patients with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. This is the first study of KEYTRUDA plus chemo-radiotherapy or radiotherapy to show statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival. At ASCO, as part of our investor event, we provided an overview of our clinical development pipeline and highlighted relevant data presentations. We have strong momentum as we evaluate the opportunity for KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of disease. Detailed results were presented from the ongoing KEYNOTE-671 study, evaluating [Technical Difficulty] with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in patients with respectable stage II, IIIA and IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy before surgery, followed by KEYTRUDA monotherapy after surgery, reduced the risk of disease recurrence, progression, or death by 42% versus preoperative chemotherapy alone. Subgroup analysis showed a consistent response regardless of PD-L1 expression, histology, and stage of disease. The PDUFA target action date is October 16. With the approval of KEYNOTE-091, as treatment after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, along with the potential approval for KEYNOTE-671 as treatment before and after surgery, KEYTRUDA will provide the optionality to benefit more patients with earlier-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Further data were also presented for KEYNOTE-942 from our Phase 2b study of KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy in collaboration with Moderna. The study showed a 65% reduction in risk of distant metastasis or death in patients with resected stage III / IV melanoma compared to KEYTRUDA alone. We are eager to build upon these findings and have started enrolling patients into the registrational Phase 3 trial for adjuvant treatment of high risk, stage IIB to IV melanoma, with plans to expand the program to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, data presented for MK-2870, our investigational anti-TROP-2 antibody drug conjugate, licensed from Kelun Biotech showed encouraging anti-tumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, regardless of TROP-2 expression level. We are advancing the broad clinical development program for this candidate with global Phase 3 trials scheduled in lung cancer and additional tumor types. On the regulatory front. Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, an important area of unmet need. In addition, our supplemental Biologics License Application for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer, based on findings from KEYNOTE-966 was accepted by the FDA for review. The PDUFA target action date is February 7, 2024. We also announced new data from KEYNOTE-811, which demonstrated KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival for the first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients whose tumors were PD-L1 positive. Merck has discussed these findings with the FDA and is working to update the current indication for KEYTRUDA. In addition, based on the data from the KEYNOTE-811 study, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. Turning to vaccines and infectious diseases. We have taken a thoughtful and evidence-based approach to establishing a pipeline of pneumococcal vaccine candidates to address the specific needs of different populations, including infants and children, healthy adults and at-risk subgroups, starting with VAXNEUVANCE and now continuing with V116, our investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults. V116 has potential to expand disease coverage to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease in more than 85% of individuals 65 and older, based on 2019 pre-pandemic CDC data. V116 includes eight serotypes not currently covered by approved pneumococcal vaccines, which are responsible for approximately 30% of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 and older based on the same data. Last week, we announced positive topline results from two Phase 3 trials evaluating V116. The STRIDE-003 trial demonstrated statistically significant immune responses in vaccine-naive adults compared to PCV20 for serotypes common to both vaccines, and the STRIDE-006 trial demonstrated that V116 was immunogenic for all 21 pneumococcal serotypes in the vaccine among adults who previously received a pneumococcal vaccine at least one year prior to the study. We are eager to share these findings and plan to present detailed data at an upcoming medical conference. As Rob noted, if approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address the serotypes that represent adult pneumococcal disease. In Infectious Diseases, we received FDA approval for PREVYMIS for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus disease for adult recipients of kidney transplant who are at high-risk of CMV infection. Since 2017, PREVYMIS has been an important preventive option for CMV infection and disease in adult seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and we are pleased to build on the benefits it provides with this new approval. Progress continues in the cardiometabolic space. As Rob mentioned, following the remarkable results from the STELLAR trial, we have completed the submission to the FDA of the biologics license application for sotatercept, for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sotatercept has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, and we look forward to working with the Agency on its review. We are advancing our broad cardiovascular program. Enrollment in Phase 3 trials for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, is anticipated to start later this month. In June, at the European Association for the Study of the Liver meeting, positive results were presented from the Phase 2a randomized, active-comparator-controlled, open-label study of efinopegdutide, our investigational GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonist, in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Based on the findings from this study, efinopegdutide was granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA. We have now started a Phase 2b study to evaluate efficacy and safety in adult patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH. Lastly, the FDA has accepted our resubmission of the New Drug Application for gefapixant, our P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough in adults. The PDUFA target action date is December 27, 2023. This follows, the positive opinion from the CHMP in the European Union. And finally, as Rob mentioned, this past quarter we are were delighted to welcome our new colleagues from Prometheus to Merck. The team is focused on advancing the clinical development program for MK-7240, formerly PRA-023, and leveraging our combined strengths and expertise to better serve patients with immune-mediated diseases. In closing, we have established a regular cadence of late-phase pipeline progress and are proceeding with speed and rigor to advance a promising portfolio of diverse candidates, guided by science and focused on patient needs. Moving forward, we are well positioned to build on this momentum with further regulatory milestones, data readouts and clinical catalysts across therapeutic areas. And now I turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Cedric, we're ready to take questions. We would appreciate analysts limit \u2013 limiting themselves to one question, so we can get to as many as possible today. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open. Geoffrey Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Rob, you opened up the call with some comments on the IRA suit, so I wanted to ask you a little bit on that. I know it's hard to talk specifics on your strategy. But at a higher level, how important is it to get more companies to join the fray with Merck? And are there any milestones to watch for this fall on the suit beyond the initial 10 drugs being named next month? Thank you. Robert Davis : Yeah, Geoff. I appreciate the question. And with regards to the IRA, obviously our concern, and I think it's just worth reinforcing is about what we see as an untenable challenge to innovation in the industry. And that's really the principal reason that drove us to bring the suit. But to your question, as you know now, there are four drug companies actually in total, including Merck have raised suits, all largely following the same types of arguments in addition to -- we have the chamber filed a suit as well as the trade group pharma. So we're all moving forward and our belief is that the provisions, particularly the negotiation provision of the IRA is in violation of both the fifth and the first amendment of the constitution and is not a good policy. That's what brought us to bring to suit. As we look forward, we're going to take this to the fullest, which means we'll take it through district court, and if need be, in the circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court. So really, that's the strategy. I don't want to comment on other companies and whether you're going to see additional companies come in beyond the four that are in now. As far as any kind of triggers to watch for, not really. Because while obviously we have set dates for the initial discovery and some of the initial hearings, this is going to take a while to play out. What I do think is highly likely is that we will be able to see this resolved by the time we get into the 2026 time frame. That's really what we're thinking about and moving through the various courts as needed. But I don't really think you're going to see any large indicator in the near term. This is a longer-term play. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Geoff. Next question please, Cedric. Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Okay. Thanks very much for taking my question. My question is regarding the onetime items. So Caroline, you mentioned regarding China for GARDASIL, as well as KEYTRUDA in the U.S. Would you be able to quantify this a little bit? Just trying to understand the magnitude of how much is impacted by those onetime items. Thank you. Caroline Litchfield : Yes, of course, Mohit. Thank you for the question. So first, talking about GARDASIL, there were no onetime items in the quarter for GARDASIL. We had exceptional growth, that growth was driven by every geography around the world. As we think about the second half of the year though, we do expect shipments to China to be less than they were in the first half of the year and therefore expect the second half of the year growth to be slower than what we've achieved in the first half. For KEYTRUDA, we had a very strong quarter, and that strength was across all indications, including the earlier-stage cancer indications that we\u2019re launching. In the United States, we had sales of $3.9 billion, a growth of 21%. Now that growth included approximately $50 million of benefit because wholesaler buy-in in the second quarter of 2023 was slightly higher than the buy-in we saw in the second quarter of 2022. One of the distributors who has brought in has indicated that they expect to buy out in the third quarter. And the quantum of that buyout has been indicated to be $150 million. That said, we continue to expect strong growth from KEYTRUDA given the current indications we have as well as new launches to come. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Mohit. Next question please, Cedric. Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open. Louise Chen : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask you on your Prometheus Phase III clinical trial, if you could give more color on the trial designs and then when you'll start those. And then if you'll pursue any other indications outside of IBD. Thank you. Dean Li : Yeah, so I'll take that. Thank you very much for the question in relationship to the Prometheus. Again, I just want to level set, for inflammatory bowel disease, there's a lot of cycling of anti-cytokines and then other mechanisms. Some of them actually have a black box. So we're very enthusiastic of moving forward with MK7240 or the TL1A. In relationship to the start of Phase III, the integration is going extremely well. We anticipate to be starting that Phase III this year for ulcerative colitis. And as other data comes in terms of Crohn's disease and other diseases, we'll adjust appropriately. So the start of the Phase III, we are targeting this year and the integration with our colleagues at Prometheus has gone extremely well. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Louise. Next question please, Cedric. Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim Investments. Your line is open. Seamus Fernandez : Great. Thanks. My question actually is on the pneumococcal vaccine, V116. Dean, just hoping that you could clarify for us what statistically significant means and if that actually implies superiority on individual serotypes, superiority on a new metric that perhaps could be an overall superiority to prevent our 20 (ph) in the STRIDE-3 results or if this is simply implying that it was statistically significant because it met the non-inferiority margin. Just trying to get a little bit more clarification there. And as a follow-up to that, just wanted to get a better sense of, if you believe the data, as it sits today, opens up a meaningful opportunity in international markets where national immunization programs have been reluctant to use pneumococcal vaccine in the adult setting largely because of herd immunity. Thanks. Dean Li : Yeah. Thank you so much. So I'll just add a top line, just say I am pleased with the data and it gives me confidence in the path forward for V116. It's not just the data that's going to be presented, but this is going to be presented relatively soon at an international conference, but it's also the path to regulatory approval and eventually in the U.S. to ACIP. So this data is strong. And I just would recount that if approved, as you point out, it would be the first, the first adult-specific pneumococcal vaccine and it covers 85% of all pneumococcal disease in adults greater than -- or older than 65. The way that I think about the vaccine is a 21 valent, is that there's 10 shared with PCV20 and there's 11 uniques with PCV20. And as one looks at the data that will be coming out, one would see that in the shared one there, right, the question always in the shared one is, is there -- how does it compare with the shared ones with PCV20? And in that situation, it has met the non-inferior boundaries. And so I want to be clear about that. Clearly, the 11 unique serotypes are unique to V116. And so the issue for that is whether they're statistically significant, whether are clinically meaningful. And I'm confident as we move forward that, that will become clear. It's really hard to talk about superiority or anything like this when you're talking about the 11 unique serotypes. But I just want to step back because you've sort of touched on it a little bit. It validates the strategy of having an age appropriate serotype coverage. Just to remind everyone, V114 is 15 valent. It has 22F, 33F and has improved immunogenicity for serotype 3. And most importantly, it provides impotence protection within the first year of life. So that's how we thought about that age appropriate serotype coverage. And then V116 clearly is 21 valent invasive [indiscernible] pneumococcal disease and then is driving towards the adult market. But I'll turn it over to Rob to give some view of the prospects commercially, how we see it. Robert Davis : Yeah. No, thank you. Thanks, Dean, and thanks, Seamus, for the question. As Dean just summarized, the data is pretty much about as good as you could expect. So as we sit here today, we're very confident in what this vaccine can offer both in the United States, and we do believe there is a meaningful opportunity for us to take this internationally. So we're going to have to see how it plays out. But as we sit here today, we are excited about this product and ready to launch as soon as we get approval to do so because we do think, as Dean pointed out, we give 85% coverage. That's 30% better than Prevnar 20. It's also better than any other vaccine currently in development. So we think this is an important drug. And when you combine it with what we have with VAXNEUVANCE, our pneumococcal franchise is a significant opportunity that we think could be multibillion as we go out into the future. So this is something we're invested in and we're going to continue to drive aggressively. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Seamus. Next question please, Cedric. Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies Group. Your line is open. Sorry, Jefferies, you line is open. Akash Tewari : Can you hear me? Peter Dannenbaum : Yes. Akash Tewari : Okay. Good. So prior to Prometheus, you guys had a pretty limited presence in immunology. Is there any urgency to build out that part of the business externally via BD? And does your team have any view on the FcRn (ph) inhibitor class, how large it may end up being over time and how maybe one of those assets could fit strategically with your plans in this category? Thank you. Robert Davis : Yeah. Akash, thanks for the question. I'll let Dean speak to the science side of this. But from a business perspective, we actually have had a presence in immunology. You might recall that across Europe and outside the United States, we sold Remicade. So we've been involved -- and Symphony. So we've been involved in this space. As we sit here today, we don't see a significant commercial build. We think actually we can leverage a lot of the capabilities we have. We will invest in this area for success. And then Dean can comment that we have been building on the science side. Obviously, we did the Pandion acquisition, building off the learning from immuno-oncology into the immunology space and now with Prometheus as well as we brought in some really top talent in both the discovery and development area in this area. So I think we're well positioned to drive this business. And obviously, we're always open to continuing to look for additional business development. But it's not something I think we have to do to fill a gap. It's more of how do we continue to augment for further growth. Dean Li : Yeah. I will just answer scientifically. I mean, what we've done with external partnerships or, I should say, acquisitions with Pandion and Prometheus, it should be very clear how interested we are in those fields. I would also note that each one of them has a lead compound that the focus is but there are also follow-on compounds that come through that will be important. And especially in relationship to both of them, Prometheus and Pandion, we've been blessed by the fact that many of those top talent have chosen to continue with us. So we're very confident in this build. The other [Technical Difficulty] is that separate to those external, there is an internal pipeline that is moving reasonably fast and will become more clear in the clinical space in the next few years as well. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Akash. Next question please, Cedric. Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Christopher Schott : Hi. Great. Thanks so much. Just a clarification to an earlier question and a follow-up. Just on KEYTRUDA and growth moderating in the second half. I guess, in addition to the U.S. wholesaler dynamic, I think you mentioned some EU price pressures. I just wanted to clarify, is that something incremental that you're expecting in the second half or more just a continuation of pressures you're already seeing in the first half of the year? And then my other question was just on business development. Just more broadly, the company has been pretty active over the past 12 to -- I guess. 12 months to 24 months. I guess what are just the priorities at this point? And should we think about a pause in activity post-Prometheus or is it really still full speed ahead in terms of looking at further transactions? Thank you. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you for the question, Chris. This is Caroline. In terms of the KEYTRUDA expectations for the remainder of the year, as we noted, we do expect continued price pressure in Europe. Two elements to that. The first is as we continue to launch new indications, we will see likely price reductions as we launch those new indications, but we'll see volume growth as we impact more patients and therefore drive revenue. We also do have the impact of some austerity measures or changes in reimbursement measures in some of our European countries, specifically in Germany with the shortening of the AMNOG review time line as well as in the U.K. with the [indiscernible]. So as we look forward, we do see that those pricing headwinds sustain, but we are confident in the continued growth that we will drive for KEYTRUDA. Robert Davis : Yeah. And Chris, on the business development question. As Caroline noted in the prepared remarks, we continue to have ample firepower to do deals. And while I can tell you, I feel very confident and I know the team feels very confident about the progress we're making with our internal pipeline and with the BD we've already done. If you look forward, we're going to be -- we've either recently announced or will be announcing a number of important Phase III assets across oncology with basically every area of the business, cardiometabolic, what we see in vaccines as well as important upcoming launches. We've talked about V116 data, sotatercept. We can go down the line. So I feel very good about the progress. That being said, we continue to have a priority to do business development. So you should not necessarily expect a slowdown. If and when assets that bring important scientific opportunities present themselves, where we see an alignment with strategy and where we can see value creation, we have the capacity and we will be and are willing to act on those. So we\u2019re actively looking and we\u2019ll continue to drive deals because while I feel very good about where we are, we\u2019re talking about trying to build a sustainable engine well into the next decade. And we want to continue to add to the firepower we have coming out of our own discovery and development labs as well. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Chris. Next question please, Cedric. Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Dana Graybosch with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Daina Graybosch : Hello. I have a question \u2013 thank you for the question -- on KEYTRUDA. I wonder if you could talk about how much remaining headroom you see for KEYTRUDA growth in some of the early-stage markets that you've been mentioning, including triple-negative breast cancer, RCC, I believe it's probably stage 2 melanoma and lung cancer, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Robert Davis : Yeah. So I'll start and Caroline can add in if I miss something here. But the high-level answer is we see a lot of room for continued growth both in early-stage cancers, the ones where we have current indications, and importantly, ones that are still coming. So kind of running through the list, triple-negative breast cancer obviously, has driven important growth, both in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant and metastatic setting. It was a big driver of growth last year in the United States. It's a driver of growth in the U.S. this year. That will slow into next year in the U.S., but we're seeing it picking up outside the United States because we're at an earlier phase in the launch across the world. So that will continue to be an important area. And then you saw today, we announced important data in KEYNOTE-756. So that is promising for a future indication that we could potentially see coming down the path in early-stage breast cancer as well. If you look at lung cancer, we continue to expect growth. In fact, we're growing in lung cancer now, both internationally and in the U.S. But importantly, what's going to drive growth longer term is as we continue to penetrate into earlier lines of therapy, obviously we're early in the launch of KEYNOTE-091 in the United States and in certain markets outside the U.S. We're very excited about what KEYNOTE-761 could be and how that will help drive growth in non-small cell lung cancer. And then across RCC, continued good growth in the adjuvant setting, good growth in metastatic. We have what's coming with WELIREG, which is going to continue to broaden our opportunity there. Great growth coming in bladder cancer. I'll stop there, because I could go on but we want to get to other questions. The short answer is a lot of growth, a lot of opportunity with KEYTRUDA. We're going to make a big difference in a lot of patients' lives as we move forward with this drug. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Dana. Next question please, Cedric. Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Timothy Anderson : Hi. Thank you. I have a question for Dean on the TROP-2 asset from Kelun. Kind of a key debate and a newer debate has been the role of the TROP-2 biomarker and whether higher expression predicts better response. And it's come into focus more recently, partly because of Aztra's top line on their lung trial as well as the Phase III trial they started earlier this year. So I'd like to get your views on the role of this biomarker. And specifically, do you plan to include that as a stratification factor in any of your upcoming Phase III trials? Dean Li : Yeah. Thank you very much for that question about TROP-2 ADCs, especially in relation to the lung. So as a broader picture, I would just say that initially the focus will be in the metastatic, and then depending on how those play out, it may go into earlier stages of cancer as well more broadly. But as we talk about lung cancer, the critical question that the field has to answer us and others, is whether or not you can dethrone KEYNOTE-189. So we're all trying to dethrone Merck's standard of care, which is pembro plus chemo in first-line in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. I will just say, lots of people have tried to do it, including us and it's a high bar to try to overcome. And so the issue for us is how do you overcome that? Because I think if you can prove that an ADC can do that, that will be very important for the field. And so we have our data. It's -- we are very comfortable with the safety. But we think that it may be important to maximize the impact of the TROP-2 ADC so that you can give something meaningful benefit over KEYNOTE-189. So I think the biomarker could be important if what you're trying to do is displace KEYNOTE-189 because KEYNOTE-189 is a high bar to beat. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Tim. Next question please, Cedric. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Shibutani : Thank you very much. With sotatercept, you acknowledged the progress of the filing completed in the third quarter here. Could you just remind us in terms of what your expectations are for potential label? Any nuances here in particular with regard to secondary endpoints that you think would be meaningful from a commercial standpoint? And then recognizing that you have had some commercial footprint, what should we think about in terms of what's going to be required with the potential launch in 2024? And similarly, with reimbursement for a new product, what should we think in terms of the cadence? We do recognize that physicians have been quite aware and enthusiastic about the data. Thank you. Dean Li : Yeah. So let me take the science part of that, Chris. In relationship to sotatercept in the STELLAR trial, I think the label in the U.S. will be reasonably clear and follow that of what the STELLAR trial is. I think one of the things that was really important is that when we declared it, we didn't just declare a 6-minute walk. We declared a time to clinical worsening and death, which was really important because I think that creates a different scenario for us than what we had predicted previously in our ability to go-to-market outside of the U.S. So I think that will be in the label within the FDA. But I think where it's important is it may change the speed with which the international markets adopt sotatercept. I hope that gives you that general sense. But as we move this forward, we are looking, and I think we've said previously that we would have the file complete. And I think given the general sense, we thought that we would be launching, at least within the U.S., in the earlier part of 2024. Robert Davis : Yeah. Chris, this is Rob. So on the question of our infrastructure support and launch, we're actually well positioned. I would remind you that we currently market Adempas outside the United States, that is NPAH. So outside the U.S., we're going to be able to leverage our relationships and our infrastructure there. We -- obviously, we'll add to it. And then in the United States, this is in its first indications. Anyway, more of a rare disease. You're looking at about 150 specialty centers in the United States have actually prescribed this. So this -- we're not talking a large commercial footprint. This is more of a rare disease type of launch. And we've been focused on building out capabilities, particularly as we think about medical affairs, science liaisons and how do we manage the relationships, kind of the complex journey of patients facing these diseases with their physicians. A lot of work is already underway. So I'm quite confident we'll be prepared for our launch, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Because as Dean mentioned, our belief, what this can be globally is much bigger than when we originally did the deal given what we expect to be the label we will see. As far as the reimbursement goes, to your point, this drug, especially in the United States is very well known. The specialists in the area already understand it. They're already waiting for it. We know there are patients waiting for it. So I think you could expect a pretty fast uptake of the drug, especially in the United States. Outside the U.S., we're going to have to drive for reimbursement. That will take longer. But I think in both cases, our expectations and confidence in both the speed of uptake and the potential total volume or total revenue potential of this drug is more significant today than when we did the deal, just given the strength of the stellar results and what we continue to expect. So we're quite bullish on this. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Chris. We have time for couple more questions please, Cedric. Operator : Yeah. So next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Baum : Thank you. A clarification for Dean and then a question for Rob. So just in regards to the previous question about TROP-2, just so I'm clear, do you plan to stratify or select for TROP-2 expression in your first-line -- first and second-line outcome trials, particularly for those patients with actionable -- without actionable genomic mutation. So are you actually going to stratify a select within the trials aimed at that patient cohort? And then second for Rob, if your efforts to repeal or amend the IRA are unsuccessful, would you delay the launch of your oral PCSK9 until you have outcome data in hand? Many thanks. Dean Li : Yeah. So let me just take care. I don't want to get too ahead of what's on clinical trials. But as I've emphasized, especially when we're thinking about first-line non-small cell lung cancer, given what we think is a standard of care, we think that it will be important to review that in the setting of a biomarker selection. And I just kind of want to leave it at that. The precise design will come out as the teams actually roll it out. But we think that, as I've said before, the biomarker strategy will be very important for our push of TROP-2 ADCs into lung cancer. Robert Davis : Yeah. And on the question of how we think about the oral PCSK9 and would we delay for an outcome study, I think it's too early to make that kind of decision because, frankly, how we think about the outcome study and whether or not, and what kind of label we get before we have an outcome study is still something we\u2019re working through. So we need to understand the label, we need to understand the timing of the outcome study. And until I know all those points, I wouldn\u2019t want to get ahead of where we would be. So more to come. We\u2019ve got some time on that one. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Andrew. So last questions please, Cedric. Operator : Yes. Our last question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Stephen Scala : Thank you so much. A question for Dean on the KEYTRUDA data in per-adjuvant ER-positive breast cancer. Should we expect the EFS to read out well before the KEYTRUDA LOE so the commercial opportunity can be realized? How do you think it stacks up to CDK4/6 inhibitors in the adjuvant setting? And is there potential to file for neoadjuvant approval in the meantime? Thank you. Dean Li : So I'll just step back a little bit. So the KEYNOTE-756, as you've noted, is an ER-positive HER2-negative, it's earlier stage, it is neoadjuvant/adjuvant. We've given -- based on the data that we've given in the press release that it's [indiscernible] in relationship to an interim. As you know, EFS is already event-based. And so the question is how fast do you accrue events in relationship to that. And our hope is -- the answer to your question is yes. But we will just have to see because they are event-based. I would just highlight, in KEYNOTE-522, which is triple negative breast, which is also earlier stage, which is also neoadjuvant/adjuvant and also at a positive path CR, we've demonstrated that path CR is a predictive of the future followed up by EFS. And so we'll have to just watch that data as that data advances. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Steve. Rob? Robert Davis : Yeah. Well, I appreciate everyone investing time today with the call. And just really maybe to conclude, I just want to reinforce how confident I am about how well positioned we are to continue to drive value creation for patients, for shareholders and for all of our stakeholders well into the future. And again, I just really want to thank all of my great colleagues across the globe for their substantial efforts. We really do look forward to building on the progress we have in the second half of 2023 and beyond. And hopefully, what you took from our comments today, both prepared and in the Q&A, is our confidence in the progress we're making and really, the difference we can make for patients across an ever broadening area of therapeutic possibility. So it's exciting what we have in front of us right now. Thank you. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you all.",

Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2022 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today\u2019s call, slide presentation will accompany our speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. These slides along with the earnings release, today\u2019s prepared remarks and our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck\u2019s website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. We continue to bring forward innovation that can save and improve the lives of patients and animals around the world. We are advancing our broad pipeline and executing in support of our key growth drivers, enabling strong progress for our business and providing tangible benefits to patients. To that end, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our talented global team. Their passion and commitment to our science-led strategy are fundamental to our continued success. Scientific innovation is truly the foundation of our strategy and it drives everything we do. We are pushing the boundaries of science through the significant investments we are making across our deep pipeline augmented by strategic business development. I am pleased by the continued progress with these programs and our growing diversity across new therapeutic areas and modalities. Along these lines, we are particularly excited by our recently announced clinical and commercial collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo for three potentially first-in-class antibody drug conjugates. The scientists at Daiichi Sankyo are proven innovators in this space, having developed proprietary ADC technology that has resulted in an approved product, which is being rapidly adopted for patients with certain cancers. We are privileged to begin working alongside them to advance this important science and achieve both companies\u2019 objectives of addressing the significant unmet patient need in oncology. Based on our strong conviction in these programs and the profound benefit they may bring to patients, we believe each has multi-billion dollar commercial revenue potential for Merck on a non-risk adjusted basis approaching the mid-2030s. We are also applying our clinical expertise to accelerate the development of other potentially transformative treatments that we have added through strategic business development, such as sotatercept for pulmonary arterial hypertension and MK-7240, our TL1A inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. This is complemented by our strong commercial execution capabilities, which we expect to amplify the impact of these life changing medicines and enable the creation of sustainable value for patients and shareholders over the long-term. Turning to this quarter\u2019s performance. We delivered robust growth driven by demand for our innovative portfolio. We are confident that we will close out 2023 with continued strong performance, which is reflected in the updated full year outlook that Caroline will speak to in a few minutes. Moving to our research organization, as I mentioned, we are making remarkable progress across multiple therapeutic areas in our promising late-phase pipeline. In oncology, Dean will speak to the significant success we are having in broadly leveraging, the foundational position that we have achieved with KEYTRUDA. This includes the continued advancements we are making in the treatment of earlier stage cancers. We are very excited by the recent FDA approval of a KEYTRUDA regimen for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer based on the KEYNOTE-671 trial results, which notably demonstrated an improvement in overall survival compared to a placebo and chemotherapy regimen. In addition, we presented numerous important datasets at last week\u2019s European Society of Medical Oncology meeting, across a wide range of molecules, tumor types and indications. Our progress across a broad set of programs reinforces our confidence in the sustainability of our oncology leadership well into the next decade. We are also making exciting progress in our cardiometabolic pipeline. Most significantly, the FDA accepted for priority review our filing for sotatercept based on the unprecedented results of the STELLAR trial and we look forward to the potential approval and launch in early 2024. We remain confident that sotatercept has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients suffering with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We also initiated Phase 3 clinical trials for our oral PCSK9 candidate, MK-0616. We believe MK-0616 has the potential to provide significant benefit to patients with elevated cholesterol and impact cardiovascular disease on a global scale. We are very pleased with our progress and what we have achieved this quarter, as we continue to focus on advancing and expanding Merck\u2019s pipeline and I want to thank Dean and his team for their unwavering commitment to addressing unmet patient needs. In summary, we continue to move with urgency to deliver on our purpose, pursuing transformative science to save and improve lives around the world. We are executing scientifically, commercially and operationally on the significant opportunities now in front of us, while also making the disciplined investments needed to sustain strong growth well into the future. With the efforts of our global team, we have increased confidence that we will deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we achieved very strong growth this quarter driven by robust underlying demand across our innovative portfolio and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term. We are also making disciplined investments to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world well into the future, positioning us to deliver long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $16 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered strong growth of 8%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 10%, driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 2%. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 17% to $6.3 billion driven by increased uptake from earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand for metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased utilization in both metastatic indications and earlier stage cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer. Uptake in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer remains strong and KEYTRUDA has now achieved brand leadership in this setting, reflecting the significant impact it is having as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage IB to IIIA disease. Our recently approved KEYNOTE-671 indication provides an important additional treatment option to patients and physicians by including usage in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. We remain exceptionally well positioned to serve patients with non-small cell lung cancer and extend our leadership to the earlier stage setting. In bladder cancer, we are excited to potentially expand usage of KEYTRUDA to cisplatin-eligible patients based on the compelling results from the KEYNOTE-A39 study. If approved, this study would more than double the eligible patient population for KEYTRUDA in first-line bladder cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, as well as increased demand in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer. Lynparza remains the market leading PARP inhibitor, with alliance revenue growing 6% this quarter. Lenvima alliance revenue had growth of 30%, driven by shipment timing in China, which we expect will negatively impact growth in the fourth quarter. Growth was also driven by increased demand for the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer in the U.S. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered strong growth, led by GARDASIL, which increased 16% to $2.6 billion, driven by underlying global demand, particularly in China. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales decreased due to CDC purchasing patterns. Vaccine sales also benefited from continued uptake in the pediatric indication of VAXNEUVANCE in the U.S. and its launch in key European markets. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales were flat as increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. was offset by the impact of generic entry in Europe. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 2%. Livestock sales grew 7% reflecting price actions as well as higher demand for ruminant products. Companion animal sales declined due to a reduction in vet visits in the U.S., partially offset by pricing actions. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77%, consistent with last year as the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange was offset by product mix. Operating expenses decreased 4% to $5.8 billion. There were no significant business development expenses in the quarter, compared with $690 million of charges a year ago. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 9%. This growth reflects increased investments in support of our robust early and late-phase pipeline, with research and development expenses increasing 17%. Other expense was $133 million. Our tax rate was 15%. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.13. Before I cover the outlook for the balance of the year, I wanted to briefly touch upon the recently announced strategic collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. This transaction follows a similar, de-risked and disciplined financial structure as we have employed in prior successful collaborations and we are very excited about the opportunity to create meaningful value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance, which includes the strategic collaboration with Daiichi. The continuing operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $59.7 and $60.2 billion, an increase of approximately $900 million at the midpoint. This range reflects strong double-digit underlying year-over-year revenue growth of 11% to 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-October rates. Our gross margin assumption is unchanged at approximately 77%. We now estimate operating expenses to be between $39.8 billion and $40.4 billion. This range reflects $17.1 billion in acquisition and upfront collaboration research and development expenses, including $5.5 billion for the collaboration with Daiichi, as well as those associated with Prometheus, Imago and Kelun. Our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We now assume other expense of approximately $200 million, which reflects updated foreign exchange expectations given recent dollar strengthening and higher net interest expense related to Daiichi. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 39% and 40%, which includes an approximate 24.5-percentage-point impact related to our business development activity. Our underlying tax rate is approximately 14.5% to 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $1.33 to $1.38. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 6 percentage points versus 2022 using mid-October rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $2.95 to $3.05. Including the one-time charge of $5.5 billion or $1.70 per share and an estimated $0.04 to advance the assets and financing costs from the collaboration with Daiichi, our prior guidance range would have been $1.21 to $1.31, with a midpoint of $1.26. Our current guidance midpoint of $1.36 represents an increase resulting from strength in our business of approximately $0.15, partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.05. Now turning to capital allocation, where our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are proud of the significant progress our team is making to advance and augment our pipeline, including our collaboration with Daiichi. We will continue to invest in our pipeline, which contains many assets with tremendous potential to address significant unmet medical needs, positioning us for strong performance well into the future. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Business development continues to be a high priority. Our track record demonstrates our ability to identify compelling science and technologies that have the potential to advance standard-of-care, access such opportunities in a disciplined and capital-efficient manner, and importantly, to rapidly progress the opportunities for the benefit of the patients we serve and our shareholders. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional, science driven, value enhancing transactions going forward. We continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, as we finish the year, we remain very confident in the outlook of our business in the near- and long-term, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and Vaccines and our exceptional pipeline. We are in a position of financial and operational strength and our continued excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dr. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will start with our oncology programs followed by vaccines, immunology and conclude with cardiometabolic disease. Over the last few years, our oncology strategy has focused on leveraging the remarkable properties of KEYTRUDA to establish a diverse clinical pipeline of candidates with novel mechanisms and modalities. This is broadly based on three strategic pillars, immuno-oncology, precision oncology and tissue targeting. In immuno-oncology, we continue to evaluate KEYTRUDA in the metastatic and increasingly in earlier stage disease settings, while also investigating multiple novel immuno-oncology combinations and coformulations. With precision oncology, we are selectively targeting pathways to inhibit cancer cell growth. And in tissue targeting, we are developing agents such as antibody-drug conjugates designed to increase cancer cell sensitivity and killing. The latter is exemplified by our recently announced collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Daiichi Sankyo scientists have made pioneering contributions in advancing novel antibody drug conjugate technology with proven benefit to patients. By combining our companies\u2019 respective strengths, we are well-positioned to accelerate three clinical stage potentially first-in-class candidates with the goal of transforming the treatment paradigm. These include, Patritumab deruxtecan, an investigational fully humanized anti-HER3 ADC, in Phase 3, Ifinatamab deruxtecan, an investigational humanized anti-B7-H3 ADC in Phase 2 and Raludotatug deruxtecan, an investigational humanized anti CDH6 targeted ADC in Phase 1. We provided details during our investor event earlier this week and are eager to begin working with the team. The Daiichi Sankyo collaboration complements our important, ongoing alliance with Kelun Biotech, whose talented scientists have developed their own innovative ADC platform. At ESMO, new Phase 2 data for MK-2870 or SKB-264, a TROP-2 targeting ADC, in patients with previously treated metastatic, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, showed encouraging anti-tumor activity with an objective response rate of 36.8%. This builds on existing data for MK-2870 both in triple-negative breast and non-small cell lung cancer. We are now poised to initiate larger studies starting with non-small cell lung cancer and expand into additional tumor types. We are also advancing clinical development of MK-1200, an ADC targeting Claudin 18.2. Recognizing the proven benefit of KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy in certain tumor types, we are exploring the tissue-targeting concept by evaluating regimens combining ADCs and immunotherapy. At ESMO, in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, potentially practice-changing survival data were presented from KEYNOTE-A39/EV-302, evaluating KEYTRUDA plus enfortumab vedotin as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This regimen represents the first approval of a combination of a checkpoint inhibitor and an ADC. Turning to immuno-oncology. Evidence continues to emerge for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of earlier stage cancer. Positive survival data from KEYNOTE-671 evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer compared to pre-operative chemotherapy were presented at ESMO, further reinforcing the benefit of routine lung cancer screening for certain populations to enable early intervention. Based on the KEYNOTE-671 results, last week the FDA approved this indication with a differentiated label that includes overall survival. KEYTRUDA has now been approved for six indications to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer. KEYNOTE-671 represents the eighth approval for KEYTRUDA in earlier stage cancer. Positive data from additional earlier stage studies in women\u2019s cancers were also presented at ESMO for KEYNOTE-756 in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, for KEYNOTE-522 in high-risk early-stage triple negative breast cancer, and KEYNOTE-A18 for patients with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. The FDA recently granted priority review for KEYTRUDA based upon this study with a target action date of January 20th. We also announced KEYTRUDA significantly improved disease-free-survival for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized muscle-invasive and locally advanced urothelial carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-123. And finally, in collaboration with Moderna, the Phase 3 trial for KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, an individualized neoantigen therapy, in earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer has now been posted and is poised to start soon. In precision oncology, our efforts continue to yield progress. WELIREG, our HIF 2 alpha inhibitor, is approved for treatment of certain cancers in patients with von Hippel Lindau Disease, a rare cancer-prone genetic disorder. Studies evaluating WELIREG in broader populations of patients whose tumors display analogous genetic underpinnings are ongoing. Data presented at ESMO from LITESPARK-005 evaluating WELIREG for adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma following immune checkpoint and anti-angiogenic therapies showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus the standard-of-care. These findings support our supplemental new drug application for WELIREG, which was granted priority review by the FDA with a target action date of January 17th. Additional Phase 3 studies in combination with KEYTRUDA and/or lenvatinib in advanced and adjuvant renal cell carcinoma are proceeding. First-time safety and preliminary efficacy data for MK-1084, our oral KRAS inhibitor both as monotherapy in patients with solid tumors and in combination with KEYTRUDA for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors harbored KRAS G12C mutations were presented at ESMO. Notably, the combination arm showed a compelling objective response rate of 71%. While the data are early, we are encouraged by the potential to combine MK-1084 with KEYTRUDA. In the hematologic space, we will begin enrolling patients in our Phase 3 study evaluating MK-3543 or bomedemstat, as second line treatment for essential thrombocythemia, an area with tremendous patient need. Bomedemstat is derived from our acquisition of Imago. Outside of the U.S., the European Union granted approval for KEYTRUDA for adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are at high risk of recurrence following complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-091. And for KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with certain gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on KEYNOTE-811. In Japan, Lynparza, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone was approved for BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, with distant metastasis based on the PROpel study. Now to our broader pipeline. Building on the ongoing launch of VAXNEUVANCE, which Caroline mentioned, progress continues in our population-focused pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program. V116, our investigational pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults has demonstrated a robust immune response to all 21 serotypes in the STRIDE-3 and STRIDE-6 studies. Detailed findings from the STRIDE-3 study will be presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November. If approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address serotypes responsible for the majority of adult invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. Our company has deep expertise, given our breadth and depth of knowledge both in immuno-oncology and vaccines. We are leveraging these capabilities in immunology, where the first patient is ready to be enrolled in the Phase 3 trial for MK-7240 in ulcerative colitis. Turning to cardiometabolic disease programs. Last month at the European Respiratory Society International Congress, we presented data for sotatercept, currently under review by the FDA for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In an exploratory post-hoc analysis of right heart catheterization and echocardiography data from patients in the Phase 3 STELLAR study, patients with PAH treated with sotatercept for 24 weeks on top of background therapy showed a reduction in right heart size and improved right-ventricular function and hemodynamic status. In addition, we presented promising data from an analysis of the Phase 3 SOTERIA open-label extension study in PAH. The results support the potential long-term durability of the response to sotatercept and represent the longest safety and efficacy analysis for this compound to-date. Given the serious patient need in pulmonary arterial hypertension, our regulatory and clinical teams worked swiftly to submit the necessary regulatory filings for sotatercept. The FDA has accepted the Biologics License Application under priority review with a target action date of March 26th. In addition, the submission to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in the European Union has been completed. Also in cardiology, momentum continues in the clinical development program for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor. We have initiated the CORALreef Lipids study in a broad patient population and CORALreef Outcomes, a randomized, double-blinded study, evaluating the efficacy of MK-0616 with respect to major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, as well as a separate CORALreef study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Over the last three years, we have moved with rigor and urgency to advance the best science while carefully coordinating our efforts internally and externally. We have and continue to leverage the foundational properties of KEYTRUDA while adding promising candidates with novel mechanisms and modalities in oncology. At the same time, we have expanded in our focused areas of excellence to establish a diverse pipeline of promising candidates spanning multiple additional disease areas. We understand there is still work to be done, but the tangible advances we are making underscore our purpose of creating innovative medicines and vaccines that save and improve lives. And now I turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Dean. Julie, we are ready to take questions. And as usual, we request that analysts limit themselves to a single question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. Good morning. The comments from the capital allocation standpoint seem to indicate that you feel that you have done some critical mass and certainly some of the deals that you have done have been very important and meaningful. You set the cardiovascular revenue goal in 2030 to $10 billion. Do you think you have done enough there and then to provoke relatedly, Animal Health, do you still feel that that fits within the portfolio, you have been building, but is there reshaping that\u2019s still could come? Thank you. Rob Davis : Great, Chris. This is Rob and I will maybe start and Dean or Caroline can jump-in if they would like. But first and foremost, I appreciate the comments and as we sit here today, Dean, made reference to it, we feel very good about the progress we have made over the last couple of years through the assets we brought in. You mentioned cardiometabolic, but also immunology, the progress we are making to broaden our position in Oncology and I will get to you in a moment, but as you mentioned the durable growth drivers we have with Vaccines and Animal Health. But specifically to the cardiometabolic area, I can tell you that today as we sit here and just to remind people what we had commented on in the past, we have said, based on both what we received through the acquisition of Acceleron plus other programs that we have been developing internally, we expected that we could be in a position to have greater than $10 billion of revenue potential in the mid-2030s and I\u2019d remind everyone that was on a risk-adjusted basis. But I would tell you as we sit here today, given what we have seen with the remarkable data from STELLAR, the excitement that is coming and we are seeing from key opinion leaders, with the potential launch of sotatercept hopefully early next year and approval even in Europe next year, our confidence that we will achieve that $10 plus billion is higher today than it was when we made the original comment. So we feel very good, doesn\u2019t mean we feel like we are done, but we feel very good about the progress. And then as you reflected on Animal Health. We continue to see the Animal Health business as an important business for us, it a durable growth driver. As we look forward, it continues to be a business that we think will be accretive to our growth long-term and it has strategic value to us, where we are both benefiting from the synergies that it brings to us and that it benefits from the synergies coming from the science that we have on the Human Health side. So as we sit here today, we remain committed that it is the strategic part of the company. But as I have often said, that\u2019s not a philosophical view that is unchanged, it\u2019s something we are very objective about and we look out regularly. But I can tell you as we have continued to look at it, our view has not changed. Dr. Dean Li : I would just add one thing, Chris, in relationship to your question, but not related to revenues or finance. I would just remind that we have made incredible advances in cancer and we are known as an oncology company. But the unmet need -- the unmet patient needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in the U.S. and in the world is quite substantial, and I don\u2019t know that we are ever going to be done with that field in the near-term, so we are still very committed to do more. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Julie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. Your line is open. Mara Goldstein : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I am curious the discussion around KEYTRUDA and migrating components of the revenue to earlier lines of therapy. Relative to when you first made statements about where you expect it to be from a percentage, do you think you are ahead of that at this point in time or on-track to where you originally thought you would be today. Rob Davis : Yeah. The short answer, Mara, is we are ahead of our -- of where we thought we would be. And just to remind everyone, we have been commenting that we expect 50% of our growth to come from movement into the earlier stages of disease in oncology, as we look forward to ultimately get to a global percent with it being about 25% of our total revenues. But I can tell you as where we sit here today, we are tracking ahead of where we expected we would be. And obviously not surprising when you see just a phenomenal results from KEYNOTE-671, what that\u2019s going to mean in the perioperative space for people in early-stage lung cancer building on 091, the continued strength we are seeing across adjuvant and RCC and melanoma, we are up now to eight approvals in this space. So we are in a very good position. But I may about ask Caroline if she has anything she would like to add. Caroline Litchfield : The only thing I\u2019d add, Rob, is to your point, we have made tremendous progress. We think this year we will have 20% of our KEYTRUDA business coming from the earlier stage cancer setting. And as we move forward given the tremendous state we have had and indications coming, we are really excited about the opportunities of further growth in lung, in potentially bladder and many other indications. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. I just want to make as a call out, because we had an investor discussion this past Sunday and we are really focused on the ADC and Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun, but I just want to call out that for me KEYNOTE-671 is a watershed moment for the field. I would remind everyone that a similar watershed happened in metastatic lung cancer in 2018 KEYNOTE-189 and 2018 is when KEYNOTE-671 was initiated. It\u2019s an earlier stage and only after 5.5 years, after only 5.5 years in an earlier stage trial, you have clear evidence of EFS and OS benefit and I really think this will catalyze a change in how we treat early-stage lung cancer, how we detect early lung cancer and how we screen. If you think about treating early those patients with Stage 2 and 3, you can reduce their mortality by 28%. I think it will catalyze people really looking at any one going to surgery in Stage 2 and 3, not just in Stage 3, people are going to have to think very carefully of why someone should get this regimen. In terms of detecting early, I think it\u2019s really important. How many individuals have a chest CT or chest x-ray with incidental findings and there\u2019s little follow-up and day and age of electronic health records, it\u2019s very easy to figure out how many people have incidental nodules that never got followed up. I think that will change. And I think in screening, early we have guidelines, where the adherence is only 6% to 7% and these guidelines were set four, five years ago, where the concept was it would reduce mortality by 20%. With these data that we have, that number is no longer at 20%, it\u2019s much lower. And so, I think there will be a push by the American Cancer Society, NCCN, NCI, NIH to simplify and broaden those guidelines, because that is -- this is the inexorable march of IO into earlier stage and into the most important cancer, which is lung cancer, which is the number one cause of death for women and the number one cause for men and our commitment to this field is not just 671 and 91, it is also as we highlighted our interest of moving INT the individualized neoantigen therapy into earlier stage in lung cancer. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Mara. Next question please, Julie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe the risk of going back to that ADC topic. One of the key questions and sort of the back-and-forth has come out in the TROP2 space, it\u2019s just the ability to combine your TROP2 with IO going forward has been a lot of commentary on the myelosuppression there and to the extent that may restrict your ability to combine with IO. Dean, would love to get your thoughts there and any additional commentary you can provide? Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. Specifically to any ADC that we would advance in any tissue tumor type, one thinks about monotherapy and one thinks about a clear indication and a line of sight, but one also thinks about how the field develops and in combinations and those combinations can be with PD -1s, but I would also highlight, it can be with chemo, it can be RAS, it can be with novel hormonal agents, it can be with PAR, it can be with other ADCs and you have to think from late and earlier. In relationship to TROP2, specifically in non-small cell lung cancer, I believe that I have said in the past that, one has to think about how the field has evolved, there was a watershed moment, it was KEYNOTE-189 and pembro plus chemo in a broad patient population along that indication do really well. So those of us who want to advance, what I would say, in ADC and NextGen chemo, that\u2019s how I think about it, have to think about a way to combine it with PD-1 in a way that is not just effective, but substantially effective over KEYNOTE-189. We are very interested in advancing our TROP2 ADC in relationship to that and that combination, like all chemotherapy based treatments, whether it\u2019s chemotherapy or whether it\u2019s chemotherapy on a payload with ADC, one has to think about adverse effects and combinatorial adverse effects and the ability to keep patients on the medicines. The data that we have shown with our partner, our valued partner Kelun is that we think that there is room to be able to advance MK-2870 and PD-1 in a variety of tumors and that they are combinable, tolerable and will be effective, but those are the trials that we are starting to do in Phase 3 in the ex-China regulatory arena. Rob Davis : Thank you, Carter. Next question please, Julie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Seamus Fernandez : Well, thanks so much for the question. So just wanted to talk about margins and some of the margin targets that you have offered, I think historically, you called out 2024 margin target of better than 42%, just trying to get a better sense of how we are tracking towards that target, particularly in the context of the substantial reduction in your royalty burden both for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. And if you wouldn\u2019t mind, would you perhaps disclose what that cumulative royalty burden was in the third quarter of this year, just so that we can provide some context for the upside case or at least what we should be anticipating there? Thanks so much. Caroline Litchfield : Seamus, thank you for the question. We have seen really strong margin expansion in our company over the last several years, and as we look-forward, we expect continued margin expansion and that margin expansion really comes from the product mix on the revenue line, it also comes from the roll-off of royalties, as you have just noted, knowing that we have the royalty on global KEYTRUDA sales going from 6.5% to 2.5% at the start of next year and our royalty on GARDASIL going from 7% to zero percent on our global sales, again, at the start of next year will drive significant gross margin improvement. At the same time, we will be investing in our business. We will be disciplined in that investment, but we are investing in the portfolio of products that we have in the market and that we will be launching, as well as investing in our robust and growing pipeline and that obviously includes the Daiichi collaboration, where we have noticed we expect about a $0.25 impact as a result of investing predominantly in the research and development of a wide range of programs, that Dean has partially outlined, as well as this financing costs. We also have made significant progress across our pipelines with many other collaborations, acquisition and the progress we are making with our own internal assets. So, altogether, we still do point to an operating margin of greater than 43% in the year 2025. However, we will not forgo necessary investments in our business to progress our pipeline to ensure that we have advance healthcare and drive growth, which really is our priority. Rob Davis : Great. Thank you, Seamus. Next question please. Julie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, another one for Dean on the TROP2 landscape. I know you guys talked over the weekend about your first Phase 3 trial in lung cancer here. Maybe just any more context on the decision to pursue the EGFR mutant population, given what you are seeing from the landscape out there, including some of the Astra data and then what that means for the front-line setting as you try to craft a trial in that broader population? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. So I just want to make sure that whether we are talking about our wonderful partnership with Kelun or with Daiichi Sankyo, we sort of lay out certainly indications that become public, but I want to be very clear that those are not the only indications that we would be interested. So that\u2019s number one. Number two, in relationship to MK-2870 and advancing it more broadly and it relates to the other question, there is -- we still have small numbers, but what\u2019s really interesting for us for 2870, there are differences in the construct in terms of payload, in terms of the linker, in terms of the dart for that. And one of the things that\u2019s interesting to us is at least to-date, we do not see serious IOD and that allows us to think broadly and thoughtfully about its combined ability in relationship to broader indications. So we are very interested in advancing. In terms of 2870 and the specific first trial that\u2019s been revealed, it\u2019s -- I will just tell you, it was driven, because of the data that we have and the data that we have we think is quite good and should be advanced. We are going to advance other ones, but the advancement in the EGFR new population is based on data that our partners Kelun and us have generated and we are very confident in advancing in that specific indication. Rob Davis : Thanks, Terrence. Next question please, Julie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open. Andrew Baum : Hi. Thank you. Question in relation to trastuzumab and your KEYNOTE-003 trial. I am assuming that you are using a similar type clinical trial design and template for the stats from KEYNOTE-42, where you have a hierarchy. Given this is a PD-L1 enriched trial and with the hierarchy in place, we are expecting an interim potentially the very end of next year, beginning of the following year. Any comments on either design or timing of entrants? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : I would just say that in general principle, your observations of how we develop drugs, especially in the IO has been something that we are known for and the structure was laid out by great leaders from Merck, who laid the basis for that. In relationship to timing of interim analysis, we have generally not commented on interim analysis and we let those interim analysis do what they need to do, which is come and if they are significant, we make that publicly known. If there is significance in relationship to public disclosure, that\u2019s when we do that, but we generally do not lay out the timing of our interim analysis prior to them happening. Rob Davis : Thanks, Andrew. Next question please, Julie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open. Louise Chen : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about sotatercept, how you are preparing for that launch, what\u2019s your go-to-market strategy and how quickly you expect uptake to be? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yeah. Louise, this is Rob. I will maybe jump-in and Caroline can add if I miss anything. I would tell you that we feel well-prepared. So, obviously, we have been working to ensure we have supply to be able to supply the market upon launch. But as we sit here today, given what is happening in the marketplace. So you are seeing warehousing of patients in anticipation of the launch of sotatercept in the United States. And from feedback from key opinion leaders and what we are hearing from the market, the demand for this will be quite high. So our expectation, as you will see a strong launch with this drug and I can tell you we have been invested and built an organization, we actually have a very focused group now in our U.S. -- within our U.S. business whose sole job is to manage this launch. And so, I think, we are both prepared from a commercial perspective and from a manufacturing perspective with the expectation, as I said that, this should go with a very strong quick uptake. And the other thing I would highlight is given the strength of the data, we do expect to see approval in Europe next year, which we originally thought would require a further study. So not only are we preparing in the United States, but we are also preparing in Europe as well and we feel good about both. But Caroline, anything you would want to add. Caroline Litchfield : No. I think you captured it Rob. Dean, anything you would want to. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. I just want to emphasize sotatercept, this is the first drug out there that really is targeting the fundamental genetic basis of the disease. It\u2019s going to be the first activin inhibitor, but most important is activin is what the genetics tells you imbalance that occurs in pulmonary artery hypertension. So this is a really important and I said watershed previously, I do think this is going to be a watershed moment for PAH. Rob already talked about the U.S. and EU, and the reason why that happened is because of the stellar data was quite impressive and that\u2019s what drove the ability to do EU. What I would remind everyone is that we have other trials coming through. We have Zenith, Hyperion and Cadence. Zenith, for example, is one that\u2019s going to look at mortality and those sort of endpoints, as the primary endpoints. Should that read-out in the next year or something like that, relatively soon to the launch, I think whatever estimates that, Caroline and Rob have talked about sotatercept that will only help the uptake of sotatercept. And as Rob has mentioned, this is a field that up many of the physicians, this was a place where I did research back-in the academic days. The phone calls, I am getting is that people are warehousing patients in anticipation of that March launch. Rob Davis : Thanks, Louise. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. I just had a question on GARDASIL, we have seen obviously some very impressive growth over the past few years, but looking ahead, I am just interested in how much more opportunity for you see for this franchise to ramp from here. So maybe just elaborate a little bit more on what are the kind of unmet needs at this point, where is the biggest opportunity to do kind of roll-out the product and just, ultimately, how much larger can this franchise become over time? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. Chris, no, I appreciate the question. So, one, I would say, we feel very proud of GARDASIL [Technical Difficulty] of this business and the fact that people increasingly recognize that we can fundamentally do what\u2019s the most important, which is prevent cancer -- prevent cervical cancer, increasingly prevent certain head-and-neck cancers if we can get people fully vaccinated. So the fact that you are starting to see that progress is important. As we look at the business going forward, I would start by saying, we remain very confident that this as a business that\u2019s going to continue to grow and that we will achieve the expectations we have communicated of over $11 billion in revenue by 2030, so nothing has changed and how we see the business. As you know, we have made significant investments in manufacturing capacity and from that perspective now, we are well-positioned, we have brought on our two sites and they are ramping now, and so we are doing quite well from that perspective. And then as far as the opportunities that exist to potentially continue to drive even beyond, what we just discussed, really, I would put it in three buckets and our ability to achieve that objective and then potentially exceed that objective really come down to these three variables. And first and foremost, while we have had great penetration in the developed world, huge opportunity still exists in the low and middle income markets. And I can tell you we have a focus and an intention to drive this business into the low and middle income markets. Obviously, that\u2019s going to require us to continue to drive down our manufacturing costs, which we have plans to do and I have confidence that we will do and just think about lower price points. But that said, that will be meaningful incremental revenue, as we achieve that over time. And then as you look at the established markets, there is still a large population to address. Obviously, to-date we have been driving largely through public vaccination programs outside the United States, in the United States through the national immunization program, primarily aimed at young women and young girls. Increasingly, the opportunity to go to a broader age cohorts, as we think about going now to people aged 45. That ability to move into the mid adult segment is a real opportunity in the United States that continues to be a driver of growth, it\u2019s increasingly going to be a growth driver in Europe and it is currently an important part of why we are driving growth with the recent expansion we got in China and there are more markets to come. So as we look at that, that\u2019s going to be another lever of growth. Obviously, the difference here is this requires consumer activation that takes commercial investments and a lot of heavy lifting. We have demonstrated we can do it like we have started to do in China and as we are starting to do in the United States. But it is going to take a lot of work and investment and we are committed to doing that. So that\u2019s another variable that we look at it. And then, lastly, this is still largely seen as a female vaccine, we only I think it\u2019s only 70 markets have gender neutral approvals. And even in the markets that do have it, particularly if you look at markets like Europe. There is still a real opportunity to increasingly bring people to understand that this is not just a female cancer vaccine, it is a gender neutral cancer vaccine. And with the growing incidence of head-and-neck cancers, which is primarily a male-dominated cancer, we do see real opportunity to continue to push and drive both getting more markets to gender neutral and in the markets, where we have those approvals drive vaccination rates up and probably one more bigger near-term opportunities is to get gender neutral approved in China, which is an opportunity. So across all of those, there\u2019s opportunities and potential. It\u2019s a heavy lift, I don\u2019t want to indicate that it\u2019s going to be easy and we are going to invest behind it. But that really will determine ultimately our success across those variables will determine the success we see long-term with this franchise. But maybe Dean or Caroline, anything you would add. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. I would just emphasize two points. One, directly related to what you said. This is a highly effective vaccine to prevent women\u2019s cancer, cervical cancer and that is something that everyone recognizes, but the gender neutral part is really important and at MRL we are advancing studies and filings in relationship to make sure that as many places that can adopt gender neutral can it -- can be in a position to do gender neutral. I also want to just make one comment about cervical cancer itself. We talk about Carticel in relationship to cervical cancer, but I would also emphasize that at ESMO, we had KEYNOTE-A18. I would remind people that cervical cancer is still the fourth leading cause of women cancer and this was another trial that showed the effect of KEYTRUDA in earlier stage in combination with chemo radiation. So that I think is a PDUFA date that\u2019s coming up and that hopefully might be the 9th early-stage and I believe that PDUFA date is among like four that are coming up in the next six months in relationship to cancer. So Carticel gender neutral, but also cervical cancer being a critical driver and driving into earlier stage. Those are all things that play around what we are trying to do at Merck. Rob Davis : Thanks for the question, Chris. We have time to take some additional questions and go past the hour. Julie, next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Hey, everyone. Thanks for the question. Question for Dean or even Rob on ADCs. So you guys have obviously done a number of deals, have partnered assets and clearly you think this approach is strategically important for Merck. So the question is how much of an investment is Merck making in building out a broader ADC platform in-house. I am just thinking beyond the partner programs, and especially, Dean, as you call out the IO paradigm is shifting earlier? Thank you. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. Thanks for that. I will grab that one. So we have been very lucky to partner with Kelun and Daiichi Sankyo and that advances our clinical programs at scale. We also clearly have collaborations with other ADC companies in relationship to KEYTRUDA. So we have a wall of data of understanding what we are hoping that the field might navigate towards. And like everyone has said there will be different antibodies, different antibodies structures to be able to change how one thinks about the tissue targeting component. There will be changes in terms of the linkers and for right now, there are probably two major payloads that people use microtubules based chemotherapy, as well as a TOPO1 based chemotherapy. I would just emphasize that there are only -- there are not just two classes of chemotherapy out there for the last 30 years and each one has a reason why they are there. So we have invested in an ADC platform that is separate, but we will build-off what is learn from our clinical programs both in the ones that we are doing with Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun, as well as those that we are doing when we are collaborating with others in relationship with KEYTRUDA. So we have built and we continue to build that expertise within the company and we hope to see those internal programs carrying its clinical head in the next couple of years. Rob Davis : Thanks, Geoff. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Steve Scala : Thank you very much. What is VAXNEUVANCE\u2019s share in pediatrics now and why hasn\u2019t it seen an inflection in the U.S. sales in line with Merck\u2019s prior comments that it held 30% share of the pediatric market with plans to grow from there. I mean, 30% share of a $6 billion market is a big number and it\u2019s well-ahead of where current sales are landing. So any color would be appreciated? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yeah. Steve, I will maybe jump on that and then others can jump in. But so your answer is we are in that low 30% share both in the public and private market. So that is what you are saying in the quarter. I think the U.S. roughly was about approaching $185 million to $200 million of total business or the products. So we are actually seeing growth pretty much consistent with what we expect and the share we got is pretty much what we expected. So we will have to think through how the disconnect in what you are seeing. But I can tell you, in fact, and we are doing exactly what we expected we would do. Caroline Litchfield : This is Caroline. The only thing I\u2019d add to that would be the performance we are also seeing outside of the U.S. So while we are early in our launch outside the U.S., we have gained 50% of the tenders in which we have participated and which being shares north of that one-third, so we are very confident in our ability to continue to drive VAXNEUVANCE and very much looking forward to augmenting our offering with V116 later next year. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. I would just add. Rob Davis : Steve, let me just clarify one thing, because I think it\u2019s important. I was just reflecting on your question just to clarify my comments. Its 30% is our exit share not overall of the year. So that\u2019s an exit share, as we are seeing the business grow today. Dr. Dean Li : Yeah. I wanted to just make a comment about VAXNEUVANCE in the setting of what Caroline said about V116. It\u2019s essentially with VAXNEUVANCE and V16, what we are trying to do is to drive the precision medicine mindset to vaccine giving the right vaccine with the right set of serotypes to the right age group at the right time and we believe that that strategy is important for VAXNEUVANCE and to think about VAXNEUVANCE not just on its own, but in relationship to V116 and we have work cut out to us in relationship to a potential approval from the FDA, as well as we will have to speak to the ACIP, as we advance this concept of a precision medicine mindset to pneumococcal vaccination. Rob Davis : Thanks, Steve. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, all. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want to touch on MK-0616, so clearly prioritizing given the advancement into multiple Phase 3 trials. Maybe talk to me about the importance of an oral PCSK9. Given the dynamics we have seen in the injectable market with both the antibodies and other long-acting assets? Thank you so much. Dr. Dean Li : Okay. I will take that was and I will give my homage to Helen Hubs and Jonathan Cohen at the UT Southwestern in Dallas Heart Study. That was really important data in relationship to showing PCSK9. And if you look at that patient population, that patient population is desperately in need of an oral potent LDL lowering cholesterol medicine and that\u2019s what we are trying to provide. We are trying to democratize our pathway, such that people whether they are in the rural and the inner city or globally, can get this. And so I would just emphasize the other point, which is cardiovascular disease atherosclerotic disease is still the number one killer in the United States and the developed countries and lowering LDL is known to be important. We used to talk about resistant or refractory, but my experience is that the level of LDL that you are going to have to drive to that increasingly the guidelines are taking is to is forget about whether you are refractory or resistant to stand, it will be very hard with one agents to get your LDL below 70 or below 55 in some patient populations. That patient population, you want to treat you want to have that treatment readily available with no cold-chain and no requirement to go into a hospital system to get it. That\u2019s what we are trying to do and hopefully our data will support such a move. Rob Davis : Great. Thanks Evan. Maybe final question please, Julie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal. Your line is open. With Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much and thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to touch upon among EGFR mutant patients, how are you thinking about a TROP2 ADC versus a HER3 ADC, because if you look at your data or even EV\u2019s data, it seems like TROP2 seem to be working quite well among those AGA mutations, so how are you thinking about these two ADCs in that same indication? Dr. Dean Li : I think that\u2019s a great question. I would just answer that. I think the TROP2 ADC data is important to look at, but I would also emphasize that the HER3 ADC program is reasonably advanced in that patient population. And so we will -- we are interested in advancing both in getting the best medicines to the patients as quickly as we can. I do think more as a general statement that the role of biomarkers for some of these ADCs outside of EGFR will be important, relationship to tissue targeting, also in relationship more broadly for ADCs and other combinations. And so we will have to see how that field is moving, but essentially the way I think about ADCs is trying to bring chemotherapy in the precision medicine approach. And with that, we are going to have to find the right patient population, with the right biomarkers to give them the maximum benefit. Rob Davis : Thank you, Mohit, and thank you all for your time and attention today. Please follow-up with Investor Relations if you have any additional questions and we look forward to being in touch soon. Thank you all very much.",

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Ivy and good morning everyone. Welcome to Merck\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 conference call. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today maybe considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2022 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today\u2019s call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. These slides, along with the earnings release, today\u2019s prepared remarks and our SEC filings, are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck\u2019s website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. 2023 was another very strong year for Merck. I am extremely pleased by the progress we have made to develop and deliver transformative therapies and vaccines that will help save and improve lives around the world. We reached more than 500 million people with our medicines last year alone. Over half of which were through donations. We also made substantial investments in research and development in our ongoing effort to discover and bring forward to patients the next generation of impactful innovations, over $30 billion in total, including the cost of certain acquisitions and collaborations. As we move forward, I am confident that our strong momentum will continue, underpinned by the unwavering dedication of our talented global team. We are realizing the benefits of our sustained focus on key strategic priorities. The excellence of our commercial and operational execution enables us to deliver tangible value in the short-term while we invest in new innovations and strengthen our pipeline for the long-term. In 2023, we advanced important clinical programs and augmented our pipeline with promising business development, such as the acquisition of Prometheus and our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Guided by our science-led strategy, I am confident that the focused and disciplined business decisions we make and the actions we take will lead to sustainable benefits for the patients we serve and long-term growth and value for our shareholders. Turning to our results and initial outlook for 2024, we delivered excellent underlying growth in 2023, reflecting robust demand for our innovative portfolio. I am pleased to share that we expect continued strong growth in 2024 driven by demand for our key products, which Caroline will speak to momentarily. Turning to the progress we are making in research, we are currently pursuing programs across a more diverse set of therapeutic areas with high unmet need and across more modalities than at any time in recent memory. This year, we will remain keenly focused on advancing our broad and diverse pipeline, which includes two launches that will address critical health needs and have blockbuster commercial opportunity. In cardiometabolic, we are very excited by the anticipated FDA action on our application for sotatercept in the United States, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment journey for many patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our commercial and manufacturing teams are fully prepared for the strong uptake we expect. Sotatercept is an important component of our growing cardiometabolic pipeline, which we believe has significant long-term potential. In vaccines, the FDA accepted for priority review our filing for V116. If approved, V116 would be the first vaccine specifically designed to address the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ages 65 and older. Based on its compelling profile, V116 has the potential to become an important new preventative option for adults and we believe it can achieve majority market share in this setting. We look forward to a potential approval in June. And in oncology, we continue to expand into additional tumor types in earlier stages of certain cancers as well as progress our increasingly broad pipeline of novel candidates. We have achieved substantial diversification with a dramatically expanded set of late-stage programs, which Dean will speak to. I am confident that Merck is well positioned to provide important innovation to patients and sustain its leadership in oncology well into the future. I know Dean and his team are energized by our progress and are prepared to build on the success we have had in 2023 to further advance Merck\u2019s pipeline and bring transformative innovation to patients this year and beyond. In summary, our science-led strategy, which keeps the patient at the center of everything we do, is delivering important advancements and helping us build a sustainable growth engine for our company. We have made considerable progress over the past year in advancing and expanding our pipeline, which has resulted in substantially increased long-term commercial opportunities. We have taken meaningful steps to diversify and position ourselves for sustained leadership in oncology while also building one of our deepest and broadest pipelines across discovery and development in our recent history outside of oncology and notably in cardiometabolic and immunology. Further, we also expect to benefit from promising late-stage programs across our vaccines, neurosciences, HIV and animal health pipelines, a robust set of early phase programs and the potential to add exciting innovation through future science-led business development. As a result, we are increasingly confident that we are well positioned to drive patient impact and value creation this year and well into the next decade. I would again like to thank our global teams for their commitment to strong research, commercial and operational execution. With a concerted focus on achieving continued excellence, I am very confident in our ability to deliver short and long-term stakeholder value. I look forward to providing future updates on our progress and impact. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2023 was another impactful year for our company. We delivered strong revenue growth of 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange. Growth was driven by robust performance across oncology, vaccines and animal health. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term while making disciplined investments in innovative science, which will drive long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $14.6 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered strong growth of 13%. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 14% driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 4% driven by companion animal products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 22% to $6.6 billion. Global growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, with particularly strong growth in international markets due to the more recent launches of these important indications. Growth was also driven by the strong global need of patients with metastatic disease. We continue to be encouraged by the positive impact our recent approvals are having on certain patients with earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer. In the U.S., we have made considerable progress in helping to improve drug treatment rates and have further increased our leadership position in the adjuvant setting. We also received positive feedback from healthcare providers following the recent launch of KEYNOTE-A39 in advanced urothelial cancer. With this approval, KEYTRUDA in combination with PADCEV is now indicated for first-line advanced urothelial cancer patients regardless of cisplatin eligibility. Based on the outstanding clinical data, we believe this regimen has the potential to transform the standard of care for these patients. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima grew 8% and 5% respectively. WELIREG sales grew 78% to $72 million driven by increased uptake in VHL-associated tumors. We are excited by the opportunity to provide a new treatment option for certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma, following the recent approval based on the LITESPARK-005 study. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 27% to $1.9 billion, driven by global demand, particularly in China. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales benefited from CDC purchasing patterns. VAXNEUVANCE sales grew to $176 million driven by ongoing launches in Europe and continued uptake of the pediatric indication in the U.S. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2022 sales in the U.S. benefited from inventory stocking in preparation for the pediatric launch. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales declined 3%. Increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. was more than offset by the impact of generic entrants in international markets, particularly in Europe. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 4%. Companion animal sales grew 12% driven by the BRAVECTO line of products due to strong underlying demand and timing of purchases. Livestock sales were flat, reflecting favorable price actions offset by the timing of ruminant product purchases. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77.2%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points largely due to favorable product mix, including a benefit from lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $11.6 billion, including a $5.5 billion one-time charge related to our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting disciplined investment in support of our expansive early-and late-phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other expense was $174 million. Our tax rate was approximately 114%, which reflects the impact of the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, the underlying tax rate was 13.1%. Taken together, earnings per share were $0.03, which includes a $1.69 negative impact from the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. We expect another year of strong growth driven by key marketed products and we will begin to benefit from the anticipated launches of impactful new products, such as sotatercept and V116. We project revenue to be between $62.7 billion and $64.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 7%. This growth includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. The headwind is primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which we expect will largely be offset by inflation-related price increases, consistent with market practice. Our gross margin assumption is approximately 80.5%, which includes the benefit from reduced royalties paid on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. Operating expenses are assumed to be between $25.1 billion and $26.1 billion, which includes an approximate $650 million one-time charge related to the announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $8.44 to $8.59. This range includes an approximate $0.26 per share charge related to the planned acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics, which is not tax-deductible and the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.25 using mid-January rates, including the impact from Argentina. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We are excited by the significant progress our team has made to advance and augment our innovative pipeline in 2023. In 2024, we will increase this investment, including the initiation of more late-stage clinical trials across multiple novel candidates, each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a high priority. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment-grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional science-driven, value-enhancing transactions going forward. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, we enter 2024 with confidence in the outlook for our business in the near and long term. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remain strong, and we are excited about our expansive pipeline. We are in a position of financial and operational strength as a direct result of our longstanding commitment to science in order to improve the lives of the patients we serve. Our continued investment in innovation and excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Good morning. Today, I will provide notable R&D updates since our last earnings call and a brief summary of 2023 accomplishments. Momentum in the pipeline remains strong. Progress is spanning both early- and late-phase programs across multiple therapeutic areas. Starting with Oncology, we are diversifying our portfolio and executing on our strategy, which is broadly based on three strategic pillars : immunooncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. In immunooncology, we remain committed to the development of KEYTRUDA and further transforming cancer care to address the needs of certain patients. In the fourth quarter, we received approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission in two gastrointestinal indications : one in combination with chemotherapy for the first line treatment of adults with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesaphageal junction adenocarcinoma based on KEYNOTE-A59; and another in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer based on KEYNOTE-966. As we continue to harness the potential of KEYTRUDA, we have an increased focus on earlier stages of disease, where we believe timely, effective intervention may significantly improve patient outcomes. Last month, we announced FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemo radiotherapy for the treatment of fecal Stage 3 through 4A cervical cancer based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A18 trial. This is an important advancement and provides a new option that has potential to become the standard of care. To-date, with all the research conducted with checkpoint inhibitors, the only studies that have demonstrated statistically significant overall survival benefit in earlier stage cancers are KEYTRUDA- based regimens : KEYNOTE-671 as part of a neoadjuvant followed by post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer and KEYNOTE-564 as a post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with renal cell carcinoma. Since the approval of a KEYNOTE-671 in October, it is notable that the American Cancer Society released guidance recommending that certain individuals with significant smoking history undergo an annual low-dose CT scan. The guidance also expands the age range for lung cancer screening. We look forward to the opportunity to help impact patients and support the identification of more patients at risk. Additional data from KEYNOTE-564 demonstrating an overall survival benefit were presented at the ASCO GU conference last week. Detailed findings from KEYNOTE-123 evaluating KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized, muscle-invasive and locally advanced, resectable urothelial carcinoma demonstrating a disease-free survival benefit versus observation were also presented at ASCO GU. Also in the earlier-stage setting, along with our partner, Moderna, we announced 3-year recurrent-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival data for our individualized neoantigen therapy, V940, in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage 3 and 4 melanoma following complete resection. We are encouraged by the durability of the responses observed and the potential for this regimen to impact patients earlier in their diagnosis. The Phase 3 trials in the adjuvant setting for certain patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are actively enrolling. Progress continues in precision oncology. The FDA approval for WELIREG, our HIF 2 alpha inhibitor for the treatment of adults with advanced RCC following a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI, marks the first drug approved in a new therapeutic class for eligible patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in nearly a decade and builds on the 2021 approval for the treatment of adults with certain von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors. Additional Phase 3 pneumococcal studies for WELIREG, in combination with KEYTRUDA and/or lenvatinib for the treatment of certain types of renal cell carcinoma in the advanced and adjuvant settings, are ongoing. Finally, moving to the tissue targeting space. Together with Astellas and Seagen, now Pfizer, we announced the FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev, a Nectin-4-targeting ADC for the first-line treatment to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer based on results from KEYNOTE-A39. These results demonstrated a superior overall survival benefit versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin and extend our pioneering work in combining KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy as well as reinforcing the value of an ADC to enable targeted delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor tissue. Following the announcement of our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo in October, we are pleased to receive priority review from the FDA for MK-1022, or patritumab deruxtecan, our investigation of a fully humanized anti-HER3 ADC for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The agency has set a target action date of June 26. Through our agreements with Kelun and Daiichi Sankyo as well as our own discovery programs, we have established a robust pipeline of tissue-targeting ADCs. And the recently announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics provides the opportunity to help complement and strengthen our approach by providing a portfolio of novel T cell engagers, the most significant of which is HPN-328, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager being evaluated in small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. Our strong diverse portfolio of immuno-oncology precision molecular and tissue-targeting agents positions us well to have a profound impact on even more patients long into the future. Next to our Vaccine pipeline. We are making notable advancements with our population-specific vaccine program for pneumococcal disease. The FDA has accepted for priority review the new biologics license application for V116, our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, specifically designed for adults supported by results from multiple Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating V116 in both pneumococcal vaccine-naive and vaccine-experienced adult patient population. Results from STRIDE-3 trial were presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November and additional data from STRIDE-3 as well as STRIDE studies 4, 5 and 6 will be presented at the International Society of Pneumonia and Pneumococcal Disease Congress in March. If approved, as Rob noted, V116 would be the first new pneumococcal-conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address the serotypes responsible for approximately 83% of invasive pneumococcal disease in about 65 years of age and older, according to CDC data from 2018 to 2021. Importantly, V116 includes eight unique serotypes, which account for 30% of disease according to the same CDC data. These serotypes are not covered by currently licensed pneumococcal vaccine options. The FDA has set a target action date of June 17. Turning to programs in the cardiometabolic disease pipeline. We are eager to bring sotatercept to patients as an important treatment option for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The FDA has set a target action date of March 26. Beyond data from the STELLAR trial, we have the Phase 3 ZENITH and HYPERION studies, which are evaluating sotatercept in patients with more advanced disease and those earlier on their disease journey. In addition, the Phase 2 CADENCE trial will evaluate WHO Group 2 pulmonary hypertension focused on a type of blood clot disease. As we close out 2023, it is important to highlight our significant progress and execution across therapeutic areas and modalities as well as multiple business development transactions. In the year, we have more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets. We also initiated over 20 Phase 3 studies across multiple new classes of assets, including in on oncology with bomedemstat, our LSD1 inhibitor in essential thrombocythemia; nemtabrutinib, our BTK inhibitor in first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia of small lymphocytic lymphoma; MK-2870, our TROP2 ADC in collaboration with Kelun in non-small cell lung cancer and endometrial carcinoma; MK-5684, our CYP11A1 inhibitor in collaboration with Orion in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and V940 in collaboration with Moderna for the adjuvant treatment of certain types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer; also in immunology, with tulisokibart in ulcerative colitis; finally, in cardiometabolic disease with multiple trials for MK-0616 in hypercholesterolemia. As a result of the increasing depth and breadth of our pipeline, we are planning to initiate an even greater number of Phase 3 trials in 2024. Considerable credit goes to my colleagues across the organization for their hard work and unwavering dedication. We are executing on our science-led strategy and look forward to providing further updates on our progress throughout the year. And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Ivy, we\u2019re now ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I know there is a trial due for you guys later this year, KEYFORM-007 trial. That\u2019s the LAG-3 with pembrolizumab in colorectal cancer. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the risk profile and the odds of success heading into that and if there is been any interim OS analysis. Thank you very much. Dean Li : I\u2019ll take this. Umer, thank you very much for that question. I mean just to recognize that in MSI high, we have a strong presence with pembro there. The larger group in CRC or colorectal cancer is in the MSS population. At this point, there is not really been any checkpoint inhibitor that\u2019s shown dramatic impact in MSS CRC. So our interest in driving pembro plus LAG-3 in that is to demonstrate that a checkpoint inhibitor could have a meaningful impact in MSS CRC. If we should get a positive signal in that, clearly, we would use that as a beachhead to expand and extend the role of checkpoint inhibitors in MSS CRC, which is a place that requires a lot of more innovation. In terms of specific interim analysis on this, we generally try to keep that when there is data that\u2019s worth sharing, that\u2019s when we share it. Thanks. Rob Davis : Just real quick, just quick microphone check. Can you hear us? Operator : No, we can hear you. Rob Davis : You can? Okay, we were showing we are muted. Sorry. Operator : No, you are fine. We can hear you loud and clear. Rob Davis : Alright. Good. Peter Dannenbaum : Next questions please, Ivy? Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Trung Huynh from UBS. Please go ahead. Trung Huynh : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So for sotatercept, we noticed the HYPERION study primary completion date has now moved to August 26. It was November 29 on clinicaltrials.gov. That\u2019s 3 years earlier. Just \u2013 could you just let us know the reason for that change? And if I could sneak one in. Just is there a place to transition sotatercept from inpatient clinic administration to self-administration? Thanks very much. Dean Li : So let me take the first question. So there is a series of trials and relationships with sotatercept. So the March date that we talk about is for a potential decision by the FDA for approval based on the STELLAR trial. And we think in the second half of 2024, we may be in a position in relationship to the EU. We have other trials, as you point out, especially Phase 3 trials, and they are ZENITH and they are HYPERION. Those two are based on events. So it\u2019s a tracking of events that sort of define when those happen. So ZENITH, I think, is now like September 2025 and HYPERION, August 2026. So that\u2019s just been event-driven. In relationship to how best to treat patients, well we\u2019re in conversations with the FDA in relationship to where is the best place for patients to be treated. But I\u2019ll just highlight that we have an image of an auto injector moving very fast through our pipeline. So that might give you a sense of where we think this may end up. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you. Next question please Ivy. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Daina Graybosch : Hi, thank you for the question. I have one on Oncology for one of the new assets going into Phase 3, the Orion MK-5684. I wonder if you could talk more about that asset. And what gives you confidence that it will demonstrate broad benefit in prostate cancer, in addition to the patients with the AR-LBD mutations? And can you confirm the stat design of the two Omaha studies will prioritize a hierarchy to statistically look at the mutation segment first? Dean Li : Yes. So just so that everyone is looking at this asset in the same way, there have been critical medicines that ablate androgen field growth in prostate cancer. And the interest in the SIP is it\u2019s very high upstream, and we think that it could be an important contribution. Clearly, we\u2019re in \u2013 as you point out, we\u2019re interested both broadly, but especially in the specific mutation patients. And so we will be advancing those trials to look at that subpopulation as well as more broad populations. In terms of the statistical sort of analysis in that, that\u2019s something that I think probably would be best sort of discussed with our clinical teams at a different time. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Daina. Next question please. Operator : Next, we will go to Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Carter Gould : Thank you very much for taking the question. Good morning. Maybe following up on the commentary on V116. You talked about a potential to reach a majority market share. What does that sort of imply around the potential ACIP recommendation or the potential for a catch-up opportunity in the adult segment? Dean Li : Yes. So I\u2019ll just \u2013 so again, we\u2019re talking about V116. We\u2019re talking about FDA potential action in June 2024, followed by ACIP, followed by MMWR. I think it\u2019s in March that we\u2019re going to be presenting STRIDE-3 and 6, and I think the data will be out there. And as you\u2019ll see in that, between STRIDE-3 and throughout STRIDE-3 all the way to 6, you\u2019ll see data in relationship to vaccination of those who are naive versus previously vaccinated. And you will see data in the patient population \u2013 or the population that 65, but also in the 50-plus as well. As that data is digested, both by the FDA, but probably very importantly, by the ACIP, I think those data will guide how the ACIP makes their decision. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Anything else? Okay, next question please, Ivy? Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could expand on some of the nuances of your guidance. Specifically, do you include meaningful revenues from sotatercept or V116? I\u2019m assuming they are for approval at some point this year. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you for the question, Evan. This is Caroline. As we\u2019ve guided for 2024, we\u2019re very confident in the underlying momentum in our business across Oncology, across Vaccines, across Animal Health. We also are very excited about the potential launches for sotatercept and V116. For sotatercept, given the significant clinical data we have and the understanding that there are many patients that have already been identified who can benefit for sotatercept on top of the treatments they have, we are expecting a strong launch. For V116, as Dean just outlined, we will wait for the FDA approval, the ACIP recommendation. We will then expect MMWR to publish, and therefore, expect to have impact with V116 coming towards the end of this year. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Evan. Next question please, Ivy? Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. A competitor recently reported some disappointing data with their TROP2 ADC and later line lung. I recognize these TROP2s are all different given the technology, the linkers. But does this impact at all your development strategy for your TROP2 in lung or perhaps increase the need for a biomarker strategy here? Thank you. Dean Li : Yes. This is Dean. Thanks for that question. So I\u2019ll just step back, and I think I\u2019ve said this previously, especially in lung, it\u2019s very important to understand what the standard of care is and that one would have to beat it in a significant way. And the standard of care, in our minds, in the late stage, is roughly KEYNOTE-189. And now in the earlier stage, it\u2019s clearly in KEYNOTE-671 both with clear OS data. What we have said previously is that we are unclear that any one ADC can have as broad of an impact as KEYNOTE-189 or 671 and that in order for ADC to have a substantial advantage in those patient populations, one may need to focus on a biomarker-selected patient population. And so the data that we saw does not change our way of thinking. It\u2019s the way of thinking that we\u2019ve discussed previously. And I would just add that it\u2019s really important, there is also data out there where people are doing retrospective biomarker data in this. For us to demonstrate true efficacy in any patient population, we need a biomarker strategy that is prospective and one that can be easily actionable throughout the world. Thanks. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Terence. Next question please, Ivy? Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Adam Jolly : Hi, thank you for taking our question. This is Adam on for Tim. On GARDASIL, a 2-dose regimen was recently approved in China. We\u2019re wondering if that poses a revenue problem. Potentially, it doesn\u2019t, if it just means that more supply gets spread out across more people, and Merck ends up selling just as many doses in total. Can Merck share its perspective here? Rob Davis : Sure. Adam, thanks for the question. So there has actually been Chinese competitors with an offering for some time actually in the Chinese market. And that market is large. We continue to believe in the eligible cohorts in just the urban females, which was the Tier 1 to Tier 3 cities, is about 200 million \u2013 a little over 200 million women. And so of that, we think probably about 30% have actually received vaccination. So, you are still looking at 120 million, 130 million eligible population. As we look at this and as we have seen over time, we continue to be very competitive. We are maintaining a vast majority of share in the private market. And really, you are seeing most of the local competitors go to the lower-tier cities and to a different population than we have been targeting. So, that does not change our view of the growth potential in China. Long-term, obviously we will continue to face competition there, and we are positioning ourselves to continue to succeed there. But the approval you are talking about is not changing our view. Caroline Litchfield : The only add, if I may is we had significant opportunity to protect further females in China. At the end of 2023, we also submitted to the regulatory authorities our data on GARDASIL for males. So, we are hopeful to introduce that in the Chinese market in the future. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks Adam. Next question please. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Maybe one question on V116 as well. So, Pfizer has recently made comments around adult market shrinking at this point. So, could you comment on how do you see the peak opportunity for V116 in the context of adult market shrinking and then you are taking share from a shrinking market? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. I will start and then Caroline can jump in as well. But I think as you look at the market size and the comments, I don\u2019t want to speak to comments that others have made. I think it\u2019s also important to understand that as we bring a vaccine which brings significant incremental coverage, at 83% versus, if you look at PCV20, just as an example, it\u2019s closer to, I think about 30%. So, you are looking at significant incremental coverage, which I think it can have an impact on how you think both about catch-up to cover the disease. As Dean noted in his prepared comments, we have eight serotypes covering 30% of what is causing disease, which is unique to us. So, we think that, that will have implications both in terms of the catch-ups as well as potentially to be able to go for patients 50 and plus versus 65 and plus. So, if you take all of those things into account, we still see this as a very large opportunity for us. Our view is it\u2019s about an $8 billion market in \u201823. We anticipate it actually growing to be over $10 billion later in the decade. And with that being the pediatric segment of that is about 70%, so we are looking at 30% of that is what is the adult piece. So, as we see it, this is still a growing market, a good market. And we remain very confident that V116 will both have a majority share and be a meaningful contributor. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks Mohit. Next question please. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks for the question. Just a bigger-picture question on business development. The company has obviously been very active the past few years. And I am just trying to get a sense of just kind of size and stage of assets that you consider just given the current R&D investments you are making and the asset \u2013 the kind of the amount of capital you are allocating there. So, I guess specifically, are deals along the lines of an Acceleron or a Prometheus still deals that Merck would look at and prioritize, or at this point, should we be thinking about maybe earlier-stage assets that, that would be more of the focus? Thanks so much. Rob Davis : Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, first, I just want to reinforce the pride I have in what Dean and the team have been able to do and the meaningful progress we are making both in our internal pipeline and what we have been able to do through the business development, which is I think in some ways, in a weird way, underlying your question. But as we sit here today, while I feel very good about the progress we have made in the growing portfolio, the diverse and deep portfolio we have in our pipeline, we do continue to believe we need more, and we will continue to prioritize business development. And I would say that our views of deals like Prometheus, like Acceleron are still the size of deals we are very interested in, if we can find great assets. So, clearly that\u2019s an area of focus. But also continuing to do smaller deals as well, like what you saw with Harpoon. So, it\u2019s going to be a range of deals. But I think as you look in that zero to kind of $15 billion, $1 billion to $15 billion, it continues to be where we will look for. And then obviously, we have also, I think shown that not only are we very open to doing an acquisition, but we see collaboration as an important tool as well, very similar to what we did with Daiichi Sankyo. So, we are going to be looking at the full suite and including deals that fit those categories. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks Chris. Next question please. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum : Thank you. I was going to ask you about your expectations for the AI \u2013 ACIP recommendation on revaccination of prevent [ph] or vaccinated patients, but I suspect you may not want to share that view. So instead, maybe I could ask you about the first-line TROP2 SKB non-small cell trial that you are running in combination with KEYTRUDA. Some of the recently published academic data suggests that TROP2 internalization is a biomarker in patients who are primary resistant to PD-1. So, it just seems like an old population to be exploring the drug in, assuming that is real and not a fake signal. And I take completely the caveats that it\u2019s retrospective data analysis in other settings. But given that, it would seem to be more sensible to have a combination with chemo and layering on top. And can you do this given the profile of the drug in terms of bone marrow suppression? Dean Li : Yes. So, I will just answer more broadly in relationship to TROP2 as an ADC and specifically our compound. One of the things that is extremely useful to us is its adverse effect profile, especially for lung cancer patients and relationship to lung toxicity is readily manageable. It\u2019s a quite good profile. In terms of your question about the paper that I think that you talked about internalization and this I think those are interesting and important papers for us to consider. But I think one of the things that\u2019s also important for us to do is to do the clinical experiment and see what the results are in relationship. We are confident that TROP2 ADC will have an impact. TROP2 ADCs in breast cancer has had an impact. And we believe that our TROP2 ADC, especially with the linker and payload, will have an important impact in lung cancer. And then the question that you have is, how do you combine it, do you combine it with chemo, do you combine it with PD-1, how do you think through that, I think those are questions that our clinical team thinks deeply about, but we also think deeply about what line of therapy and also what the standard of care is. And if you want to move to first line standard of care is KEYNOTE-189 with a chemo/pembro basis. So, one has to think about how one would advance a TROP2 from different lines all the way to first line. So, those considerations come in quite heavily. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please Ivy. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Seamus Fernandez : Thanks very much for the question and congrats on the quarter and the guidance. Can you just talk a little bit about subcutaneous KEYTRUDA, how you anticipate payers\u2019 acceptance of this new delivery modality as well as potential economic benefits to patients given the shift from Part B to Part D? I think there could be some benefits from the updated catastrophic cap being drivers there. But struggling in the face of potential biosimilars of KEYTRUDA after 2028 to see how payers would treat this, just interested to have a little bit more color on the economic benefits, not just the benefits of the patients of subcutaneous KEYTRUDA. Thanks so much. Dean Li : So, this is Dean. I will take the first question and then I will hand it over to Rob and Caroline because the economic question and the payer is also related to the innovation that you provide. I just want to make sure that our way of thinking about something like pembro with hyaluronidase given as subcu is really there is going to be a call for that innovation. I will just emphasize, we constantly speak about the earlier-stage cancer. And right now, we have nine approvals. And as I have said in relationship in the prepared remarks, of those approvals, two \u2013 the only two that have checkpoint inhibitors that have OS benefit is KEYTRUDA base, which is early lung cancer and RCC. I actually just came from a meeting speaking to a bunch of thoracic oncologists in this, and it\u2019s quite interesting to hear how they speak for those who are thoracic oncologists, who are linked to setting with medical oncologists, and they very clearly understand why KEYNOTE-671 perioperative is the category one. In situations where you may have a CT surgeon outside of a major care plan or a care \u2013 a major medical center sometimes you have CT surgeons moonlighting doing lobectomies and resection, for that, the KEYNOTE-091. And constantly, what we hear from the physicians and the provider, and many of them are in provider systems of all different types, is the need to have an alternative way to get the KEYTRUDA to them, either Q3, Q6 given the regimen. So, I just want to emphasize that the subcu pembro plus hyaluronidase is an innovation that is going to be demanded and is being demanded by the field. Rob Davis : Yes. Thanks Dean. And to the questions on the economics, and I think we have commented on this a little bit in various settings. But as we think about our strategy for bringing this to the market from a commercial perspective, our view is the quality-of-life benefits this brings does demonstrate and afford us the ability to get a premium price. But we also are very cognizant that any subcu pembro will have to be considered in the context of a generic IV version. So, we will price our subcu to drive for volume and to do for conversion, which means we will be looking at prices really more in line with where you would see the generic version at a premium that history has shown is very manageable and expected and covered by payers today when you look at the different delivery for them. So, in that sense, we think we will be able to manage this. The whole question of Part B versus Part D, we will have to see how it plays out as far as the ultimate side of administration. But if it does end up being into the Part D category, which is a reasonable chance, you are correct and that some of the new coverages that are out there in catastrophic and with the cap, also then from a patient perspective, should lower the burden they are going to face, which we also think could help with conversion. Peter Dannenbaum : Alright. Thanks Seamus. Next question please. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Geoff Meacham : Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Caroline, on margins, you highlighted a benefit from KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL this year, which I think was expected. But looking forward, is the guidance this year a reasonable target until the KEYTRUDA LOE? I wasn\u2019t sure if there is other drivers going forward or whether mix could impact margins as well. Thank you. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you for the question, Geoff. So, as you all know, our company has made great progress in expanding operating margin over a number of years. As we look to 2024, we expect operating margin to improve. And that\u2019s really driven by the strength of the top line and mix of revenue by the roll-off of royalties that we have noted on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. Being disciplined in our expenses, while we do invest fully behind our expansive pipeline, as we go beyond 2024, we still point to an operating margin of greater than 43% in 2025. But our focus as a company and as a team is to really ensure that we are fueling the pipeline supporting the portfolio of products that we are launching to drive growth into the long-term. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks Geoff. Next question please. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Steve Scala : Thank you. I believe the Merck RSV monoclonal antibody Phase 2/3 study is registrational and reads out this year, is that correct? And assuming positive, how soon could Merck be on the market? And how might this product be differentiated from by Fortis? It\u2019s just a little odd that this could be a $1 billion opportunity, not that far off, and Merck never talks about it. Thank you. Dean Li : I really appreciate the question. So, I will talk about it. In relationship to the RSV monoclonal antibody, it\u2019s for the early birth, it\u2019s an antibody, it\u2019s passive immunization, and it\u2019s for the pediatric population. This is a single shot. This is not weight-based. And we believe it has a longer season in relationship to other choices. And so we think it\u2019s an important readout, and we are very excited and interested to move on this RSV monoclonal antibody. I would also emphasize that the New England Journal of Medicine just published a series of papers, not in RSV, but also in dengue that also we are very excited about. And we are moving that forward quickly. And then more broadly from the ID vaccine, I have said previously that I am very intrigued to see the results of our NRTTI islatravir and our other NRTTI, MK-8527. So, that will also be coming out this year. We will be able to see those. So, it is the RSV. It is the dengue that was just out there, and it is the HIV data that we are going to be very interested in seeing across this year. Rob Davis : Yes. And Steve, just to maybe, from a commercial perspective, build on the question, from a launch timing perspective, our expectation is that we would be in the market in 2025. And obviously, we are working to be ready for that season in 2025. And then from \u2013 a differentiator for us, recall that our coverage covers what is the full prevention season for RSV, which is five months to six months. We are a single fixed dose, not a weight-based administered shot. So, for us, those are all very important things. And the last thing I would note is the site of action for us is really, we think, has low risk of development of resistance and is different than the competition. So, we actually are very bullish on this. I think we don\u2019t talk about it, frankly, because we have so many other good things to talk about. It sometimes gets lost. But it doesn\u2019t mean we are not excited about this and/or dengue, which frankly, I still believe dengue is a little bit, obviously, later than this, but huge for us. So, those were things we are excited about. It just reinforces the breadth of the portfolio we have. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Steve. Next question please, Ivy. Operator : Next we will go to the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. If I could ask about immunology, essentially a reentry into that realm with the Prometheus acquisition, if you could just update us on what we should be expecting to learn and also what you find interesting perhaps being to further build out on the immunology platform. Specifically, the clinicaltrials.gov has the Phase 2 maintenance data and UC is enrolling. Should we expect to hear from you on results there? I did not observe something there on Crohn\u2019s disease. What\u2019s the update on that program? And then in immunology further, it appeared from the start of the year a lot of excitement about different modalities, cell therapies in particular, oral advanced treatments. Share with us some views on where you think immunology could go to take Merck to be a relevant presence in the 2030s. Thank you. Dean Li : Chris, that\u2019s a great question and an expansive question. So, let me just hit in relationship to the TL1A antibody. We have our ulcerative colitis trial moving forward, and that\u2019s been listed and that\u2019s moving forward. I think probably the really important thing for me that I look out is getting the Crohn\u2019s disease trial moving. The reason I think it\u2019s really important is I will remind myself that TL1A is in the super TNF family. But TL1A may be different than run-of-the-mill TNF in its ability to not just dampen inflammation, but affect fibrosis. So, going from ulcerative colitis to Crohn\u2019s disease, Crohn\u2019s disease has lots of strictures in this. That will be important. And it will be also important to look and follow \u2013 I follow our data in TL1A in relationship to lung disease and scleroderma. So, that\u2019s with that. I would also emphasize that there are other assets within the partnership or acquisition that we did with Prometheus and those compounds, which had already been discussed previously are advancing through the pipeline as well. And then the other question that you have is, are we interested in other platforms and moving forward, the answer is absolutely yes. I think you had a question in terms of cell therapy with immunology. I think there is interesting there. But as you know, we have \u2013 when we have looked at cell therapy in relationship to cancer, especially not in heme, but in solid, we have been a little bit probably more exploratory. And right now, our view of cell therapy in immunology is one that might be more similar to our view of cell therapy in solid tumor, a little bit more exploratory. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Chris. Ivy, we have time for one more question please. Operator : And for our final question, we will go to the line of Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Louise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you on your ADC platform, if you feel that what you have is enough for now or do you want to expand or add on to it. And any interest in radiopharmaceuticals? Thank you. Dean Li : Thank you very much for that question. So, when we think about tissue targeting, we think of ADCs. And the answer is, I think the ADC fields will continue to develop, and I think there will be other payloads, other linkers, but also the specificity by which you do the tissue targeting in relationship to the antibody may change. There is also clearly evidence of potential movements into peptide drug conjugates that we are interested in as well as the possibility that the payload is no longer chemotherapy-based, but other sort of compound-based. So, we are interested in that. In tissue targeting more broadly, we are interested, and so we view that as, okay, that\u2019s how we are going to move sort of toxic cell chemotherapy agents into tissue targeting sort of scheme making chemotherapy precision medicine. But we also are very interested in the IO space in relationship to tissue targeting, and that is \u2013 our foray in that is really helped by our proposed acquisition with Harpoon that has a very interesting asset in relationship to tissue targeting and immune engagers. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Louise and thank you all for the really good questions and appreciate you sticking to mostly one question. We got to a lot of questioners, so appreciate that. If you have any follow-ups, please reach out to IR. We will be seeing you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for participating in the Merck & Company Q4 sales and earnings conference call. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Please disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",

These slides, along with our earnings release, today's prepared remarks and our SEC filings, are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Robert Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We've begun 2024 with continuing momentum in our business. We're harnessing the power of innovation to advance our deep pipeline and are maximizing the impact of our broad commercial portfolio for the benefit of patients. We drove strong growth across key therapeutic areas, executed strategic business development and are now launching a significant new product in the cardiometabolic space while also preparing for the potential approval and launch of 2 additional important candidates in vaccines in oncology. We have significant opportunities ahead of us across all areas of our business, and we're highly focused on realizing them. I continue to be inspired by the dedication of our talented global team, which is working tirelessly to bring differentiated medicines and vaccines to patients through seamless scientific, commercial and operational execution. In March, we received FDA approval for WINREVAIR, a first-in-class treatment for adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare progressive and ultimately life-threatening disease. This marks the achievement of a significant milestone for our company. It exemplifies the value of our strategic priorities and demonstrates how our enduring commitment to our purpose is resulting in tangible benefits for patients. Just over 2 years since adding WINREVAIR to our pipeline, our attention now turns to the execution of a strong commercial launch where we have already seen prescriptions being written. We see a tremendous opportunity to positively impact the lives of people living with PAH. And further, the importance of this therapy to patients provides us with increased confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. Strategic business development focused on the best external science remains an important priority for our company. We've demonstrated that we can leverage our deep discovery prowess to identify important acquisition targets and then add significant value through our powerful clinical research engine, our regulatory expertise and our commercial scale, which together can serve to accelerate development and enable broad global access to important medical discoveries for patients in need. Turning to our first quarter results. We achieved strong growth, reflecting robust demand for our innovative portfolio. We're pleased to reflect this momentum in our updated full year guidance, which Caroline will speak to in a moment. Turning to our broader research efforts. We're focused on advancing our expansive and diverse pipeline of leading-edge programs for the benefit of patients. In vaccines, we continue to pioneer new approaches to optimize disease prevention. In HPV, we're building on the foundation set by GARDASIL to further reduce the global burden of certain HPV-related cancers and disease by potentially providing broader protection with a new multivalent HPV vaccine and by generating data to clearly demonstrate whether or not a single dose of GARDASIL-9 provides comparable long-term protection to the approved 3-dose regimen in males and females ages 16 to 26. In pneumococcal, we presented additional compelling data for V116, a vaccine that is specifically designed to help protect against the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ages 65 and older and look forward to its potential approval in June. Each of these programs are platforms where we can provide meaningful protection to broad populations on a global scale. In HIV, in partnership with Gilead, we shared promising data from our revitalized program for a once-weekly combination of islatravir and lenacapavir in the treatment setting. We're actively progressing our comprehensive clinical program, which is focused on both treatment and prevention strategies to meet the evolving needs of the HIV community. And in oncology, we initiated several late-stage programs of novel candidates from our diverse pipeline as we work to expand our impact for patients and reinforce our leadership position over the long term. Finally, across our deep pipeline, we have significant clinical momentum in a range of therapeutic areas. Cutting-edge science is at the core of who we are, and I'm confident that Merck is well positioned to deliver the next wave of important innovations and value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders.  In summary, our science-led strategy is delivering compelling proof points that we are creating a sustainable innovation engine that with continued clinical success will lead to a more diversified portfolio of growth drivers over the next decade and beyond. I again want to recognize the enormous efforts across our global organization. My confidence is strong and growing, that we are well positioned to build on this momentum and drive patient impact and value creation this year and well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we have had a strong start to the year with robust growth across our business, which reinforces the confidence we have in our outlook. We are also making strategic investments to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world, positioning us to continue to deliver long-term value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $15.8 billion, an increase of 9% or 12% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The impact from exchange is primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business continued its momentum with double-digit growth of 13%, driven by oncology and vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 4% across both companion animal and livestock products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 24% to $6.9 billion, driven by increased uptake from earlier-stage cancers and continued strong demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumors. In earlier-stage cancers, the increase was largely attributable to non-small cell lung cancer following the launches of KEYNOTE-671 and KEYNOTE-091.  In the metastatic setting, we saw strong uptake from the recent launch of KEYNOTE A39 in first-line advanced urothelial cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by continued uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma as well as continued strong demand from patients with metastatic disease. Inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima grew 7% and 10%, respectively. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $85 million, driven by the additional indication following FDA approval of LITESPARK-005 for certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma as well as by increased uptake in certain VHL disease-associated tumors.  Our vaccines portfolio delivered strong growth, led by GARDASIL, which increased 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by global demand. Sales also benefited from the timing of shipments in China and CDC purchasing patterns in the U.S. VAXNEUVANCE sales grew to $219 million, driven by continued uptake of the pediatric indication in the U.S. and ongoing launches in international markets, particularly in Europe. In the U.S., VAXNEUVANCE sales also benefited from CDC purchasing patterns. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 4%. Livestock sales growth was driven by price actions as well as demand for swine and poultry products. Companion animal growth reflects price actions.  I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 81.2%, an increase of 4.3 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL, which went into effect at the beginning of this year as well as favorable product mix. Operating expenses decreased 4% to $6.4 billion, a charge of $656 million related to the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics this quarter was lower than the $1.4 billion of charges a year ago for certain business development transactions. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 8%.  We remain committed to investing appropriately to realize the promise of our expensive early and late phase pipeline and support the promotion of our key growth drivers. Other expense was $87 million. Our tax rate was 16.1%, including the impact from the Harpoon transaction for which no tax benefit was recorded. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.07, which includes a $0.26 negative impact from the charge related to Harpoon.  Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.1 million and $64.3 billion, reflecting strong year-over-year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, including the negative impact from foreign exchange. At the midpoint of this range, operational strength in our business of approximately $600 million is partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $400 million using mid-April rates resulting in a full year negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 3%.  Our gross margin assumption is now expected to be approximately 81%. Our estimated range of operating expenses is between $25.2 million and $26.1 billion, which does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is expected to be approximately $250 million. Our full year tax rate is unchanged between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are increasing and narrowing our expected EPS range to $8.53 to $8.65. This is a $0.07 increase at the midpoint despite an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.05 using mid-April rates, resulting in a full year negative impact from foreign exchange of more than $0.30.  As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. The increase in our sales guidance is driven by the strong performance across our current product portfolio, led by KEYTRUDA, which continues to experience growth from additional indications and patient demand. For GARDASIL, second quarter ex U.S. growth will be adversely impacted by shipment timing to China. This year, we expect more evenly distributed quarterly shipments to China. Recall, in 2023, we accelerated shipments from the second half to the first half of the year, which primarily impacted the second quarter. Over the near and long term, we remain confident in our ability to protect many more people from HPV-related cancers and drive growth of GARDASIL. Sales of LAGEVRIO in the first quarter were driven by an extended wave of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific markets. LAGEVRIO continues to be an important treatment option for certain patients with COVID-19. So we continue to anticipate full year sales to be lower than last year. We are excited to provide a novel treatment option for adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, following the recent FDA approval of WINREVAIR. We are seeing high interest from patient groups and a range of relevant prescribers. We are also making good progress in enabling access.  Several payers have already established coverage policies consistent with the label and STELLAR study criteria, while others are in the process of developing their policies. As we go forward, we intend to provide an appropriate level of transparency to enable insight into the impact we are having on patients, including prescription data and revenues. In summary, we are confident in a successful launch of WINREVAIR, consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our innovative pipeline, including the initiation of many new late-stage clinical trials across multiple novel candidates, each of which has the potential to meaningfully address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Adding compelling science to our pipeline through business development remains a high priority. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment-grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional science-driven value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases.  To conclude, we remain confident in the near- and long-term outlook of our business, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines as well as our exceptional pipeline. Our unwavering commitment to use the power of cutting-edge science to improve the lives of the patients we serve has put us in a position of financial and operational strength. Our excellent execution and continued investments in innovation will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress with a steady cadence of clinical regulatory milestones across our pipeline. Today, I will provide updates from our cardiometabolic disease portfolio, HIV and vaccine programs and close with advances in our oncology pipeline. As Rob and Caroline noted, late last month, we received approval from the FDA for WINREVAIR, our first-in-class active and signaling inhibitor for the treatment of dose living with pulmonary arterial hypertension to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. WINREVAIR is a novel therapeutic option that targets a new PAH treatment pathway and is indicated to treat a broad PAH population. This approval marks a significant step towards our goal of transforming the treatment journey for many patients with PAH. WINREVAIR is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency with a decision anticipated in the second half of this year. The Phase III ZENITH and Hyperion studies evaluating patients with more advanced disease and those earlier on in their disease journey, respectively, are ongoing as well as the Phase II cadence trial evaluating WHO Group II pulmonary hypertension, a type of left heart disease.  Our commitment extends to a broad range of pulmonary hypertension, informed by results from the Phase II cohort of the Phase II/III insignia PAH study evaluating MK-5475, our inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator and the STELLAR trial results for WINREVAIR, we have made the decision to focus the development of MK-5475 on WHO Group 3.1 pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD, and not further proceed in PAH. PH-COPD is an area of significant need with no specific therapies currently approved. Our HIV pipeline continues to advance. Last month, presentations at the conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections, reinforce progress in our strategy to develop less frequent dosing regimens for managing and treating HIV.  We believe these programs have the potential to help address adherence, stigma and other challenges faced by some individuals taking daily antiretroviral pills. In collaboration with Gilead, safety and efficacy findings were presented from a Phase II study evaluating a once-weekly oral combination of islatravir, an investigation on nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor and lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor for the treatment of adults living with HIV. At 24 weeks, the trial met its primary endpoint and in a secondary endpoint maintained a high rate of viral suppression. Additional longer-term data will be presented at a later date.  In addition, safety and tolerability data were presented for MK-8527 a novel oral NRTTI candidates from 2 Phase I trials that evaluated ascending single dose and multiple doses in adults 18 to 55 years old, not infected with HIV. MK-8527 is being investigated as a potential monthly option for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. Vaccines remain an important element of our pipeline, and we are making progress across several programs. Findings from multiple Phase III trials of V116, our investigational 21 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were presented at the meeting of the International Society of pneumonia and Pneumococcal Diseases last month. V116 was shown to be immunogenic for all 21 serotypes covered by the vaccine, including a pneumococcal vaccine naive and vaccine experience adults as well as those at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. If approved, V116 would be the first vaccine specifically designed to address the majority of serotypes that cause invasive pneumococcal disease in adults, ages 65 and older.  The target action date is June 17. The meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on immunization practices is scheduled shortly thereafter. Since the initial approval of GARDASIL, a steady flow of clinical and real-world evidence has been generated to support the favorable efficacy, effectiveness, safety and long-term durability of protection against certain human papillomavirus-related cancers and diseases in both males and females. Despite the proven public health benefit of HPV vaccination, the latest global cancer statistics from the International Agency for Research on Cancer indicate there is more to do to help increase vaccination rates.  The latest statistics from 2022 ranked cervical cancer as the fourth most common cancer globally in terms of incidents and mortality in women and the leading cause of cancer death in 37 countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Southeast Asia regions. At the Urogen Congress, last month, we disclosed plans to build on the development of GARDASIL with a new clinical program to identify a novel multivalent HPV vaccine candidate with the potential to extend protection against a broader array of HPV types. This includes several types known to disproportionately impact African and Asian populations and individuals of African and Asian descent. First-in-human studies are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, we announced plans to conduct 2 randomized, double-blind multiyear clinical trials in females and males ages 16 to 26 years to examine the short- and long-term efficacy and immunogenicity of a single dose of GARDASIL-9 versus the currently approved 3-dose regimen. The goal of these studies is to generate data that clearly demonstrates whether or not a single dose of GARDASIL-9 provides comparable long-term protection to the approved regimen, while also satisfying the high standards required by regulatory authorities. The clinical trials are anticipated to start enrolling in the fourth quarter.  In oncology, we continue to focus on our 3-pillared strategy comprised of immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting agents. In immuno-oncology, September 2024 will mark a decade since the first approval of KEYTRUDA in metastatic melanoma. KEYTRUDA has since amassed approvals for 39 indication and continues to reinforce its reputation as a foundational therapy for certain types of cancer. Building on the recent FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of FIGO 2014, Stage II through IVA cervical cancer, we recently announced that the pivotal KEYNOTE-A18 trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival, potentially providing a new standard of care for these patients. Our commitment to providing better options to prevent and treat cervical cancer remain strong. Also, in women's cancer, the Phase III KEYNOTE-868 trial, known as NRG-GY018 was granted priority review by the FDA for the first-line treatment of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. This agency has set a target action date of June 21. Outside of the U.S., the European Commission approved KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer at high risk of recurrence based on the Phase III KEYNOTE-671 study. This marks the first approval in Europe for an anti-PD-1 PD-L1 therapy as part of a treatment regimen for the neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment of resectable non-small cell lung cancer based on positive overall survival results.  Next to precision targeting. Building on the success of KEYTRUDA for certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer, earlier this month, we announced the initiation of the Phase III clinical trial for MK-1084, an investigational oral selective KRAS G12C inhibitor in combination with KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of certain patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The decision to proceed to Phase III was based upon early promising evidence from a Phase I study showing antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile. KRAS is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in human cancers, and G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.  In the tissue targeting space, we are moving with speed and rigor to advance a broad pipeline of antibody drug conjugates with multiple planned and ongoing Phase III trials. In just over 6 months, we have made remarkable progress in our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Recently, we announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase II/III REJOICE OVARIAN01 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of raludotatug deruxtecan, an investigational CDH6 directed DXDADC in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We are poised to begin a Phase III study evaluating ifinatamab/deruxtecan, a B7-H3-directed ADC in small cell lung cancer, a notably difficult-to-treat tumor type. New treatment options are desperately needed for these patients where the prognosis remains poor.  We are pleased to have recently completed the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics, which provides novel T cell engagers, including MK-6070, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager, also being evaluated in certain types of small cell lung cancer as well as neuroendocrine tumors.  Finally, please mark your calendars for the evening of Monday, June 3, where we will host an investor event at ASCO in Chicago and provide an update on our diverse portfolio of immuno-oncology, precision molecular and tissue-targeting agents.  Looking forward, June promises to be a busy month with 3 regulatory action dates, including V116 for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. KEYTRUDA for primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma; and patritumab/deruxtecan for advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. We continue to execute on our strategy with a focus on operational excellence and look forward to providing further updates on our progress throughout the year.  And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Surely, we're ready to begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : This is probably one for Dean. Obviously, you guys have been focused on building out your cardiometabolic franchise now. You have the sotatercept launch underway. You've got an oral PCSK9 in late-stage development. You have a GLP glucagon also moving forward for NASH, I believe. But I guess I'd just be curious how you think about the opportunity in obesity broadly as, on one hand, it seems like it could align with your current footprint. But on the other hand, it seems like Merck has gone more towards specialty markets and away from kind of primary care. So maybe just would love your thoughts there, Dean, as you think about building out. Dean Li : Well, thank you very much. Yes, we are excited about the build-out that we have in cardiovascular metabolic. You pointed out the programs that have the most visibility right now. But let me assure you, there will be other programs that you will have more visibility over the coming years.  In relationship to your question about GLP and obesity, I think there's 2 ways to look at it : you can look at it from a GLP angle, and you can look at it from an obesity angle. If you look at it from a GLP angle, there has been really important work showing its impact in diabetes, weight loss, more recently, in cardiovascular outcomes, most recently in sleep apnea. And you're right, we're very interested in relationship to MASH. We think that's an also important outcome. And we also think that there will be distinct populations, whether you call it obese or whether you call it NASH or -- within that GLP space. With distinct relations, it will be important to give a benefit of a molecule that really takes care of the primary concern. And that's our play, for example, in NASH, where we think we have a very tolerable drug that has significant reduction in liver fat and also gives a weight loss of 10% to 12%. When you look at that, I think these different outcomes may need different molecules. More generally, if you're talking about obesity, I do think that there's important work going on right now. But I think that there could be another wave where people start thinking about orals, how tolerable they are, the accessibility they are, combinations, how do you maintain, how you preserve muscle and also additional outcomes. And it may not be that the same molecule is the best molecule that wins out in every one of those sub populations. And so I would just -- I wonder if there will be some fractionation of the patient population when you say the word, for example, generally, obesity. And we wonder if there's opportunity there. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : I wanted to touch on some of your work in lung cancer, specifically with KRAS G12C, echoing Dean's comment. So this space is becoming increasingly crowded. Maybe walk me through what you believe differentiates your assets today from the currently approved one or from the pan-KRAS assets in development. Dean Li : Yes. So this is one of my more favorite projects. So I appreciate that you actually ask a question about it. When you look at KRAS, as you point out, there is -- it's one of the most important driver mutations in multiple cancers. And if you say more broadly, not KRAS but pan-RAS, that is also true. In relationship to KRAS G12C, that's a small percentage of all the KRAS mutations and all the RAS mutations. But where KRAS G12C is especially prominent is in non-small cell lung cancer. It's, depending on the percentage, 12% to 15% in that patient population.  And I will also emphasize that we have a lot of data in relationship to that patient population in non-small cell lung cancer. It's KEYNOTE-189. It's chemo plus IO. You need a potent compound with a KRAS to move it into first line. That's the game that we're trying to play. So it is crowded. But what you're looking for is a potent compound that has tremendous monotherapy efficacy. But most importantly, when you combine it with, for example, pembro, you maintain the dose, you maintain the ability to not have dose modifications. And that's the data that made us excited about this because I think we reported an ORR of 71% in combination. So that's why we're advancing that.  The race for us is to get it in first line and then to think about other KRAS indications and IO-sensitive/insensitive and also other molecules that are coming through in the lung cancer space. And some of them are related to antibody drug conjugate. So we are very excited about our KRAS G12C program, 1084, which is moving to Phase III. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Chris Shibutani : Maybe focusing on the pipeline on areas that you do not highlight as often, specifically immunology. And then a lot of the discovery work that you talk about in CNS. With immunology with a TL1A, can you just help us understand where we are on the Crohn's study there and also the Pandion acquisition, like in just Phase II. And then CNS, you highlight how many folks you have doing discovery research. How do you feel about the distribution of your efforts in CNS there? So just 2 areas not highlighted in the press release, but I think are important to your overall portfolio. Dean Li : Thank you very much. So I'll first touch immunology and specifically in the TL1A space. So that TL1A, we think that it will be a highly effective -- the higher efficacy, and also not just in terms of efficacy, in terms of tolerability. That ulcerative colitis program Phase III has started already and is recruiting. We are hopeful that we will be announcing the opening of the Phase III and patients coming in for the Crohn's disease over the next few months. So we are very excited about moving TL1A eagerly and appropriately aggressively move it in Phase III to really sort of outline the really differentiated profile that we have seen for TL1A, and specifically, our compound.  I should also emphasize that we also are looking at TL1A not just within sort of inflammatory bowel disease, but we're also interested in other diseases. And one of the things that's really interesting about TL1A, it is blocking inflammation. But there is reasons to believe that it can have profound effects on fibrosis, and that's our interest in Crohn's disease.  But there are other diseases, for example, in the lung where fibrosis is a really important component. And we will be interested to see those. We have other assets moving forward both from the Prometheus acquisition that is not the TL1A as well as other internal that are moving forward with Alacrity.  In relationship to neuroscience, we hope to be getting the readout with MK-8189. We have other programs that are moving and advancing. And we have made some commitments in the early discovery space in a BD standpoint to accelerate some of our works that have been made public.  I think over the next 1 to 2 years, we'll see readouts Phase IIbs, Phase Is moving to Phase II. But I think at that point, we will be able to speak more fully. But I think the investment in neuroscience, I think, is critically important. From a health care unmet need, you have to list from an economic value to the health care system and population. Especially in the United States, neuro disease continues to be a really important place, and I would say neuro disease not just in terms of degenerative but -- not just classic neuro disease but in the psychiatry arena as well. And you've seen others advance business development in that space. We're interested in continuing in business development there, but also importantly, moving our own internal program, the lead program being MK-8189. Operator : Our next question from Daina Graybosch. Daina Graybosch : I want to ask some on pneumococcal vaccine. You mentioned several times V116 is customized for adults 65 and older. In the ACIP meeting, they discussed a recommendation in adult 50 or older. And I wonder if you could comment on where you think that ACIP recommendation will end up for V116. And on V117, I wonder if you could talk about how the stack scene, which I believe is now in Phase I is customized for pediatric patients. Robert Davis : Yes. Maybe I can start, Daina, and then Dean can add. Obviously, I would just start by saying we were very pleased with the overall tone and tenor of the discussion coming out of the ACIP meeting. And as you look at what we have with V116, we continue to believe -- if you look at the strength of the data behind that, and we've talked about -- Dean mentioned some of the clinical readouts that have come. But recall, we cover 83% of the serotypes-causing disease in adults. That's 30% higher than PCV20. So it's significant, and that was how it was specifically designed, targeting those serotypes which are most prevalent in adult disease.  As a result of that, we continue to believe the value proposition of V116 is very compelling. If you look at the cost effectiveness, it's going to be a very cost-effective vaccine. And as a result, I think that's why you started to see the ACIP ask questions about the 50 to 65 age cohort as well as the 65-plus. So I don't want to get ahead of the ACIP and their recommendation. But I would say our belief and conviction in the value of the data and the value this vaccine will bring for patients in the pneumococcal space is significant. And I would expect overall that we're going to see broad coverage coming out of the ACIP. Dean Li : Yes. I would just add, again, we want to be respectful of ACIP and the FDA. But you did point out something that I think is something that clearly we took notice. When Rob talks about that 83% versus 50% and 30% more, and the specific question that you're asking about, 50 to 64, I would remind everyone that dropping that age for universal vaccination have been considered previously for other vaccines. And they could not come to a situation where they thought that it would be a good idea based on cost effectiveness and as such. And by increasing it from 50% to 83%, we believe that we changed the calculus, and that made why there is renewed interest in lowering that age based on the broader coverage given for V116. Robert Davis : And I think there was a second question you had, Daina, about V117. I'll just maybe give a general answer, which is, obviously, if you look at the strategy of V116, it's the same strategy with V117 : How do we develop an investigational PCV vaccine that is targeted specifically to those serotypes that cause disease in children, in peds, without hopefully causing untoward effects. And so it's a model that follows that. We've not given any details to the additional serotypes or our thinking. But just understand that if you look at the model of V116, V117 is the same thing in peds. Operator : Our next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. James Shin : Firstly, I know Merck does not provide product-level guidance, but given WINREVAIR's importance and investor focus, can you provide any color on WINREVAIR contribution to guidance? And then second one is for Dean on REJOICE-Ovarian and I suppose precision oncology in general. But does the field know how much overlap there is between [indiscernible] FRalpha? And then for patritumab, I know the data for HER3 shows high expression in advanced patients, but there's a lot of development in advanced space. So how does Merck envision patritumab to be positioned or sequenced? Robert Davis : Yes. Maybe, James, I'll start. And thank you for the question. The short answer is, unfortunately, we don't provide product-level guidance. So I don't think we want to get into trying to tell you what we see WINREVAIR as being a contributor in 2024.  But with that said, I think it's important to make a few points just so you understand how we're seeing it. First of all, we're very excited to provide this novel treatment for patients with PAH. As you know, we think this will be a game changer in that space. We were well prepared for the launch. And I can tell you the launch, although very early, is going well so far. We've seen an increasing number of prescriptions being written. We've seen repeat prescriptions, and that's coming both from the COE space, from the Centers of Excellence, which is about 150 in the United States, as well as from non-COEs, which is a good development.  We've already begun making shipments to patients' homes. And hopefully, we'll have patients being dosed very soon, if not already.  And then I think the other thing I'd note is the prescribers as well as the locations are both from the Centers of Excellence and also non-COE. So that's something to note. And then finally, from a payer perspective, we're seeing good access. No real limits. In fact, we already have several payers who have established coverage policies. And I think as Caroline pointed out in the prepared comments, very consistent with the label and what we saw in STELLAR. But the fact that we've seen policies enacted giving coverage to patients already this quickly after launch, we see as a good sign. It's obviously early. But everything so far looks quite good. So our confidence in a successful launch has not changed. We continue to see this consistent with our expectations. And as we move forward, we'll give you appropriate level of transparency. But I just want to give flavor, even though we can't give the specific guidance you were asking for. Dean, I'll let you take the second part of the question. Dean Li : Yes. So I'll just add a little bit in relationship to WINREVAIR. I think it's important to emphasize that the indication or the label that we have is a broad indication and is based on STELLAR. And there will be potential data flows that will continue to inform and strengthen the field. We have STELLAR and SOTERIA, which is open label. We have ZENITH, which is advanced, and that will look at mortality and morbidity; and HYPERION, which is in more -- earlier in the journey.  We have the European action that will happen in the second half of 2024. And I would just emphasize that this is something that health care professionals and self-administration is possible. And in relationship to that, there will be a demand for innovation, and we hope to provide that innovation as this becomes even more used in a self-administration standpoint.  You asked a number of questions and many of the questions related, and some of it got blurred out, but some of it related to ovarian, but more broadly speaking, tissue targeting and ADCs. So I'll just give you an overview. When we look at the field, we look at cancers where there is IO and chemo and that combination. And where will we see that? We ask ourselves, can you combine an IO agent with a chemo agent? And we think about KEYTRUDA, but we also think about next-gen tissue targeting IO agents, such as the recent immune engagers that we have from Harpoon. And then on the other hand, we think about chemo, we think of precision targeting like RAS, how can it combine? And we also think in terms of ADCs. And the specific case that you're talking about, you have HER3 patritumab. That's moving along in EGFR non-small cell lung cancer. In B7-H3, there's prominent data that's in small cell lung cancer, maybe in prostate. And for CDH6 itself, that ovarian data is quite interesting, and that's raludotatug. At least for us, it's very interesting because the initial data with our partners in Daiichi Sankyo is striking to us. Because in that patient population, it looked like allcomers did extremely well and that in some situations, you think about a biomarker. But for the CDH6, the impact across sort of biomarker subsets was quite impressive. So I hope that gives you a general structure and we're happy to -- and thank you very much for that question. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Umer Raffat : I'm just trying to think through your next-gen HPV vaccine. And I guess, how should we think about potential penetration rates with a revaccination opportunity with the new broader-spectrum HPV, especially in patients who have already taken GARDASIL 9. Dean Li : Revaccination and relationship to HPV, is that what the question is? Robert Davis : The new [indiscernible]. Dean Li : With the G9+. I'm struggling to answer your question because I first got to make a G9+ that works really, really well. And when I get that, that will be great because there are patient populations that I think would be extremely well served. But I would also emphasize that we've just talked about cancer. We talked about early-stage cancer. This is the time that you can really treat and potentially cure, but we're in the business of preventing cancers as well. One of the questions that comes to us is that in certain patient populations, you want a vaccine that -- the data, for example, Scandinavia, it's 90-plus reduction -- 90% reduction in cancer incidents. And then the recent American Cancer Society. We are wondering whether if you make a G9+ vaccine, whether you can make the argument, if we're successful with the G9+ and what we hope to aspire for, whether you could fundamentally change how one recommends cancer screening for women in relationship to cervical cancer and also the reduction both in men and women of many other cancers outside of cervical cancer. Caroline Litchfield : This is Caroline. I'll just add that as we sit here today, we all know there are many, many people around the world that have not received a vaccine to prevent them against, to help protect them from HPV-related cancers. With the possibility of improving upon G9 with a multivalent vaccine, we're hopeful that we can provide further protection, especially for different population groups. And we will price the vaccine appropriately based on the benefit that it will provide. So we're looking forward to continuing to see growth in GARDASIL and see how the science evolves with our clinical programs. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : I have a few questions on KEYTRUDA subcu. It may not be scientifically sexy, but of course, it could be quite commercially meaningful. So we'll see that data, I believe, later this year. Any risk whatsoever to that readout? Or can we consider it to be a slam dunk? Second question is when the subcu launches in the U.S., presumably next year, will uptake be fast or slow or somewhere in between? And then eventually, how much can a subcu account for the franchise on a volume or a patient basis? Dean Li : So I'll take the first part of that. I remind myself, nothing is slam dunk once you place innovative drugs in patients. So I'll answer that question. But I think you highlighted really the pembro plus hyaluronidase that we're advancing. I would disagree a little bit. I do kind of think it's sexy in some ways. And that D770, we will be sharing that data by early 2025.  The reason I think it's really an important innovation is to really increase the access. You've seen the number of early-stage cancer readout that are coming through with pembrolizumab and KEYTRUDA and especially in the earlier stages when we talk about KEYNOTE-671, when we talk about in renal cell carcinoma, where we have OS benefit. I think this is going to be really, really important for patients. It will also be important in patients for treatment, especially in those who have monotherapy and those especially combos with oral agents because it just makes it so much more accessible. So we think this is an important program and that it could have substantial impact on patients and their access to PD-1, where we know the foundational elements of PD-1. And in terms of financial... Robert Davis : Yes. Maybe, Tim, I'll just provide some commentary on your questions on uptake and how much of the patient population this can account for. As we think about uptake of this opportunity, I would first point out that we see really -- it starts with the strength of the clinical data underlying the IO agent itself. So it's more about the confidence they have in KEYTRUDA. And then secondarily, it's about the delivery mechanism, which is important as we think about obviously leveraging the data we have and just the breadth of what KEYTRUDA is.  But I will tell you that as we think about bringing this forward when we do launch, our goal will be the price appropriately with the goal of driving quick adoption. So we do want to see adoption happen, and we do think you will see it. Obviously, if you look at then the size of the patient population where it could be, just to give you a sense, by 2028, if we look at the patients who are on monotherapy with KEYTRUDA who are using combinations with orals and those who are moving into earlier stages of disease through some of our adjuvant and neoadjuvant areas with KEYTRUDA, that represents about 50% of the patient population at that time. So that is really the addressable market for what we see the subcu offering to be.  And potentially, we're not foreclosing the opportunity to also look into the metastatic setting and people being given care in institutions as well as those moving outside of the institutions. But obviously, the value to the patient is ease of use, ability to use it outside of the hospital setting. The time and share is obviously less if you're getting a subcu versus an IV. And then from a cost to the health care system, the ability to not have a patient sitting in the chair for as long allowing for more patients to move through, we think, actually drives access and improves the providing of care as well. So we see it both beneficial from a patient perspective and from the provider perspective, and that's why we do think you'll see uptake of this important medicine when we bring it forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise Chen : I just wanted to ask you for ASCO on June 3. Are there any specific readouts updates that you're very excited about presenting? Dean Li : I think there's just going to be a stream of data. There's going to be follow-ups and a series of KEYNOTE, whether it be gastric, hepatocellular, biliary, bladder, non-small cell lung cancer. There will be discussions of many of the programs that I think you're beginning to see coming up in the clinical trial website in relationship to a whole series of Phase III related to molecules that you're familiar with, but also molecules that are sort of earlier in our Phase III development, ranging from bomedemstat to the KRAS program, to many of the ADCs and the updates that we've shown in relationship to not just the Daiichi Sankyo ADCs, but the other ADCs, whether it be TROP2 Claudin or [indiscernible]. So you'll have a whole full array of discussions of those compounds, some at the ASCO, but some at the ASCO investor event. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Louise. I know we have several more people in the queue. We're going to go an extra 5 or 10 minutes to try to get to as many questions as possible. Operator : Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Trung Huynh : Trung Huynh from UBS. On the WINREVAIR launch, thanks for the comments today on access and coverage. On approval, you noted that 2/3 of your PAH patients would likely Part D and third commercial. Perhaps can you expand on the free assistance program that you're hoping to initiate? And what proportion of those Part D patients do you think could be receiving free product this year? Robert Davis : Yes. I appreciate the question. So as you point out, we are very focused on ensuring that patients get access to the medicine. We're very much committed to it. And that's why we do have -- in addition to our normal programs we would run, we do have the access program we run. That program is actually independent of our commercial operations. We don't really report data coming out of that because it's run through a separate foundation and with the goal, frankly, of making sure that patients get medicines there. So that is available. It can be accessed on our website, and we're committed to making sure patients get the medicine. But specifics on that, we're not going to go into. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter L. Gould: Maybe on your personalized cancer vaccine with Moderna, as the Phase III sort of nears completion of enrollment, it of course begs the question around the potential to sort of file based on the existing data you have. Can you maybe just update us on your thoughts there and whether you think you still need Phase III data or manufacturing would preclude an early filing? Any help there would be appreciated. Dean Li : Yes, I'll take that. I mean I don't want to speak about whether the FDA will take what action or not. But I'll just reemphasize to everyone what is exciting about our I&T program and our excitement working with Moderna. So here, we're inducing and coaxing sort of immunity. And we're mixing it with a drug that's well known that and leases pre-existing immunity, which is KEYTRUDA.  What we have in our hands is a randomized, early-stage IO sensitive trial, where it is very clear of the contribution of components of the INT, not in immunogenicity, but in clinical benefit. So I just want to highlight that about our data as one looks at the data of others.  We also have begun to show that we are moving it in Phase III in adjuvant melanoma and adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer and our ability to move that with speed and rigor but get patients recruited, which is going well, I think will be very important because you're going to need a Phase III regardless of what the FDA decides on an accelerated approval or not. And so that's what we're focused on.  We're also focused on looking at other IO-sensitive tumors such as renal cell carcinoma. And I would just emphasize the strength of the data in relationship to durability is being answered. The ability for us to open these trials and successfully advance it is being answered. And we clearly have work to do with our colleagues who we respect deeply for what they've done in relationship to manufacturing.  Any -- all mRNA vaccine, I mean, they've really pushed the envelope here. Our ability to do that will be important to make this an important treatment. As far as the FDA's decision, the FDA will need to make their decision as to how they consider the opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Just a couple of GARDASIL questions. You're pointing to a more evenly distributed China sales this year, and it seems like a tougher 2Q comp. But can you just directionally talk about growth for GARDASIL more broadly for the year? I guess the heart of it is still a healthy growth asset for you this year. And the second one on GARDASIL is if we were to move to a single dose of GARDASIL-9, what does that mean commercially and from a sales perspective for the franchise? Caroline Litchfield : Chris, it's Caroline. So in terms of the phasing of GARDASIL, as you pointed out, during 2023, we saw in China an acceleration of the shipment from the second half of the year to the first half of the year, specifically to the second quarter. What that's done is it's provided an actual tailwind to revenue growth in the first quarter for China, but it will provide a headwind more significant in the second quarter. And that's what we've called out.  As we look at overall growth for GARDASIL, given where we are with the level of vaccinations across the world, given the manufacturing that we have been scaling up, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth during 2024. And in 2025, we will see our manufacturing capacity unconstrained so enabling us to further supply and support the market. As we've talked in the past, our opportunities for growth are significant as we look to continue to improve on adolescent vaccination rates, as we look to improve upon gender-neutral vaccinations, as we look to really activate the mid-adult segment, but increasingly get to the lower-income and middle-income markets, which will come at a different price point.  As we sit here today, continue to be confident in the outlook for GARDASIL over both the near and the long term. As we look at the possibility of a single dose of GARDASIL, the study that we are conducting will be a comprehensive study and will take some time to unfold. What we're seeing in the marketplace currently is where certain low-income markets are implementing a single-dose regimen, they are also increasing the numbers of people they are vaccinating by broadening the age cohort or also opting to vaccinate males at this stage. We'll have to be long term how the data plays out with regards to a single dose to ensure that we will price our vaccine based on the benefit that we're bringing and we vaccinate as many people in the world that we can. Operator : Your next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Luisa Hector : I also have questions on the WINREVAIR launch. I just wanted to check how straightforward the subcutaneous administration is and when you might expect to launch an auto-injector. Also, should we actually expect the Part D access to come online at a similar pace as commercial? I'm just not sure whether that's something that's maybe sitting more into next year.  And if I can, just another question on that with Part D is that you price for the Part D restructure next year. How do you expect payers to behave when this happens. I can see that the payer will take on a greater burden for higher-priced oral therapies. Do you expect some pushback within the actual drug that you would have higher rebates at that point? Or do you think that incremental burden for the payers might be spread more broadly across all products? It's a kind of bigger-picture question that WINREVAIR brings it into focus. Dean Li : So this is Dean. I'll answer your questions in terms of delivery of WINREVAIR. We have it in a vial, and we have it in a situation where both a health care provider or self-administration is both feasible, possible and will be used. We believe that the vast majority with time that people will use it as self-administration. This is a patient population that's quite used to doing injection. So we think that, that will be able to navigate and that the patients will get access.  But as you point out, further innovation will be demanded for, and an auto-injector will be critically important. We are doing the studies right now to evaluate how do we provide such an option, and we hope to have those options and those plans more public in the near future. But we agree with you totally in the fact that a future auto-injector will be important. Caroline Litchfield : And Luisa, this is Caroline. At this stage, we are seeing a real acceptance of the value proposition of WINREVAIR in the United States. We're seeing policy for coverage equally across both the Medicare and Medicaid patient population as well as the commercial segment. So as we move forward, we'll look forward to just helping as many patients as we can across all of those segments, irrelevant of their coverage. Operator : Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Seamus Fernandez : Wanted to ask actually about your RSV-targeted antibody, how you're thinking about that, the optionality for it and the market size and Merck's potential participation in this market as it relates to the competitors' global supply constraints at this point in time. It seems like coming to market more aggressively or as aggressively as possible could actually make for a meaningful market opportunity for Merck.  And then just a follow-up. Rob, I wanted to just get your sort of qualitative view 3 years, 4 years in thinking about the evolution of the business. 2028-2029 still represents a meaningful challenge with KEYTRUDA. But as you look forward to the rest of this year and heading into 2025, how important is business development to Merck from here in terms of the size and type of acquisitions I think investors have certainly applauded what Merck has executed on in the last year for sort of mid- to later-stage assets. Dean Li : Yes. So I'll take the RSV question. So clesrovimab, we're excited about it. As many of the people know, it's a monoclonal antibody and it's a way to get passive immunity to infants. We think it's really important as we have seen recently. And ours is a single fixed dose and has the durability in terms of covering a whole RSV season, I think, is critically important. And the ability to give this to an infant any time and -- versus, for example, alternative strategies, which is maternal vaccination. And then also, we believe that this will be a distinguished monoclonal antibody and it's high barrier to resistance. So we're excited about moving and -- seeing that data and moving with both speed and rigor to get this to the market because we think it will be an important contributor, especially given what we've seen in the RSV season just this past season.  I do want to just take this one moment to just say it's not just the RSV vaccine that we're very excited. We're also very excited because it's very much in the lay press in our dengue V181, which is a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine. And we're moving with equal eagerness to move that forward into Phase III, as we've already seen data from our colleagues in Institute Butantan about the effectiveness and efficacy of this vaccine. But I'll turn it back to Rob. Robert Davis : Yes. No. Thanks for the question. And so if I would just kind of, I guess, think a little bit about where we've been in over the last 3 years, a few points I would want to raise. One, I think we've made tremendous progress in a relatively short period of time, and I give all credit to Dean, to our R&D colleagues for what they've been able to do, how they have been able to really move just flawlessly products through our pipeline. It's amazing you think of it now 3 years in, we haven't had really any major failures. The one maybe hiccup with islatravir, but that's coming back. And so I feel very proud of what our colleagues in R&D have been able to do.  And then I think about from a commercial perspective, from a manufacturing perspective, we're pulling the products through, we're showing value. The fact that we're ready for the launch with WINREVAIR shows how we can build capability very quickly. We did it in KEYTRUDA, we did it in JANUVIA and now we're doing it in WINREVAIR, and we'll do it in new spaces coming forward. So we feel very good about that. So across all elements, R&D, commercial, manufacturing, the business is delivering.  And so as we sit here today, if our clinical success continues, I think you're going to see us with a more diversified set of growth drivers over time than, frankly, we've had in many years, if ever. And that's very important. And it all is really what leads to the confidence you've heard me express in other settings, that I'm increasingly less focused on 2028. And I would remind you, by the way, it's a staggered LOE. So it's 2028 in the U.S.; in China, it's 2031; in Europe, in 2032 and in Japan. So it's not a one-moment event. It actually happens over time.  But that being said, as you've heard me say, I see it is more of a hill than a cliff. And my confidence that we're going to come back with fast growth after that is very high. And we're very focused on the sustainable engine from 2030 to 2040 at this point. So I feel good about where we are, but I just want to reinforce it's a team effort, and I've been left with a great team. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Seamus, and thank you all for your time and your interest today. I'm hoping to see many of you at our ASCO event on June 3 or at a few of the conferences that we'll be attending this quarter. So thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks Peter. Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. Our business is demonstrating strong momentum as we exit the first half of the year. We remain guided by our purpose of harnessing the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world. Our ambitious and dedicated teams are working tirelessly to reach more patients with our broad commercial portfolio and advance our deep pipeline with the goal of delivering future innovations that solve for additional unmet medical needs. Through excellent scientific, commercial and operational execution, we\u2019re achieving significant milestones for our company and for patients. This quarter, we\u2019re proud to have successfully launched WINREVAIR, which has introduced a novel mechanism to treat adults suffering with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We\u2019re also pleased by the recent FDA approval of CAPVAXIVE, the first approved pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults, as well as the subsequent ACIP recommendation. Both of these important innovations demonstrate our unwavering commitment to creating value for patients and shareholders. And we remain committed to the execution of strategic business development to further augment our pipeline. We recently announced and have now closed the acquisition of EyeBio, which expands our effort in ophthalmology and brings to Merck a novel, late-phase candidate for the treatment of retinal diseases. This promising new mechanism adds another substantial potential commercial opportunity to our expanding pipeline in an area of significant unmet medical need. In addition, our Animal Health business closed the acquisition of Elanco\u2019s aqua business, which establishes Merck as a leader in this important production animal category. 3 years ago, I was honored to step into the role of CEO, and it remains my top priority to uphold and build on Merck\u2019s legacy as a premier science-driven, patient-focused biopharmaceutical company. At that time, I affirmed Merck\u2019s strategic commitment to the research and development of innovative medicines and vaccines as the source of long-term value creation. I communicated our intention to be appropriately aggressive in making the necessary investments to both advance our broad internal pipeline and augment it with the best external science through business development. Since then, we\u2019ve made substantial progress in expanding and evolving our pipeline to the benefit of future patients. We have the potential to bring as many new drugs to market in the next 5 years as we launched over the last 10 years, across a greater number of therapeutic areas and modalities, and with a significant proportion having blockbuster-plus potential. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress building on our past successes, enabling the creation of a sustainable engine that will drive future innovations for patients. And we continue to leverage our scientific prowess to identify new therapeutic targets where we can add value through our expertise in clinical development and regulatory affairs, and our global commercial scale. I\u2019m also proud of the substantial improvements we\u2019ve made across our sustainability focus areas. We\u2019re reaching more people with our medicines and vaccines across a greater number of countries globally than ever before, and doing so with a dedicated, highly talented and diverse employee base. Finally, we\u2019re driving increased innovation and productivity through widespread integration of data, digital and analytics in all areas of our business. Going forward, I\u2019m committed to ensuring our actions remain aligned with our strategy, and I\u2019m confident that we are well positioned to deliver value to patients and shareholders long into the future. Turning to our second quarter results, we achieved strong growth, reflecting continued demand across our broad portfolio, which is reflected in our updated full year guidance, which Caroline will speak to in just a moment. Turning to our broader research efforts and new launches. In cardiometabolic, we\u2019ve seen very favorable reception by physicians, patients and payors to the availability of WINREVAIR. While still early, the U.S. launch has gone very well, in line with our own high expectations. We\u2019ve deployed a focused, customer-centric rare disease model and are pleased to see an increasing number of prescriptions being written and patients obtaining access. We\u2019ve also received a positive CHMP opinion and look forward to potential regulatory approval in Europe in the near future. We continue to see a tremendous opportunity to positively impact the lives of patients living with this devastating disease. In vaccines, we continue to bring forward innovations for both adults and children. We are proud of the recent FDA approval of CAPVAXIVE for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, and the unanimous ACIP recommendation. Given its compelling clinical profile, we expect that CAPVAXIVE will achieve a majority market share in the adult setting. We were also pleased to announce positive topline results from the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of clesrovimab, our investigational monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in infants, and we are moving swiftly to bring this important option to market. Finally, at our ASCO investor event, we highlighted the significant broadening of our oncology pipeline and the progress we\u2019ve made in building on the success of KEYTRUDA. We presented data for multiple novel candidates, demonstrating our commitment to advancing standards of care and maintaining leadership over the long term. As a company, we remain highly focused and continue to work with urgency to bring forward these innovations, and others, for the patients we serve. In summary, I want to again recognize the tremendous efforts of our global team. Together, we\u2019ve made significant progress across our diverse pipeline and portfolio. As a company, we\u2019ve been advancing science for the benefit of patients for over 130 years, and I\u2019m confident that Merck is well positioned to deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders well into the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we delivered another excellent quarter, with growth driven by robust global demand across our innovative portfolio. These results are enabled by the excellent execution of our teams and reinforce the conviction we have in our science-led strategy. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term, and are committed to making disciplined investments in compelling science to drive long-term value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now, turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $16.1 billion, an increase of 7%, or 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its momentum with double-digit growth of 11% primarily driven by Oncology. Our Animal Health business also delivered solid performance, with sales increasing 6%, driven by growth in livestock products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.3 billion driven by increased uptake from earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumors. In the earlier-stage setting, the increase was largely attributable to uptake from KEYNOTE-671 and KEYNOTE-091 in non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA has now achieved market leadership in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, building on its existing leadership position as adjuvant therapy. In metastatic disease, we saw continued strong uptake in first-line advanced urothelial cancer following the recent launch of KEYNOTE-A39. KEYTRUDA plus Padcev has now surpassed platinum chemotherapy-based regimens in new patient starts. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased use in certain earlier stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and intermediate-high or high risk renal cell carcinoma as well as continued strong demand from patients with metastatic disease. Inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima each grew 4%. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $126 million driven by increased uptake in certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma. Our vaccines portfolio delivered solid growth. GARDASIL sales increased 4% to $2.5 billion. In the U.S., sales benefitted from price as well as demand and favorable CDC purchasing patterns. Outside the U.S., higher demand across many international markets was partially offset by the timing of shipments to China. In pneumococcal, VAXNEUVANCE sales increased 16% to $189 million. Growth was driven by ongoing launches in international markets. As Rob noted, we are very excited by the opportunity to positively impact the lives of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension following the recent U.S. launch of WINREVAIR. Recall, we received FDA approval on March 26th, with the first patients receiving therapy about one month later. Initial patient and physician feedback has been favorable, and we recorded $70 million of sales in the quarter. We estimate that approximately 40% of sales were attributable to doses administered to patients, with the remainder due to distributors building inventory in support of increasing demand. The launch is off to a strong start. As of the end of June, more than 2,000 patients received a prescription for WINREVAIR. Our experience to date with those prescriptions, would suggest that approximately 75% to 80% will receive commercial product. Of those, more than 1,000 patients started treatment in the quarter, largely reflecting prescriptions written in April and May, as it currently takes approximately one month to complete the steps necessary to commence therapy. More than 500 physicians have written at least one prescription, with many looking to gain experience with the product as they prioritize treating the most advanced patients, who are in greatest need of additional therapy. Most prescribers are from either large academic centers or larger private practices. We are pleased that payors are recognizing the value of WINREVAIR and are already providing access to patients. Many payors have established coverage policies consistent with the label or STELLAR study criteria, while others are in the process of developing their policies. In summary, we are pleased with the strong start and look forward to continued progress in enabling access for appropriate patients over the coming months. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 6%. Livestock sales grew 11% driven by higher demand for poultry and ruminant products as well as price. Companion animal sales grew 1%, reflecting price partially offset by a reduction in distributor inventory. We are also excited to have launched a long-acting BRAVECTO injectable in a number of international markets during June. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 80.9%, an increase of 4.3 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL as well as favorable product mix. Operating expenses decreased to $6.2 billion. There were no significant business development expenses in the quarter, compared with a $10.2 billion charge a year ago. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting strategic investments to realize the promise of our robust early- and late-phase pipeline and support the promotion of our key growth drivers. Other expense was $108 million. Our tax rate was 14.1%. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.28. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.4 and $64.4 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million at the midpoint. Our increased guidance range represents strong year over year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, including an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-July rates. Our gross margin assumption remains approximately 81%. We now expect operating expenses to be between $26.8 and $27.6 billion. This range reflects an incremental $1.5 billion of charges related to the one-time cost to acquire EyeBio and ongoing expenses to advance the assets, as well as investments to progress our innovative pipeline. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other Expense is expected to be approximately $350 million, which now includes financing costs for the acquisitions of EyeBio and Elanco\u2019s aqua business. Our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 15.5% and 16.5%, which includes an unfavorable impact related to the EyeBio acquisition that is not tax-deductible. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.94 to $8.04. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of more than $0.30, using mid-July rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $8.53 to $8.65. Including the one-time charge of $1.3 billion, or $0.51 per share, related to the acquisition of EyeBio and an estimated $0.09 to advance the assets as well as finance the EyeBio and Elanco aqua business transactions, our prior guidance range would have been $7.93 to $8.05, with a midpoint of $7.99. Our current guidance midpoint remains the same as our higher revenue estimate is being offset by increased investments to support our business. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. We look forward to the opportunity to help protect certain adults from invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia following the recent FDA approval and ACIP recommendation of CAPVAXIVE. We are now working toward the achievement of certain milestones that will enable commercial uptake. These milestones include publication in the morbidity and mortality weekly report, which typically lags an ACIP recommendation by a few months, as well as obtaining payor coverage and contracting with customers. For GARDASIL, over the past few years we\u2019ve benefitted from extremely strong demand in China, including from the expanded indication for GARDASIL 9 to the 9 to 45 year age cohort in late 2022. In the second quarter however, there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei. We are working closely with them to more fully understand the dynamics that caused this change. As we learn more, we will assess future shipments to our partner and work to bring their inventory back to more normal levels. If shipments from Zhifei into the points of vaccination do not increase it is likely that we will ship less than our full year 2024 contracted doses by the end of this year. We believe the opportunity in China remains very attractive as there are more than 120 million females in the addressable population living in Tier 1 to Tier 5 cities who have not yet received the protection of an HPV vaccine. As we said before, it will take increasing efforts to educate and activate the next wave of patients. Together with Zhifei, we are focused on and committed to investing in additional resources and patient education on the value of GARDASIL given the important benefits it provides. We also look forward to the potential approval for males which we believe represents a meaningful opportunity. More broadly, we remain confident in the opportunity for GARDASIL globally based on the protection it provides against HPV-related cancers and low immunization levels overall, and continue to believe we will achieve sales of over $11 billion by 2030. Our initial launch of WINREVAIR is having a positive impact for patients. We are very pleased with its performance and look forward to supporting more patients in the U.S. and across the globe. Outside the U.S., we are pleased with the positive CHMP opinion and potential near-term launch in Europe. Following EU approval, we will need to obtain reimbursement, which should occur in 2025 in most major markets, but expect that Germany will receive reimbursement and launch this year. We remain confident in the successful launch of WINREVAIR, consistent with our high expectations, and look forward to providing further updates on our progress. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our expansive pipeline of novel candidates, each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend, and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a priority and we are well positioned to pursue additional science-driven, value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, as we enter the second half of the year, there is continued strength in our business, driven by global demand and commercial execution. We remain confident in our outlook, driven by our unwavering commitment to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve the lives of patients. With investment in innovation and our ongoing focus on execution, we are well positioned to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Momentum continued in the second quarter with several clinical and regulatory milestones, as well as progress in our science-led business development strategy. Today, I will speak first to programs in vaccines, then cover oncology, followed by cardiometabolic disease. As Rob noted, last month the FDA approved CAPVAXIVE our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and we subsequently received a unanimous recommendation from the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices, for its use in certain adult populations. CAPVAXIVE is the first vaccine specifically designed to help protect adults against pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease and, as such, provides an important new public health option. It has been designed to address those serotypes responsible for approximately 85% of the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 years and older, based on CDC generated surveillance data. The CAPVAXIVE marketing authorization application is also under review by the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. We continue to evaluate novel approaches to alleviate the burden of infectious disease. Recently, we announced positive topline results for clesrovimab, our investigational respiratory syncytial virus preventative antibody, a single, fixed-dose option to help protect infants from birth through their first full RSV season. In the Phase 2b/3 trial, clesrovimab met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints as well as its secondary endpoint regarding RSV-associated hospitalization. Detailed findings of the study will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress and we plan to file these data with global regulatory authorities. Globally, RSV infection is a leading cause of hospitalization for otherwise healthy infants under one year of age. The historically high surge in incidence in the 2022, 2023 season reinforced the need for more effective preventative measures. Now to oncology. During the investor event at ASCO, we detailed how we have leveraged our foundational position with KEYTRUDA to create a diverse pipeline by executing on our three pillared strategy comprised of immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting candidates. This quarter, tangible progress has been made across each of these pillars. In immuno-oncology, we received FDA approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy for the treatment of primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer regardless of mismatch repair status, based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-868 study. Data continues to flow from the KEYTRUDA clinical development program including from studies which achieve an overall survival benefit, the gold standard for many oncology trials. We announced an overall survival benefit in high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer based on the KEYNOTE-522 study. KEYTRUDA is the only PD-1 or PD-L1 to date to receive approval for nine earlier stage indications, of which four have now demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival benefit including in non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and most recently, triple negative breast cancer. We were pleased to announce that KEYNOTE-811 met its overall survival dual primary endpoint for the first line treatment of patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. These results build on the previously reported positive data that formed the basis for the FDA approval last year. A similar approval was received from the National Medical Products Administration in China this quarter. Also in immuno-oncology, the FDA granted priority review for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma based on the overall survival benefit demonstrated in the KEYNOTE-483 trial. The FDA has set a target action date of September 25th. KEYTRUDA has now received approval for 40 distinct indications in the U.S. and has demonstrated statistically significant overall survival in 25 trials. Next to precision molecular targeting, we exercised the exclusive development option to advance the program for opevesostat, an oral nonsteroidal inhibitor of CYP11A1, through our collaboration with Orion. Two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating opevesostat in combination with hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic prostate cancer, OMAHA-1 and OMAHA-2, are ongoing. Lastly, in the tissue targeting space, The European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion recommending approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. We are also advancing a broad portfolio of diverse antibody-drug conjugates with Kelun-Biotech and Daiichi Sankyo, as well as our own internal programs. Last month, together with Daiichi Sankyo, we announced receipt of a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for the Biologics License Application for patritumab deruxtecan, for the treatment of certain adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The letter was issued based on findings from an inspection of a third-party manufacturing site. We are working with Daiichi Sankyo to provide appropriate support as they work with the FDA and the manufacturer to address the feedback in a timely manner. Of note, the findings identified in the CRL have no bearing on either ifinatamab deruxtecan nor raludotatug deruxtecan. Turning to cardiometabolic disease, as Caroline indicated there is strong interest from physicians and patients for WINREVAIR in the U.S. Building on this momentum, we were pleased to receive a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommending the approval of WINREVAIR as a treatment option for certain patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The European Commission\u2019s decision on the marketing authorization application is expected in the third quarter. Finally, we continue to execute on our science-led business development strategy with a focus on seamlessly integrating efforts across our internal pipeline with the best external science through our One Pipeline approach. We recently closed the acquisition of EyeBio that includes Restoret, MK-3000, an investigational, late phase, potentially first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific Wnt antibody candidate for diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, as well as additional preclinical assets targeting retinal diseases. There remains a significant medical need in this space and our teams are eager to work alongside the talented EyeBio team to advance these promising candidates. In closing, over the past 3-plus years, we have successfully built on the solid foundation established by the previous leadership team to assemble one of the strongest pipelines in recent memory. We have diversified in oncology while strengthening and expanding in other therapeutic areas including cardiometabolic, immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience and vaccines. We have strong momentum and I look forward to providing further updates on our progress. And now I turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Brad, we're ready for Q&A now. And I request that analysts limit themselves to one question today. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Hi, great. Thanks so much for the question and congrats on the progress. I just want to kick off with just a question on GARDASIL dynamics in China. Maybe just a 2-part question here. First, can you quantify what percent of your international sales are coming from China? And just any additional color on what drove the step down in 2Q. I'm trying to get my hands around this. And maybe as part of that, the 2024 guidance update is the potential for shipments to come below the 2024 contracted doses now reflected in that guidance? Or would that represent an incremental headwind to numbers to the extent that played out? Thank you. Rob Davis : Great. Thanks, Chris, and thanks for the question. And I'll maybe take the first part and then ask Caroline to comment on guidance. To your question, China represents about for GARDASIL about 60% to 70% of the numbers. So that kind of gives you a sense of it. But maybe to give some context on what we saw in the quarter and as we look to the full year and where we see things going. So let me start maybe by talking a little bit about the dynamics. The opportunity that exists for GARDASIL in China remains very attractive with more than 120 million eligible females in China yet to be protected against HPV, which represents about 60% to 70% of the eligible population. And I think we all recognize the benefits of protection against HPV-related diseases is clear and importantly, aligns with China's Healthy 2030 initiative. So the underlying support, we continue to believe is there. In addition, we have filed for the male indication, which has been accepted and represents another significant opportunity. So as we think about China, I just want to set the context because I think it's important to understand, we continue to have a very meaningful opportunity in the China market. What's unclear to us and what we're trying to understand is that during the second quarter, we saw a significant step down in shipments from Zhifei [ph] to the points of vaccination. The reductions during the second quarter was surprising, and I would point out was a meaningful departure from prior trends we've seen both throughout really all of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024. So as we look at this, we're wanting to understand what would cause the trend break we saw. And I can tell you what we know as of now is we believe there could be multiple factors that may be contributing to this dynamic, and we're working closely with our partner to try to tease out what exactly is happening. But overall, the data we track indicates that the whole HPV market in China experienced this step down. So this is not a Merck-specific event. And importantly, we see the market share for GARDASIL as stable or actually increasing right now in the marketplace. We don't believe this step down, therefore, represents any change in the competitive dynamic and GARDASIL remains by far the market leader. We do believe, however, that based on the intelligence we've gathered, activity in the HPV vaccine area has been recently impacted by China's anti-bribery and anticorruption drive, which, as you know, started really last year. And up to that point, we really haven't seen much impact, but we do believe we are starting to see it now. And this is really driven by the fact that in the health care industry, there has been as a result of this, a reduction in scientific engagement, primarily in the CDC within China and fewer immunizations. So we need to tease that out more. And in addition, we did see reduced levels of promotional support for HPV vaccination at the same time that our distribution partner, Zhifei [ph] broadened its portfolio. So we'll need to get more into that. But obviously, we have a very strong relationship with Zhifei, and we already have started to put in place a robust plan to invest in increased promotional efforts really designed to drive awareness, education and activation of the remaining female opportunity, and this includes both resources at Zhifei and more selling resources and promotional resources as well as promotional resources being deployed directly from Merck. So as we look forward, we will have to see how all of these activities impact shipments to the point of vaccination. And as we learn more, we'll assess future shipments to China with our partner. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of what we're seeing, but I just would reiterate one other point. And that's -- that as we look to the long term, given both the opportunity in China, I mentioned for the 120 million remaining females as well as the potential for the male indication, outside of China, we saw double-digit growth across all regions in the quarter. So we continue to be on track, doing well and driving growth in this important vaccine. And that's why you heard Caroline in our prepared comments reiterate our confidence in the $11 billion number by 2030, even taking into account what we saw China happening - in China this quarter. So with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Caroline and she can address your guidance specific question. Caroline? Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. So Chris, in terms of our guidance, we've assumed a range of scenarios from providing the fully contracted 2024 doses during this year to providing something less than that. If I anchor to the midpoint of our guidance, we have been measured in assuming a scenario that has less than the contracted 2024 GARDASIL doses shipped to China. And even with that, we were able to raise our guidance at the midpoint by $200 million. And that's really as a result of the underlying momentum that we have in the rest of our business, including oncology, with KEYTRUDA and WELIREG. It includes in animal health with the launch of BRAVECTO in injectable, as well as the acquisition of the Elanco aqua business, and we remain confident in our outlook for WINREVAIR and the opportunities to drive patient impact and growth consistent with our high expectations. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can I just dial down the GARDASIL point just a little more. Rob, I know you mentioned there's an anti-bribery, anticorruption drive going on in China, which started last year. But it also feels like some of the shipment delays are happening, perhaps a few months ahead of potential competition hitting the market as well. So could you speak to whether there's any future contracting happening and whether your long-term price integrity will stay intact on GARDASIL in China? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. No, thanks for the question. So everything we're seeing in the marketplace, I would just reiterate, would point to dynamics that we don't see the competition, the future potential competition. And I think you're referring to the fact that we very well could see a 9-valent sometime next year come into the marketplace. So I don't believe from anything we've heard in the marketplace from competitive intelligence as well as what we're hearing from Zhifei that, that is what's happening here. As we look forward, and Caroline can comment specifically, we have always expected that as we see the peak move through from the indication we got for the expansion of the age cohort that you would see a flattening out over time of the demand in China. And then that for women, specifically, and then we would bring on the male indications that should allow us then to continue to drive the business forward from there. Nothing has changed in that dynamic in what we're seeing right now. So as we look forward, our belief in China being a significant contributor is unchanged. But I'll let maybe Caroline can speak specifically as we're thinking about some of the guidance around how we think about next year. Caroline Litchfield : So what I would add is we have always contemplated that we would have a 9-valent competitor within the Chinese market. As such, the current contracted doses with Zhifei for 2025 are less than what the contract is for 2024 as we would expect to participate in that market but understand a competitor would likely gain share in that market. We also, though, as we said in the prepared remarks, has the potential opportunity of a male launch in China. And we are hopeful for an approval with GARDASIL 4 and 9 by first half of next year and be coming to the market at that stage. So we are confident that China will remain an important part of our GARDASIL business as we move forward, and more importantly, are confident in the opportunity to drive GARDASIL longer term to the $11 billion that we've stated. Rob Davis : Yes. And maybe, Umer, just to give one little bit of color because it's probably worth pointing out, I'm assuming people understand when we talk about the anti-bribery and anticorruption what is happening. And one question that could be there is this has been going on since late last year, and we did not see impacts early on, what's changed and how do we see it evolving. And what I would point out, first of all, one, just reiterate, as we think about what's happening in China around the anti-bribery and anticorruption we very much support those activities because it means we have a fair, open and transparent market. So we're very supportive of what the Chinese government is trying to do there. But as we see how this is impacting us at the CDC, we have seen some dampening in them engaging in scientific discussions and driving for vaccination. We believe some of this could be due to the fact that there was criminal charges brought against a senior scientific representative of one of the local players related to a COVID vaccine that we believe has had a dampening effect overall. And how long this lasts, how it will continue to play out, we'll have to see. But I thought I would provide additional color because I don't want to assume that you all are aware of what really is happening there. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks. Umer. Next question please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Carter Gould of Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just switch gears and talk about WINREVAIR a bit. Can you maybe characterize or maybe going to -- in terms of the pace of new starts, do you see that sort of as sustainable or surpassable? And as we think about the sort of that 1-month delayed time line from prescription to start, can you maybe characterize how much of that is sort of payer versus sort of the nurse training driven? And if there's a chance that might evolve? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. No, thanks for the question. So to give you a sense of what we've seen as of the end of June, we've had more than 2,000 patients receive a prescription for WINREVAIR. So that's -- obviously, we feel very good about that. And right now, what our experience would tell us is that about 75% to 80% of those receiving a prescription will convert to commercial product. So that gives you a sense of what's happening. Right now, actually, in the quarter, driving the revenue you saw was about 30 -- about 1,000 patients actually on treatment had started treatment. So as we sit here today, you have 1,000 patients who have started treatment in the quarter, the 2,000 total scripts, and we would expect that the 75% to 80% of those 2,000 scripts will ultimately convert to the commercial sales. And so if you look at what's driving that difference, some of that is due to access, but also some of it is due to patient dropout and the fact that you will have some patients who despite getting a script after they go through blood [ph] work and go through the medical evaluations don't qualify. So you have all of those dynamics happening. If you look at the 30 days and specifically that you're referring to, we think that probably the total period from when a person gets a script to when they get their approval for -- from an access perspective is about 2 weeks to 3 weeks. So there is obviously opportunity to improve that. But just remember that in addition to going and getting a blood test, getting your insurance approval, you then have to schedule to have a nurse come to your home to go through the initiation and training around administration -- self-administration of WINREVAIR. So all of those elements are contributing to that time frame, how much of that time over time we'll have to see. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Carter. Next question please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Tim Anderson : Oh, thank you very much. Just going back to GARDASIL. I know you're reiterating your $11 billion figure, at least $11 billion in 2030. The shape of the curve over that time in China specifically, which is only a part of that number, are there likely to be periods where year-on-year sales actually contract beyond 2024 in the inventory issue? Because it does seem like pricing is really going to be a risk here, the way pricing works with vaccines in China and some of these other offsetting indications like males are going to take time to launch. So it seems like there may be periods there where you could have year-on-year declines in sales over the next, let's say, 5 or 6 years. So if you could just describe the shape of that curve, please? Rob Davis : Yes, sure. So as we look at it, we do expect you will see a flattening of the curve as we see the female indication, be more fully penetrated. Obviously, more to go there, given what we believe is still the addressable population. And then it will ramp back to growth as the male population comes on in full. So that is what we're expecting to happen. And on the pricing point, I think it's just important to understand the way this market works and how we operate in the market. We sell into Zhifei, Zhifei then is responsible for doing the bidding with the provinces and actually then determining ultimately that end sale to the point of vaccination. As we look forward, I think it's important to understand that GARDASIL as we think about the addressable population, we continue to believe we'll be a highly sought after vaccine even in the face of competition, and we're dealing in an overall population when we quote the $200 million total females of which we would say we're 30% to 40% penetrated today. That's really in the Tier 1 to 5 cities that we think can afford a cash pay market. The total population accessible in China is much bigger and so I don't think we should assume we're all competing for that small slice. There's a much bigger slice. We have chosen not to go for that bigger piece because obviously, we can't get into the local vaccination program because we don't produce GARDASIL in China. Our competitors will be able to do that. So I think I would just caution all to not view it as a zero-sum game. I think there's still a market expansion opportunity in China that will benefit both us and the competitors. And frankly, the other thing we have to see is how quickly will the male indication be given to others beyond us. We believe there's a chance we could be sitting alone with that as well. So the dynamics need to play themselves out. But I think we need to first understand what we're seeing in the quarter specific, a short-term event or something else. And that's still not clear because I would just point that the trend break was pretty significant. It's not what we've seen in any of the markets that you would expect. And that's why we're a little hesitant to say this is just demand in China. And also, I would also bring back the fact that actually, if you separated out what happened in China, we had one of our strongest quarters in every other market around the world with strong double-digit growth. So that's -- those are all dynamics that we'll have to play themselves out. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you. Tim. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Scala of TD Cowen. Your line is open. Steve Scala : Thank you. How does clesrovimab compare on hospitalizations to Beyfortus [ph] which has 85% to 90% effectiveness on hospitalizations. I appreciate you're not going to give out data specifics. But for instance, would you say your product is highly competitive. And I'm just curious, how does it achieve longer durability given that it has a shorter half-life than Beyfortus? Thank you. Dean Li : Yes. So this is Dean. Thanks for the question. As you point out, there is a significant global unmet need both for the healthy and at-risk infants. And as we've said, from the PKPD studies as such, this is something that can be given as a single dose. It's not weight-based, so single dose broadly. And we are very comfortable in relationship to the PKPD in relationship with the half-life in relationship to the affinity that's the prevention, which was studied would cover the entire RSV season, which is 5, 6 months. We did announce the top line. We're not going to get ahead of the public presentation of these that we hope to have at some session in the second half. I do point out that what you highlight is really important, which is the RSV associated hospitalization will be a really important point in relationship to looking at this vaccine versus others, and we are very confident in that profile. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Steve. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And just to trying to understand the long-term growth path for GARDASIL, it seems like and correct me if I'm wrong, a lot of it, it would depend on raising awareness in those Tier 1 to 5 cities and male vaccination. So the question is, of those Tier 1, 2, 5 cities, where do you think there is bigger opportunity because, I mean, going to Tier 4 and 5 could be challenging. And then based on your main vaccination experience in the developed world, how should we think about China in that context? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. So if you look across the Tier 1 to 5 cities, we're actually -- when we quote that we're 30% to 40% penetrated, and again, this is just to the females. So this is -- we're only speaking to females right now. We're 30% to 40% penetrated. We're a little bit less penetrated, I think we're around kind of, say, 30th percent in the 4 and 5 Tier cities, and we're around 40% into 1 to 3. So there's not a huge spread between the Tier 1 to 3 and the 4 to 5. So we will continue to focus efforts across all of those areas as we have been to date. And then it's a whole different exercise to activate the male population across that same area, which is, frankly, doesn't -- isn't there today because of the fact that we don't yet have the indication. As you think about how all of this fits into the broader global picture, I think it's also important just to remind everyone that the total penetration of GARDASIL on a global basis to the eligible population is approximately 10%. So our opportunity to activate patients globally as we bring on additional capacity is significant. And as we've talked about in the past, we were going to continue to look to activate the mid adult segment in the private market. We're doing that today in Europe, and that's part of when I comment that we're driving double-digit growth across the rest of the world outside of China. Part of it is we are starting to see uptake in that private market activation, both in Europe and across parts of Latin America and Asia Pacific more broadly. We're going to continue to drive into the low and middle income markets, we see that as a meaningful opportunity going forward, and we are well on our way to getting our costs in a position to be able to compete in that space quite effectively. We will continue to drive that. And then obviously, while China is the best example of where we need to get a male indication to drive for gender-neutral vaccination if we truly want to eliminate cervical cancer and increasingly address the other cancers we know related to people with HPV, including head and neck cancers, which are very prominent, especially if you look across the Asia Pacific area. That is work we will continue to do, but not only in China and across Asia but also across Europe and other parts of the world where there still is a lot of opportunity to drive for gender neutral. And then lastly, Japan is a market where we are continuing to see growth driven by the fact that we've had a renewed NIP program there with both initial NIP and a catch-up phase and longer term opportunities for males there as well. So the opportunities are significant. The context of how we will drive growth has multiple levers for us to look at to do that. And that's why we are confident in the $11 billion number long term. And I think that's important as we shape the overall context of the discussion. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Mohit. We have availability to go a bit past 10, so we'll continue on with questions. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question is from Luisa Hector of Berenberg. Your line is open. Luisa Hector : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on RSV antibody, please. Can you confirm that you can file in all major markets this year? And then I just wondered about China in this context, is that a market where you'll be filing soon? And what the opportunity is there? How much education is required to access the private market? Thank you. Dean Li : Yes. So let me just level set in relationship to clesrovimab, and the RSV antibody. So we have the data, and that data will be presented at some time in the second half of this year as the different plenary sessions of different conferences occur. In relationship to filing, our plan is to file such that it would be available, not for this season, but for the next season within the United States. And so that's the sort of next wave in relationship. So I want to make sure that there's no concept that this is coming out this RSV season. We're targeting next RSV season in relationship to when we're seeking approval and licensure. Rob Davis : Yes. And maybe just on the broader question, could this be an opportunity in China. We are continuing to look at all global markets. And I would point out, as Dean points out, we're looking at the '25, '26 RSV season, so next year. And then beyond that, we will go globally thereafter. And China is a market we are looking at. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Luisa. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Dana Graybosch of Leerink. Your line is open. Dana Graybosch : Hi, thank you for the question. I want to ask about the recent ODAC that was on periadjuvant [ph] development in lung cancer. I wonder, let's assume FDA takes a hard line on requiring the contribution of the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases. And you look forward to the current KEYTRUDA development program. Do you see any risk to that hard line to any of your label extension plans? And how are you going back to looking at your development, especially of novel combos in the early stage given that discussion. Thank you. Rob Davis : Thank you very much. So just to provide some context, the recent outcome talked about how much of a PD-1 or a PD-L1 is put in earlier stage, especially in the resectable and there's giving it before the surgery, there's giving it after the surgery, and it's giving it before and after the surgery. And the issue that comes up is in this curative setting, what's the sort of relative benefit risk in, because it's different than in the metastatic. What I would just emphasize is we track and we are in discussions with the FDA in relationship to our clinical trials and such. But I do want to emphasize the ability to show OS especially in the earlier-stage cancers is very difficult. And that's why we always emphasize we have 9 earlier-stage approvals, but we highlight that 4 of them have overall survival, and we, at this point, do not know anyone else who has 4 overall survivals. I do want to point out that in 2 of those over survivals in TNBC and in lung, it is perioperative. So I think the future studies need to consider what the FDA has said, but the FDA has also been very clear that over survival is the gold standard, especially an earlier stage. And as we build our program, we consider both the recent AdCom, but also the recent -- with the continuing interest of the FDA to show contribution of components of a new agent on top of PD-1 and showing overall survival and using platforms that have overall survival to show that when you add something even more, you continue to have increasing benefit in terms of over survival. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Dana. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Akash Tewari of Jefferies. Your line is open. Akash Tewari : Hey, thanks so much. And really helpful color on GARDASIL. Just one more here. Looking at the latest Zhifei contract, it looks like there's around $4.5 billion in potential sales for 2024. That's projected to decline in 2025 and 2026 to around $2.5 billion. Historically, however, it looks like you've always exceeded that contracted figure. So just to be clear, does the contracted decline in sales over the next 2 years bake in the upside for potential male approval? And should we expect the Zhifei contract to get renegotiated as we get further clarity on demand? Thanks so much. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you for the question. So the Zhifei contract that we have at this stage is focused on the current approval that we have in the market. So it's really focused on the female population in the cohort 9 through 45. As we move forward and we have a male indication, we will, of course, be working with our partner to have the appropriate doses so that we can protect as many males as possible. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Akash. Next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Trung Huynh of UBS. Your line is open. Trung Huynh : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on CAPVAXIVE. During the ACIP at the end of June, there was a big discussion on the plus 50 population for the product. They never got around to reviewing it those. So is it possible we can get that looked at in October for a potential updated recommendation? Rob Davis : Thank you so much for bringing that up. There was a lot of discussion. There were a lot of points that the ACIP working group have to vote on. And what they had said is that they were very interested in revisiting this in October. I want to be very clear that we have not had a formal confirmation of that reevaluation. But we did listen to the discussion. And the discussion was very clear that there was an interest in revisiting that in 50 to 64. And the data presented at the June ACIP meeting demonstrated or actually reinforced the ongoing burden of pneumococcal disease, especially in the 50-64 age group, most notably in the ratio of disparities. And I went back to the comments that were made by different individuals, but I focused on some of the points that those who actually vote in the ACIP, one resonated with me when that member said, the burden in 50 to 64-year-old black individuals is comparable to greater than 65 when we're all endorsing universal recommendation for over 65. And that member wondered whether we, which is the ACIP, was missing something too, by not deciding, and that we, the ACIP needed to decide at some point, and I hope we get there pretty soon in part because of the racial and ethnic disparities in the invasive disease. So we are very confident in our data, and we look forward to the ACIP considering this expanded age-based recommendation potentially in October, and we hope to find out at some appropriate time that they're going to formally confirm that reevaluation. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Trung. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question is from Louise Chen of Cantor. Your line is open. Louise Chen : Hi, thank you for taking my question here. I wanted to ask you on WINREVAIR, how you think about sales in the third quarter of '24, given some stocking that we saw this quarter? Thank you. Caroline Litchfield : So thank you for the question, Louise. We feel that we're off to a really strong start with WINREVAIR. As we've described, as at the end of the quarter, we have 2,000 patients who now have the prescription for WINREVAIR, of which 75% to 80% historically have been receiving commercial product. So we're confident in what we expect for the profile for WINREVAIR in the third quarter. And we actually expect that the stock level should increase as more patients have prescribed the product. So we remain confident in the outlook for WINREVAIR consistent with the high expectations that we have. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Louise. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Shibutani of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Chris Shibutani : Thank you. On business development, this is typically a question that you get closed in June, you did comment that the company does have an expressed interest in the cardiometabolic space, thinking about second and third generation opportunities potentially in weight management. Can you just provide us with the latest views, house used in terms of appetite, size, therapeutic area in particular noting obesity? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. No, Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, we discussed what we did in the quarter with EyeBio and Elanco aqua business, we're going to continue to follow the same strategy we've been looking at, which is really focusing on the science and looking at how can we best continue to drive where we see a scientific opportunity that matches our portfolio and our skill set to bring that in more on the earlier stage settings and with some mid late but clearly not commercialized products more to build the pipeline. So the continuation of the strategy we've been following. We continue to have the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes. But as we've pointed out in the past, we tend to look in that $1 billion to $15 billion, is a good indication of where we would most likely play. And to the obesity question specifically, our view continues to be that if we can find opportunities to look at next-generation plays in that space, those will be things we will continue to evaluate and consider. We don't believe going after today's first generation is the place to play. So it will continue to be looking at second and third generation waves of innovation, whether it be around oral delivery, looking for where there's high tolerability, combinability and or preservation of muscle mass. Those are the areas of focus for us. And if we see something, we continue to have the capacity and the interest to act. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please, Brad. Operator : The next question is from Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two part on WINREVAIR for me. I was just wondering if you think you've already worked through the initial bolus of patients in kind of late line or if there's more to go here for the second half? And then any color on background therapy in terms of the patients that have already started on sotatercept. Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. Maybe I'll start on the second part and then I'll come back to the first part. So on background therapy, you are seeing the vast majority of patients, as you would expect, are some of the sicker patients or who doctors are putting on the drug first. So there is a large amount on triple therapy or double therapy, and you are seeing uses with prostacyclin. So that is and frankly, consistent with what you would have seen in STELLAR as well. So we are seeing that pretty much as you'd expect. And then over time, we would expect to move into the earlier lines of therapy as we go. As it relates to what we see going forward with the bolus, I would say that we're -- it's not necessary that we think the bolus has been worked through. There's what I would tell you more broadly is we're seeing a continued growth in both the breadth and the depth of prescribers who are prescribing, which were at a little over 500 doctors now prescribing. We think there's probably somewhere in the 800 to 900 range of doctors that are doing the vast majority of prescribing out there. So we still have a ways to go to get to what I would consider to be heavy prescribers of the medicine. And as we see that group continuing to come in and as we continue to see access being granted because the other thing I would point out that, one, we feel very good. We have about a third of all lives are covered today under medical plan with a protocol in place for reimbursement related to WINREVAIR. We expect that to continue to grow because I would remind you that a lot of plans actually put in place just by the rule that they will wait 90 to 120 days-ish to put in place a plan -- a coverage plan after a drug is launched. So you have a lot of plans still yet to come. So because of the fact you're going to see increasing access, you're going to see the fact that we have increasing number of physicians, and we're continuing to see the breadth of patients grow, I think you're going to see continued trend for growth upward. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Terence. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for the update today. So give me interest in the schizophrenia space with a number of readouts coming in the second half of the year. Can you characterize what we should expect from your Phase IIb trial of MK-8189? It looks like the study completed back in June. Just wondering when we might do the data on kind of how we should be comping this to the novel developments in the space? Dean Li : Yes. So this is Dean. Thank you very much for that. Neuroscience question for MK-8189. I should just point out that I believe it was just in May that we published the Phase IIa, and it shows its efficacy and relationship to schizophrenia. But what was also interesting was that there was a reduction in body weight of around 6 pounds over just 4 weeks. And the reason why that's important is that oftentimes, it's not simply how efficacious the drug is. It's whether a patient will stay on and what are the adverse effects that will drive a patient not to take the drug. So that Phase IIa was really important that triggered the Phase IIb. So I'll just lay out that if we see things that are comparable to that Phase IIa and our Phase IIb, we would be eager to see such results. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Evan. Brad, one more question, please. Operator : Your final question comes from James Shin of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. James Shin : Morning. Thank you for the question. For WINREVAIR the conversion of the 75% to 80% of scripts into commercial embedded within fiscal year '24 guide? And quickly, is there any time line on the INTerpath filing? Thank you. Rob Davis : So the answer to your first question is yes. And the answer to the second question, I would let Dean address. Dean Li : So in relationship to our collaboration with Moderna in relationship to the INT [ph], that's something that we're focused on getting the Phase III fully enrolled and to move forward as that's really important in relationship to how we will see the program and how the FDA will see that program. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, James, and thank you all for your good questions today. As always, the IR team is available for any follow-up questions. Rob, any closing comments that you'd like to make. Rob Davis : No. No. I just want to thank you for your interest this morning. Hopefully, you appreciate the transparency with which we try to bring. But I maybe would close by just bringing back the confidence we see in the business, both in the short term and the long term. Obviously, we'll work through what we see happening with GARDASIL in China. But the fact that we see strengthening, and I would call them, green shoots around GARDASIL everywhere else in the world gives us confidence in the $11 billion for that, as we've talked about. But then beyond that, the growing breadth of our pipeline, obviously, KEYTRUDA continues to deliver meaningfully for the business and for patients. But I am growing in my own excitement for the breadth and depth of the pipeline we have coming. Hopefully, it wasn't lost on everyone that we pointed out, we would be launching more drugs in the next 5 years than we've launched in the last 10 many, many of which will be blockbuster plus opportunities. So the pipeline is maturing, and we're starting to see the green shoots of opportunity that continue to grow our confidence as we look to 2028 into the 2030s and beyond. And that's where we will continue to focus. But we will not take our eye off the short term where we are equally confident in the guidance, we raised revenue today. Obviously, we kind of were neutral on earnings, but that's because of the investment we're making into the business, bringing in even more opportunities like EyeBio. So there's a lot out there, and I just want to leave you with that note of what's driving my confidence and my appreciation for your support of the stock. Thank you.

These slides along with the earnings release, today's prepared remarks and our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. At Merck, we're confronting some of the world's most challenging unmet medical needs with innovative science and differentiated solutions, and we're delivering on our key strategic priorities. The strong progress we're making across our business increases the confidence I have in our ability to achieve long-term success and create sustainable value for both patients and shareholders. We're launching important new products that solve for unmet medical needs and which have significant commercial potential. We're advancing novel clinical programs across a pipeline of diversified therapeutic areas and modalities. And we're adding to our internal research and development efforts through value-creating business development transactions. As a result, Merck is moving toward a future with a much more diversified portfolio. Our Phase 3 pipeline has nearly tripled over the past three-plus years to more than 20 unique assets. This will fuel a substantial set of new medicine and vaccine launches over the next five years. In fact, approximately equal to what we've launched over the past 10 years, and we believe the majority have blockbuster plus potential. We've improved the long-term visibility and are intensely focused on ensuring strong clinical execution across our diversified set of pipeline opportunities and future growth drivers. As always, we remain science-driven and patient-focused as we work to bring these medicines and vaccines to those who need them most. Turning to our third quarter results. Commercial execution is a top priority, and we're highly focused on delivering in the near term. The strength of our overall portfolio puts us on track to achieve strong full year growth. For the quarter, revenues increased 4% or 7% on a constant currency basis. Our results benefited from increased usage of KEYTRUDA globally, contributions from new launches, including WINREVAIR and CAPVAXIVE and strong growth in our Animal Health business. I'm pleased with the launch performance of WINREVAIR, which is consistent with our high expectations and remain confident in the long-term opportunity it represents for patients and for Merck. As anticipated, results also reflect a decline in GARDASIL sales year-over-year. Notably, however, we achieved strong double-digit growth for GARDASIL in almost every major region outside of China. In China, consistent with the expectations we discussed on our prior earnings call, we shipped less to our commercialization partner, Zhifei, and we expect fourth quarter shipments will be at a similar level to the third quarter. Overall channel inventories of GARDASIL have decreased, which is directionally encouraging while inventory at Zhifei remains above historical levels. We are highly focused on this market and are making progress with Zhifei to increase promotional resources and patient education efforts. We expect these efforts to translate to increased patient activation and demand. But as we've said, this will take time. Taking a step back, we're proud of the role that GARDASIL is playing in helping prevent certain HPV-related cancers. There's a wide range of long-term growth opportunities around the world due to the tremendous remaining need to protect more individuals with less than 10% of the global eligible population vaccinated and meaningful opportunities to improve vaccination completion rates, gender-neutral vaccination rates, mid-adult coverage and access in low and middle-income markets. This includes in China, where there is an attractive long-term opportunity, given the significant number of females yet to be immunized and the potential approval for males next year. We're highly focused on using our scale and strong capabilities to drive education and awareness of the benefits of HPV vaccination and to reach and protect more patients globally. As such, we remain confident in our goal of achieving greater than $11 billion of sales by 2030. Turning to our research efforts. We achieved important clinical and business development milestones this quarter. Starting with our clinical advancements in vaccines, we presented positive Phase 2b/3 results for clesrovimab, our investigational monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in infants. Based on its differentiated profile and robust clinical data, we believe this opportunity is underappreciated. We're moving swiftly to make this important prevention option available in the U.S. during the '25-'26 RSV season. In pneumococcal, ACIP voted to expand vaccination recommendations for CAPVAXIVE to include adults ages 50 to 64. We're pleased to bring CAPVAXIVE's effectiveness and protecting against invasive pneumococcal disease to this new cohort of patients, and this recommendation reinforces our confidence in its blockbuster commercial potential. In oncology, it's been 10 years since KEYTRUDA's first U.S. approval, and we remain highly focused on advancing standard of care and maintaining durable leadership in oncology. At ESMO, we presented overall survival and long-term follow-up data for KEYTRUDA and data also were shared from our innovative ADCs, underscoring our commitment to building a broad and diverse oncology pipeline. In infectious diseases, we shared Phase 2 data from our collaboration with Gilead for the combination of once-weekly oral islatravir and lenacapavir for HIV treatment in treatment-experienced adults. This data represents just a portion of our broad HIV development efforts to further advance the field. In immunology, we shared positive Phase 2 maintenance data for our investigational TL1A candidate tulisokibart in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease that adds to positive prior clinical results. Both our HIV and immunology programs address patient populations with significant remaining unmet need despite available therapies. Our investments in these therapeutic areas reflect our belief in the opportunity to deliver additional value to patients and fortify our sustainable innovation engine for the long term. Regarding business development, we continue to leverage our scientific expertise to identify promising therapeutic targets that can further broaden and fortify our pipeline. This quarter, we acquired a novel investigational bispecific T-cell engager from Curon with potential applications in both oncology and immunology, complementing our efforts in each of these areas of high unmet need, and we closed the acquisitions of EyeBio and the Elanco aqua business. In summary, we remain highly focused on strong commercial and operational execution to enable access to our medicines and vaccines. We're also continuing to make strategic investments in our pipeline that we're confident will lead to important innovations for patients and future growth drivers for our company. I want to again recognize the commitment and efforts of our team across the world. Based on our continued progress, I'm more confident in our longer term future today than I was a year ago, and I believe that Merck is even better positioned to deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders long into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter. The fundamentals of our business remain healthy, fueled by robust global demand for our innovative portfolio. This strong performance reinforces the conviction we have in our science-led strategy and in our outlook for continued growth. We remain confident in our ability to consistently deliver strong results in the short term while we make disciplined investments in leading-edge science, which positions us to generate lasting value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $16.7 billion, an increase of 4% or 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business sustained its momentum with sales increasing 8%, primarily driven by oncology. Our Animal Health business also delivered strong performance with sales growth of 11%. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.4 billion. Global growth was driven by increased uptake from earlier-stage cancers and continued robust global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S. KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumor types. In the earlier stage setting, the largest driver was increased use in resectable non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA's market leadership continues to grow as part of the treatment regimen in the perioperative setting, building on its existing leadership position as adjacent therapy. In metastatic disease, we saw increased uptake in first-line advanced urothelial cancer based on KEYNOTE-A39. KEYTRUDA plus Padcev continues its leadership in new patient starts outpacing platinum chemotherapy-based regimens. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer as well as continued demand from patients with metastatic disease, inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Lynparza alliance revenue grew 13%, driven by increased global demand. Lenvima alliance revenue declined 4% due to the timing of shipments last year. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $139 million, driven by increased uptake in certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma in the U.S. In vaccines, GARDASIL sales were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10%, driven by a decline in China. In the U.S., sales benefited from CDC purchasing patterns as well as price and demand outside the U.S. sales increased by double-digits in almost every region, driven by robust demand. In pneumococcal, VAXNEUVANCE sales increased 13% to $239 million, driven by ongoing launches in international markets. We are also excited by the recent launch of CAPVAXIVE, which is off to an encouraging start. In cardiovascular, the launch of WINREVAIR continues to gain momentum with global sales of $149 million. In the U.S., we have seen steady progress in adding new patients. During the quarter, approximately 1,700 new patients received a prescription, bringing the total number of new patient prescriptions to more than 3,700 since launch. Based on our experience to date, approximately 80% of those patients will receive commercial product. Given this and the approximate one month time frame to complete the steps to commence therapy more than 2,600 new commercial patients have started treatment since launch. We are seeing physicians prescribe WINREVAIR to more of their patients and new physicians prescribe the product. Through the end of September, nearly 800 physicians have written at least one prescription with most prescribers coming from either large academic centers or larger private practices. Physicians are continuing to prioritize the sickest patients who have already been receiving multiple PAH therapies. We are also making important progress in enabling access. We have achieved coverage for approximately 60% of lives, nearly doubling the amount from last quarter. Many payers have established coverage policies consistent with the label or STELLAR study criteria. Outside the U.S., initial feedback from scientific leaders has been positive following the recent EU approval. We are pleased that the first patients in Germany have received a prescription for WINREVAIR. We look forward to securing reimbursement in other European countries, which typically takes 12 months as well as launching in other international markets. In summary, we are excited with the continued progress of the launch and look forward to positively impacting more patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our Animal Health business delivered strong growth, with sales increasing 11%. Companion animal sales grew 17%, driven by uptake from new product launches, including the long-acting Bravecto injectable in certain international markets as well as price. Livestock sales grew 7%, reflecting higher demand for poultry and swine products, the inclusion of sales from the recently acquired Aqua portfolio from Elanco, which closed in mid-July and price. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 80.5%, an increase of 3.5 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL as well as favourable product mix. Operating expenses increased to $8.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of charges related to the acquisition of EyeBio and a promising candidate from Curon. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 9%, reflecting strategic investments in support of our innovative early and late phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other income was $193 million, which includes a payment of $170 million from Daiichi Sankyo related to the collaboration for our T-cell engager. Our tax rate of 21.9% includes an unfavourable impact from the EyeBio and Curon transactions. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.57. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business has enabled us to narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.6 billion and $64.1 billion. This guidance range represents strong year-over-year growth of 6% to 7%, including an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-October rates. Our gross margin assumption remains approximately 81%. We expect operating expenses to be between $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion, which now includes the $750 million onetime charge related to the asset acquisition from Curon. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is now expected to be approximately $100 million including the benefit of the $170 million payment from Daiichi. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%, which includes an unfavourable impact related to the Curon transaction. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.72 to $7.77. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.30 using mid-October rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $7.94 to $8.04, including the onetime charge of $750 million or $0.29 per share related to the asset acquisition from Curon and the $170 million or $0.05 per share benefit from the payment from Daiichi, our prior guidance range would have been $7.70 to $7.80 with a midpoint of $7.75. Therefore, our current guidance midpoint is unchanged. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains the same. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our key growth drivers and expansive pipeline of novel candidates each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend with the goal of continuing to increase it over time, adding compelling science through business development remains a priority and we are well positioned to pursue additional value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchase. To conclude, as we finish the year, we are confident in the momentum of our business, underpinned by robust global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. Our unwavering dedication to leverage compelling science to save and improve the lives of the patients we serve has put us in a position of financial and operational strength. Our commitment to bring forward important innovation will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. We have continued to execute on our strategy of diversifying in oncology and expanding into new therapeutic areas, while also investing in novel modalities and technologies. The third quarter was marked by several important clinical and regulatory milestones. I will first cover infectious diseases and oncology and conclude with updates on the broader portfolio. . As Rob noted, last week, ACIP voted to update the adult age-based pneumococcal vaccination guidelines and recommend the use of CAPVAXIVE, our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for individuals 50 years and older. CAPVAXIVE is specifically designed to cover serotypes responsible for the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease and includes serotypes responsible for approximately 84% of cases of IPD in adults 50 and older based on national level CDC data from 2018 to 2022. Building on our company's proud legacy and infectious diseases, detailed findings from a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial evaluating clesrovimab, our investigation of respiratory syncytial virus preventative monoclonal antibody for the protection of infants entering their first RSV season were presented at IDWeek. Clesrovimab administered as a single dose immunization to healthy preterm and full-term infants, regardless of weight met all trial endpoints with consistent results through both 5-month and 6-month time points. The incidence of adverse events and serious AEs were comparable between treatment and placebo groups, with no treatment or RSV-related death. As shown in the summary tables in the data press release, clesrovimab immunization is being studied across mild, moderate and severe RSV disease endpoints. Importantly, clesrovimab significantly reduced the incidence of RSV, the primary endpoint and hospitalizations associated with RSV infections through 5 months by more than 84% the secondary end point. It was also observed that clesrovimab reduced RSV lower respiratory infections by more than 90% through 5 months, the tertiary endpoint. Positive results were also presented from an interim analysis in a separate Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of clesrovimab versus Palivizumab in infants and children at increased risk for severe RSV disease. If approved, clesrovimab will be the first and only immunization designed to bright infants with direct rapid and durable protection for the full six months RSV season with the convenience of one dose regardless of weight or month of birth. Also at IDWeek, positive data were presented from the Phase 2 study of the combination of islatravir and lenacapavir, Gilead HIV-1 capsid inhibitor as a once-weekly oral treatment option for people living with HIV. The 48-week results build on the positive 24-week data previously presented. These findings reinforce the strength of our HIV pipeline as we evaluate multiple promising candidates in preventative and treatment settings. Next, to oncology. KEYTRUDA continues to raise the bar in treating earlier stages of disease. In the earlier-stage setting, KEYTRUDA is the only PD-1 or PD-L1 to date to receive FDA approvals for nine indications and is the only one to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit in four earlier-stage settings; non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. And as Caroline spoke to we continue to see strong patient impact. KEYTRUDA-based regimens have demonstrated positive results across 13 pivotal trials in tumor types. We look forward to building on the data in the earlier-stage setting. We recently announced positive top line results for the KEYNOTE-689 trial, evaluating KEYTRUDA as a perioperative treatment for patients newly diagnosed with Stage 3 or 4 a resected locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The trial met its primary endpoint of event-free survival and demonstrated an improvement in major pathological response, a key secondary endpoint. This is the first positive trial to show a statistically significant benefit of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment for newly diagnosed patients with resected locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 20 years. Results will be submitted to regulatory authorities and if approved would mark the tenth indication of a KEYTRUDA-based regimen for the treatment of earlier stage cancer. On the regulatory front, we received FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma based on results from the KEYNOTE-483 study. This brings the number of distinct FDA-approved indications for KEYTRUDA to 41. The European Commission approved three KEYTRUDA-based regimens, which include in combination with Pfizer's Padcev and Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on the KEYNOTE-A39 study. In combination with carboplatinum and paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma and in combination with chemo radiotherapy for the treatment of FIGO 2014 Stage 3 to 4A locally advanced cervical cancer in adults who have not received prior definitive therapy based on KEYNOTE-868. KEYTRUDA was also approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health for three indications. In combination with Pfizer's Padcev and Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with radically unresectable urothelial carcinoma based on the KEYNOTE-A39 study. For patients with radically unresectable urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-052 as well as in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment then continued as monotherapy as an adjuvant therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer based on findings from KEYNOTE-671. At the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress, three presentations for KEYTRUDA were showcased during presidential symposium sessions. These include overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-522 trial and high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer. Overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-A18 trial in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer and 10-year follow-up overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-006 trial showing the long-term benefit over Ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. And finally in oncology, we continue to advance our increasingly diverse pipeline, including our efforts to evaluate the potential of new combination regimens to improve patient outcomes. Earlier this month, we announced a clinical development collaboration with Exelixis for their investigation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Zanzalintinib, which will be evaluated in combination with KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and with WELIREG for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma. In collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, we initiated IDeate-Lung02, a Phase 3 trial evaluating Ifinatamab, Deruxtecan, a B7-H3 directed antibody drug conjugate for the treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer. We also expanded our agreement to evaluate the combination of IDXD with MK-6070, an investigation of delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager. Evidence from clinical studies for each candidate provides strong rationale for evaluating this combination regimen. Next, to our broader portfolio. As Caroline mentioned, we were pleased to receive approval from the European Commission for WINREVAIR, expanding the reach of this treatment option, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment journey for patients suffering for pulmonary arterial hypertension. In immunology, 50-week efficacy and safety data for tulisokibart, our investigational humanized monoclonal antibody directed to tumor necrosis factor like cytokine 1A from the Phase 2 ARTEMIS-UC and APOLLO-CD studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, were presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week Congress. The results reinforce the potential of tulisokibart to help patients achieve long-term clinical remission. The Phase 3 trials continue to actively enroll patients. Finally, in ophthalmology, soon after completing our acquisition of EyeBio, we initiated the Phase 2b/3 BRUNELLO trial for MK-3000 an investigational tetravalent, trispecific antibody that acts as an agonist of the winglet related integration site signaling pathway being evaluated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. We are executing on our one pipeline approach, augmenting and complementing our internal programs through business development. Recently, we completed the acquisition of CN201, a novel CD3, CD19 T-cell engager, now known as MK-1045 from Curon Biopharmaceutical. MK-1045 has shown to significantly deplete B-cell levels with potential applications in B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. As with our previous acquisitions, we plan to seamlessly advance clinical development with rigor and speed. In closing, during the quarter, we saw a regular cadence of late-phase pipeline advancements including regulatory milestones and data readouts. We continue to make progress across therapeutic areas, and I look forward to providing further updates on our programs in 2025. And now I turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Shirley, we're now ready for Q&A. If the analysts today could limit themselves to one question, it would be appreciated so we can get as many analysts on the call as possible. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Trung Huynh : Thanks for taking my question. Just on GARDASIL, given the inventory levels remain elevated, you've noted this declining demand. How should we think about dynamics as we head into 2025, given that increase in promotional activity, but that's balanced by the inventory work down will take time? Or do you have any color on when we'll see an inflection to that returning growth? Rob Davis : Great. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're very focused on GARDASIL in China, but maybe just to step back for a second. And we continue to be very proud of the contribution that GARDASIL is making for patients and people around the world to really address and hopefully eliminate long-term cervical cancer as well as other HPV-related cancers. So that important work will continue -- and importantly, as we commented in our prepared remarks, while China did decline, and I'll speak to China in a second. Overall, we saw strong double-digit growth in really nearly every other region around the world, which is showing the progress we're making and which is why we continue to have such confidence in the long-term potential for this. But as it relates to China specifically, and as we think about 2025, I don't want to give specific guidance because obviously, we're still working through our 2025 plan. But what I would say is we do expect to continue to see a decline in shipments into China into 2025. And as we had highlighted before, this is happening a little bit earlier than we originally expected, but we had always expected that over time, as we work through the bolus, we would see the female opportunity decline and then hopefully seeing growth come with bringing the mail opportunity, which we would expect to see with approval, assuming it comes next year. So that's how we see it progressing. So as we think about 2025, we see China really in the $2 billion to $3 billion range as far as an opportunity for 2025 and for the next several years with the opportunity in males really being the growth driver. And at that level, we would expect for overall Merck that you're going to continue to see based on the portfolio we have solid growth. So I think that's just important to kind of frame where we're seeing things. But understanding, we're focused on this. We're bringing our efforts to drive demand and we're going to make progress. We are making progress, but it's going to take some time. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Trung. Next question please, Shirley. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. This is Edward [ph] on for Vamil from Guggenheim. Just on WINREVIR, what are you seeing in terms of safety since it's been rolled out commercially. Any sense of how many patients are on the low dose versus the high dose? And then, any estimate of what percent of patients need to have their dose reduced or stopped due to the safety issues? Rob Davis : Yes. I'll maybe let Dean start and then I can jump in. Dean Li : From the safety issue, we haven't had any profound or important signals at all in relationship to the patients that we've been serving. So that has not been an issue to date in the patients that have gotten WINREVAIR, but more broadly. Rob Davis : Yes. So just to give you a sense of what we're seeing in the marketplace as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing the sickest patients being predominantly about 80% of the patients we have today. So those would be people on triple therapy. And as we're looking at the kits being used, we're still predominantly seeing use of single vials, not double vials as we're still bringing a lot of people onto therapy, remember that when a patient starts therapy, they start on a single vial and then they would transition either to maintaining on single or going to double depending on their weight over time. So we expect to see, as we saw with STELLAR that you would end up with about two-third of patients would be on the single vial and about one-third of patients on the double vial right now, that's a little bit more skewed towards single, but we expect it still to get there over time. And importantly, on your broader question, Dean gave one sense about where we see safety. I think the best real-world statement around safety we're seeing very strong adherence and really seeing less discontinuations than we expected. So the anecdotal information we're getting from the marketplace as far as the rural world experience, I would say, as said that safety is not an issue. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Shirley, next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. You may ask your question. Louise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about your outlook for 2025? What are the major puts and takes are? And when do you plan to get that guidance? Thank you. Rob Davis : Yes. I'll turn it over to Caroline for that. Caroline Litchfield : So Louise, we plan to give our guidance with the fourth quarter earnings as we ordinarily do. But if I give you a sense of the overall pushes and pulls. If I start with 2024, it's been a really strong year for our company. As we've noted, we expect to deliver 6% to 7% growth, while we're investing in and really driving our pipeline and have delivered strong underlying operating margin improvement. As we look to 2025, we expect solid growth for our business. And the key opportunities that we have is the continued impact for KEYTRUDA especially in earlier-stage cancers but the tumor types we would call out would be early stage non-small cell lung cancer. We've got great opportunity in women's cancers, including early Stage 2 negative breast but also endometrial and cervical cancer. And of course, bladder cancer is a real opportunity for growth. We are confident where we are with were and the opportunities there to continue to see strong performance and the impact for patients. And of course, we have the recent and upcoming launches that includes WINREVAIR, where we have high expectations for growth. It includes CAPVAXIVE, where we expect to get a majority share over time, and it also includes the opportunity for the launch of clesrovimab in RSV ahead of the '25-'26 season. And as we noted, Animal Health is a strong contributor to growth, and we expect that to continue into next year. We have a few headwinds. One is the expiration of our agreement with J&J for the immunology products, REMICADE and SIMPONI. And as Rob noted, we do expect sales of GARDASIL in China to decline in 2025 compared with 2024. However, all of that said, we're very confident in the opportunity to drive solid growth for our business in '25, while we invest fully behind our expansive pipeline investing the commercial activities to ensure excellence in the marketplace and expect to deliver operating margin expansion. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Louise. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Chris Shibutani : Thank you very much. The capital allocation opportunity is something that you have been very consistent about providing us updates given some of the push and pulls in the business, in particular vulnerability with GARDASIL, I think you have capacity and you have also mentioned interest in certain areas, I would note with obesity. Can you update us on where you are with your appetite therapeutic area, anything that would give us insight into your ability to use that as a lever to help perhaps offset some of this uncertainty tied to GARDASIL? Rob Davis : Yes. No, Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, I feel very good about the business development we've done, including some of the transactions that Dean just highlighted in the prepared remarks, and we're going to continue to look to do more. So while we feel good about where we are. And actually, as I made a comment in the prepared remarks, we have more Phase 3 assets now than we had was more than tripled that from where we were 3 years ago and with more than 20. So we have a lot there, but we need to add more. And we're looking across all therapeutic areas. Our approach remains where it's always been, which is we start with the science, and where we see a scientific opportunity that addresses an unmet need and where we think Merck can strategically play, if we see that aligned with value, we will act as it relates to obesity, our goal and strategy there continues to be focusing on the second and third generation opportunities in that space. We've talked in the past, thinking more of a focus on oral opportunities and those that can be in combination focused on outcomes that go beyond just obesity but to actually medical outcomes. So we continue to look but we're going to be disciplined. And if we don't see something where we think it makes sense from a value perspective and a strategy, we won't move. Beyond that, I would say, you should continue to see us look in areas of oncology immunology and broader cardio metabolic, all the places where we're playing today are areas where we continue to look for opportunities down the road. From a capacity perspective, just to be clear, we continue to think we have capacity, frankly, to do pretty much anything of any size. But our focus area continues to be mainly in that $1 billion to $15 billion range. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Chris. Next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daina Graybosch with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Daina Graybosch : Yes. Can you talk a little bit more about the pneumococcal opportunity? What do you think is the incremental market size from the expansion down to age 50? And is there anything you're looking for in the MMWR language when they publish that recommendation that would drive more or less share to CAPVAXIVE versus the competitors? Rob Davis : Yes. Maybe, Dean, do you want to start, and we can jump in? Dean Li : Yes. I mean, I think it was interesting to watch the ACIP. They're balancing how to make the best recommendations, and we should just remember, we have a 21-valent vaccine that gives 85% adult protection that was very clear, and there is a competitor who has a 20-valent that has a 54% adult protection. And I think that was very clear at the ACIP. And I would just remind myself that previously when they thought about doing the 50 to 64, just with the 20-valent, there was a decision not to proceed. And I really do think the health economic data and the data that we show for the 21-valent given it's 85% versus 54% is what drove them to finally move and address a really important need, which is the health equity issues in relationship to a pneumococcal vaccination by lowering it to 50 to 64 and lowering it for everyone. But in terms of the dynamics in the market. Caroline Litchfield : So, in terms of the commercial opportunity we have, given the strength of the data that Dean has just shared, we feel very confident in our opportunity. And to remind, in terms of the number of patients in the United States, there's around 120 million people over the age of 50, 60 million of those are in the 50 to 64 age group, which now given the ACIP recommendation provides a tremendous opportunity for us to activate that patient cohort to go and get this vaccine as well as the group that sit above the age of 65 given the strength of our data. So, we are ready. We have supply, and we're looking forward to ensuring that we can protect as many people as possible. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Daina. Next question please, Shirley. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just another one on GARDASIL. Rob, I believe you said kind of $2 billion to $3 billion per year opportunity for China over the next few years. Just a couple of quick ones there. First, what does that compare to where China is going to shake out for Merck this year? And is that $2 billion to $3 billion number what was reflected in the $11 billion longer-term target? Thanks so much. Rob Davis : Yes. So, to give you just a sense of where we are, and we don't normally give product level guidance or specifics on a quarterly basis. But given the importance and focus on GARDASIL, just to give you a sense of where we were with China, GARDASIL in the third quarter. It's about approximately $500 million in the third quarter. And as we said, we would expect to ship about the same amount in the fourth quarter. So you should expect that the fourth quarter itself would also be in that $500 million range. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where we are. So as you look forward to 2025, obviously, as we think in 2025 and over the next several years, if you're running in that $2 billion to $3 billion range, that's why we made the comment that with that and given the other opportunities we see around the world, we remain confident in our ability to get to the $11 billion by 2030. So we are contemplating that $2 billion to $3 billion over the next several years in China as the contribution that it would make to get us to where we need, understanding also that long term, we do expect to be able to have the potential for growth driven by the male opportunity in China and then obviously continuing to drive more broadly around the rest of the world. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Chris. Next question please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just one question and one clarification. Just on the GARDASIL side, Rob, that's the $2 billion to $3 billion includes the males or it does not include the males, sorry I was a little unclear based on the last response. And then obviously, next-gen IO remains a big focus for both Merck and the industry, I know, Dean, you talked a lot about some of the efforts Merck has made on this front. Would just be curious to get your perspective on the PD-1, PD-L1 VEGF bispecifics. Obviously, there's some data emerging out of China there. Just any thoughts on that data and where that might fit from a competitive landscape perspective or if that's a target Merck has considered at all? Rob Davis : Yes. So, I'll take the first part of that question, Terence. So the answer is yes. The $2 billion to $3 billion over the next several years does include male, but we have the opportunity as you look longer term to drive growth with that opportunity. That was really the point we were trying to make. Dean Li : In relation to your question in relationship to the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, it is an important axis. I just -- there's been a lot of data in that. It's not just the most recent data. Merck has made a substantial investment in that pathway our collaborations with Eisai and Exelixis is along that pathway. It's PD-1, in this case, with the VEGF RTK inhibitors. Other companies have taken their PD-L1 and added to, for example, Avastin, and I would just emphasize, our interest in HIF-2 alpha is also related to vascular endothelial growth factor. In relationship to the specific question about Summit, that deep expertise that has developed in that VEGF. I think it's really important for all of us to watch carefully, and we are watching carefully the ability to turn PFS into OS. The other issue is that in China, the health system is a little bit different as to how they treat individuals, but also the patients here are also different in terms of their responsiveness to VEGF. I would also emphasize that the experiment that was done in China is an experiment that we would be unable to do, for example, in the United States, we would not be able to compare new combo against KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the PD-L1 through 49% PD-L1 that's something we would not be able to do because in that situation, the comparator is not monotherapy, but it's KEYNOTE-189. But broadly speaking, combos will be important, combos to deepen it to go earlier stage will be important. I think vascular endothelial growth factor pathways are important. IT will be import, RAS will be import, ADCs will be important and all of those readouts will come some before 2028, some around 2028 and some will happen after 2028. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Terence. Next question please, Shirley. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the GARDASIL color. Maybe on WINREVAIR, can you comment on the impact of stocking in the quarter? And I'm trying to also kind of square Rob, some of your comments around sort of the efforts to work through the sickest patients, kind of maybe help frame for us kind of how far you're along sort of that initial bolus of patients, those later line patients within the STELLAR label? Thank you. Caroline Litchfield : So Carter, in the quarter, over 80% of the revenue is to support demand. And so a very small level of inventory build and we'd expect inventory dollars to build over time, given the growth that we expect in the product. In terms of the patients that are being prescribed the product, as Rob noted, a large portion, it's actually about 80% of the patients are on background triple therapy or in combination with the prostacyclin. So we're making really good progress in that segment. At the same time, a large number of the physicians have prescribed WINREVAIR now to patients that are not on a prostacyclin background therapy which gives us confidence for the ability to move to the patients who are more dual therapy over time. And we remain confident in the opportunity in line with our high expectations here to benefit patients and to drive significant commercial benefit for our company. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Carter. Next question please, Shirley. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have -- I wanted to focus on GARDASIL just a little more. That was a very helpful commentary, Rob, you mentioned 500 million in sales in 3Q and 4Q to China, which obviously is 2 billion run rate. My question is, was that shipping to demand because if so, what that means is inventory sitting at your pay is still something that would need to be worked down in 2025 as well as possible 9-valent generic entry -- sorry, 9-valent local competition entry in 2025 as well. How do you factor those 2 dynamics into thinking about the 2025 number of 2 billion to 3 billion in China? Rob Davis : Yes. So if you look at what's happening in the overall marketplace and just to give you a sense, from an inventory perspective, maybe starting there. If you look at overall inventory levels in China, they did come down. And that's taking into account and this is for GARDASIL. GARDASIL and Zhifei, which frankly remains high and grew slightly but that was more than offset by reductions in the CDCs and the points of vaccination. So that's a good sign that we're seeing overall inventories coming down, which also would point to the fact that as we're looking at demand, which we're seeing stabilize, we think we're at a position now whereas we're starting to talk about what we're shipping. Our expectation is we are shipping below demand. So we have been working very constructively with Zhifei to think about this, both is what we're doing in this year is, frankly, as well as we're continuing to have constructive dialogue around 2025. Our intention would be to balance the need to get product into the marketplace to meet the demand at the same time, allowing for Zhifei to bring down their inventories over time. So we're very thoughtful on how we're thinking about it, and we've done that, taking into account our expectations of both the female competitive launch that could come next year, but also the opportunity that a male approval early next year could allow us to have. So all of those factors are in as we think about that $2 billion to $3 billion number. Peter Dannenbaum : Thanks, Umer. Perhaps two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please ask your question. Steve Scala : Thank you very much. I mean, all things considered, is it still possible to see global GARDASIL growth in 2025. And Rob, you noted at the start that recovery in China will take time. But it sounds like you have good visibility now because you're giving this $2 billion to $3 billion guidance for GARDASIL in China. So I'm unclear what it is that we're waiting for. Rob Davis : Well, what we're talking about taking time is basically to work down the inventory and to then build demand over time so that we can continue to drive that market. What we're giving you is kind of what we see as the baseline of China. Our hope is that we'll do better. And we're going to put the work in to do better and to continue to drive long term. I think that what I'm trying to make sure everyone hears is this isn't going to be solved next quarter. It's going to take us through probably 2025, but we're thoughtful on how we're doing it. We're working with Zhifei in a constructive manner to do it. So those are the elements are going to take time because we need to build the demand. We know the opportunity is there with 120 million females still out there to go after and with potentially 200 million males with the male opportunity. We have to activate that demand to make sure we can drive that business. So that's really what we're focusing on. As far as it relates to GARDASIL for 2025, I don't think we really want to get into giving product line guidance right now. We were very specific to China because of the concerns that were there. And I wanted to make sure, that we see solid overall growth for Merck because that's important to have context. But beyond that, we normally wouldn't be giving guidance at this point in time. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Steve. Last question, please. Operator : Thank you. And that comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Mohit Bansal : Great, thank you very much for taking my question. My question is regarding V940 in lung cancer. I see that you have started Phase 3 trial. Could you please help us understand what kind of data you have seen in earlier stages, which makes you move into Phase 3, I don't think we have seen a lot of data from our side here. Dean Li : Yes. So this is Dean. I would just emphasize, and I was trying to sort of lay the foundation during the prepared remarks. I would just recognize that in earlier stage, we have 9 approvals and 4 with OS, that basis allows us to drive curative setting combos in a way that is advantageous for the patient and also often uniquely ability for us. The specific study that you're, I think, referring to is the announcement with our partners, Moderna, of going in lung cancer. Specifically, that one is built around KEYNOTE-671, which has an OS benefit and is approved. But the interesting thing is in the sort of neoadjuvant or perioperative followed by surgery, there becomes a situation where we can discern who has a pathological complete response and who doesn't have a pathological complete response. And that patient population that does not have a pathological complete response there is the need and our ability to provide other combinations in that space, and that is where we're driving the INT in that situation in lung cancer. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you all for your good questions today. And as always, we're available for follow-ups. Please reach out when you want. Take care. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dannenbaum, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Shirley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's fourth quarter 2024 conference call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I'd like to point out that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items that we have excluded from our non-GAAP results.

These slides, along with the earnings release, today's prepared remarks and our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. Rob Davis : Thanks Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. 2024 was another year of significant advancement across our company, and I\u2019m proud of the continued progress we\u2019re making in developing and delivering transformative medicines and vaccines to help save and improve lives around the world. We are impacting patients on a global scale. In fact, in 2024 we reached nearly half a billion people with our medicines and vaccines, including through donations. We remain focused on the pursuit of breakthrough science and innovation as the source of sustainable long-term value creation for patients and shareholders. We\u2019re continuing to execute on our strategic priorities. We\u2019re progressing our pipeline, launching important new products that have significant patient benefit and strong commercial potential, advancing key clinical programs in our robust early- and late-phase pipeline, and augmenting our pipeline through promising business development. Our business remains well positioned thanks to the dedication of our talented global team, and I\u2019m more confident than ever in our ability to advance patient care, fueling Merck\u2019s long-term growth potential. Now, turning to our results and outlook. We delivered strong growth in 2024, reflecting demand for our innovative portfolio, including for KEYTRUDA, which continues to benefit more patients with cancer globally, the successful launch of WINREVAIR and strong performance of our Animal Health business. We also saw higher demand and achieved strong sales for GARDASIL outside of China. As we closed out 2024 and entered 2025, the market dynamics for GARDASIL in China have remained challenging. Like many other companies, we\u2019ve seen increased pressure on discretionary consumer spending, including across the vaccine space more broadly, and demand for GARDASIL has not recovered to the level we had expected. As a result, overall channel inventory remains elevated at above normal levels. In light of this, and based on further discussions with our commercialization partner, Zhifei, over the past couple of weeks, in particular regarding their most recent financial disclosure and working capital levels, we\u2019ve made the decision to take a new approach and temporarily pause shipments to China beginning this month and through at least mid-year. We believe taking this action now will facilitate a more rapid reduction of inventory and help support the financial position of our important and valued partner. Importantly, we believe China still represents a significant long-term opportunity for GARDASIL given the large number of females, and now males with our recent approval, that are not yet immunized, and we remain both committed and well-positioned to maximize this potential for the long-term. Outside of China, demand for GARDASIL remains robust, and we expect strong growth this year and well into the future. Our overall business remains very healthy. In fact, irrespective of the performance of GARDASIL in China, we expect the Company to deliver strong growth in the second half of this year, as well as in both 2026 and 2027. Longer-term, our confidence in our ability to successfully navigate the KEYTRUDA LOE period is unchanged, which is based on the strength of our pipeline, the excitement we have for our ongoing and upcoming launches of innovative new products, and the commercial opportunity they represent. Next, I\u2019d like to turn to our research efforts. We\u2019re making remarkable progress across multiple therapeutic areas in our late-phase pipeline. In the fourth quarter, we announced FDA acceptance for our filing of clesrovimab, our long-acting monoclonal antibody to protect infants from RSV disease; and positive topline results from three programs, including for subcutaneous pembrolizumab; for islatravir in combination with doravirine in the treatment of HIV; and for WINREVAIR from the ZENITH trial. We also executed value-enhancing business development that is both science-led and portfolio informed. We licensed promising investigational assets including in oncology with a clinical-stage anti-PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody from LaNova, and in cardiometabolic, with an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist candidate from Hansoh. Merck is anchored today by a robust set of commercial products addressing important medical needs, and we\u2019re rapidly moving to a future with a much more diversified portfolio. We have amassed an expansive pipeline, with tremendous potential to further advance the practice of medicine around the world. You can expect a steady cadence of data readouts in the coming months and years leading to potential new launches as we seek to bring much needed innovation to patients. In fact, we have 20 potential new growth drivers, almost all of which have blockbuster opportunity. These include WINREVAIR and CAPVAXIVE, our adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccine which is now launching in the U.S., as well as many innovative assets currently in Phase 3 development. Over the past three years, we have nearly tripled the number of assets in late-phase development across a broad range of therapeutic areas and modalities. Based on the significant progress, we see over $50 billion of potential revenue opportunity from these programs. We are positioned for long-term leadership in oncology as we continue to diversify and deepen our pipeline. We are excited about cardiometabolic as a future area of growth, including with our oral PCSK9 inhibitor program where we have important Phase 3 readouts this year. In immunology, HIV and ophthalmology, we have opportunities to bring forward first-in-class and/or best-in-class, blockbuster medicines. Further, we expect to benefit from promising programs in our infectious disease and vaccines pipeline, strong growth in our Animal Health business, and many early-phase programs that will enter Phase 2 over the next few years. And we remain well positioned to pursue additional science-driven value-creating business development. In summary, I have increased confidence in our long-term future. While the rapid change in the Chinese market for GARDASIL has caused a short-term headwind for our company, our overall business is healthy and growing. We remain strongly positioned to successfully navigate the KEYTRUDA LOE period, as we continue to deliver on our purpose of saving and improving lives. I want to again recognize the commitment and efforts of our global teams. Together, we remain focused on delivering and sustaining value for patients, shareholders and for all of our stakeholders today and well into the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Caroline. Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we had another year of strong growth, reflecting continued robust demand for our innovative portfolio and demonstrating the importance of our products to the patients we serve. Growth was driven by oncology, Animal Health and new product launches, which more than offset the GARDASIL headwinds in China. These results demonstrate the strength of our business and give us confidence in our outlook. Our commercial and operational execution enables us to deliver value in the short term, while we invest in new innovations and deliver our pipeline for the long-term. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $15.6 billion, an increase of 7%, or 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its momentum with sales increasing 8%, driven primarily by Oncology. Our Animal Health business also delivered strong performance, with sales growth of 13%. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.8 billion, driven by continued robust global demand from metastatic indications and increased uptake from earlier-stage cancers. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types. In metastatic disease, we saw increased uptake for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev in first-line, locally advanced urothelial cancer, supported by the strong results from KEYNOTE-A39, as well as KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer, based on the compelling data from KEYNOTE-868. In the earlier-stage setting, growth was driven by increased use in resectable non-small cell lung cancer as well as triple negative breast cancer. Outside the U.S., growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer, as well as continued demand in metastatic disease. Inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Our broader oncology portfolio achieved strong growth including WELIREG with sales more than doubling to $160 million driven by increased uptake in certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma in the U.S. In vaccines, GARDASIL sales were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 18%, due to lower demand in China. In the U.S., sales benefitted from price and demand, partially offset by CDC purchasing patterns. Outside the U.S. and China, double digit sales growth was driven by higher overall demand, including the catch-up cohort in Japan. In pneumococcal, CAPVAXIVE sales were $50 million, driven by demand from the retail pharmacy channel. We have made great progress in achieving the commercial milestones necessary to ensure a successful launch and are well positioned to help protect adults from invasive pneumococcal disease. VAXNEUVANCE sales decreased 9%, as growth from launches in international markets was more than offset by competitive pressures in the U.S. In Cardiovascular, we are seeing steady growth from the ongoing launch of WINREVAIR, which contributed $200 million of sales, predominantly in the U.S., where we saw some impact to prescription volumes due to the holiday season. Approximately 1,500 new patients in the U.S. received a prescription, bringing the total number of new patients prescribed to approximately 5,200 since launch. Access remains strong, and our experience continues to indicate that approximately 80% of those patients who receive a prescription will receive commercial product. Notably, we continue to see the vast majority of patients remain on treatment. The breadth of physicians and depth at which they prescribe continues to grow. We are also seeing an increase in the percentage of prescriptions for patients not on prostacyclin background therapy. Outside the U.S., initial launches are progressing well. In summary, we remain confident in our growth expectations for WINREVAIR, as we look forward to positively impacting more patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our Animal Health business delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales increasing 13%. Livestock growth reflects higher demand for poultry, sales from the recently acquired aqua portfolio from Elanco, and price. Companion animal sales growth reflects price. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 80.8%, an increase of 3.6 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL, as well as favorable product mix. Operating expenses decreased to $7.4 billion. Charges of $700 million related to the license agreements with LaNova and Hansoh Pharma this quarter were lower than the charge of $5.5 billion a year ago related to the collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 10%, reflecting strategic investments in support of our robust early- and late-phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other expense was $5 million. Our tax rate was 16.2%. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.72. Now turning to our 2025 non-GAAP guidance. We expect revenue to be between $64.1 and $65.6 billion, representing growth of 2% to 4%, excluding a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. For GARDASIL in China, our guidance assumes no further shipments at the low-end and less than $1 billion at the high-end. Excluding sales of GARDASIL in China in both 2024 and 2025, and the negative impact from foreign exchange, total company growth is expected to be 7% to 9%. Our gross margin assumption is approximately 82.5%. Operating expenses are assumed to be between $25.4 and $26.4 billion. This range includes a $300 million payment related to the license agreement with LaNova which will be recognized upon completion of the technology transfer for MK-2010. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other Expense is expected to be between $300 and $400 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 16.0% and 17.0%. We assume approximately 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $8.88 to $9.03. This range includes approximately $0.09 related to the expected payment to LaNova and a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 35 cents, using mid-January rates. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. In 2025, we are expecting to see the benefit of a more diverse commercial portfolio with continued strength in Oncology and Animal Health as well as contributions from new product launches. During the first half of the year, we expect roughly flat year-over-year revenues as the headwind in China is offset by high single digit growth across the rest of our business. During the second half, we expect strong year over year growth. Looking at GARDASIL longer-term, while we believe there continues to be a path to the $11 billion, we feel it is prudent to withdraw this target given the uncertain timing of an economic recovery in China. Our growth expectations outside of China for this important vaccine remain unchanged, and we are well-positioned to protect more lives and drive strong growth beyond 2025. For KEYTRUDA, U.S. sales benefitted from approximately $200 million of wholesaler inventory buy-in during the fourth quarter, which we expect to reverse in the first quarter. We expect Medicare Part D redesign to have a negative impact to sales of approximately $400 million, primarily affecting WINREVAIR and our portfolio of small molecule oncology products, including WELIREG, Lynparza, and Lenvima. At the beginning of 2025, we lowered the list prices of the JANUVIA family of products in the U.S. to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount Merck pays to Medicaid and as a result, we expect higher net sales for these products in 2025. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We will continue to make disciplined investments in our key growth drivers and expansive pipeline. We remain committed to our dividend, with the goal of continuing to increase it over time. Business development remains a priority and we are well positioned to pursue additional science-driven, value- enhancing transactions. We recently increased our authorization for share repurchases by $10 billion to $12 billion in total. Given the opportunities to invest in our business and augment our pipeline through business development, we expect to maintain a modest level of share repurchases this year. We remain committed to not having excess cash build on our balance sheet and the higher authorization provides flexibility to increase share repurchases, if appropriate. To conclude, we enter 2025 with confidence in the outlook for our business, driven by global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines, as well as our exceptional pipeline. Our long-standing commitment to leverage leading-edge science to improve the lives of patients has put us in a position of financial and operational strength. With investment in innovation and our ongoing focus on execution, we are well positioned to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean. Dr. Dean Li : Thank you, Caroline. Good morning. We are making progress in early and late phase programs across multiple therapeutic areas. Today, I will cover major updates since the last earnings call and provide a summary of highlights from 2024. Starting with cardiometabolic disease. The Phase 3 ZENITH trial evaluating WINREVAIR in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, who are at high risk, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of morbidity or mortality events compared to placebo, both on top of background PAH therapy. Based on the overwhelming efficacy the trial was stopped so that all participants have the option to receive WINREVAIR. Detailed results will be presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s ACC.25 conference in late March. Following a review of the totality of efficacy data from the WINREVAIR clinical program, including positive results from the ZENITH trial, the External Steering Committee and Merck unanimously concluded that the Phase 3 HYPERION study should stop early. We discussed this with the FDA and have notified study investigators. Based on the strong clinical benefit WINREVAIR demonstrated in the STELLAR and ZENITH trials, it was determined that the HYPERION study had lost clinical equipoise. The study will remain blinded and all participants will have the option to receive WINREVAIR as part of the open-label, long-term extension study, SOTERIA. We anticipate data will be available later this year and we will present at a future medical congress. This reinforces growing recognition that WINREVAIR, the first and only activin signaling inhibitor for the treatment of PAH, has the potential to change the practice of medicine and be transformational for patients with this progressive and debilitating disease. WINREVAIR has now been approved in more than 35 countries globally. Recently, we submitted an application for approval to regulatory authorities in Japan. More broadly in the cardiometabolic space, in December, we entered a licensing agreement with Hansoh Pharma for an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist, now known as MK-4082, which will be entering the clinic this year. With our extensive experience in incretin biology, we are well-positioned to advance oral small molecule GLP-1 agonist-containing combinations with next generation agents for weight loss, as well as those that target cardiometabolic disease. Next, infectious diseases. The FDA has set a target action date of June 10th for clesrovimab, our prophylactic long- acting monoclonal antibody for infants entering their first RSV season, when the risk of serious illness is greatest. If approved, clesrovimab would be the first and only single dose passive immunization for infants irrespective of weight with the potential to protect babies for the full RSV season. Turning to HIV. We announced topline results from the two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating the investigational, once- daily, oral combination of doravirine and islatravir in adults with HIV infection that is virologically suppressed on different antiretroviral therapy regimens. Detailed findings from these studies will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress, and we plan to submit the data as part of a package for regulatory approval. Islatravir, a potentially first in class Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Translocation Inhibitor, is also being evaluated in multiple late-phase clinical trials in combination with other antiretroviral therapies for the treatment of HIV. This includes ongoing Phase 3 trials in combination with Gilead\u2019s capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, as a once-weekly oral treatment option. We are also evaluating MK-8527, another investigational NRTTI candidate, as a potentially important once-monthly oral option for pre-exposure prophylaxis which we expect to advance to Phase 3 this year. Next to vaccines. The National Medical Products Administration of China approved GARDASIL to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers and diseases in males 9 to 26 years old. In November, at the International Papillomavirus Conference, we presented new clinical and real-world data for GARDASIL 9 that examined the prevalence of oral HPV infection, the burden of HPV-related head and neck cancers, as well as rates of HPV infection in females. This evidence reinforces the importance of gender-neutral HPV vaccination with GARDASIL in adults up to age 45. More recently, the American Cancer Society\u2019s annual report on cancer facts and trends noted an increase in cervical cancer diagnosis rates in females ages 30 to 44. There remains a need to protect more individuals from HPV-related cancers. In Europe, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency recommended the approval of CAPVAXIVE for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults. Moving to oncology. Our Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational subcutaneous fixed dose combination of pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa, in combination with chemotherapy, compared to intravenous KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy, met its dual primary pharmacokinetic parameter endpoints of noninferiority. If approved, this route of administration would be a meaningful option for patients. We plan to share detailed findings of the study at an upcoming scientific congress. Consistent with our growing, and increasingly diverse, pipeline of oncology candidates, more than twenty abstracts from studies evaluating treatment options for a range of hematologic malignancies were presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. This included early results from the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 study evaluating zilovertamab vedotin, an investigational antibody drug conjugate targeting ROR1, in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. On the regulatory front, in China, we received three approvals for KEYTRUDA-based regimens including a neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment regimen for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer based on KEYNOTE-671, the treatment of certain types of locally advanced cervical cancer based on KEYNOTE-A18, and first-line treatment of patients with urothelial carcinoma, in combination with Padcev based on KEYNOTE- A39. In addition, WELIREG was approved for the treatment of adult patients with VHL associated renal cell carcinoma based on LITESPARK-004. In Japan, The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved two KEYTRUDA-based regimens including the treatment of advanced cervical cancer based on KEYNOTE-A18 and for primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-868. In the U.S., the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to sac-TMT, our investigational TROP-2 directed antibody drug conjugate, for the treatment of certain patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Sac-TMT is being developed through a collaboration with Kelun-Biotech with ten ongoing Phase 3 studies across multiple solid tumors. Finally, in December, we completed an exclusive global license agreement with LaNova Medicines for a novel investigational PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody, now known as MK-2010. We plan to explore the full potential of MK-2010 across multiple tumor types in a global patient population. As Rob mentioned, 2024 was marked by significant pipeline progress. Greater than 20 Phase 3 studies were initiated spanning cardiometabolic, immunology, infectious diseases, oncology, ophthalmology and vaccines. We received more than 25 regulatory approvals in major regions, including for WINREVAIR and CAPVAXIVE. At the same time, we successfully executed on our one pipeline strategy, by leveraging our clinical expertise and business development capabilities to identify and secure external opportunities where science, medical need and value intersected to expand, complement and diversify the pipeline. Acquisitions of Harpoon and EyeBio as well as an asset from Curon added important new biologic candidates in oncology, ophthalmology and immunology, respectively. License agreements with Hansoh and LaNova secured rights to potentially important candidates for cardiometabolic disease and oncology. Notable milestones to look out for in 2025 include detailed results from the ZENITH trial from islatravir-based regimens in HIV and in oncology for subcutaneous pembrolizumab as well as KEYTRUDA in earlier-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are all scheduled to be presented at upcoming medical meetings. Results from three Phase 3 registration-enabling studies evaluating our oral PCSK9 inhibitor candidate enlicitide for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia are anticipated and the primary completion date of the Phase 2 CADENCE study, evaluating WINREVAIR in pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease is scheduled for the Fall. I look forward to providing further updates on our pipeline progress. And now, I will turn the call back to Peter. Peter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Shirley, we're now ready for questions. I'd request that analysts limit themselves to one question to get to many questioners as possible. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Umer Raffat : I realize that there's a lot of folks GARDASIL this morning, but allow me to focus on another growth driver, which tracked a slightly weaker versus consensus, WINREVAIR. And my question really is, as we think about the cadence of growth into '25, there's been some question marks off of some clinical data suggesting maybe the start of the year might have been slightly weaker versus some of the growth expectations. So, do you feel reasonably comfortable that WINREVAIR can grow about 100% year-over-year from the fourth quarter trends into end of '25? Rob Davis : Yes. Umer, thanks for the question. And this is Rob. I would just say, overall, our confidence in WINREVAIR and the potential benefit for patients with PAH, and in turn, its importance for growth are unchanged. And as we look at what's happening in January, actually, we're seeing January returning to the levels we would have expected it to be. And so, as we look at 2025, we do actually see this as a strong growth contributor, and all of the fundamentals we see support that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Terence Flynn : Was just wondering if the change in outer-year GARDASIL sales impacts at all how you're thinking about either the size, the type or the cadence of your M&A and business development strategy here. Does this open the door to maybe larger deals now? Rob Davis : Yes. No, thanks for the question. As we look forward, and I think as we've been pretty consistent, the long-term expectations we had at the Company, especially as we get into the LOE period, were never counting on GARDASIL as a growth driver because we always had an expectation that eventually, it would start to plateau as we got through all of the cohorts. And really, we're back to just the birth cohort. So, as we look forward, our expectation for what the post-LOE period looks like is frankly unchanged from what I previously communicated. That said, as we've also communicated, while I feel increasingly confident about that period, we have always said we do believe we need to do more to continue to augment the pipeline we've built. And so, we will continue to do -- to drive business development and we're looking at business development in a full range, always with science being the leading question. But if we can see value and a tie in to our strategy where science intersects, we will be willing to move. And it will still be in that zero to $15 billion range is our sweet spot, but obviously, open to looking at deals. And as we've also said, we're open to commercialized assets as well, if they fit the overall profile I laid out of science and value. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Luisa Hector : Perhaps on the oral PCSK9, could you just add a bit more color around what you're targeting for cholesterol lower, whether we might need to see all three trials in-house before you issue a press release? And I think you mentioned before potential combinations. Obviously, you have now optionality on the oral GLP. So just perhaps some color around where you could go with further development. Dr. Dean Li : I'll take that. Thank you very much for the question. This is Dean. Yes, we have three Phase 3s that are ongoing that should be reading out April, July and August of 2025. I would imagine that there is a possibility that given a prominent conference at the end of the year that we would hope to be able to present publicly that data. In relationship to what we're trying to achieve with oral PCSK9, I would just look at what the antibodies can do and just say, we want to achieve a very similar profile of the PCSK9 antibodies in an oral molecule because we believe that there is a great unmet need. 70% of people on STEMS are not at goal. So, we think that this will be an important set of data. And if it reads out positive, we're eager to get this out to the general population just in the United States, but throughout the globe. In terms of combinations, there are a number of combinations that one could do. And I like how you put it because it ends up being something that's really important as a singular drug, but it also is a platform to add other important cardiometabolic assets onto it or compounds that could give even greater cardiovascular outcomes. And so, we will probably be providing that data a little bit later after we've cleared the Phase 3s for the oral PCSK9 inhibitor, enlicitide. Operator : Thank you. This question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Mohit Bansal : Sorry, I joined a little bit late, but if the question -- have you commented on how much inventory Zhifei had at this point with GARDASIL? And would the decision to stop shipment, possible shipments for first half, would take care of the inventory? I'm just trying to get -- understand the demand situation in China as well. Rob Davis : Yes. Mohit, thanks for the question. We have not commented specifically on how much inventory Zhifei is sitting on. They're a public company, so we need to leave it to them to make comments about that. But I think the important point here is to understand that as we've seen the marketplace, what we intend to is to accelerate that drawdown. So, we are planning to ship and by -- frankly, by not shipping February potentially through the midyear and essentially longer, depending on how we see the inventory come down, we're going to allow the underlying demand that is still there to absorb the Zhifei inventory and improve Zhifei's financial position and working capital. We think if we can put the inventory situation behind us, we can get to a more normal market dynamic, one where with the underlying demand and the fact you have the male indication coming, it can come back to growth. So, the speed with which we burn that down, we'll have to see. But the other thing I would just highlight for context, with this rebasing, GARDASIL China now is about 1% of our total earnings. So, it is becoming -- of our total revenue. So obviously, that's an important thing to understand. And that's why we also highlighted that if you look at the way the business is going to progress, as we get into the back half of this year and we anniversary the GARDASIL China situation. We will be strong growth and for overall Merck as well as, as we go into '26 and '27. And that's important because, obviously, at that point, anything that happens in China with GARDASIL is an upside. And that's really why we've decided to now rebase this, understanding it's a change from the direction we had taken previously. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Daina Graybosch with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Daina Graybosch : I want to ask another one on WINREVAIR and the HYPERION trial. Can you help us understand what outcomes you may be able to provide from that trial given the enrollment and follow-up? Is it possible to hit on the primary? Or any of the trends that you think would support use in these less severe patients, where I think physicians are more worried about the risk of the toxicity? Dr. Dean Li : Thanks for that question. So, if I could just take a step up and then address your HYPERION question directly. So, the aspiration of WINREVAIR was that it would be a first-in-class mechanism action of an active-in-signaling inhibitor, and the molecular design was to address the fundamental human genetic basis. And what we're trying to do is build the evidentiary wall of data that this novel mechanism can change the practice of medicine. So, for STELLAR, that's already got an FDA and a global approval. And it's clear that it increases exercise capacity, increases functional class and decreases risk of clinical worsening. ZENITH is very important because it is, I believe, the first PAH trial ever to be done on hard outcomes. And I also believe it's the first PAH trial ever stopped early for overwhelming efficacy. I think in 2025 ACC, people are going to steer at that data and looked at lung transplantation, hospitalization and death and look at that and also will also steer into how soon after treatment those benefits are observed. So, that leads me now to HYPERION, where HYPERION is actually in a very similar patient population as STELLAR. It's the earlier use of WINREVAIR in that patient population, and it was decided to stop early. It remains blinded, but the investigators basically, having looked at all of the data, really felt that it was not as to go-to treatment. So, we will have to see what that data is because it remains blinded. And hopefully, we will have that data and further updates. But again, the ZENITH updates will be in -- at ACC. There is continuing safety data from the readout of these Phase 3s and consequent rollover patients into SOTERIA. And the long-term safety experience that we've had is very -- is well within the label. And I'll just remind everyone, the label says 4% in the treated and 1% in placebo, so it's maybe a 3%. We're well within those margins. And so that data, as we get more and more information, will become more public this year as our investigators put together presentations and publications. So, our aspiration of changing the practice of medicine for PAH has growing support. I know no other active-in-signaling inhibitor in clinical development. And also, we're clearly exploring outside of PAH other forms of pulmonary hypertension. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citi. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Geoff Meacham : Sorry to continue to harp on GARDASIL. But just, I guess, given the situation in China, you guys are less willing to predict the timing of recovery. But I guess the question, Rob, is there an inventory threshold that you need to see to start shipping again? I wasn't sure what the -- what kind of the tipping point would be for that. And maybe more broadly, just given the political climate towards vaccines overall, maybe just talk about where this TA falls in your BD or internal R&D priorities, if that's changed at all? Rob Davis : Yes. Geoff, thanks for the comments. So, on China, in particular, there's not a -- I don't want to commit to a specific inventory level. Obviously, we need to see it come down meaningfully from where it is. And I think by taking this action, to stop shipments given the demand that's there, we're going to see that happen. We just have to let it work itself through. Because the economy there still is soft, and that has led to the fact that we are seeing consumer demand continue to be weak. And so, as that situation resolves, I think that will determine the speed with which all of this happens. But I think it's important to just reemphasize, going forward, by rebasing this now out, this is upside. This is not a core to our growth story going forward. And so that is also what we want to make sure people understand. I recognize it's a big change. And we want to do and we will do everything -- we are very committed and positioned well to drive growth in China. But to me, at this point, that will be upside for the Company. And beyond that, the breadth of what we have will drive the growth in oncology, in Animal Health and with our new launches. To the vaccines business more broadly, we continue to believe in vaccines as an important area. Obviously, we have CAPVAXIVE, which is launching as we speak. We have palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody for RSV, that we hope to get approval and see come before the RSV season this year. And then we have other programs in development, including dengue is probably one of the most significant other ones. So, we continue to focus there. I wouldn't say that vaccines is a big focus of our BD strategy primarily because we just haven't seen that many opportunities in the space. But we are continuing to be committed to driving the R&D we're doing in this space going forward and continue to believe there's opportunity for it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Chris Schott : Another one on GARDASIL. Specific to the long-term guidance, I totally understand the near-term dynamics need to reduce inventory, but the removal of the $11 billion target is -- how much of this is conservatism just given the dynamics of China versus this being a more permanent reset of your view on the Chinese market? I'm trying to get my hands around that. And then as part of that answer, maybe just talk about GARDASEL ex-China. Has there been any change in your longer-term views on the global opportunity ex China for the product? Rob Davis : Yes. No, thanks for the question, Chris. So, as you look at China, as Caroline said in the prepared remarks, we continue to believe there's a path to the $11 billion, but feel it's prudent really to withdraw the target right now because it is uncertain, both the timing of the recovery in China and the extent. That being said, if you look at the underlying dynamics that had always caused us to believe in the growth in China, they're still there. We still have the 100 million-plus women, 120 million women who have yet to be vaccinated in the Tier 1 to 5 cities. We have the male indication where we are the only company with that indication, and we're launching that as we speak. And obviously, that is a population about the same size as female. It's about 200 million if you look in the total potential once we're in that marketplace. So, the opportunity is there. We have the near-term dynamics of the inventory and the near-term dynamics of the economy we need to adjust. That is why I think it's prudent to just say until we see that, because China was a meaningful part of the $11 billion, that's why we made the decision to say, let's pull back on the $11 billion. As we look at every other market around the world, for the rest of the world, our view remains unchanged. And as Caroline pointed out, if you exclude GARDASIL China, we had strong double-digit growth this year, again, in the rest of the world. And as we look forward, if you exclude China, we have strong growth coming in GARDASIL every year, year-on-year. So, nothing has changed in our long-term view. We need to get the China situation figured out. We need to lap this market dynamic and figure out what the actual growth and opportunity is in China. And until we do that, I just want to remove this from the dialogue because by continuing to always come back to this, I feel like we missed so much else we have in the strength of our pipeline and in the growing breadth of our business. That is really the fundamentals of our growth long term, has been and will continue to be. And I want to get people focused there because that's where we're focused. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. You may ask your question. Tim Anderson : A couple of questions on KEYTRUDA. So, I don't think GARDASIL would have impacted the stock as much as it has over the last six months had it not been for these underlying concerns about KEYTRUDA going into the IRA in '28 going off patent at the end of '28. So, my first question is, when can we expect Merck will be in a position to talk about longer-term forward-looking guidance like a lot of other companies that address this period? At the moment, you're saying, you can successfully navigate period, there's no quantification. And I would argue that the latter is needed. And then a second question is near-term KEYTRUDA, investors worried about two competitor readouts in '25 that take on KEYTRUDA head-to-head. The first is Astro's AVINZA trial with TROP2. The second is the SUMMIT data with the PD-1 VEGF. It would be great to get any perspective from Dean on these two readouts. What's the realistic worst-case scenario? Rob Davis : Yes. Tim, thanks for the question. And as you pointed out, I recognize the focus is on what happened post the LOE. And we've tried to give direction. I think if you go back to what we said at JPMorgan, we were pretty clear in what we see. And that is if you look at the combination of the business development and the advances in our pipeline across oncology, and this is excluding anything to do with KEYTRUDA. So, these are small molecules, the individualized neoantigen therapy and our ADC portfolio, combined with ophthalmology, with what we see in HIV, with cardiometabolic as -- you can see the whole list there. We have $50 billion-plus of what we see as potential. So, that's why we continue to talk about a hill versus a cliff and that my confidence in that growth trajectory we showed is still there. We have not decided if and when we will give long-term guidance. That's always a two-edge sword, and I think we need to be thoughtful about that. But I also recognize as we move through time, we need to continue to give proof points like what we're seeing with CapEx, like what we're seeing with WINREVAIR and like what we are confident you're going to see as enlicitide and the data for that start to flow through and other products we have been coming down the pipe. Those proof points are what are going to bring confidence over time. But I hear you on the guidance, and we will reflect on that, but we do not have a plan right now to do that. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. This is Dean. I'll just answer in relationship to the Daiichi Sankyo TROP2-ADC that you referenced, we're very comfortable about our TROP2 program. As you might know in our Phase 3 clinical trials, we have 10 ongoing. And so, we're very eager to have those move forward and we're confident in them. In relationship to the VEGF PD-1 that you spoke about, I mean, I would just say combination PD-1 and VEGF independently have been extensively studied by us in combination with Eisai and by other companies as well. And there is a general sense that there are many examples of improved progression-free survival that don't have a pattern of consistently hitting translatability to OS. And I think important work by others suggest that maybe there's increased PFS for PD-1 or PD-L1 VEGF. And that needs to demonstrate OS. But the way that we look at that is that Merck is uniquely positioned to explore this and an advantaged company that could really figure out whether VEGF PD-1 is going to give you OS benefit. And if it does, we have the infrastructure based on 41 indications in 18 tumor types, nine in earlier stage and four with OS, to really rapidly bring this innovation should lead to OS to many patients and many cancers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Akash Tewari : Just kind of building on the last one, your team recently updated your new product guidance for oncology from $20 billion to $25 billion despite the recent failures we've seen from both TIGIT and LAG3. What are the ballpark components of that $25 billion figure, particularly for the TROP2 and the Daiichi ADCs? And Dean, where do you think your TROP2 strategy differs versus Astra with data? Are there any particular biomarker populations where you feel like Merck will win out for both first- and second-line lung? Rob Davis : Akash, thanks for the question. So, as you look at what makes up the $25 billion, to be clear, the IO-IO combinations were never part of that. So those were always supplemental to that. The $25 billion was made up of the antibody drug conjugate programs we have both from Kelun and from Daiichi Sankyo as well as a suite of small molecule deals we did, mostly in target and molecular approaches to cancer. This would be the -- if you will, the LSD1, the CYP11A1, all of those suites of programs we had, the INT, which is the individualized neoantigen therapy which is the partnership we have with Moderna. That made up the numbers. What changed that allowed us to increase our confidence is two things. One, we added the T cell engager from Harpoon, which we're very excited about, both as a stand-alone and potentially in combination as we look at small cell lung cancer. And most importantly, the TROP2 program we have is, we think, going to be even more successful than we originally thought as we continue to see the data read out there. So, we feel very good about that $25-plus billion number. And then separate from that, just to be -- it's important, we still are also very confident in our subcu KEYTRUDA, which as we pointed out at JPMorgan, we will be -- you'll see data readouts. It will be filed this year and hopefully, potentially even launched yet this year. So that is something we continue to also be very confident about. That is not in that $25-plus billion. So that's important. We will be much greater than that in oncology when you look at the totality of what we will have. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So, I'll just answer as quickly as I possibly can. One of the things I would just be a little bit cautious is when everyone speaks about TROP2 or HER2 ADC that all the molecules are the same. The molecules are quite different. We've already seen that with Catella and in HER2. And the same thing can be true when you look at ADC given the same sort of target. So, we're very confident of our Sac-TMT in the design. But also early on, one of the things that we've always said is it's important to hit the right target population. Chemo plus pembro has a broad impact. And every trial that we do, we ask ourselves what patient population would a Sac-TMT or any ADC will be distinguished from that baseline. In relationship to the other Daiichi Sankyo ones, patritumab, we're very interested in relationship to breast; the B7-H3, we're very interested in small cell lung cancer; CDH6, we're very interested in ovarian; and we're very interested in mixing and matching some of them with T cell engagers. I do just want to make a call-out just in relationship to the design of the Kelun as well as the Daiichi Sankyo, that's really, I think, important molecules that we think if we hit the right patient population and combine them with the right IO strategy, whether it be T cell engagers or PD-1s, that we will have differentiated profiles for patients. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Trung Huynh : I just wanted to ask on the tariff news we saw emerge over the weekend. So, can you perhaps talk about your manufacturing footprint from China, Mexico and Canada? And there were also some discussions on it from the administration on transfer pricing. So, your IP for KEYTRUDA is based out of Ireland. How much of an impact could that have on Merck, if transfer pricing is also targeted? Caroline Litchfield : Thank you for the question, Trung. Our company, like many other companies, has a manufacturing footprint that really enables global supply. We have very low levels of manufacturing happening in China, in Mexico and Canada. So, we'd expect a very immaterial impact from tariffs that were proposed over the weekend for those countries. We will continue to assess the situation based on the different tariffs that are being proposed by the U.S. government, but remain confident in our supply chain and our ability to supply our medicines and vaccines around the world. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Vamil Divan : Maybe just going back to WINREVAIR. Obviously, you have the positive news on the ZENITH and HYPERION. Just curious if it's changed in any way your expectations for Cadence. I think that's maybe underappreciated event later this year and other different indications. But just, I guess, Dean, curious if there's any readthrough we should be mean from the success you're having there. And then tied to that, if you can just comment if there's any inventory fluctuation. I think it's impacted the sales number the first couple of quarters. So just want to understand if it impacted WINREVAIR this past quarter. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So, I'll just take the WINREVAIR question in relationship to the different patient population. So, patients who have pulmonary hypertension can have pulmonary hypertension because they have PAH. And what I would say is my confidence of WINREVAIR as to potentially reshaping the standard of care in the treatment paradigm for PAH is very high, especially since this molecule is designed at the genetic cause of the disease. We are looking at broader implications of that because there are other ways that you can get pulmonary hypertension besides PAH, and we are very eager to see what it does in relationship to a heart failure population. And so, we'll have to see those results. The preclinical data that suggests that's an important experiment for us to do, and we're eager to push that forward, and we're excited to see the results. Caroline Litchfield : And in terms of inventory for WINREVAIR, we have not seen anything unusual. Inventory levels were normal as we exited the year. And in the quarter, we did include an adjustment for the value of the inventory in the channel given the Medicare Part D redesign. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Courtney Breen with Bernstein. You may ask your question. Courtney Breen : I just wanted to clarify two things. The first was just kind of coming back to GARDASIL, and I know there's been a lot of conversation around that. Can you please kind of provide specificity as to whether there's any risk of write-off as we think about the inventory that's sitting in the channel at Zhifei and the age of the inventory? And then the second question around Part D redesign. I know you just mentioned specifically about WINREVAIR and kind of the channels' dynamics there. But as you're thinking about 2025 and some of the guidance that peer companies are beginning to give, and we've seen different ranges and different interpretations, can you just give some context as to what you've baked in, in terms of volume relative to price as we think about the $400 million guidance? Caroline Litchfield : Thank you, Courtney. In terms of GARDASIL inventory, we are, as Rob said, forcing shipments to enable Zhifei to utilize that inventory in the market, and that's inventory that our partner owns. So, the risk for write-off of inventory from Merck is extremely low. In terms of Part D redesign, what you have are the two dynamics. The first is the price impact. And as noted in our prepared remarks, that predominantly impacts WINREVAIR as well as our oral oncology agents. That think will be partially offset with some volume benefit as patients stay on therapy. But the majority of the $400 million that we noted is really the pricing impact. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question. James Shin : Can you hear me? Caroline Litchfield : Yes. Peter Dannenbaum : Yes. James Shin : Sorry about that, just making sure, technical difficulties. Don't mean to belabor the GARDASIL topic, but there is an upcoming February 2025 ACIP meeting, and the agenda suggests there's some follow-up on last October's dosing questions. Can you level set us on the expectations from this February session? And relative to the long-term guide of GARDASIL, did the U.S. market play any role in that change the guidance or guidance being withdrawn? Rob Davis : Yes. Maybe I'll take the second part of the question, and Dean can take the first part. No, no change. So, as we said earlier, if you exclude China, our expectations for the rest of the world, which would include the U.S., are unchanged. So, there's no change in our long-term belief in GARDASIL from that regard. As it relates to the ACIP and the dosing question, we're going to have to wait and see where it is. We continue to believe that the strength of the clinical data supports the two- and three-dose regimen we have today. It's a very high bar, and I'll let Dean comment maybe on some from the FDA and our perspectives. But I think we need to see where it goes, but we continue to feel very strongly that the dosing is appropriate and do not necessarily see that as a risk in the U.S., but I'll let Dean comment. Dr. Dean Li : Yes. So, the way that I would look at it, ACIP is CDC. The label is FDA. Scheduling dose is the FDA. And I would just say that the dosing schedule of GARDASIL has been rigorously vetted by the FDA. And as you've seen, as we've gone from three doses and two doses, the evidentiary proof that is required by the FDA to change scheduling is high. I should also emphasize that we have been in discussions with the FDA in relationship to how do we create and reach a randomized controlled trial that could change schedules for GARDASIL/GARDASIL-9 in men and in women. And the FDA, as you might imagine, has a very high bar for that proof. Now, I would surmise that the remarkable history of efficacy and safety influences the FDA's high standards and rigorous standards for anyone to want to change the label. I can't speak to what will happen, but I might suspect, especially now, that the deep attention and expertise of the FDA on dosing and scheduling might be important to the CDC as they decide how -- decide on this question of creating a schedule that is outside of the label from the FDA. Peter Dannenbaum : Great. Thanks, Dean. Thanks, James. Rob, a couple of comments to close the call? Rob Davis : Yes. Well, thank you all for your time on the call. Just maybe to end the call, I just want to reinforce our confidence in the long term. I recognize the GARDA situation in China is a change. I think the right decision we're making now to put this behind us to resolve this inventory situation and move forward. But putting -- that's a short-term event, putting it in context of the long term of this company. As we said, we see strong growth in the second half of the year eating into 2026 into 2027. And importantly, as we look to the period beyond, the strength of the pipeline, the diversity of the pipeline, the progress of the pipeline is profound. And I really believe that once we fully understand all of that, and I recognize it's going to take proof points in time, you'll understand why we have the confidence we do in the long term. And we are committed to demonstrating that, and most importantly, to continue to advance that pipeline for the patients we serve. So, with that, I'll close the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",
