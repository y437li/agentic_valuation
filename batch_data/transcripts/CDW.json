    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Bridget, and I will be your conference operator for today's call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to CDW's 2014 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to remind you that today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect now. It is my pleasure to turn the call over to CDW's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Richards. Mr. Richards, you may begin your conference. Thomas Richards : Thanks, Bridget. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today and to report another quarter of record results. Joining me on the call today are Ann Ziegler, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Leahy, our General Counsel; and Sari Macrie, our Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results and key drivers, Ann will run through the financial highlights, and then we'll go right to your questions. But before we begin, Sari will provide a few important comments regarding what we will share with you today. Sari? Sari Macrie : Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Our first quarter earnings release was distributed this morning and is available on our website, along with supplemental slides that you can use to follow along with us during the call.  I'd like to remind you that certain comments made in this presentation are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the Form 8-K we furnished with the SEC today and in the company's other filings with the SEC. CDW assumes no obligation to update the information presented during this webcast.  Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find reconciliation charts in the slides for today's webcast as well as in our press release and the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today.  Please note that all references to growth rates or dollar amount increases in our remarks today are versus the comparable period in 2013. The number of selling days in the first quarter are the same for both 2013 and 2014, so there is no difference in growth rate for average daily sales and reported sales. A replay of this webcast will be posted to our Investor Relations website, investor.cdw.com, by this time tomorrow. I also want to remind you this conference call is a property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company.  So with that, I'll turn it back to Tom. Thomas Richards : Thanks, Sari. We started the year off strong with sales increases well above forecast for the U.S. IT market, and excellent profitability. Net sales were $2.65 billion, up 10%; adjusted EBITDA increased 8.5%; and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 43.7%. This quarter's results reflect 3 key drivers : our balanced portfolio of channels, our flexible business model, and focus on productivity and cost control.  The first driver of our results, our balanced portfolio of sales channels, contributed to a 7.2% increase in Corporate and a 14.5% increase in Public. Corporate performance was led by continued momentum in our largest customer channel, medium and large business, which increased 8%. Our small business channel, which is largely focused on customers with 20 to 100 employees, delivered its third consecutive quarter of improvement, up 3.3%. We are cautiously optimistic that we will see continued improvement in small business results as confidence in the economy builds.  Public results were powered by our Education channel, which delivered robust growth, up 38.5% for the quarter. K-12 performance accelerated off of last year's rapid growth, driven by continued success delivering digital curriculum and common core testing solutions. Higher Ed delivered strong results, up high-single digits. State and Local continued its success delivering Public safety solutions offsetting lower sales in our Federal channel, and overall Government performance was up 0.7%. While Federal budgets were approved last year, the allocations process continued into the quarter. We are encouraged by increased activity as funds are released, and procurement offices are processing orders especially in the civilian side of our business.  The environment in Healthcare continued to improve in the quarter, and our sales were up 8.8% driven by both client refresh and infrastructure. While it's too early to call a full recovery, we remain confident that Healthcare will be an important contributor to growth in 2014. Our other results, Canada and ATS, combined to deliver 9.8% growth. Canadian operations continued their momentum and grew nearly twice as fast in local currency. Just last month, we were ranked #1 on the 2013 Top 100 Solution Providers list from Computer Dealer News, one of Canada's leading news sources for IT service providers, a short 7 years after we entered the market. At that time we were ranked #29. And this -- where just 1 month of sales in Canada surpassed total 2007 annual sales. We believe we still have plenty of headroom in Canada with an estimated 4% market share. The second driver of our results was our agile business model. The business model underpinned by our market segmentation, including industry-specific verticals and our broad product portfolio backed by deep technical resources. These 2 elements work together to enable us to quickly identify and capture profitable growth opportunities, and most importantly, they enable us to make our customer priorities, CDW's priorities. These were customer priorities broad [indiscernible] across the entire suite, notebooks, laptops, tablets and desktops. Revenue mix for the quarter reflected this focus. On a net sales basis, hardware grew 13% and services increased 8%, while software declined 3%. Hardware sales were driven by client devices as both notebooks and mobile devices, including Chromebooks and desktops, increased well into the double digits. Clearly, a driver of this growth was the expiration of XP operating system support. But we also saw pent-up demand unleash as customers focused on replacing an aging installed base of client devices. Although 5 products captured the majority of our customers' mind share this quarter, nettop products with high-single digits and telephony grew in mid-teens. Enterprise storage was flat as exceptional growth in emerging technologies offset softness in more traditional storage. Servers were down year-over-year as they continue to be disproportionately impacted by Federal sales performance. Software performance was also driven by a disproportionate impact in Federal, where software sales declined at twice the rate of total Federal sales. Although net software revenues were down, gross profit from software increased reflecting higher contribution from sales that are booked jet [ph] like warranties [ph] , cloud and commission revenues. Our business model is underpinned by market segmentation, which drives focus, customer intimacy and knowledge. A great example of this is our continued success in providing common core curriculum solutions. Inside our education channel, we have 2 segments : K-12 and Higher Ed. Back in late 2012, our K-12 team identified the need for a comprehensive solution to meet common core curriculum testing requirements being adopted across the country. With more than 15 years in the Education market, we knew that school districts have no interest in being in the IT business. Their focus is on educating. So we developed a solution that includes network and wireless assessments to ensure adequate bandwidth, asset tagging and configuration to speed delivery, and training to equip users with the skills needed to master new tools. This solution has driven exceptional Education results now for 4 quarters. Common Core testing is set for the spring of 2015, and we remain dedicated to helping our customers get ready for this important initiative. For CDW, common core is much more than providing devices. I spoke before about how our Common Core solution is fueling excellent increases in the infrastructure necessary to use digital devices in schools, including networking. And that was the case once again this quarter. But our efforts to help facilitate Common Core compliance are also leading to other business. Let me share a recent example of a school district that is doing just that. A school district in Northern California with more than 10 schools and close to 10,000 students recently launched a project with us, that while it includes Common Core testing solutions, it also includes a complete data center overhaul. We just completed the data center, setting up racks and installing power storage, new service and migrating to new equipment. In addition to the data center, the project also calls for the installation of a new digital phone system, wireless network nodes and even new clock speaker systems in each school. This $4.8 million sale is a great example of the benefits we derive from deeper market segmentation.  As we have shared with you last quarter, we moved 2 of our incubator verticals -- financial services and legal services -- from our small business channel to our medium, large channel. For us, the key measure of success of incubation efforts is whether they deliver revenue growth at a faster pace than overall sales. This quarter, verticals inside of our MedLar channel grew at a substantially higher rate than the overall business.  To make customer priorities your priorities, you must have the products and solutions they need and the skill set to deploy them. And that's why the second element of our business model, our broad product portfolio backed by extensive technical resources, that helps us stay best-of-breed across the technology platform is so important. Being best-of-breed enables us to meet our customers' needs today while we lead the way as they adopt new technologies. This ability to help customers evolve as the market evolves is one of the fundamental reasons for our consistent performance for the past 30 years.  Just last quarter, we were named of VMware's Cloud Hybrid Partner of the Year, and growth in emerging technologies like Converged Infrastructure and our cloud portfolio far outpaced first quarter consolidated growth. All in all, we delivered excellent top line, driven by both our balanced portfolio, our sales channels and our agile business model. While the mix of business was skewed towards lower margin product -- excuse me, lower product margin flag [ph] devices, we maintained excellent profitability achieving first quarter records for gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income per share. And that leads me to the final driver of our performance for the quarter : Our focus on productivity and effectively managing our expenses while still investing in our future. As you have heard me say before, an essential element of our long-term success has been our ability to consistently deliver profitable growth. First quarter results provide an excellent example of the levers we have to help us deliver this goal. Sales compensation is one of our largest expense components. Because it modulates with gross profit both up and down, we have a highly variable cost structure. This quarter we experienced expense leverage since gross margin compressed. Operating profitability also reflected tight management of expenses, including advertising expenditures. While we continue to make strategic investments in building our brand and March Madness continues to be an excellent vehicle for us, we made a change to our advertising mix this quarter, which resulted in lower spend. This year, our campaign was once again built around Charles Barkley and the fictional company Gordon & Taylor company and included TV, radio and digital. But we dialed back TV and added a new social media component in partnership with Reddit. This mix was designed to deliver comparable results for less investment and based on our metrics, campaign impressions were equal to last year's, at lower cost. Delivering long-term sustainable profitable growth is part of a constant focus on the balance between expense management and investment. This quarter, we continued our investment in enhancing our capabilities to deliver a broad spectrum of IT solutions that includes cloud, mobility virtualization, collaboration, network and security. We added 56 customer-facing coworkers on target with the plan we shared with you last quarter that calls for us adding between 150 and 200 customer-facing coworkers during 2014. Today, coworkers who are primarily focused on helping our account managers deliver solutions, our service delivery coworkers, customers [ph] and field sellers represent more than 1/4 of our total workforce. We will continue to invest prudently to ensure deliver the solutions that our customers need and take advantage of the opportunity we see in the marketplace for a national provider with scale and highly technical resources. But just as we always do, we will monitor the marketplace and adjust our plan up or down as needed. [indiscernible] my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence in the power of our balanced portfolio, agile business model and focus on productivity and expense control. When combined with our ongoing investment in solutions, capabilities, we think we have a winning hand that helps us both capitalize on the current market condition and deliver profitable growth well into the future. With 5% market share in a highly fragmented market, we have plenty of runway. Let me leave you with a few comments on the remainder of the year. You'll recall that on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2014 U.S. IT market growth in the 3% to 4% range and our target to grow 200 to 300 basis points above that. Given recent market activity and our performance, we've updated our view and now expect a higher end for both ranges for the year. Of course, we will continue to refine our expectations as we move throughout the year. Now, let me turn it over to Ann, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann Ziegler : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our first quarter financial results reflect the benefit of our balance, our business model and our focus on productivity and expense management. They also reflect the progress we are making against our financial strategies to drive contact growth, delever our balance sheet and deliver double-digit earnings growth. Let me begin with our P&L. If you have access to the slide posted on line, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on Slide 7. Top line growth [indiscernible] net sales $2.65 billion, 10% higher than last year on both a reported and average daily sales basis as we had the same number of selling days in both the first quarter of 2013 and 2014. Average daily sales were $42.1 million. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales were down 0.3% [ph] versus Q4 2013, which is well above normal seasonality. Gross profit for the quarter increased 5.8% to 125 $50 million [ph] . As expected, we experienced gross margin compression for gross margin at 16%, down 70 basis points from last year's Q1. The decline was due to the impact of both fixed pricing pressure from both in lower margin's more transactional products, as well as advertising rollouts [ph] and the impact of inventory adjustment. In many cases, most of this pressure's at the SG&A level. Reported SG&A, including advertising expense, was $289.4 million, up just 2.7% over last year. This increase reflects sales commissions and other variable compensation costs consistent with our increased profits and cost associated with increased coworker count, as well as reduction in advertising expense of $1.8 million in the quarter or 5.9% compared to last year. We ended the quarter with 7,040 coworkers, up 76 coworkers since the end of 2013 and up 260 coworkers since the end of last year's first quarter. Annualized sales per coworker were $1.5 million, up 6.7% over Q1 2013. Our adjusted SG&A, including advertising was $232.6 million, up 3.5% over last year.  As you can see on the next slide, adjusted SG&A for the quarter excludes $3.3 million of noncash equity compensation, $2.2 million of historical retention cost and other expenses, including litigation of our costs related to our market [ph] statutory offering. It's easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our gross profit less adjusted SG&A expenses. We also adjust for $52 million of depreciation and amortization.  As you can see on Slide 9, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $193.7 million, up 8.5% which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.3%, down 10 basis points from last year. So all in all on the operating side, in our advertising expense and our variable cost structure, we are able to offset 60 basis points of the 70 basis points gross margin decline. Let's look at the rest of the P&L on Slide 10. Interest expense was 31% lower than last year at $50.1 million and included a reduction of $627,000 related to interest equalization from the redemption of our 12.535% senior subordinated notes this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 37% versus 36.4% Q1 of 2013. On a GAAP basis, we earned $50.9 million of net income. Our non-GAAP [indiscernible] better reflects our operating performance of $81.1 million in the quarter, up 44.1% over last year.  As you can see on Slide 11, non-GAAP net income reflects aftertax assets that followed [indiscernible] general profit. The ongoing amortization of intangibles from ongoing pricing transaction, any nonrecurring costs related to financing including debt extinguishment and interest equalization, ongoing noncash equity compensation and other onetime nonrecurring income or expenses, which for this quarter included expenses related to our market [ph] statutory offering. These adjustments are tax affected [ph] at a statutory rate of 39%. Our Q1 weighted average for the shares outstanding of 172.3 million delivered $0.47 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 43.7% over the prior year.  Let's turn to Slide 12 and look at our balance sheet, which had a number of changes since our last call, some that impacts current results and some that will positively impact results going forward. During the quarter we had 2 redemptions : The January 22 redemption of $33 million of our 12.535% senior sub notes and the February 21 redemption of an additional $20 million of these senior sub notes. We also had a March private repurchase of $25 million of our 8.5% senior notes due 2019. In addition, tomorrow we will close on the redemption of the last outstanding $42.5 million of our senior sub notes. This will result for our second quarter in a $2.2 million loss in extinguishment of debt and $0.5 million redemption in our interest expense related to the impact of interest equalization. I am pleased to say that with this final redemption, there will no longer have to share [ph] any impact on interest equalization.  On Slide 13, you can see that on March 31, we had $307 million of cash and cash equivalents, including monies pending for tomorrow's redemption. We assessed [ph] $3 billion in net debt for the first time since we went private, finishing the quarter with $2.87 billion of that debt, $197 million less than our December 31, 2013, balance. Our cash revolver availability was $956 million, net debt [indiscernible] EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 3.5x, 0.3x less than 2013. Pro forma [indiscernible] redemption on weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt, 5.9%. In this potentially increasing interest rate environment, I'd like to remind you that our $1.53 billion term loan facility is subject to a 1% LIBOR floor, and we have in place $1.5 billion fiscal amount of interest rate cap at a weighted average rate of 2.4%, which expires in Q1 of 2015. The remainder of our outstanding debt fixed rate, so 88% of our outstanding debt is effectively fixed or hedged, and rates up [ph] significantly before they had a material impact on our interest cost. Free cash flow this quarter between tax rate [ph] operating cash flow plus the net change in our foreign agreement less capital expenditure was $231 million compared to $203 million in Q1 of 2013. Cash taxes for the quarter were $9.5 million, and cash interest was $16 million. Our ability to drive expense in this business is tied to our working capital management. We continue to deliver strong working capital metrics, and the details by component are provided on Slide 14. Using a rolling 3-month calculation, our cash conversion cycle was 22 days for the quarter, flat to last year's first quarter. We expect to continue to maintain our cash conversion cycle within our target range for the remainder of the year.  Turning to the rest of 2014, as Tom mentioned for our top line, we currently expect to grow at the higher end of our target of 200 to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market. We also continue to target pre-teen medium-term financial measures you see on Slide 15. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-7% range, mid-teens non-GAAP earnings growth per share, which we expect to exceed again this year, likely hitting high teens and delevering 1/3 to 1/2 per year until we hit our target leverage of 3x. Keep in mind that we view the medium term as the next 2 years and hold ourselves accountable for delivering these targets on an annual basis not quarterly.  Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those of you modeling our 2014 financials. As can see on Slide 16, the realignment of our financial services and legal verticals at the beginning of the year resulted in a shift of approximately $150 million of revenues inside of our Corporate segment from small business into MedLar. For the first quarter of 2013, the impact was $34 million. When modeling our free cash flow in 2014, keep in mind that 2013 free cash flow reflected the benefit of lower cash taxes, primarily due to divestments associated with our IPO and any refinancing-related expenses. Also keep in mind that our free cash flow tends to be very front-end loaded. We expect our cash interest to be approximately $180 million for the remainder of 2014, and our book issue for the remainder of the year to be in the $145 million rate. Remember that our tax interest expense is lumpy through the year as interest payments on our 8% and 8.5% notes are paid on April 15 and October 15.  For the full year 2014, we continue to expect a cash tax rate 39% to be up high [ph] pretax income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $40 million per quarter. In addition, we will pay $21 million to $22 million of taxes related to the cancelation of debt we incurred in 2009. Timing will impact cash growth here as well as we pay our first quarterly estimated tax payment in Q2 and then move to more normalized cash tax payment in Q3 and Q4. We continue to expect our 2014 effective tax rate to be higher than last year, in the 37% to 38% range. To keep this increase in our effective tax rate fine if you model our business quarterly as the phasing of our taxes this year will impact our year-over-year GAAP growth rate. Given the overlap to the 27.5% tax rate we had in Q4 of 2013, we'd expect 2014 non-GAAP net income growth to be significantly stronger in the first 3 quarters of the year than in Q4.  One final note, returning cash to shareholders is an important component of our commitment to build shareholder value. And I am delighted to report that our Board of Directors declared our third quarterly cash dividend since our return to the public market. We will pay a dividend of 0.0425 per share on June 10 to shareholders of record on May 27. We intend to revisit our dividend policy annually. And once we achieve our current target leverage ratio of 3x, we will look at our overall strategy to return cash to shareholders, which depending on tax policy and other factors at that time, could include share repurchases.  This concludes the financial summary. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please provide the instructions on how to ask questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Bill Shope : So you were able to nicely counter some of  the gross margin pressure with OpEx discipline. But how should we think about the mix and margin dynamic as we head into the second quarter and the remainder of the year? Can you give us a bit more color on that? Is it more of the same, or should we assume gross margins begin to normalize somewhat? Thomas Richards : I think, Bill, as a starting point, a lot of it's going to depend on how long the client refresh continues. I mean, as you heard Ann talk about, that was one of the drivers when you have that kind of, just growth in the marketplace. We -- people ask me what inning are we in, how long is it going to last? And we do expect to continue not necessarily though as intense as it was in the first quarter to the remaining part of the year. And as it goes back to a more normal distribution, we would expect to see gross profit to follow then. Bill Shope : And then looking at the -- I guess the flip side of that would be thinking about the revenue growth side of the equation. Obviously, you've boosted the outlook for the year. But if we dig down into the strength and the growth this particular quarter, the Education segment was obviously the key source of upside. How are you thinking about the sustainability of the underlying drivers in that particular segment as we model out the rest of the year? Thomas Richards : Well, as we've said, Education is the gift that continues to perform, so to speak. And while we would expect it to continue to grow -- obviously though, it's not going to grow at that rate because we start to lap some pretty amazing performance last year. But with the date still off into the 2015 timeframe, we still have school districts that are in the mode of getting ready. So we do expect it to continue, but I think it would be a little unrealistic to continue at 38%. I would love it, but I think the realist in me says that probably won't happen. Operator : Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Benjamin Reitzes : Wanted to talk about PCs and the sustainability of that given the XP situation. Does that continue throughout the year? It seems like it would based on your guidance now raised for IT spend in your own revenue growth. And outside of Education, what gives you and PCs, what also gives you confidence in that forecast? Because you just answered the Education question. So maybe if we could talk about other areas, maybe servers, storage, anything that also helps drive that higher-than-expected outlook that you just gave for revenues? Thomas Richards : All right, Ben, so a couple of things. One is let's take the PC part first. We do expect there continue to be uplift from the refresh and the expiration of XP. I think the reality that it was going to happen hit people. I think there are people in the marketplace who wondered whether it would happen. And so as we still have customers that are in the process of refreshing their client devices. As I alluded to with Bill's question, I don't know that it will keep the same intensity that it had that first quarter, but I do believe it will continue to be a growth driver for the remainder of the year. And if you look at it, it wasn't just in Education where we had strong PC growth. I mean it really was across the spectrum -- it was gonna [ph] get that, this notion of the balance and having multiple channels. We saw strong growth in our Corporate segment, we saw strong growth in our Public segment with the exception of Federal. So we think that it's going to continue from a growth perspective. As far as other -- then you kind of dipped into what other categories. As you saw in the quarter, we continue to see strong growth in network, which I think kind of fits as people are upgrading their client devices and expanding, you're going to drive traffic, and traffic is going to drive upgrades for networking. We would expect that to continue. And in some of the other -- I think you asked about the servers or storage. We see some interesting dynamics going on in storage. You heard me say that, on the whole, it was flat. But we see this really incredible transition happening where the growth rate of the newer resource [ph] technology is tracking at an exponential rate as people transition to some of the new storage capabilities. I don't know if I got it all because there was a lot in that question... Benjamin Reitzes : That was great, and my apologies. My follow-up is simply on pricing. Ann mentioned there was some pricing dynamics that impact gross margin. What's going on in pricing? And what's embedded in your guidance for how pricing plays out as we go throughout the year? That's it. Ann Ziegler : We've been clear for several quarters that there continues to be pricing pressure in more transactional products, and that continues. And you see the impact of both the mix shift to transactional products and the continued pricing pressure. We don't expect to see that newly rate [ph] in the short term. That end of the IT market has always been subject to pricing pressure. And part of our strategy with a balanced portfolio is to make sure that we continue to invest in the higher margin solutions business to attempt to offset that from a total portfolio basis. Operator : And our next question is from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Brian Alexander : Tom, it sounds like you're a little bit more confident on the overall IT market this year as you referenced 4% growth in your prepared comments. And it was 3% to 4% previously. Is that primarily because the first quarter came in better than you expected, and you're basically flowing that through the year, or do you actually think the balance of the year will be better than you previously thought? Thomas Richards : I think it's more of the former than the latter, Brian. When you come out of a quarter like this, it has an impact on what you think the annual's going to be. And I don't think this is -- I don't think it was just a first quarter phenomenon. As I alluded to earlier, I think you're going to have carryover in people doing the upgrade in the process. So I think that is really the main driver. We are seeing, as you heard my comments, increased confidence in Small Business, which we always kind of look at as kind of an insight as to how people are feeling about the economy. And I think the last comment I'd make was when I talk to myself executives about what was driving the client refresh? The easy answer is to go right to XP, but they will quickly tell you that some of this is customers having a little more confidence in the general economy, and therefore, taking advantage of a refresh opportunity. Brian Alexander : Okay, and then just on the data center part of your business, servers down, storage flat. To what extent did you see things slow down at the end of the quarter, and perhaps, pick up in April? There's been some discussion from distributors and other solution providers that things really did slow down at the end of March, but they've recovered thus far in Q2. So I'm just curious if you've seen a similar pattern? Thomas Richards : We've been pretty constant. I mean if you look at our performance, we didn't see kind of a peak and valley, if you want to put it that way, or valley and peak would be maybe a better way to say it. It's been pretty constant. And the interesting thing for us, Brian, I think is a big differentiator is -- and then it comes back to the balance issue. We saw pretty different performance across data center technologies in the different segments. We -- even though our server revenues were down, we saw 3 or 4 segments that had really strong server growth. And when you go to storage, I think it was actually 4 or 5 segments. So it really seems to be, for us, very segment-driven relative to where people are, what are they focused on. And the last thing I would tell you is I think in our Small Business, it's as much a mind share issue as anything else. It's how many different IT projects can a Small Business person manage at one time? And if the client issue is staring them in the face because of the expiration of XP, they're going to deal with that first. And so I think that will dominate some of the mind share for a while in this modern market. Operator : And our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just want to ask about seasonality and the advertising spend there? I heard some of the comments there, but how should that play out through the balance of the year? Ann Ziegler : We look at adjusted SG&A in total as we look at the balance of the year. And we would expect our adjusted SG&A to grow more in line with sales as we move through the remaining 3 quarters than you saw in the first quarter. Tien- Tsin Huang : Let me just ask one more on the balance sheet. Obviously, you've been seeing a lot of value in the senior notes, that makes sense. Will you take a pause here in the short term with debt retirement given the note redemption and the cash interest and tax payments that you -- and the dividend that you talked about? Ann Ziegler : Actually, the next time we have any debt that's callable is our 8% note. And those do not become callable until December. And then the 8.5% notes become callable in April. And there was an opportunistic opportunity to purchase a little bit of the 8.5% notes, and we did that. But absent some other opportunistic buy, we would expect that again, calling notes when they become callable in December and then in April. Operator : And our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matthew Sheerin : A question on Small Business. You talked about relative growth there and above-market trends. But are you starting to see customers begin to migrate to the Public cloud strategy? And how are you working with customers through that transition, and how does that affect your model going forward in terms of services both -- versus hardware? Thomas Richards : Well, we have seen the work we've done with Small Business on cloud. That's been happening for multiple quarters now. So it's not a new phenomenon for us. We've -- our cloud portfolio has had really exponential growth rate. Now, it's still relatively Small Business, but the growth rates are just amazing, which suggest that  we're doing a pretty effective job of helping them sort through what different options they have. And then we've got such a broad portfolio of cloud-based solutions, both in the SaaS and IAS and its services and even in our aggregation services, that it gives the customer the ability to pick and choose how they want to construct a cloud-based solution. And I think part of the reason that as you've seen the growth rates improve in Small Business, one of the reasons that the margin has held up really well is because a lot of what Jill and her team have been selling to the Small Business customers, are cloud-based solutions, which as you know, are 100% margin business for us in a lot of cases. So we continue to feel really good about our ability to help customers navigate through that. Matthew Sheerin : Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then on Federal, you mentioned a more stable demand and pipeline. But do you have confidence that you will see a recovery in that market at all this year, and do you see any growth coming there? Thomas Richards : Well I think what I said was we're seeing the funds flow now and the allocation process and procurement offices starting to put out contracts. And we did see some pickup in activity in civilian. I do think it's still going to be a multiple quarter process until we see Federal Government begin to be kind of back on an upward trend. We are encouraged by activities because in the Federal market, until you see contracts being let, until you see dollars being specifically allocated to a project, the sales process can't kind of -- the flywheel doesn't fly, so to speak. And we are seeing that now. If you said to me, I would expect -- if you look at the Federal sales process, normally, it's very back-end loaded. It's heavy in the third and fourth quarters. And I would say if we're going to see a recovery, that's when we'll see it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Jayson Noland : Tom, just a clarification question on storage. Your ability to offset weakness in the traditional storage market with emerging technologies, is that basically a function of your early engagement with companies like Nimble and youpanics [ph] , or is there something else there? Thomas Richards : The answer is yes. And also some of the Converged Infrastructure project that we've been working with the more traditional vendors, but you're on the right track. Jayson Noland : Do you see that more as a secular shift than something that's product-cycle driven? Thomas Richards : It feels product-cycle driven. I mean I think everybody is -- everybody -- a lot of the OEMs are moving to develop those kinds of solutions. And so I think if you look at our customers, this is kind of the second iteration, as I would describe it of efficiency. The first was we did virtualization. We virtualized storage, we virtualized servers. And customers then created incremental capacity by doing that. And now, as they get to the next phase, they're looking at these more efficient storage capabilities to, again, create greater capacity at less cost. So I think it's just the nature of the technology beast, so to speak. Jayson Noland : Okay, and then a follow-up question on that Healthcare vertical. Good quarter, you've got easy year-on-year compares the next couple of quarters. Do you see better visibility in that vertical specifically? Thomas Richards : Well it's getting better. They're a little bit covered with some of the Federal budget issues when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. But I was encouraged, quite honestly, in addition to the client refresh to see the networking business grow, because I think that's an indication of people making, what I'll call, investments they're driving themselves versus responding to maybe on expiration of XP. And I think that's a good sign. But again, it's just a couple of quarters here so we're going to remain cautiously optimistic on Healthcare, but do view it as a growth driver this year. Operator : And our next question is from Jerry Lou with Morgan Stanley. Jerry Lou : Calling in for Katy here. Just wanted to ask about Chromebooks. It's obviously been really strong in recent quarters. But even including accessories and other services you provide, does that -- do those products put extra pressure on margins versus traditional notebooks and desktops? Thomas Richards : Well, I think they do if you just sell them in isolation. And one of the things that I think has been great about our Education result is it was part of a broader solution. And I think as I've alluded to, as you deploy the Chromebooks, it drives and pressures things like your network. It drives the need for increased security. It drives the need for network management and all of those kinds of things, Jerry, bring higher margins with them. Jerry Lou : Got it. And the same question on just the CapEx this quarter. I think it was -- the $30 million was maybe doubled recent quarters. What drove that? Does it have to do with any data center or cloud buildout, and do you expect the expense to continue at this level? Ann Ziegler : Yes, our CapEx was in line with our normal spending in the quarter. I think you may be picking up a investing cash flow relating to a charitable contribution that was triggered that tied back to the original LBO. And the cash flow for that contribution went out this quarter, and that was picked up in financing cash flow, but CapEx was normal in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. Mr. Richards, please proceed with any further comments. Thomas Richards : Okay. Once again, really, really proud of the team's performance this quarter. Again, on our ability to kind of help our customers with what's important to them at any given time in their IT life cycle. And as I always say, if any of you need help with your IT inside of your companies, CDW is absolutely the person you ought to be calling. And let me leave with this, for all of you mothers out there, Happy Mom's Day. All right. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Tom Richards : Thanks, Sari. As I mentioned earlier, second quarter results were strong and I am pleased to report that we reached all time records for three key financial metrics. Net sales rose 11.8% to $3.1 billion, delivering the first $3 billion plus quarter in our 30-year history. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.3% to an all time high of $247 million and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 45.6% to $0.67. These results reflect the combined power of our diverse customer channels, the benefit of our full suite of offerings that address customer priorities across the IT landscape, and ongoing success in executing our three part strategy. Our nearly 4% increase in sales was driven growth across all of our customer channels, ranging from a low of 6% to a high of 25%. On a segment basis, corporate was up 7.7% and public was up 17.5%. In corporate, our medium and large business increased nearly 7% and small business was up 14%. Public segment growth was once again led by education which delivered excellent performance with sales up 25%. Education results reflected both continued exceptional performance in K-12 and low double-digit growth in higher Ed. Government sales increased 5.9% as federal sales returned to low single-digit growth and state and local continued to deliver low double-digit growth and healthcare was up nearly 18%. Our other net revenues which represents our advanced technology services and Canadian operations increased 11.9%. Advanced technology services delivered high single digit growth. Canadian sales were up in the low-teens in U.S. dollars and nearly twice that rate in local currency. As anticipated, customer priorities in the quarter remained squarely focused on client devices. Notebooks, laptops, tablets and desktops. Once again driven by continued strong demand for Chromebook and K-12 and PC refresh as customer address the expiration of XP support as well as the need to replace a fairly old installed base of client devices. Our full suite of offerings which includes transactional products, solutions and services, enabled us to quickly and effectively meet strong PC demand which we experienced across our entire portfolio of customer channels. Revenue mix for the quarter reflected this demand. On a net sales basis, hardware grew 13.7%, software grew 4.2% and services grew 12.7%. Hardware growth was driven by client devices with notebook and mobile devices including Chromebook and desktops growing well into the double-digits. While client devices continued to dominate customers' mindshare, there were a few other areas that posted double-digit growth this quarter including wireless networks, network security, managed services, and enterprise storage declined by low single-digits this quarter as continued strong growth in emerging technologies was not quite enough to offset weakness in more traditional storage. Servers were down year-over-year, although less than last quarter. Software performance was solid across all our categories with the exception of storage, as this tends to be driven by hardware sales. Virtualization, security and database software, all increased double-digit. Once again, software gross profit margin expanded reflecting higher contribution from sales that are booked net, like software assurance and software as a service. Services growth was driven by increased warranties and configurations for both client device refresh and Chromebook solution sales as well as cloud services like aggregation. While our mix of business was influenced by lower product margin client devices, we maintained excellent operating profitability. The variable nature of our cost structure combined with our ongoing focus on cost control enabled us to convert our 11.8% net sales growth into adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.3%. Our ability to deliver sustained, profitable growth is underpinned by the success we have had in executing our three part strategy. Which is to first capture market share from existing and new customers, second expand our solutions suite, third, build our service capabilities. Our go to market strategy is a key driver of our ability to increase share of wallet and acquire new customers. And you see the benefit of our vertical go to market strategy in this quarter's results where education and healthcare grew substantially faster than our overall 4% growth. By focusing resources on a specific vertical, we develop deep industry knowledge. Knowledge that enables us to develop custom solutions, like our solution for the common core curriculum challenge in K-12 or our mobile card technology solution for healthcare. Building the expertise and reputation required to deliver these solutions takes years and resources. For example, we just moved financial services into MedLar as a standalone sales organization. Over the past few decades, we have helped more than 15,000 banks, credit unions, capital markets and specialty financial service companies assess and align their IT infrastructures with growth strategies, manage regulatory compliance and reduce cost. Over that time we have build deep industry knowledge around the technology needs of financial services companies. When you combine this industry expertise with all of our competitive advantages and advantages that include our scale, our scope, meaningful relationships with our partners, you can see why we are able to drive growth substantially faster than the rest of the market. Let me share an example of how this combination helped us win a capital market customer. Our scale enables us to allocated resources at a fairly granular level. And we have done that inside of our financial service vertical where we have further segmented into three teams. Capital markets, banks and credit unions. Our capital markets firm that provides trading services to multi-asset clients is highly dependent on technology to meet their clients' needs for both speed and reliability. Certainly an excellent prospect for CDW given our experience low latency trading solutions. Technology is the company's competitive advantage and understanding the roadmap of their major vendors is critical to their ongoing success. But the local VAR they were working with couldn\u2019t get the right people on the phone when they needed help. That\u2019s where our competitive advantage came in. Given our significant relationship with their major technology provider. Remember we have more than 15 partners with whom we do more than $100 million on an annual basis. We were able to set up face to face meetings between our customer's CTO and our partners head of industry standards within a week of our first meeting. The value of our industry specific expertise and access we provided was immeasurable. Today this company is not only a great customer taking advantage of IT solutions designed specifically low latency trading, but a major source of new business as they refer their small and medium sized capital markets customers to CDW. In addition to vertical alignment, geographic alignment is also a key part of our go to market strategy to help us gain share. You can see the impact of that in small businesses' 14% increase this quarter. Late last year we completed a new geographic alignment mapping small business sellers to our MedLar regions. Now in addition to the knowledge they bring to the market around unique issues facing small business, sellers and technical specialists can work more effectively with our partners who tend to be aligned with us by geography and drive more local events for customers which are a very cost effective way for us to help small business customer get up to speed on new technology. Of course, the great go to market strategy isn't worth anything if you don\u2019t have the products and services your customers need. And that is where our second and third strategies come in. Our second strategy is to continuously expand our solutions capabilities. Clearly our success in meeting customer needs for client devices was a primary driver of our results this quarter. But we did see continued excellent growth in cloud offerings albeit from a small base, to our overall sales as well as in mobility and security in the quarter. Our ability to deliver complex integrated solutions also contributed to our robust client device sales this quarter. Let me share with you an example of how that works in our healthcare channel. A newly designed multi-hospital health system in the Southwest with two data centers and more than 10,000 co-workers needed to refresh more than 5,000 desktops across fairly old infrastructures. There CIO was a prior customer of CDW in another healthy system and knew our healthcare expertise would help them develop a solution that would work specifically for their needs. We assessed their current environment and determined that the devices needing refresh were shared resources and used primarily for data input by nurses and doctors at group workstations. This fact coupled with their aging infrastructure led us to a VDI solution. We architected the workflow and sizing for a new VDI infrastructure and presented several options for implementation. In the end, we determined that the best for their situation was a converged infrastructure solution. This need for a client refresh drove over $2 million of revenues in the second quarter. Approximately $150,000 in professional service revenue, $1 million for converged hardware, software and maintenance and $1 million for [their clients] (ph). With two data centers, the customer will be adding a second converged infrastructure solution to ensure forward (indiscernible) this quarter, as well as a new server platform and wired and wireless infrastructure. With so many projects on the place and the integration of the two IT systems that customer decided to have us provide remote managed services of the new VDI environment, which will generate annual recurring revenues of nearly $200,000. This leads me to our third strategic priority, which is continue to build our service capability. Service capabilities are an integral part of many high-end solutions sales and one of the key ways solutions add to customers' stickiness. By expanding our service delivery capabilities, we deepened relations with both customers and our vendor partners. Let me share a great example of the power of our services offering when combined with our solutions portfolio. A financial management software company that provides SaaS based solutions to their customers, was expanding overseas. A relatively small firm, they wanted to maintain control over their production environment while minimizing time to market and cost. With the delivery of software mission critical to their business, they couldn\u2019t sacrifice security of clients or performance. Our hybrid solution helped them achieve these goals by combining a part of the solution they put out and built cost effectively themselves within their infrastructure. First we mapped out the hardware they needed, a converged infrastructure solution. Then we help them chose the right global co-location and cloud partner, including making sure they found the best premise to cloud hybrid solution for disaster recovery and offsite disk space data archive. Finally, we helped them get started by providing configuration services and employed in-market engineers to help them set up the environment. This solution drove hardware, software and professional services revenue of $1.8 million and aggregation fee of $60,000 per month for a 36-month term. Delivering long-term-sustainable profitable growth requires a constant focus on balance between expense and investment. During the quarter we continued to invest to ensure we can help our customers address an increasingly complex IT landscape adding 65 additional customer facing co-workers. We now have a 121 additional customer-facing co-workers on the team since the beginning of this year, on target with the plan we shared with you last quarter that calls for adding between 150 and 200 customer-facing co-workers during 2014, likely to be at the high end of that range. Once again, this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence and our ability to deliver consistent sustained profitable growth. The combination of our full suite of offerings, our diverse customer channels with our scale and scope, go to market strategy and long-lasting customer and partner relationships, continues to position us to both capitalize on current market conditions and deliver profitable growth well into the future. With approximately 5% market share in a highly fragmented market, we have plenty of runaway. Let me conclude by sharing some thoughts on the remainder of the year. As you can see from our results this quarter, we continue to reap benefits from our efforts to build our capabilities and capacity to deliver high growth technology solutions. But there is no doubt we benefitted from client devices tailwind. While we expect to see client devices growth significantly above trend from the remainder of the year, we do expect the rate of growth to slow, both from a significant year-over-year overlap in K-12 perspective and some other signs that the PC refresh is moderating slightly. By no means a halt but a slight moderation. Given expectations for client device sales in the back half of the year and our first half performance, we now expect to grow 400 to 500 basis points above U.S. IT market, which at this time we see growing slightly above 4% for the full year. If client devices sales don\u2019t moderate as much as we think, then we would expect to see an increase in the U.S. IT market growth above that level. And with that, let me turn it over to Ann who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann Ziegler : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our second quarter, financial results reflect CDW's ability to deliver a full suite of solution offerings that address customer priorities across the IT landscape, the power of our diverse customer channel and the ongoing success of our three part strategy. They also reflect the progress we are making against our financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, delever our balance sheet and deliver double-digit earnings growth. Let me begin with our P&L. If you have access to the slides posted on line, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on Slide 7. Top line growth was excellent this quarter with net sales of $3.11 billion, 11.8% higher than last year on both a reported and average daily sales as we had the same number of selling days in both the second quarter of 2014 and 2013. Average daily sales grew $48.5 million. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales were up 15.3% versus Q1 2014, which is well above normal seasonality. Gross profit for the quarter increased 10% to $496.9 million. Similar to Q1, gross margin remained under pressure with our gross margin at 16%, down 20 basis points from last year's Q2. The decline was primarily due to the ongoing impact of both mix and pricing pressure from growth in lower margin to more transactional products. Reported SG&A, including advertising expense, was $308.7 million, up just 3.6% over last year. Advertising expenses remained fairly constant as a percentage of sales, increasing $3.2 million in the quarter versus last year. We ended the quarter with 7151 coworkers, up 184 workers since the end of 2013, and up 341 since the end of last year's second quarter. Annualized sales per coworker were $1.75 million, up 7% over Q2 2013. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising was $250.7 million, up 4.5% over the last year. This increase reflected higher coworker cost related to higher compensation consistent with increased coworker count and attainment based compensation plans tied to adjusted EBITDA consistent with our year-to-date performance. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation generally associated with transactional products. Expense leverage from the overall increase in sales and the tilt in business towards more transactional sales coupled with continued tight cost control and timing of investments, enabled us to more than offset our gross margin pressure. As you can see on the next slide, Slide 8. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter excludes $4.3 million of non-cash equity compensation, $2.2 million of historical retention costs and other expenses, and costs related to our May secondary offering. To make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our growth profit plus adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. As you can see on Slide 9, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $247.1 million, up 16.3% year-over-year, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8%, up 40 basis points from last year. Let's look at the rest of the P&L on Slide 10. Interest expense was 31% lower than last year at $48.5 million, reflecting reductions given by repayments and refinancing activity completed in 2013 and 2014. Our effective tax rate was 36.9% versus 36.2% in Q2 2013. On a GAAP basis we earned $86.6 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income which better reflects our operating performance, was $115.9 million in the quarter, up 46.3% over last year. As you can see on Slide 11, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add backs that fall into four general buckets. The ongoing amortization of intangibles from our going-private transaction, any non-recurring cost related to financing including debt extinguishment and interest equalization, on-going non-cash equity compensation, and other onetime non-recurring income or expenses. These adjustments are tax effected at statutory rate of 39%. With Q2 non-GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 172.7 million, we delivered $0.67 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 45.6% over the prior year. Turning to the first half results on Slide 12. Revenue was $5.8 billion, an increase of 10.9% on both a reported and average daily sales basis, as average daily sales grew to $45.3 million. Gross profit during the first quarter of 2014 was $922.1 million, up 8%. Gross profit margin was 16%, down 40 basis points from 2013. SG&A including advertising expense, increased by $18.2 million or 3.1%. Adjusted EBITDA was $440.8 million, 12.7% above first half 2013. Non-GAAP net income for the first half of 2014 was $197 million versus $135.5 million in 2013, up 45.4% driven by our higher operating results and lower interest expense which was down $43.8 million. Turning to our balance sheet on Slide 13. On June 30, we had $227.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. As I indicated on our last call, on May 9 redeemed the remaining $42.5 million of our 12.535% senior subordinated notes. This resulted in a $2.2 million loss from extinguishment of debt and $0.5 million reduction in our interest expense related to the impact of interest equalization. We finished the quarter with $2.9 billion of net debt, $665 million less than the beginning of the year. Our cash plus revolver availability as $1.18 billion; net debt to trailing-12 months EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 3.4 times, 0.1 turn less than the end of Q1. As we have shared with you in the past, we continuously evaluate opportunities to improve our capital structure. To take advantage of favorable terms and rates currently available in the marketplace, this morning we launched the offering of a new $600 million senior unsecured note facility. We intend to use the funds from this offering to redeem the entire outstanding $325 million 8% senior secured notes and pay down $235 million of our 1.28 billion 8.5% senior notes. This proposed refinancing is designed to deliver a reduced interest rate in future periods and a more favorable covenant package which both better reflect the improvements we have made to the balance sheet over the past few years and also provides us with greater financial flexibility. For more information about the proposed GAAP transaction you can access the press release posted on cdw.com. Not taking into account the proposed refinancing we announced this morning, our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 5.9%. In this potentially increasing interest rate environment, I would like to remind you that our $1.52 billion term loan facility is subject to 1% LIBOR floor and that we have in place on $0.15 billion principal amount at interest cap at a weighted average rate of 2.4% which expires in Q1 of next year. The remainder of our outstanding debt is fixed rate, so approximately 88% of our outstanding debt is actively fixed or hedged and rates would have to move significantly before they have a material impact on our interest cost. Consistent with normal seasonality, cash flow from operations plus the net change in our flooring agreement, was down sequentially in the quarter. Remember that Q2 and Q4 are our lowest cash flow quarters of the year as our interest expense on our 8% and 8.5% note is paid on April 15 and October 15. Also remember that our cash flow generally drops in Q2 as we cash taxes for Q1 and Q2 in the second quarter. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $102 million and cash interest was $84 million. During the quarter, we had net investment in working capital commensurate with our higher rate of growth over the period as well as the impact of a strategic stock position we took in Chromebook to ensure we could meet customer demands in a market that is beginning to show a few pockets of supply constraint. Recall that it's similar to when we took advantage of our distribution and warehousing capability to make sure that we had hard disk drives for our customers during the Thailand flooding shortage. Our normal seasonality coupled with these investments in working capital resulted in free cash, flow which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures, of negative $20.6 million in the quarter. While our accelerated rate of growth drover increased working capital investment at the end of the quarter, as you can see on Slide 14, we maintain strong rolling three-month metric. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 1 day versus last year's second quarter. We expect to continue to maintain our cash conversion cycle within our target range of the lower mid-20s for the remainder of the year. Turning to the rest of 2014. As Tom mentioned, for our top line we now expect 2014 growth between 400 and 500 basis points higher than the U.S. IT market, which we currently believe is tracking slightly above 4% for the year. We also continued to target these medium term financial measures you see on Slide 15. Adjusted EBITDA margin in mid-7% range, mid-teens non-GAAP earnings growth per share which we expect to repeat again this year, now likely hitting below-20s and deleveraging 1/3rd to 1/2 times per year until we hit our target leverage of three times. Keep in mind that we view the medium term as the next two years and we hold ourselves accountable for delivering these targets on an annual basis not quarterly. Let me provide a few additional comments for those of you modeling our second half 2014 financials. As you can see on Slide 16, the realignment of or financial services and legal verticals at the beginning of this year resulted in a shift of approximately $115 million of revenues inside our corporate segment from small business into MedLar for 2013. For the second quarter of 2013 the impact was $37 million. Not taking into account the proposed refinancing announced this morning, we expect our cash interest to be approximately $96 million for the remainder of 2014. For full year 2014, we now expect a cash tax rate of 40%, up slightly versus our prior expectation of 39%, to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition related intangibles amortization which is approximately $40 million per quarter. In addition, beginning this year and continuing through 2018, we will pay $20 million to $21 million of taxes per year related to the cancellation of debt income or CODI we incurred in 2009. As I shared with you in the past, 2013 free cash flow reflected the benefit of lower cash taxes primarily due to deductions associated with our IPO and refinancing related expenses. This year, tax payments ramp up as we lose those deductions and begin making the CODI payments I just referenced. Given the absence of 2013 tailwinds and the incremental impact of CODI, while you should expect excellent free cash flow in 2014, it will likely be below that of 2013 and at the low-end of our normalized targets of 2.5% to 3% of net sales. Again, don\u2019t forget that our cash flow will tend to increase sequentially into the third quarter and then decline sequentially in the fourth quarter due to our semi-annual interest payments. On the expense side, consistent with the past couple of years, we expect our adjusted SG&A to increase at a rate more in line with sales for the balance of the year as we absorb costs related to higher coworker count and infrastructure and productivity initiative investments in the second half of the year. Sales compensation also should return to a more normalized percentage of gross profit as client devices both moderate and represents a lower percentage of sales growth. Increased sales to the federal government, which tend to be lower margin at the end of their fiscal year, should offset any potential lift in product margins from improved mix. All of these puts and takes bring us to a lower adjusted EBITDA margin for the balance of the year with the full year margin hitting our mid-7% target range. Given seasonality and the timing of our investments, we expect our fourth quarter EBITDA margin to be below our full year target range. Moving down the P&L. We expect book interest for the remainder of the year to be in the $95 million range and we continue to expect our 2014 effective tax rate to be higher than last year in the 37% to 38% range. Given the overlap of the 27.5% tax rate we had in Q4 of 2013 and lower interest expense savings as we lap last year's big reductions, you should expect 2014 non-GAAP net income growth to be significantly stronger in the first three quarters of the year than in our Q4. One final note. Returning cash to shareholders is an important component of our commitment to build shareholder value and I am delighted to report that our board of directors declared our fourth quarterly cash dividend since our return to the public market. We will pay a dividend of $0.0425 per share on September 10 to shareholders of record on August 25. We intend to revisit our dividend policy annually and once we achieve our current target leverage ratio of about three times, we will look to our overall strategy to return cash to shareholders, which depending on tax policy and other factors at that time could include share repurchases. That concludes the financial summary. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Operator, can you please provide instructions for asking the questions? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays. Your line is now open. Ben Reitzes - Barclays: Can you talk about drivers -- and by the way, Ann I appreciate that color on the cash flow, so that\u2019s still what I was going ask. I am going to ask about drivers for the second half. You mentioned that PCs could temper a little bit. But I was wondering what you thought about a potential server cycle as a driver. And also can you talk about the sustainability of the public revenue streams that have been -- that really were higher than expected in the quarter? And then particularly touch on that eRate program and how that impacts your business. Thanks. Tom Richards : So there is kind of three parts to that, Ben. First on the PC refresh. I think we are fairly comfortable that it's going to continue through the end of the year and the comment on the moderation in part is just the number of customers that have already done the refresh. You have got some interesting comps going on for K-12, to say the least, during the second half of the year. But we do, I think to user your term, we do expect PC refresh to continue to be a driver for the remainder of 2014. As far as the server business and for that matter our overall solutions business, we would -- I do think there is a mindshare issue that goes inside of both our sellers and customers when it comes to how many big projects can I take on at one point in time. We are a little bit of encouraged by the end of the second quarter increase in some of our solutions business, including servers and how that started in July. We will see if that remains. But a big wildcard for us I think this second half of year will be what happens with federal. And because, as I have said, we had our first positive growth quarter in a while, we are very excited about that and we are seeing, Ben, some increased, what I will call sales activity in the federal channel. You know quotes, RFPs requested, contract meetings, all of those tend to make you believe we are going to see some uptick and that could influence a lot the second half of the year. But you know as you know, we have had six or seven quarters of tough (indiscernible). So that\u2019s a little bit of a wildcard. In the overall public driver, it is segment specific. So the eRate access or helping customers find and how to use eRate to fund different products and programs. It is part of our vertical expertise, if you will. It kind of demonstrates the vertical strategy. We continue to think that will be something that will be a tailwind for people buying technology. I would tell you that K-12 is the segment that continues to surprise. I have been getting asked how much more of this core curriculum tailwinds do we have and we recently read the statistics somewhere have been -- where it said something like 18% of the school districts are kind of prepared or full prepared and then another 30% or kind of prepared. So to me, my math is that\u2019s 50% that still need help in getting ready for the core curriculum. So we are continuing to look to K-12 to be a growth. And then the last one that makes up the public group or is an important part is healthcare. We had nice returns, so a strong growth. And we do see that continuing for the rest of the year and again the PC refresh will be part of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs : I guess first question. Could you give us a little bit more color on your thoughts around the refinancing strategy, both today's announcement and your thoughts on the future? And I guess related to that, the debt reduction definitively end at three times leverage or with refinancing presumably becoming through the call dates after that, or do you still think you may have some capacity beyond that? That would be my first question. I have a second question after that. Ann Ziegler : Yes. I am not sure I understood the last part of that question but let me. The refinancing strategy is, you know as we approach the early call dates and you begin to look out at where interest rates might move, it just makes sense to take up a piece of the risk off of the table by doing a piece of the refinancing today. So that\u2019s what we did. We will continue to monitor the marketplace and as it makes sense, opportunistically begin to refinance the remainder of the debt that\u2019s outstanding and become callable in April of next year. Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And I guess the question I has asked, the second question, was really the question we ask quite often. Which is how to think about your capital allocation strategy after you hit three times leverage. I know you have several options buybacks, dividends, potential for more deleveraging. But how are you thinking about that today given the environment we are in. Ann Ziegler : Absolutely. So as we have indicated, we will revisited our dividend annually. So that will come up because we are about to anniversary the first dividend we paid. But then on top of that when we get to three times leverage, we will revisit the strategy more globally, looking at potentially a significant step function change in the dividend as well as initiating stock buyback. But all that\u2019s going to depend on the marketplace at the time, tax policy, interest rates etcetera. Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Great. And then my final question would be, on how to think about absolute OpEx trends through the back half of the year. You gave a ton of details on the call, I am not sure I got them all but in particular, if you could focus on how we should think about the absolute OpEx trends over the next two quarters and particularly how variable comp effects that given the stronger than expected revenue performance. Ann Ziegler : Yes. I think the best way to think about it is, that we expect our OpEx to grow, or adjusted SG&A to grow more in line with sales for the second half of the year as we continue to add coworkers through the year that OpEx growth, and we also have some initiatives that were simply funded or some funds to be invested in second half of the year. So as you think about the second half, you would expect OpEx adjusted SG&A to grow more in line with top line growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin - Stifel: Just wanted to focus on your services. Tom, you gave some pretty good examples of some of the solutions that you are providing for both small and large customers. If you look at your infrastructure, your network operations centers and data centers, what's your capacity look like and are you expecting to expand that? And as a related question, could you talk about CapEx plans for the year. Tom Richards : Okay. So let me start with the second quarter first. You know we typically spend about 0.05%, I think in CapEx spending for the year. I think we are going to be in that range. We have been in the, I think what, $40 million to $50 million range. We are pretty steady eddies when it comes to spending on CapEx. We do have some projects interesting enough, that Ann alluded to, that are important drivers of growth in our cloud business that we will be working on during the second half of the year and delivering. As far as the first question about capacity, I don\u2019t see any capacity constraints. When it comes to expanding our services business and in particular where you would think about that is in our managed services and some of our hosting strategies. And we feel very comfortable we have the capacity to meet whatever demand is going to be in the marketplace. You are instinctively on point, so to speak. We are getting increasing demand from customers to help them think about infrastructure as a service or remote network management, managed services as the hybrid IT blueprint continues to be the prevailing discussion point with most of our customers. Matt Sheerin - Stifel: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then looking at your vertical strategy which is obviously benefitting the growth. Could you talk about any other areas? You talked about financials, are there any other verticals that you are looking at and potentially building out as a sub-sector of one of your other segments? Tom Richards : Not at this point. We still consider the finance and the legal verticals to kind of be in their embryonic stage if I would say it that way. You know we just moved them into the MedLar sales channel, kind of graduating from the pilot phase. And so we will concentrate on those right now and getting those into being full productive sales channels. And then -- that doesn\u2019t mean we aren't thinking about it, but I don\u2019t think I am at a point where I could share anything this specific. But I think another point is, we do continue to subs-segment, as I alluded to. And that is a huge benefit because as you might imagine, even inside of healthcare or finance, your ability to get underneath that segment level and provide unique solutions is a real asset to customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : I just wanted to clarify the growth outlook for 2014. So based on what you see today it sounds like CDW, you expect CDW to grow 8% to 9% for the year versus I guess 11% growth in the first half. So just trying to back into the second half growth expectation of around 6% to 7%, just to make sure that I heard that right. And then I have a follow-up. Tom Richards : Yes. It's going to be, if you just think about it, just do the 400 to 500 on top of the slightly above 4. But I did allude, the PC refresh continues, Brian, stronger than I think. It could be slightly above the 4 number, which could than push us a little higher than the number you talked about. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : And then just on the slower growth in client devices. Is that based on sales trends that you are experiencing or is it more of an expectation based on customer conversations or just intuition based on how strong it has been in the first half? Tom Richards : Probably the correct answer is, all of the above that you mentioned. It's a little bit some looking at the math and knowing the overlaps some of those segments have. Some of it is just looking at the rest of the market that has the opportunity to do that. Although I would tell you that, we haven't seen it moderate yet in a meaningful way but your instinct would tell you, by the time you get to the end of the year, you are going to see some moderation in that growth rate. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : Okay. And then just a final clarification for Ann on the margins. So if I heard your comments, it sounds like gross margin you think stays around 16%, OpEx grows in line with revenue. And so if we kind of look what that means for adjusted EBITDA margins, around 7.5% for the year, flattish year-over-year in the third quarter but down in Q4. Is that right? Ann Ziegler : Yes. I think you have it right conceptually. I mean we don\u2019t provide that specific level of guidance. We certainly expect to hit our medium term target in the mid-7% range on a full year basis. I want to be clear, we don\u2019t expect to hold the margin at the 8% range. We delivered this quarter with OpEx growing more in line with sales in the back half of the year. Right. It's certainly going to be lower than it was in Q2. And in Q4 in particular, because of some of the overlaps, we expect to be below the medium term annual target. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham. Your line is open. Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: So, two questions. First, you talked about continued pricing pressure especially on the transactional products. I am just interested, in this rising demand environment here domestically, what do you think is the driver for that? Is there not enough business going around for some of these small regional players that you are competing against or are they also trying to gain share? Are they trying to compensate for other areas? Any additional color on the price competition. Then I have a follow-up. Tom Richards : Well, I think part of it, Rich, is driven by as certain parts of the IT infrastructure get commoditized. Pricing pressures always becomes the bigger and bigger part of the discussion. And I think -- I don\u2019t know if I could comment on other peoples strategies but I do know that when there is an opportunity in the marketplace and people feel like they need to either maintain their share or protect their share, that pricing tends to be the strategy some people run to. So we have experienced that now for a period of time. I am going to say, it feels like the last 18 or 24 months on the transaction part of the business. Not quite as much on the solutions side but more on the transaction side. And the connective tissue there is, we just expect that part of our business to continue to grow and therefore you are going to continue to see that pricing pressure. Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: Okay, and then just on the Chromebook tightness. Do you feel you've got a diverse supply of those in terms of vendors? What has been the vendor response when you have relayed the demand issue that has led you to stock some extra product? Tom Richards : Well, the answer to your first question is, yes. That\u2019s one of the great benefits of a company like CDW, is the diversity of options. That also is a great operating benefit for us because it enables us to sent a pretty strong message about our ability to consume those devices. And I will tell you, the partners have been very good. I think one of the things that has helped is our ability to give them specific forecast and our confidence level in those forecast. And when you can have that kind of dialogue, it tends to be a pretty good equation. Rich Kugele - Needham & Company: How long do you expect that tightness to continue? Tom Richards : I don\u2019t know that I could comment on that. Quite honestly, I really don\u2019t know enough about the back end of the manufacturing process. All I know is, we want to make sure that we have the product for our customers and that\u2019s why we were aggressive in building a stock position. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird: Tom, a question on taking the growth rate to 400 to 500 above the IT market growth from 200 to 300. That implies share gain. What is the primary driver of that? Is it mostly a function of end market exposure for CDW? Tom Richards : Jayson, I am sorry, what was the last part of your question? I didn\u2019t quite -- what's the... Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird: Why are you gaining share? Is it a function of where your end market exposure is? Tom Richards : Yes. I would say it's a couple of things. One is, you know we have been working on a number of different initiatives that are beginning to kick in. You heard me talk about the geographic realignment in small business. I think a second part of it is, we are anticipating federal will continue to return to growth and we are looking at some other initiatives and some of the things we talked about earlier, the success of our vertical markets. So I think all of those have been part and parcel of why we have experienced the share gain in both existing customers, which I think it's important to keep this to mind, that when we talk about share gain, it's both within share of wallet inside of an existing customer and then acquiring new customers. And as I have, I think mentioned on a couple of these calls, cloud computing and some of the other initiatives that we have implemented in small business have been huge factors in helping us acquire new customers. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird: Okay, thank you. And a follow-up on data center. I think you said storage and server were a little soft. What are you seeing in the networking market right now? Tom Richards : Network was pretty good. It wasn\u2019t anywhere near the client tailwind but the network business has been pretty consistent for us. Within the network business, I think alluded to this in my comments. So wireless networking continues to be a pretty area of strong interest by our customers. I think a lot of that has to do with, they deal with kind of the mobile world, the deal with maybe Ethernet kind of landline restrictions when it comes to capital investment. The wireless part of the network continues to be a growth area. Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : As you noted, hardware growth significantly above software growth. Is there any historical relationship whereby strong hardware sales will lead to an acceleration in software growth in coming quarters? Or is the PC dynamic less likely to drive software and services attach? Tom Richards : Katy, I think the answer is, in some parts of the hardware world, the answer is yes. Like in storage and that implication on storage software. But with more of the cloud-base solutions, they are almost independent growth driver in the business, not necessarily tied to a particular hardware refresh. So we saw, as I think I alluded to, we saw growth across our virtualization practice, our security software practice and obviously our cloud-based solution practice. And I don\u2019t know that those were driven as much by hardware as just independent decisions inside the business. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Okay, got it. You made a couple of comments about federal returning to growth in the second quarter. We are heading into the fiscal year-end for federal. What are your expectations as it relates to any budget slash in the September quarter? Tom Richards : Katy, I am so hesitant to give federal expectations based on what we have been through in the last couple of years. I do feel, if you kind of look at happened, civilian really had a strong quarter and DOD started to see the increased activity. That would suggest to you increased momentum. But I think I would careful suggesting we will have a normal, if you can say that word anymore, normal end of the year federal budget flush. But activity would suggest continued growth. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is (indiscernible) on behalf of Bhavan. And I just kind of wanted to ask a question about the geographic alignment success you saw in small business. I was just kind of wondering if you really change anything in your go to market strategy there and kind of how you see this progressing in the back half of the year. Tom Richards : Well, yes, we did. One of the things we have been working on is the benefit of geographic alignment to the small business team, I tried to call it out in the comments. It now gives us the ability, since our partners are generally aligned geographically, to have the small business team participate in in-market technology, seminars. In-market technology, sales opportunity. That\u2019s a huge benefit for them because it really become the cost effective way to get your message to multiple customers at a single time. When they were not geographically aligned with MedLar, it made it hard for them to take advantage of that. So I don\u2019t want to suggest that just that single initiative drove the improved performance. But it was clearly a contributor in the go to market -- excuse me, the success of the small business. Operator : I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Tom Richards for further remarks. Tom Richards : Okay. Thank you. Thanks again to everybody for your time today. We are thrilled with the quarter. Obviously, the growth rates and the profitable performance are important parts of what we expect of ourselves. And we are excited about what the second half of the year suggests for us. So as always, if we can help your companies solve some of these technology problems, please let us know. And enjoy the rest of your summer and we will see you in the fall. Thanks, everybody. Ann Ziegler : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

I also want to remind you, this conference call is a property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the Company. So with that let me turn the call back to Tom. Tom Richards : Thanks, Sari. So let's begin with our results. Once again CDW delivered industry leading profitable growth with a net sales increase of 14%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 12.2% and earnings per share growth of 29.2%. We broke third quarter records for all measures. There were 3 main drivers of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer channels, our broad suite of products and solutions, and balanced expense management and investment. Let me walk through each one of these and how they contributed to performance. First, our balanced portfolio of customer channels. As you know, we have 5 channels, medium and large business, small business, healthcare, government and education, each generating annualized sales of $1 billion or more. You've seen the power of our balanced portfolio of channels in the past when our unique end markets have acted counter cyclically in face of different macro economic cycles or exogenous factors. For example, in last year's third quarter, corporate sales growth was 9.9%, nearly double public's 5.3% as public results reflected declines in both federal and healthcare. This quarter we experienced the combined power of our portfolio in a different way, with all of our channels delivering double-digit top line growth. On a segment basis, corporate grew 10.7% with balanced performance between small business, which was up 10.4% and medium-large business, which was up 10.8%. Public was up 18%, education increased 23.2%, once again, driven by K-12 as they continue to drive exceptional growth in 3 ways. First, from the sale of Chromebooks to support Common Core curriculum implementation. Second, from the related security software to keep students safe. And third, from solutions that support schools expanding data needs. Higher ed and healthcare both delivered double-digit growth. Finally government, which we thought could be a real wild card for us in the quarter rebounded significantly from last year, up 17.6% with both state and local and federal growing in the high teens. Federal buying behavior was more normal in 2014, consistent with the ramp up we discussed, on last quarter's call that began late in the second quarter. Our other results line, which includes Canada and Advanced Technology Solutions was up 13.5%. We continue to experience currency impact with Canadian operations growing nearly 1-third faster in local currency. The second driver of our performance was our broad portfolio of products and solutions. With over 100,000 products, services and solutions we are well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. This quarter, our customers' needs were broader based than the past few quarters and we experienced product strength across the spectrum with hardware up 14%, services up 13% and software up 14%. Continuing the trend we have seen for the past four quarters, transactional products grew faster than solutions. Transactional product growth continues to reflect PC refresh in K-12 Common Core curriculum preparation, with significant increases in notebooks and mobile devices, which includes Chromebooks. Our solutions practices also contributed meaningfully to our top line. Solutions focused hardware growth accelerated in the quarter with netcomm growth more than doubled the second-quarter rate increasing low double-digits. And enterprise storage increasing high single digits compared to a decline of low single digits in Q2. For the third quarter in a row, server performance improved and was essentially flat in the quarter compared to a decline over the last few quarters. Our software results were excellent this quarter, in part driven by the impact of 1 large deal. However, absent that deal, software still grew high single-digits, reflecting increased solutions focused businesses \u2013 business with significant increases in storage, security and virtualization software. Once again, our excellent top line performance in the quarter was driven by both our balanced portfolio of sales channels and broad suite of products. But as you know, transactional products tend to have lower margins and when sales mix is tilted more toward transactional products as it was this quarter, we experienced pressure on our margin. This quarter our gross margin was down by 50 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. And that leads me to the final driver of our performance for the quarter. Our balanced approach to expense management and investment. Our relentless focus on cost containment has driven our long history of industry-leading profitability. This quarter was no exception. When combined with the cost leverage, we experienced from accelerating sales growth, our tight expense control nearly offset our gross margin pressure. At the same time, to ensure we are prepared to meet our growth objectives, we continued our ongoing investment in our customer facing co-workers. As expected, since the beginning of the year, we have added 200 customer facing co-workers at the top of our initial target range of adding between 150 and 200 this year. We expect to end the year around the current level assuming normal attrition. This investment ensures we continue to enhance our ability to gain share and build our capabilities to deliver the products and solutions our customers need and want from us, a broad spectrum of IT solutions that include cloud, mobility, data center architecture and security. Today co-workers who are primarily focused on helping our account managers deliver advanced capabilities; our service delivery co-workers and specialists represent one-quarter of our workforce. More than one-third of our co-workers are sellers focused on ensuring that we continue to gain market share through acquiring new customers and expanding share of wallet. I hope you can tell from my remarks that this quarter's results reinforce our confidence that our strategy will continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth and cash flows. That confidence enabled us to establish our refreshed capital allocation priorities and take the actions we announced today. Our capital allocation strategy is focused on providing both near and long-term returns to shareholders. We're ensuring we continue to invest in our future. Reflecting this balanced approach, we have 4 capital priorities. First, increase dividends annually. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure. Third supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. Today's announcements are the first actions taken under these priorities. We increased our quarterly cash dividend 59% and authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Ann will provide more detail on our priorities in a few minutes. But before she does, I'll share some thoughts on the third action we announced today. Our strategic investment of a 35% minority interest in Kelway. Our investment in Kelway is a natural extension of our long history of following the customer. And as you know, CDW has been successfully executing against our 3 part strategy for a number of years, which is to first profitably grow our core business, and increase share of wallet with existing customers, while adding new customers. Second, enhance our ability to deliver high growth integrated solutions. And third, expand our services capability. By executing these strategies we have deepened our relationships and delivered continuous greater value to our customers and partners. As we have increased our importance to customers, we have been increasingly asked to help multinational customers internationally. Up until today, we have met those requirements through strategic (technical difficulty) relations \u2013 relationships, primarily with Kelway. The investment we are announcing today solidifies our partnership with Kelway and further enables our ability to follow our customers' needs for international IT solutions. Let me share a brief snapshot of Kelway. Kelway is a private company, founded in 1990, is 1 of the leading integrated technology services and solution companies in the UK, focused on the mid-market, which they define as employers with between 250 and 2000 co-workers. As of March 2014, Kelway had over 900 co-workers. Similar to CDW, approximately two-thirds of their co-workers are customer facing. Roughly 90% of Kelway's sales are derived from the UK. What makes them unique is that they have developed the ability to provide solutions and services in over 100 countries through global supply chain relationships. Headquartered in London, Kelway has regional sales offices around the UK and locations in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. They also operate 3 data centers in the UK. For their fiscal year ending March 30, 2014, Kelway reported revenue of GBP526 million. Using today's exchange rate that equates to approximately $850 million. At its very core, CDW is about meeting the needs of customers better than anyone else and our investment in Kelway enhances our ability to do that. Kelway enhances our customers' access to international technical expertise and IT solutions. By working more closely with Kelway we will be able to provide a more consistent brand experience for our customers, regardless of where the solutions are delivered. Kelway accelerates our first strategy, which is to profitably grow our core business. It both enhances our ability to increase share of wallet of our existing US based multinational customers, and our ability to capture new customers because we will be far more relevant to prospects with significant international IT needs. Kelway's learning and experience providing customer portals that deliver real-time management views of hosted and managed infrastructure will help us accelerate our second and third strategies as we continue to enhance our solutions and service offerings including cloud. Kelway also provided us with additional geographic diversity, adding to the benefit we already received from our balanced portfolio of channels in a relatively low risk way. Whenever you make an investment in another business, culture is a key factor of its success. Having worked with Kelway as a strategic partner for more than 18 months, we know that their values and culture are very much aligned with ours, as is their value proposition to their customers and vendor partners. A great fit all around. We are making this investment in a measured, consider way, just as we do for any important allocation of capital. The investment we are announcing today is for 35% of the company and we will account for the investment under the equity method. While we are not disclosing the terms of the transaction, we do want you to know that we expect it to be accretive to earnings per share in the first year, consistent with our stated strategy of creating long-term shareholder value and our focus on delivering sustained profitable growth. The transaction is structured so that we can take up to as much as 100% ownership through mid-2017, which we intend to do if the business performs as planned. As we have shared with you in the past, this type of transaction is exactly what we intend to pursue under our new capital allocation priorities, a strategic tuck-in that adds capabilities that would be either too lengthy to develop or too costly on our own. In this case we are adding international capabilities. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy capital for bolt-on acquisitions in strategic situations that we believe will contribute to our ability to create shareholder value. However, you should expect us to continue to be highly selective and disciplined around these opportunities. These could include solution capabilities or service capabilities and would be evaluated in the context of our capital allocation priorities. Before I turn the call over to Ann, let me leave you with a few comments on our expectations for the remainder of the year. You'll remember, that on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectation for US IT market growth of slightly above 4% in 2014. Based on what we have been seeing in the market, we now expect US IT growth in the 5% range for the full year. While client devices sales contributed meaningfully to our top line in the quarter, the level of contribution in the quarter decelerated just as it did the last 2 quarters. We expect that trend to continue. If the deceleration continues as expected, the tailwind we have experienced over the past few quarters from client devices will diminish in the fourth quarter. Even factoring in this deceleration, we expect to deliver top line growth, about 600 basis points above the market for the year. We will accomplish this by continuing to leverage the factors that drove our performance this quarter. The balance of our portfolio of channels, a broad suite of products and solutions, and our balanced approach to expense management investment. I know many of you may be wondering what we expect to see in 2015. We are in the middle of our planning cycle and while we haven't finalized our view on the market growth, you should expect us to continue to achieve our medium term targets. I will share a thought about the US IT market in 2015, during our year-end earnings call. Now let me turn it over to Ann. Ann Ziegler : Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our P&L, balance sheet and working capital for the quarter and year-to-date, provide some thoughts on the fourth quarter and then provide more detail on our refreshed capital allocation strategy and our new medium-term target. As Tom indicated, our third quarter financial results highlight the power of our balanced portfolio, broad suite of products and solutions and disciplined approach to investing and controlling costs. Our third quarter results also reflect the progress we are making against our financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, delever our balance sheet and deliver double-digit earnings growth. Turning to our P&L, If you have access to the slides posted online, it would be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 10. Top line growth was excellent this quarter with net sales of $3.27 billion, 14% higher than last year on both the reported and average daily sales basis as we had the same number of selling days in both the third quarter of 2014 and 2013. Average daily sales were $51 million. On a sequential basis sales were up 5.2% versus Q4 2014 \u2013 Q2 2014, which is above recent Q3 seasonality. Gross profit for the quarter increased 10.7% to $507.3 million. Similar to Q1 and Q2, gross margin was impacted by both mix and pricing pressure from growth in lower margined more transactional products. This quarter we also felt the impact of the mix shift into public, which tends to have lower margins and the impact of lower advertising co-op as a percentage of sales. Gross margin was 15.5%, down 50 basis points from last year's Q3. Reported SG&A including advertising expense was $322.6 million, down 11.8% over last year. Remember that last year's third quarter reported SG&A included $74.1 million of IPO related expenses. Advertising expense increased by 12.1% or $4.1 million in the quarter versus last year. We ended the quarter with 7,242 co-workers, up 270 co-workers since the end of 2013, and up 328 since the end of last year's third quarter. Annualized sales per co-worker were $1.82 million, up 8.7% versus Q3 2013. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising was $265.8 million, up 9.5% over last year. This increase reflected higher co-worker count and attainment based compensation consistent with our year-to-date EBITDA performance. We also took advantage of our strong top line growth to make investments in the business, including co-workers, increased advertising and process improvement initiatives. Expense leverage from our higher than seasonal sales increase and lower costs associated with supporting transactional sales enabled us to partially offset gross margin pressure. As you can see on the next slide, slide 11, adjusted SG&A for the quarter excludes $3.9 million of non-cash equity compensation, $2.2 million of historical retention costs and other adjustments. To make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our gross profit less adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. Slide 12 shows our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $242.6 million, up 12.2%, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.4%, down 10 basis points from last year. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 13, interest expense was 10.9% lower than last year at $50.1 million reflecting the impact of redemptions and refinancing activities completed last year and this year. Our effective tax rate was 37.9%, which resulted in tax expense of $33.9 million versus a tax benefit in Q3 of 2013 of $2.6 million. On a GAAP basis, we earned $55.6 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance was $110.7 million in the quarter, up 29.9% over last year. As you can see on slide 14, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add backs that fall in 4 general buckets, the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, any non-recurring costs related to refinancing including debt extinguishment costs, ongoing non-cash equity-based compensation, and other one-time non-recurring income or expenses. These adjustments are tax affected at statutory rate of 39%. With Q3 non-GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 173 million, we delivered $0.64 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 29.2% over the prior year. Quickly turning to the first 9 months of the year on slide 15, revenue was $9 billion, an increase of 12% on both the reported and average daily sales basis, as average daily sales grew to $47.2 million. Gross profit during the first 9 months of 2014, was $1.43 billion, up 8.9%. Gross profit margin was 15.8%, down 50 basis points from 2013. SG&A including advertising expense decreased by $24.7 million or 2.6%. Adjusted EBITDA was $683.4 million, 12% \u2013 12.5% higher than last year. Non-GAAP net income for the first 9 months of 2014 was $307.7 million versus $220.7 million in 2013, up 39.4% driven by our higher operating results and lower interest expense, which was down $49.9 million. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 16, on September 30, we had $357.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and net debt of $2.8 billion, $259.2 million less than at the beginning of the year. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion. Net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 3.2 times, 0.2 turns less than at the end of Q2. As we discussed on the last call, during the quarter we issued $600 million of new senior unsecured notes and redeemed the entire outstanding $325 million of our 8% senior secured notes as well as paid down $234.7 million of our outstanding 8.5% senior notes. This refinancing delivered a reduced interest rate and a more favorable covenant package, which better reflects the improvements we've made to our balance sheet over the past few years. With this new issuance, our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 5.5%. During the quarter we also started the process of rolling over our existing interest rate cap with new contracts and we plan to have the existing caps replaced when they expire. To-date we have replaced roughly one-half of the $1.15 billion of cap that expire in January of next year. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement, less capital expenditures was $149.1 million compared to 200 \u2013 compared to $95.9 million in Q3 of 2013. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $359.1 million, up 13.5% from last year. Cash taxes paid for the quarter were $78 million and cash interest was $27 million. As you can see on slide 17, we maintained strong rolling 3 month working capital metric. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 20 days flat versus last year's third quarter. We expect to continue to maintain our cash conversion cycle within our target range of the low to mid 20s for the remainder of the year. Before I turn to the capital actions announced today. Let me provide a few additional comments for those of you modeling our fourth quarter financials. Fourth quarter sales growth is expected to be below our normal seasonality, reflecting our strong year-to-date performance. As we indicated last quarter, given the seasonality and persisting gross margin pressure, we expect our fourth quarter EBITDA margin to be below our full year target range. We do however, expect to be within our mid 7% target range for the full year 2014. Moving down the P&L, we expect book interest for Q4 to be approximately $46 million and continue to expect our 2014 effective tax rate could be higher than last year in the 37% to 38% range. As we discussed on last quarter's call, the overlap of the 27.5% tax rate we had in Q4 of 2013 and lower interest expense savings as we lapped last year's big reduction results in 2014 non-GAAP net income growth significantly stronger in the first 3 quarters of the year than in Q4. For the full year, we expect to significantly exceed our current medium term target of annual mid-teens EPS growth likely growing EPS for the full year in the mid 20s. Keep in mind we refinanced $600 million of debt in Q3 and we intend to refinance the balance of our 8.5% senior notes due 2019, no later than when they first become callable in April of 2015. So you should expect to see additional interest expense savings beginning in the first half of 2015. Turning to our cash flow. We expect our cash interest to be approximately $58 million for Q4 2014. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate of 40.5% versus our previous estimate of 40% to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $40 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay $20 million to $21 million in tax annually related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. As we have shared with you in the past, 2013 free cash flow reflected the benefit of lower cash taxes, primarily due to deductions associated with our IPO and refinancing related expenses. This year tax payments ramp up as we lose those deductions, and begin making the CODI payments due over the next 5 years. As we've indicated all year, given the absence of 2013's tailwinds and the incremental impact of CODI, while you should expect excellent free cash flow in 2014, it will likely be below 2013 and at the low end of our normalized target range of 2.5% to 3% of net sales. Also remember, we pay semi-annual cash interest payment in the fourth quarter and see the impact of our Federal business receivables, which tend to have longer than average days outstanding running through our working capital. Now let's turn to capital allocation. You will recall that since the IPO, we have stated we would revisit our dividend annually and once we achieved our medium term target of about 3 times net leverage, we would revisit our capital strategy more holistically. With the net leverage ratio at 3.2 times at the end of the third quarter, the time is right to update the market. Our capital allocation strategy is designed to provide shareholders with a balance between receiving short-term capital returns and long-term value creation and provide CDW with the flexibility required to execute against our long-term growth strategy. This drives our balanced approach to capital allocation and results in the 4 priorities you see on slide 18. First, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases we have set a target to achieve a dividend payout ratio of 30% of free cash flow over the next 5 years. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place and we have set a target to maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic tuck-in acquisitions. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. Today's actions on slide 19 align with these priorities. First, our dividend; our Board of Directors declared a 59% increase in our annual dividend to $0.27 per share. This equates to a new quarterly dividend of $0.0675 per share. The first quarterly dividend will be made on December 10 to shareholders of record as of November, 25th. Given our current payout ratio and target of 30% of free cash flow, this is the first in what we expect will be excellent annual increases over the next 5 years. Of course, future dividend actions will be determined by our Board as they consider both our annual free cash flow and alternative uses of capital. The $500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board is structured to provide us with the flexibility to repurchase shares via open market or via private transaction depending on market conditions. There is no set time limit and repurchases can be commenced or suspended from time to time. We have 2 goals for our share repurchases. First to offset dilution from incentive compensation programs and second act as an effective tool to help us achieve our new medium-term target of low double-digit earnings growth, which begins in 2016. Given these objectives, we expect [indiscernible] authorization will be utilized over the next few years. This leads us to our refreshed medium term targets on slide 20. Our current medium term targets will remain in place through 2015, our new medium-term targets over the time period of 2016 through 2018. Similar to our current target, we expect to continue to outperform US IT market growth by 200 basis points to 300 basis points and maintain annual adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid 7% range. However, the amplification of earnings from lower interest expense will decrease as we conclude our remaining refinancing and achieve our target leverage of about 3 times. Instead, our new target of low double-digit EPS growth reflects the anticipated impact of operating results supplemented by both accretive tuck-in M&A and share repurchases. Remember, these refreshed targets begin in 2016. Our current target continue to run through the end of 2015. Also keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our targets on an annual, not on a quarterly basis. That concludes the financial summary. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Operator, could you please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Benjamin Reitzes from Barclays. Your line is open. Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays: Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. Tom Richards : Good morning, Ben. Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays: Hey, can you \u2013 my first question before the follow up I guess is on Kelway. Can you just talk about your decision to ease into it a little bit with the 35% and reiterate for us and explain how you can top that up to 100%. It would seem that you're obviously with the way it's structured to have a good chance to make sure that the partnership is working wonderfully before you would top up your ownership. And it could \u2013 I think you mentioned something about 2017, If you could just talk about that now that will eventually hit the P&L that would be great. Tom Richards : Ben, I don't think I could answer the second part any better than you did relative to why it's structured the way it is because it gives us an opportunity to just like we do most things here at CDW carefully and thoughtfully work through the partnership and work on a complete integration plan. And as we said, we are taking a 35% stake. That was presented as an opportunity as one of their former investors had decided they were going to exit. So, we kind of seized that opportunity, so to speak and took advantage of the window of time presented in front of us. As I indicated, we'll have the opportunity to take up to 100% through mid-2017. That doesn't mean we necessarily have to wait that long, but it does mean that that's the window of time. Your description was extremely accurate. One of the things we like about the kind of way this has rolled out, if you think about it is, we've been partnering with Kelway now for over 18 months and working with them on customer issues and working through opportunities together. So you get a really good feel for the partner, that's why we're so excited. But we also know that during an integration of this kind of magnitude and opportunity is something you want to do thoughtfully. And so now we have the time to do it, without doing it and too much of a risky kind of profile. Ann anything else? Ann Ziegler : Yes. Then on the ability to top up, the option to acquire control in a 100% begins in June 1 of next year and then continues for 30 months. So again, we think that's an appropriate time that gives us the opportunity to make sure the partnership is working and make an inform decision about whether to acquire 100%. Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays: It's a great detail. Thanks. And just really quick on the gross margin and how \u2013 you were very detailed on your guidance and your objectives. But on the gross margin side, I want to reiterate, you think it can go up sequentially in the fourth quarter and how does gross margin fit into the mid-teens EPS guidance for 2015 or at least the goal that you have out there directionally? I know you're still planning, but the puts and takes on gross margin sequentially and into the next year, even from a high level, I think would be pretty useful. Thanks. Ann Ziegler : So, we've been talking about the impact of product mix on the gross margin. And so while we do expect the growth rate of the client, the transactional products to decline, we expect these products, especially the Chromebook to continue to be an important part of our mix. When you think about Q4 as well, we would expect this year to have a greater mix of federal business than we saw last year and that business is also generally lower margin business. In terms of at a higher level, remember, we managed to profitability, EBITDA profitability. And so we plan our SG&A expenses accordingly. So relative to gross margin that we expect [indiscernible]. So, given the recent competitive environment, we are not planning on seeing gross margins expand and we'll keep our eye on SG&A accordingly. Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays: Okay, thank you very much. Tom Richards : Thanks, Ben. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bill Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you. Now that Federal spending is improving/normalizing, how should we think about the trend in the 4Q off of the fiscal year ended and the September quarter and how should we think about it going into early next year from an annual growth perspective, given the strength (technical difficulty) this quarter? Tom Richards : Well, if you think about it, Bill, this is the second quarter of returning to growth. I think we had a small growth in the second quarter and then obviously strong growth. So it does feel more, as I stated in my formal remarks, normal. We would expect the growth to continue and we are expecting Federal government to continue to be a growth segment for CDW. That's absent any new exogenous factor that could enter the process. But we look at it as it will be returning to a growth segment for CDW. I would tell you that I think, normal, if you go back to what normal was for CDW is that the fourth quarter is typically slower than the third quarter only because you have the end of the year financial flush that we hadn't experienced in the last couple of years and we fortunately did experience this year. Bill Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay and then my follow-ups on your M&A strategy, should we assume that most of your M&A and investment activity will be centered on international opportunities or do you think this is going to be spread domestically and internationally over time? Tom Richards : No, I think what we have been, I think fairly consistent in stating, Bill, is that we look at these things, not so much as just broad roll up, but more looking for tuck-in, or specific opportunities. And in my formal remarks, I talked a little bit about other solution areas where it may be better for CDW either time wise or cost wise to acquire those kind of capabilities than it would be to try to grow them yourself. So, I would not look at this as the launch of a \u2013 an aggressive international acquisition strategy, but more so the opportunity to work with a great international partner that's going to help us expand our international capability. Bill Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Tom Richards : Okay. Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Kugele from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Tom Richards : Good morning, Rich. Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company: Thank you. Good morning. A couple of question, well, actually 1 question with 2 parts. Can you just talk about the recovery off of from the storage side and the server side? And in particular, each one have their own dynamics earlier in the year, one being on the storage side where there were some delays and you saw that, certainly a lot of the top vendors were talking about that and then it has recovered, so any color you could provide on that. Then on the server side, obviously there has been the new processor roll out from Intel and others and then you've got the refresh coming next year for post Windows 2003 and later 2008. So those are 2 really interesting areas for investors if you could talk about those areas and the opportunities for CDW. Tom Richards : Yeah, okay. So let me take storage first and I think what we saw in the third quarter was in part what we suggested a little bit in earlier quarters is if you remember from earlier quarters, there was a lot of discussion about kind of the new entrants into the marketplace and the impact they were having on the more traditional providers. And I think I remember saying that, I didn't expect the traditional providers to roll over and play dead. And so clearly they aggressively responded in the third quarter and that helped drive some of that growth. I think the other thing that's happening and this is I think in part driven by to some degree a mindshare issue. When customers have priorities and clearly the client refreshes their priority for customers for over 4 quarters, there is only so many projects that companies are going to be able to take on at any given time. I can tell you this from having said on the other side of this desk for some period of time. So I think one of \u2013 another reason you're seeing that return to momentum is people are moving through the client refresh and now starting to take on some other opportunities, and we feel like we saw that in the storage place. In the server arena, for us, we've been kind of on this steady improvement growth for the last several quarters. And I think \u2013 I agree with you, the Windows 2003 Server opportunity as you know, is not something you do quickly. I actually think people have been working on this and to some degree, have been already making improvements in the marketplace, which has contributed I think to some of the improvement we saw in our server performance going forward. Having said that, we're also seeing compute improvement in our cloud business, which I think people need to keep in mind when you look at server performance, we kind of keep cloud separate, but clearly customers are having the opportunity and the benefit to make a choice between which applications and which opportunities, where do I want my compute to sit. And the beauty of the position we're in is, we don't care. It can be there in the cloud or on the prem and we're going to be happy either way. Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company: That's helpful and just conceptually, looking at your top line growth. Would you be able to grow, whether it's 2015 or if you want to go further out to 2016, 2018, would you be able to grow an IT spending plus 200 basis points to 300 basis points without acquisitions or do you view tuck-in M&A as critical to hitting that? Tom Richards : No, no, I would say the M&A strategy is strategic from the perspective of continuing to provide capabilities that further cements our relationships with our customers. I think we've demonstrated the ability to grow organically 200 basis points to 300 basis points above the IT market and we would continue to expect that of ourselves. Rich Kugele \u2013 Needham & Company: Excellent. Thank you very much. Tom Richards : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Shan Shan Wong from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Shan Shan Wong \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes, thanks, good growth here. Just curious what percent of your business this quarter was transactional and how much of the third quarter upside came from transactional sales? Tom Richards : Well, I can tell you it was a meaningful part of the business. I'm not sure we're going to share the percentage, if you look at the numbers, but just, interestingly enough though the percentage that came from what I'll call the PC business was again meaningful and you heard me talk about some of the PC growth numbers, but it has declined in each of the last 3 quarters. And so, it's a kind of an interesting phenomenon because it's continuing to grow at a rate much higher than we had experienced in previous years. And the one thing about \u2013 to keep in mind about the PC business of CDW is we had growth when the rest of the marketplace wasn't growing, demonstrating the benefits PCs provide for business customers. But the growth clearly over these last 3 quarters, it's \u2013 I mean I don't want to say ridiculous, but it's pretty significant. And so it was a meaningful part of the growth for the whole quarter. Shan Shan Wong \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes. Just last question given the difference which all we heard from some of the other bigger players. So just as my follow-up, maybe 2 quick ones, just the split of HP here, any impact to CDW from a contractual standpoint? Then just can you clarify again your buyback philosophy? Thank you. That's all I had. Tom Richards : I'll take the first part, look, we don't see any impact truthfully from a negative perspective of the HP decision. We, in today, deal with those 2 groups as separate entities. As far as, excuse me, how they deal with the channel where the investments go. So, we are excited for their change moving forward, but it really won't have an impact on how we operate with them and specifically how we work with customers. And I'll let Ann answer the second question. Ann Ziegler : Sure, on the share repurchases, as we approach the leverage ratio that we targeted at the IPO, we thought it was appropriate just to add share repurchases to the tools that we have to deliver shareholder value. The program allows us to do both open market and privately negotiated purchases. And we have 2 goals with our repurchases. One is to offset dilution from incentive compensation programs, and you'll see us begin to do that next year. And the second just to act as an effective tool to help us achieve the new medium-term targets of low double-digit earnings growth. Shan Shan Wong \u2013 JPMorgan: Helpful. Thank you. Tom: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Yes, thanks and good morning. I just had a question, another question on Kelway, could you give us an idea of the profitability metrics of that company, is it similar to CDW's. Tom Richards : Yes, in the range, you can go to their website and look at information about the company. But they've been working hard on improving profitability and we're excited about the progress that they've made. Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. And on the education market. Tom, you talked about a couple of opportunities, one in Chromebooks but also security and data. We've seen obviously double-digit growth for a few quarters now, where are we in terms of innings, if you will, in terms of that upgrade cycle on the opportunity and is it mostly Chromebooks or is the next phase the infrastructure part of that build out? Tom Richards : Matt, we knew we were going to get the inning question sometime in this call. Look, I feel a little bit exposed here because I keep saying this thing can't continue and every time I say that this group of people prove me wrong. They have continued to be successful, I would tell you that we just sat with them a week ago and they continue to be pretty bullish, although they know they're addressing or excuse me jumping some pretty meaningful comps in the marketplace. But I think, Matt, there's still runway here, if you look at, I mean just 1 simple lense to look through I think we saw something that said, less than 50% of the people are actually prepared for the Common Core. Now, whether the data is actually adhered to or they get an extension is another thing, but we are still seeing lots of opportunity. The second thing is, the thing that I think it's lot in the success of what the K-12 group has done with the Chromebook is the other business, the infrastructure business that is being generated as a result of us becoming a meaningful provider of the Chromebooks inside for the Common Core curriculum. I can't give you the actual numbers, but I can tell you that the K-12 Group was a leader in a lot of other categories and in the top in servers and in the top of netcomm and software, so it kind of tells you the whole picture that's being created by their success. Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, thanks very much. Tom Richards : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Alexander \u2013 Raymond James : Okay. Thanks. Maybe another one on Kelway. Tom, just, what gives you the confidence and variability to execute to the standards that you hold for CDW. I know you talked about the 18 month partnership, but did that span a large number of customers and engagement such that you have a high degree of confidence in their ability to execute and how are you going to transfer your secret sauce to them in terms of systems, processes and people? Tom Richards : So, Brian, the first one is absolutely confidence. These 18 months, we have had a meaningful number of joint opportunities and they've gone both ways, which has been great pride. There have been opportunities we have brought to Kelway and then Kelway has finished kind of the international. And then the reverse has been true where they've had UK based companies that have had US deployments. So we've had a chance to kind of work through a number of different scenarios. So the thing that in my formal remarks that I would reinforce is, culture is a big part of successful acquisitions and mergers. And the fact that they are so customer focused and driven much like CDW, gives us a really high degree of confidence that as people would like to say, they get it. And so we're excited about that. As far as some of the things you referred to, there are let's just say more than a few opportunities where we think we can share some of our best practices with them. But I would tell you as I also mentioned, there's a few things they've done in the area of their service works product and looking at their hosted and managed services portal and how they have built some capability to help customers manage that and their cloud solutions. That while not maybe necessarily perfectly transferable, those learnings are going to be very valuable to us at CDW. Brian Alexander \u2013 Raymond James : Great, that's helpful and then just as a follow-up, I know we're not talking much about 2015. But I think investors are trying to figure out how much of the tough comps from this year could affect growth next year. So just to clarify, based on what you know today, do you still expect to outperform the market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points next year given you're going to do much better than that this year? And do you think the strong PC growth from this year takes the market growth something below GDP next year or do you expect other categories like storage, like servers to fill the void and the overall market can still kind of grow in that 3% to 4% range, maybe just give us some high-level thoughts on how you're thinking about that today. Tom Richards : Yeah, Brian we absolutely expect to out go to the market by our target of 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Regardless of the comps we hold ourselves accountable for that and we don't let tough comps kind of get in the way of focused on execution. The other thing that is in our favor, if you think of the PC and the success we've had this year as a tailwind that would become a headwind is we've also had market segment that maybe weren't performing as strongly as they have been in the past and that presents new opportunities for us going forward. So, we feel confident that we'll continue to perform and execute at the 200 basis points to 300 basis points kind of minimum range we've been focused on in for the last couple of years. Brian Alexander \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hi, thanks. Just trying to think about the growth going forward and going about the US, IT growth of 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Can you give us some sense of what you think your market share is now, how much longer that outgrowth is sustainable versus the US IT spending? Tom Richards : Yes, Sherri. Despite the kind of incredible year we've had and another great quarter, I would argue from an addressable market perspective, we're still in the 6% range 5% or 6% range. So, that's 1 of the reasons I can state with confidence that we intend to continue to outgrow the market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points is because pick your number, there is 95% of the addressable market out there that we can continue to go after. Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay great. And, Ann, just a quick clarification on the taxes, the taxes go up in fiscal '15 or do they not go up until fiscal '16? Thanks. Ann Ziegler : Now the taxes have gone up this year 2014 versus what we had \u2013 what we saw in 2013. We got the benefit of significant deductions related to the IPO and all the refinancing activity in 2013. So we have a higher tax rate this year than we had last year and we expect that higher tax rate to continue basically for marginal rate. Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Your line is open. Unidentified Speaker : Hey guys, this is [Matt Farrell] on for Anil. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious, if you are doing any type of sales force incentives to maybe help push some higher margin products as the gross margin has kind of come down here recently. Tom Richards : Matt, truthfully, one of the beauties of CDW's compensation structure is people get paid on margin. So they are every day incented to \u2013 I've often said this tongue and cheek they are kind of margin seeking missiles and we're proud of that, out there. So \u2013 but look, here is the other side of it. If you're truly in a partnership and a role of a consultant with your customers and customers say right now we've got to do this PC refresh, you're going to do the right thing by the customer in the short run. Because, doing the right thing by the customer in the short run is going to end up meaning, you're going to have the right long-term relationship. And so, I don't feel like we've got to put some extra incentive out there because, our sellers have a long history of going after margin opportunities. Having said that, we have had and continue to have under Ann and the sales executives' responsibility, a number of issues that currently look at how do we improve gross margin. What kind of things can we do, what kind of cost efficiencies can we get in the business, what kind of road block removal can we take out of making sure that we get the best deal possible both for CDW and our customers. So, you should feel comfortable that we've got a long list of things that we have been working on and that we continue to work on to improve gross margin. Unidentified Speaker : Alright, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Market. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Market : Thanks a lot, good morning, guys. 2 questions for me, one, maybe I missed this, but I think what you guys have implied sales being down 10% or so sequentially. I'm not sure \u2013 maybe you just talk about, why is it so much more severe than normal seasonality, given the fact that US IT spending is actually going to go from 4% to 5% versus the initial expectation. Maybe I missed what's driving the Q4 seasonality being worse than historical trends. Tom Richards : I would tell you, it starts with the third quarter being so exceptionally higher than what our normal trend is. If you look at our growth rates, especially since the beginning of this year, they've been meaningfully higher than kind of the normal CDW trend. So what it does is, it just creates a higher cliff that you're coming off of when you have a 14% growth in the third quarter, which I think it's been a while since we've had that kind of growth. Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Market : Got it. That makes sense and then \u2013 I guess everyone started to get the arms around the 2015 model. Maybe if you just talk about in 2014, you guys are outgrowing IT spend about 600 basis points, let's say. How much of that is sustainable market share centric kind of tailwinds versus things like PC that may not exist \u2013 that may not help you next year. You just talk about maybe I guess how much of that 600 basis points is something that you can repeat again next year, versus the more \u2026 Tom Richards : Well, I think, if you look at our history, we've been really good at repeating 200 basis points to 300 basis points which is why that's the target we hold ourselves accountable to. And we're always going to be opportunistic and if the opportunity presents itself and that number goes to 400 basis points or in this case this year, 600, we're going to do that. But I think that's been one of the reasons we've had the consistency of performance is because we do feel like our focus, our model, the things I talk about the breadth of our channels, the breadth of our products. And now, adding our international partnership with Kelway is going to give us an opportunity to ensure even if we don't get the PC tailwinds that we'll be able to perform in 200 basis points to 300 basis points beyond the market. Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Market : Perfect, thank you. Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks, good morning. One of the nice elements this quarter is the consistent growth across customer segments and product segments including some improvement in storage and software and Med Bar in addition to Federal. And yet, gross margin is sort of back to 5 year trough. So, I don't know, Ann, if you could go back through some of the reasons that there was another big downtick despite PCs, a lower percentage of the business and some improvements in those higher margin categories that would be helpful. Ann Ziegler : Yeah. I think, what you need to understand is that, while we did have much better solutions growth in the quarter than we've seen in the first half of the year, we continued to have outside growth, even better growth in the transactional business. So you have that mix impact. The other thing you see in this Q3 versus last year is Federal returned to much more normal performance and particularly at the Federal year-end that is lower gross margin business as well. The other thing you have is, things like co-op income, the co-op marketing dollars. They don't scale when our top line grows as on an outsized basis like it has in Q3. Those items don't scale and therefore just, they have a negative mix impact on gross margin as well. So, that's why you see the performance at the gross margin line. We do again, we managed to profitability and the transactional product do have a lower cost to serve if you will. And you do see some of that offset as you move down through SG&A down to EBITDA. Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, that's helpful. And just a clarification on the near and medium term EPS targets, you're still looking at mid-teens EPS growth next 2 years and then after that you'd be moving towards the low teens. Ann Ziegler : We're looking for \u2013 we expect to deliver mid-teens in 2015, consistent with the targets we've set forth at the time of the IPO, and then beginning in 2016, that's when we moved to the low-double digit. Katy Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our finl question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird : Okay, great. Thank you. I wanted to follow-on to data center. Could you, I think network has been stronger than server storage. But you could \u2013 could you talk about network relative to server storage? And then more broadly, the converged market how is \u2013 what's your perspective there and how does, how much of an opportunity is that for CDW? Tom Richards : Hey, Jay. First of all, you're right, the networking or the netcomm market had a strong quarter for us, which I think is indicative of some things going on in particular segments. Truthfully, if you think about even healthcare where you have the movement of those healthcare records and the need to upgrade the network, you think about what's going on K-12 or the Chromebook, all of that stuff drives the need for extra capacity and we've kind of seen that now in the network part of our business. And so that point of your insight was exactly accurate. What was the second part of your question? Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird : Converged. Tom Richards : CI, yes. Look, another great growth area for us, continues to be a great opportunity. I think to some degree it will be interesting because tracking CI and you think about the notion of CI. How do you account for that, when you think about servers and storage in year-over-year numbers, we're quite honestly not worried about that, we are just being focused on taking advantage of customers coming to us. And some of those new CI players have been really successful for us in the marketplace. Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird : Okay, thank you. And then final question again on Kelway, you or Ann mentioned a few data centers, they operate in the UK, could you describe that component of their business and then is it similar at all to any of your initiatives here in the States? Tom Richards : The answer is yes, it is similar, it's really 2 categories. It's hosting and managed services, which you know are important parts of our growth profile for our second strategy of expanding solutions capabilities. And so that's another (technical difficulty) we are very excited about the synergies between the 2 companies. Jayson Noland \u2013 Robert Baird : Thanks guys. Tom Richards : Alright, thanks, Jay. Operator : Thank you. And I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Tom Richards : Okay. First of all, thank you again for your time today. Obviously we're proud and pleased with the quarter that CDW has produced and the new capital allocation priorities that we've announced today, which I think is a signal of our confidence in the business. And lastly, our general excitement about our new partnership with Kelway. And so, let me leave with Thanksgiving thought, don't be a turkey, hug somebody on Thanksgiving. Thanks everybody. See you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

I also want to remind you, this conference call is a property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the Company. So with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Tom Richards : Thanks, Sari. We had a strong finish to a great year of both financial and strategic performance. For the year, we significantly outpaced our medium term annual target of growing 200 basis points to 300 basis points above the U.S. IT market delivering a 2014 net sales increase of 12.1% well above estimated market growth rates with excellent profitability. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.2% and earnings per share increased 29.7%. Our performance in 2014 demonstrates the strength of our business model and highlights the power of our balanced channel portfolio, diverse product suite and variable cost structure. Let me walk through each of these and how they contributed to performance. First our balanced portfolio of five channels each with nearly $1 billion or more of annual sales. This balance has served us well on the path when we have been confronted with challenges outside our control like the closing of the federal government in 2013. In 2014, instead of working together to offset macro economic or exogenous factors, our balanced portfolio worked together to fuel top-line growth. With each channel growing high single digits or better. Second, our diverse product suite of more than 100,000 products from over 1000 leading and emerging brands, which ensures we are well-positioned to meet our customers' needs whether transactional or highly complex. In 2014, this enabled us to meet strong client device demand for both PC refresh and meeting common core curriculum digital testing requirements. Client device demand drove significant growth throughout the year. While initially dominating customer mind share as we move through the year and refresh projects are underway, our solutions business bounced back of growing high-single digits in the second half of the year. Even with this strong performance transactional products grew faster than solutions throughout the year and represented 53% of our 2014 sales compared to 49% in 2013. Faster growth in client devices fueled our top-line, but also pressured our gross margin. And that leads us to the third element of our growth performance this past year are variable cost structure. For those of you unfamiliar with our cost structure after our cost of sales, our largest cost element is sales compensation. Sales compensation is highly variable for two reasons; first, it is tied to gross profit not revenue. Second because solutions sales involve technical resources who are also paid transaction sales are less expensive to serve. In 2014, a higher mix of transaction sales pressured our gross margin, but the variable nature of our sales compensation helped to mitigate this impact. And finally, we would not have been able to deliver the exceptional results we did had it not been for the efforts of our dedicated and talented team of over 7,200 co-workers. They are a true source of competitive advantage in a highly competitive market and are a key reason why our business model is successful in delivering industry-leading performance year-after-year. Let\u2019s briefly turn to the fourth quarter performance. Net sales were up 12.4% substantially above market estimates. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 11.1% and EPS growth was 8.6%. Corporate was up 8.9% with balanced performance across both the small business, which was up 8.7% and medium-large which was up 8.9%. Public increased 18% led by government's 35% increase reflecting both strong year-over-year growth in federal as we lapped the shutdown of federal government last October and excellent state and local growth. Without the distraction of a government shutdown sequestration or debt ceilings to content with, we saw a more normal federal buying behavior. Federal customers not only had their fiscal 2014 budget in hand, but felt more confident that they would have a 2015 budget. Education delivered excellent growth up 21% led by a 20% plus increase in K-12 with low double-digit increases from Higher Ed. K-12 activity continued strong into year-end as schools worked to be ready for spring 2015 common core testing. Healthcare grew just over 1% as projects and initiatives driven by meaningful use and the Affordable Care Act slowed after the rapid pace in the first half of the year and industry consolidation led to more focus on driving out cost and investment. Together Canada and advance technology services which we report as other posted 11.8% increase. Canadian sales in local currency were twice the low-double digits they delivered in U.S. dollars. Looking at our broad product categories for the quarter; hardware was up 15%; services were up 12% and software was down just over 1%. Notebooks and mobile devices growth continued strong in the quarter driven by common core digital testing devices and ongoing overall client refresh with excellent increases in federal. Defying expectations K-12 grew notebooks and mobile devices at the same rate as the third quarter on top of 2013's exceptional fourth quarter results. Our solutions business sustained the momentum we had in the third quarter delivering strong increases in categories that support integrated solutions. NetComm was up low-double digits and storage and servers were both up high-single digits. A great example of the success we are having in solutions is the CDW deployed Wi-Fi network at the University of Phoenix Stadium used during the Super Bowl to enhance fan experience. Early data shows that there were 2.5 terabytes of data downloaded and 3.7 terabytes uploaded more than 6 terabytes of Wi-Fi usage over the network. Nearly 26,000 unique devices connected to the network on Game Day. Peak concurrent usage was over 17,000 users not surprisingly during half time. We are very proud of the great partnership between CDW Cisco and the University of Phoenix Stadium team. Stadium networking has become an area of expertise for us. We have delivered integrated solutions to the Georgia Dome, Lucas Oil Stadium, Soldier Field and Reliance Stadium among others. On the software side strong performance in security and virtualization was offset by a higher portion of revenues from SaaS sales and software assurance contracts. While this resulted in a revenue decrease of just over 1%, the higher portion of these revenues which are recorded as 100% gross margin led to software gross profit dollars increasing high-single digits. This helped to mitigate some of the product margin compression we experienced from the higher mix of transactional products. As you can see 2014 was an excellent year of financial performance. It was also a year of excellent strategic progress. For CDW everything we do starts with our customers; what do they need and how can we meet that need? Our customers' want to take advantage of all of the productivity and growth benefits integrated IT solutions provide. But, given limited IT resources and the ever increasing pace of IT change, they need help deciding what path to take. Our three part strategy is designed to make sure that they turn to us as an extension of their IT resources and their trusted advisor to help them make the right decision for their business. In 2014, we made progress against all three of our strategies. Our first strategy is to increase share of wallet and acquire new customers. Two key ways we accomplish this is by enhancing seller capacity and improving seller capabilities. In 2014, we made excellent progress in both areas. Enhancing seller capacity makes it easier for them to focus on what matters most meeting the needs of their customers. One way we do this is by reducing administrative burden. In 2014, we introduced new tools that enabled sellers to reach customers more efficiently enhancing order processing. In 2014, we also enhanced seller capabilities with new training tools including new programs to build proficiency in cloud and game-based work shops to enhance selling skills. The game which we called negotiations won nationally recognized awards for excellence in three learning categories. Best use of games for learning, best use of social collaborative learning, best custom content for excellence in learning. To further our sellers' ability to deepen relationships and solve unique customer needs, we established new verticals in finance and legal and refined our geographic segmentation with the establishment of a new south region. This is all about getting closer to the customer. And to make the selling process more effective in 2014, we continued our marketing productivity investments. We evolved our mix of media with a heavy focus on digital to more effectively get our message up. We also improved our blade to identify remarketing opportunities through the use of advance predictive analytics. To enhance our sellers ability to meet U.S. based customers and prospects internationally, we made a 35% investment in U.K. based IT solutions provider Kelway. We're off to a great start with Kelway, and we'll have more detail on their contribution to our results shortly. Our second strategy is to enhance our ability to deliver high growth integrated solutions. This helps ensure that as technology evolves, we have the resources and the capabilities necessary to meet our customer needs. Today, we have six solution practice areas; converged infrastructure, which includes security, unified communications and network communications; Software, cloud which includes infrastructure as a service, software as a service and platform as a service; Mobility, data center which includes server storage, power and cooling; and our services practice which includes field services, managed services, configurations, warranties, and third-party services. In 2014, we enhanced our cloud portfolio with migration offerings that help our customers manage the challenging process, moving to new cloud-based solution. We also gained first mover advantage when we became the first company authorized to provide Google Apps productivity suite to business customers. And we added two new born-in-the-cloud security providers, to make sure that customers and prospects understand the breadth and depth of our cloud portfolio. We launched an awareness campaign around our cloud capabilities, which included Wall Street Journal advertising and Sunday morning talk show commercials. We enhanced our mobility portfolio with the launch of our innovative mobile app marketplace for developers, a single online destination that connects organizations with vetted, proven developers of industry leading mobile apps for key business functions, such as sales support, customer relationship management, human resource systems and more across all industries and job functions. There were nearly 200,000 visitors to our app marketplace in 2014. We also added to the tool kit of our sellers by \u2013 they help evaluate customers design and implement solutions with the creation of our dedicated Cloud Client Executive or CCE teams as well as the addition of new solution architect to support fast growing practice areas like unified communications and collaboration. Our third priority is to expand our service capabilities. To support our service initiatives, we've added more than 50 service delivery and co-workers and opened two new markets. Today, we have technical specialists, service delivery and sales co-workers in more than 20 major metro markets across the country. These markets are supported by our national traveling team and a nation-wide network of partnerships with OEMs and local service providers to ensure we cover the entire U.S. market. Later this year, we will enhance our ability to operate and manage customer IT, infrastructure remotely, when we open a new 24/7 level I and level II managed services command center. Expanding service delivery capabilities underpin our first two strategies of capturing market share and expanding our solutions suite and enable us to deliver an end-to-end solution. Our sellers develop and manage the customer relationships, identify the opportunities and bring the right combination of products and services to solve the customer problem. Our specialist work with our customers and partners to whiteboard the design, create a bill of materials for products and services required and draft the statement of work for the services. And our professional services and service delivery engineers install and maintain this solution. All of these co-workers are customer facing. In total, we added more than 140 customer facing co-workers in 2014, more than three quarters of which are in solutions and services. Given the rapid pace of additions in the first nine months of the year, we took a hiring pause in the fourth quarter to digest the more than 250 new co-workers we were on-boarding finishing the year slightly below our target of adding between a 150 and 200 customer facing co-workers. We made excellent progress bringing on our new co-workers. Year end annualized revenue per co-worker was $1.67 million, an 8% increase over 2013. Our 2015 plan calls for hiring between a 150 and 200 customer facing co-workers. As we always do, we will monitor the market conditions and accelerate hiring, if we see stronger IT spending that we currently anticipate. Let me close with a few thoughts on what we see for the market in 2015. Given our current view of economic growth, we are looking for 3% to 4% growth for the U.S. IT market and currently look to achieve our medium-term annual target of exceeding market growth by 200 basis points to 300 basis points. We expect moderation in client device demand both from refresh slowing and the winding down in common core activity as spring of 2015 testing is implemented. We also expect federal performance to be more normal, at the same time we expect solution categories to continue their second half of 2014 momentum into 2015 and anticipate a more balanced split between transactional and solution sales. You should expect this to rewind our views both for the market and our growth premium as we move through the year. In 2015, you should also expect us to continue to execute our three part strategy to ensure we can help our customers navigate their options and maximize the return on their IT investment. As we do, we will further penetrate our core customers and acquire new customers. This in turn will strengthen our relationship and importance to the leading and emerging IT brands. By strengthening our value proposition to both customers and partners and leveraging our business model, we intend to continue to profitably grow faster than the market, while generating superior returns today and in the future. And with that, let me turn it over to Ann, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann Ziegler : Thanks Tom. Good morning everyone. As Tom indicated, our fourth quarter and full year financial results demonstrated the strength of our business model, as we captured market share and delivered excellent profitability and cash flows, while continuing to invest in our future. As I review our financial results, I highlight some other ways the results demonstrate one of the key strength of our business model, our variable cost structure. Turning to our P&L, if you have accessed to the slide posted online, it would be helpful to follow along. I am on Slide 8. Top-line growth was excellent this quarter, with net sales of $3.05 billion, 12.4% higher than last year on both the reported and average daily sales basis as we had the same number of selling days in both the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013. Average daily sales were $48.4 million as expected on a sequential average daily sales basis sales were down 5.1% versus Q3 2014, below recent Q4 seasonality due to exceptionally strong Q3 performance. Gross profit for the quarter increased 9.7% to $491.1 million. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 16.1%, 40 basis points below last year primarily reflecting the ongoing mix impact from growth in lower margin to more transactional products. Given our strong sales growth margin was also negatively impacted by vendor funding, which while increasing in absolute dollars represented a lower percentage of net sales. And as expected the higher mix of federal sales also negatively impacted gross margin. Partially offsetting these decreases were an increase in net service contract revenue, which includes software assurance, warranties and netted down software-as-a-service revenues all booked at a 100% gross margin as well as positive inventory reserve adjustment. Reported SG&A including advertising expense was $327.6 million, 7% higher than last year attributable to higher co-worker count and attainment-based compensation consistent with our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA performance. Advertising expense increased by 5.4% or $1.8 million in the quarter versus last year. We ended the year with 7,211 co-workers up 244 co-workers since the end of 2013. As you can see on the next slide, Slide 9, our adjusted SG&A including advertising was $269.3 million up 8.5% over last year, 390 basis points lower than our net sales increase of 12.4%. Here is where you really see the power of the variable nature of our cost structure. The combination of the lower cost to serve transactional sales and our compensation model that pays on growth profit resulted in lower sales compensation as a percentage of sales compared to last year's fourth quarter, delivering significant SG&A expense leverage. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter excludes $4.9 million of non-cash equity-based compensation and $2.2 million of historical retention cost in other adjustments. To make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our growth profit less adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. Slide 10 shows our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $223.6 million up 11.1%. Adjusted SG&A leverage partially offset gross margin pressure and we ended the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.3% down 10 basis points versus last year. Looking at the rest of the P&L on Slide 11, interest expense was 5.5% lower than last year at $48.6 million as we continued to benefit from redemption in refinancing activities completed this year. Continuing down the P&L, you see our other income net line which is where we will be reporting our Kelway minority interest income. Kelway delivered $1.2 million of equity investment income in the quarter. Other income net also includes some other very minor item such as foreign currency transaction gains and fixed asset gains and losses. As a reminder, on November 10, 2014, we completed the purchase of 35% stake in Kelway; all in we paid $86.8 million including fees and expenses. We structured the Kelway transaction to provide CDW the right, but not the obligation to acquire up to 100% ownership in Kelway. The price we paid in November reflected Kelway's capital structure at that time. Our call option includes agreed upon valuation multiples that just within a narrow range with Kelway's performance. Given this and the fact that Kelway's leverage may change should we move ahead with our call option, the $86.8 million we paid for the 35% stake will not be directly comparable to the price we would pay for the remaining stake, which would likely be higher due to improving performance and debt pay down. The option to repurchase the remaining share \u2013 the remaining stake in Kelway runs from June 2015 through June 2017. We continued to expect Kelway to be slightly accretive to earnings this year. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate was 35.4% compared to 27.5% in last year Q4, which resulted in tax expense of $28.3 million versus $22.6 million. On a GAAP basis we earned $51.8 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income which better reflects our operating performance was $102.2 million in the quarter up 9.3% over last year. As you can see on Slide 12, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add-backs that fall into four general buckets. The ongoing amortization of acquisition related intangibles; any non-recurring cost related to financing including debt extinguishment; ongoing non-cash equity-based compensation; and other one-time non-recurring income or expenses. These adjustments are tax affected at statutory rate of 39%. Our Q4 weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $173.2 million, we delivered $0.59 of non-GAAP net income per share up 8.6% over the prior year. As discussed on our Q3 earnings call, our high-single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth rate in Q4 reflects the overlap of a lower tax rate we had in Q4 of 2013 and lower interest savings compared to the first nine months of the year. Quickly turning to full year results on Slide 13, revenue was $12.1 billion, an increase of 12.1% on both the reported and average daily sales basis. And average daily sales grew to $47.5 million. Gross profit in 2014 was $1.9 billion up 9.1%. Gross profit margin was 15.9% down 40 basis points from 2013. Here again, you see the power of our variable cost structure. The largest component of our SG&A, sales payroll increased only 3.9% in 2014 compared to a gross profit increase of 9.1% and net sales of increase of 12.1%. Adjusted SG&A including advertising increased 6.6% enabling us to maintain our adjusted EBITDA margin and deliver adjusted EBITDA for the year of $907 million, 12.2% higher than last year. Non-GAAP net income for 2014 was $409.9 million versus $314.3 million in 2013 up 30.4% as operating results were amplified by lower interest expense, which was down $52.8 million. Non-GAAP net income per share was up 29.7% at $2.37. Turning to our balance sheet on Slide 14, on December 31, we had $344.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $2.8 billion, $217.6 million less at the beginning of the year. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 million. Net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 3.1x, 0.7x less than the end of 2013. During the quarter, we issued a new $575 million senior note facility at 5.5% and redeemed $541 million of our 8.5% senior note. With this new issue, our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 5%. We did incur an extra $2.5 million of interest in the quarter on the redeemed \u2013 on the amount redeemed as the redemption required 30 days notice. As mentioned on our last call, we started the process of rolling over interest caps which expired in mid-January. We have now replaced the $1.15 billion of caps that expired on January 14, with $1.4 billion of new caps that went into effect in mid-January. Currently over 96% of our outstanding debt is effectively fixed or hedged and rates would have to move significantly before they had a material impact on our interest costs. As you can see on Slide 15, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q4. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down two days versus last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculated operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures was $96.3 million compared to $10.4 million in Q4 of 2013. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $51 million and cash interest was $69 million. Our full-year free cash flow was $455.5 million or 3.8% of net sales. Free cash flow was higher than expected as we benefited in Q4 from approximately $100 million of one-time items and timing which will reverse in Q1. This approximately $100 million of cash flow was a result of three things; one, early payments from a few major public sector customers; two, a higher mix into vendors which provides longer payment terms to us; and three, inventory shipments earlier than expected due to accelerated customer rollout. Normalizing for this, free cash flow as a percentage of sales for the full year would be at the high-end of our target range of 2.5% to 3%. Our priorities for uses of this cash flow remain consistent with our capital allocation strategy and will depend on market conditions and opportunities. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components which you can see on Slide 16. First, to increase dividends annually, to guide these increases we have set a target to achieve a dividend payout ratio of 30% of free cash flow over the next five years. For this quarter we will pay a dividend of $0.0675 per share on March 10 to shareholders of record February 25, up 59% from a year ago. Second, to ensure we have the right capital structure in place and we have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the quarter at 3.1x. Third, to supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions, our Kelway investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, to return excess cash after dividend and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases for which we currently have a $500 million authorization. These capital allocation priorities support our medium-term targets which you see on Slide 17. Through 2015, we continue to target top-line growth of 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market. We also continue to target our other two key medium-term financial measures; adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-7% range and mid-teens non-GAAP earnings growth per share. Reflecting the conclusion of our initial refinancings and absence of earnings amplification from lower interest expense, starting in 2016 through 2018, our new medium-term targets call for low double-digit EPS growth. We intend to use share repurchases and accretive acquisitions to amplify earnings results and help achieve this target. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our current and refresh medium-term targets on an annual, not a quarterly basis. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those of you modeling 2015 financials. I am on Slide 18. Based on the seasonality and rhythm of our business, first half of the year net sales are typically wider than in the second half and first quarter sales are typically sequentially below our fourth quarter. As a result, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales typically runs higher in the first half of the year than in the second half and our adjusted EBITDA margin will likely be below our full year target range in the first quarter. As discussed on our last call, we intend to refinance the balance of our 8.5% senior notes through 2019, no later when they first become callable in April 2015. So you should expect to see additional interest expense savings beginning in the second quarter of 2015. For 2015, our booked interest expense is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. Between lower interest expense savings and higher SG&A as a percentage of sales, both due to seasonality and a more balanced mix of solutions and transactional sales, we expect first half EPS growth to be below 2015 full year growth. We expect our 2015 book tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range and as previously mentioned we are targeting annual mid-teens EPS growth. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling cash flow. First, our Q1 cash flow will be lighter than normal due to the impact of the approximate $100 million of working capital timing that will reverse in Q1. Second, our capital expenditures, which tend to run 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis, will be a bit higher in 2015 at approximately 0.7% of net sales as a result of growth capital investments we are making relating to consolidating lease buildings for our offices North of Chicago. Adjusting for the approximately $100 million of free cash flow timing in 2014, we expect 2015 free cash flow to be at the high-end of our target range of 2.5% to 3% of net sales. We also expect to continue to maintain our cash conversion cycle within our target range of the low to mid 20s. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 39% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition related intangible amortization, which is approximately $40 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually related to the cancellation of debt income, we incurred in 2009. That concludes the financial summary. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Operator, can you please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open. Ben Reitzes : Good morning team. Tom Richards : Hi, Ben. BenReitzes: Hey couple of things, just in terms of how we think about demand and revenue throughout the year, Tom you mentioned client slow and solutions pickup, can you just give us a little more detail there, how much you expect in clients to slow and a little more detail on what's going to pickup the slack and potentially maybe some verticals that pickup the slack as well? Tom Richards : Yes. I think Ben, my expectation for 2015 is we'll return to what I would describe as a more normal rhythm that we have had in previous years, we had a pretty strong tailwind as you know with the Windows XP and what that caused on the refresh cycle. I think I'm getting out of the business of predicting when cycles end, because I might go for the month. Look, it lasted longer than I thought and obviously at end of the fourth quarter, but what we did see, which I think is important is beginning in the third quarter, the solutions business begin to really come back and really hit a nice rhythm during the second half of the year and we would expect that to continue. Look K-12, I think on this call, you guys have asked me so many times when are they going to run out of the common core digital testing, client device business, I've missed that one a bunch of times, they keep defying logics. So I would tell you, I think they are going to continue to find ways, we have some new things happening in K-12, some e-rate opportunities, which kind of go hand and glove with putting in the networks that are going to help take advantage of digital testing then you have the one-to-one initiative. So we think there is a number of things there to \u2013 that will keep that momentum. We think federal was back on our normal rhythm again. Hopefully, we don\u2019t have any exogenous factors like the shutdown. So we think that continues to be strong. You saw a nice year and a really nice end to last year by our corporate gang both med-lar and small business. And we expect that group to continue to grow going forward. So we feel pretty good about heading into 2015, and it's just a little bit of a shift in where the business comes from. Ben Reitzes : All right. And then just sneaking in a follow-up, healthcare it looks in my model, you really be public, but healthcare looks like it was slow and I was wondering if that's going to pick up and I also wondered what your repurchase plans were for 2015? And that's it from me. Tom Richards : Well, it sounds like three. Ben Reitzes : Yes, yes. Tom Richards : But, let me sneak in the second one and then I'll flip to Ann. Yes, healthcare this year for us, if you look at the whole year grew about, higher-single digits 9.5. We would expect healthcare to continue to be a mid-to-high single digit growth. I think it is going to have some lumpiness just because of the Affordable Care Act and what its doing to drive out cost causing consolidations. Now I think that would tend to plan our favor because of the breadth of our footprint. But anytime you have consolidations going on, it causes people to pause; try to take cost out and I think you saw then and some of the lumpiness there for sure. But I think on the whole on the average we still expect healthcare to be a good growth segment for us. So I'll let Ann answer the third one. Ann Ziegler : Yes. On the repurchases Ben, what we've committed to is that, we'll buyback enough shares to offset dilution from our equity plans and that would be roughly 2 million shares in the year. I would say that's a minimum commitment, the repurchase is structured to permit us to buy along any secondary that our sponsors may do. But that will depend on market conditions and timing. Ben Reitzes : Thanks a lot. Good execution. Tom Richards : Thanks Ben. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. Just question regarding your commentary on growth this year, perhaps more momentum on the solutions side versus the transactional side. Would that in theory booster your gross margin through the year and it might be, you finally see a reversal in gross margin throughout the 2015 versus last year? Tom Richards : Well, if you think about our model, it will impact a couple of different things, I would argue that part of the reason we saw a little bit of improvement in gross margins in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter was the continued improvement of our solutions business, which you are accurate Matt and that is got a higher margin profile. But there is a double-edged sword to everything in life, the downside of that is \u2013 is that we, they tend to be more complex, require technical resources as I said in my formal comments and therefore tend to maybe drive up your sales compensation. So we're \u2013 that - work this year and the reverse so to speak, because transaction business doesn't require that. Then in next year, while we'll benefit from hopefully maybe having some pressure to grow, I can use that analogy gross margin you'll have the offsetting fact of having to pay more people. Matt Sheerin : Got you. So the EBIT margin is very won't be impacted that much there. Tom Richards : That is exactly why we focus on the EBIT margin because it's really the things that we can control most and you will hear us talk about the EBIT margin most frequently because of that very reason. Matt Sheerin : Okay. And just my second question, regarding the potential server upgrade cycle that a lot of suppliers and distributors are talking about, are you having conversations with customers there and it seems like it may not be one for one replacement where customers opt for alternatives either a cloud solution or another platform. And how does CDW play in that scenario? Tom Richards : Matt that is very accurate. Fortunately we're having more than just conversations. We're actually having success. We started in the middle of last year a pretty aggressive and thoughtful Windows 2003 server initiative. We are finding as you might expect, some different kind of feedback from customers. There are many customers that we've been able to already help. And I would suggest that was a small part of why you saw some of the positive growth in servers. But the other thing that, we're hearing is the many customers either through virtualization have created capacity and so there are not necessarily automatically adding new servers, but maybe expanding the capacity of existing servers, in addition to looking at cloud-based solutions, which, as turned out great for us, it's one of the reasons our cloud business as had such exceptional growth. So I think it will be \u2013 look it's, I hesitate to use the word tailwind, because of what a big tailwind XP was, but I think it will be a mild tailwind from \u2013 for 2015. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thanks very much and best of luck this year. Tom Richards : All right. Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Thanks good morning, good results here. Just first on the transactional mix versus solutions being higher, is that a function of budget flaws or something else and what's going to drive the mix higher or towards solutions in 2015? Tom Richards : Thanks Tien-tsin. I would say it was more a function of the Windows XP exploration as the kick starter. But I think once people got into the mode of doing that, they were, they took advantage of it and started to just expand it beyond just Windows XP and did a refresh cycle. Tien- tsin Huang : Make sense, it make sense. And this is for Ann, just a clarification on the 2015 guidance, through 2015 so easing that as a compounded annual growth rate meaning the average through period for 2015 or is that an annual growth expectation for 2015, do you follow on that? Ann Ziegler : Yes. That's an annual growth expectation for 2015. Tien- tsin Huang : Terrific 2015 over 2014. Thanks again. Tom Richards : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Alexander : Okay. Thanks. Ann, you mentioned vendor funding in the minus column if you will this quarter as it relates to gross margin, but you also said that you added higher funding dollar. So I'm just curious if the margin rate decline was that more mix driven or are there more holistic changes that your vendors are making in terms of how they approach vendor funding? Ann Ziegler : No. Brian, it was mix. That was what I was alluding to, because the revenues grew so much and vendor funding is a little bit more of a fixed dollar, so while the dollars were higher, just as the mix impact it had a negative margin effect. Brian Alexander : Okay. And then just the follow-up is on software. Tom, I understand it was influenced, down 1%, influenced by a higher mix of net sales and SaaS sales and that depresses revenue, but it increases gross margin, I think you said gross profit dollars up high single-digits. So I'm curious, in the situations where your software vendors are converting from a license model to a SaaS model. Do you think CDW is at least holding its own in terms of market share? And when you look at the economics to CDW, over the life of a SaaS agreement are you generally making similar, more or less profit dollars than you were under the old model? Tom Richards : So Brian, I think your description is accurate, although I would probably change it. I'd like, we're actually not holding our own, based on the success of our cloud business, and the SaaS growth rate, it feels, although it's a pretty complicated comparison, truthfully trying to compare the two. But I would think as far as just pure market share and helping customers, I think holding own would be the minimum. As far as the financial model, it's a little bit premature I think, and here's why. As you make the conversion to, in some cases subscription, that becomes a monthly payment process and extends, can extend over multiple years. But then you also have lots of opportunities to upgrade even once that's in place and we really haven't seen that play out yet. I can tell you that the complexity and just the thought of going through which workloads do I want to put in the cloud, how do I want to think about my on-prem solutions versus what I have off-prem, has caused many of our customers to actually come to us and say help us think through this. And that's why we've added those cloud client executives this year. We're now up to 15. Those people can sit down with customers and actually have that detailed planning discussion. So up to this point it's been, as I said at the IPO, it's been a positive thing for CDW and our cloud growth has been exceptional. Brian Alexander : Great. Thanks a lot. Tom Richards : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bill Shope : Okay. Thanks. I wanted to dig in a bit more on the solutions and enterprise momentum you guys are looking for this year outside of servers. How are you thinking about other categories like storage? Are you seeing any signs of a refresh here as we head into 2015? And then I guess related to that you have commented on storage growth. If you could break that down as you have done in the past in the terms of incremental color and legacy versus emerging growth within storage? Tom Richards : Well, let me answer the second one first, Bill. The second one is it was more balanced this quarter. We saw strong growth from what you might think of is the more traditional solutions from a storage perspective. But we continue to see strong growth from the emerging brands and a lot of the flash technology so I just think it was a quarter where you had balanced growth, probably why we had a pretty good quarter overall relative to the growth rate. When we think of solutions, it's a much broader context than for us just servers and storage. It's our NetComm business, which has been a really stable and strong growing business. If you look at our performance over the last multiple quarters, NetComm is usually in the top two or three growth categories every quarter, which I think is a manifestation of what's going on in the data center as well as the growth in cloud computing. The second thing is our services practice, which is another meaningful part of our solutions business and again that's been a really strong growth for us, tied to our deployment of those customer-facing coworkers I talked about that are close to customers that can help do managed solutions and services. And the other one, converged infrastructure, which is something we don't talk about a lot, it includes network, but it also includes our security practice which is growing very aggressively in our collaboration practice, which is growing aggressively. So that is kind of more of a holistic picture, I didn't even get into the mobility part that I mentioned in the script so that's really how we think about solutions, not just the server and storage. Bill Shope : Okay. That's helpful. And then quickly if I could, on the buyback. I wanted to understand why you wouldn't get more aggressive than just countering dilution this year? And I guess related to that, could you remind us of any legacy restrictions you still have on the buy back with some of your prior debt deals? Ann Ziegler : So let me address the last question first. Under the remaining 8.5% notes we have outstanding, there's a restricted payment basket, which would be obviously hit if we did a share buyback. That dollar amount is roughly $225 million as of the end of Q4. Obviously, that restriction would go away once we refinance the 8.5% and then the relevant RP basket becomes the one under the term loan, which at this point is in excess of $700 million so much less of a restriction. In terms of how aggressive we're going to be on the buy back this year it's not \u2013 I guess I don't mean to say we're not going to be more aggressive. What I'm saying is the minimum commitment that we've made is to offset dilution. Whether we become more aggressive depends on market conditions, opportunities, obviously if we exercise our call option on Kelway that will be a use of cash as well. So at this point in the year, it's just hard to be more specific than that. We'll obviously do the minimum commitment. Bill Shope : Okay. Thank you. Tom Richards : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Thanks. Just thinking about your long-term goals about growing the U.S. IT market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points. I just wanted to understand in terms of your perspective, is that additional opportunity for share gain? How much more share opportunity is there for you, or is it largely driven by your mix of business and being better positioned in growing segments? Tom Richards : I would say yes, Sherri. First of all, if you think about CDW being a $12 billion business, our addressable market is over $200 billion so, there \u2013 and that's just in the U.S. Lots of upside for us relative to market share and market share opportunity both with existing customers and with those customers that unfortunately aren't customers of CDW at this point, yet. The second thing would be your point about the solutions business, obviously gives us opportunities to further penetrate into the data center and become more trusted advisors with our customers. So it really is a combination of both. Sherri Scribner : Okay, great. Thank you. And then, Ann, just quickly on the interest expense; I know you said that now your interest rate is about 5% on a blended basis and I think you said \u2013 just wanted more clarifications, I think you said the interest rate dropped in 2Q. Just trying to figure out how to model it for the full year based on $160 million to $170 million for the full year? Thanks. Ann Ziegler : Yes. I was alluding to the interest rate dropping because we've indicated that we'll refinance the 8.5% no later than when they've first become callable, which is in April of 2015. So it's too soon to say the amount of that drop because I don't know what the markets are going to be and what we'll be able to refinance that. The two most recent refinancings we did at 5.5% and 6%, but it depends on market conditions when we do that refinancing. Sherri Scribner : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Jerry Liu : Hi. Hey. It's Jerry for Katie. Just a question on the solutions versus transactional. Understand that solutions momentum is increasing going into this year and finally it's slowing down. But with the common core debt line into spring \u2013 in the spring of this year could we see transactional stronger in the first half? Or would CIOs not be rushing to do upgrades? Tom Richards : Jerry, that's a good question. Look, we still \u2013 there's a significant number of school districts that have not deployed yet and there is some discussion about whether they would extend the date relative to reimbursement funding. So I wouldn't be surprised if you saw some of the school districts extend their acquisition, especially when you think about the kind of linkage to the one-to-one initiative from a digital curriculum standpoint. So I don't think we should depend on the fury that we've kind of seen, to get ready, but I wouldn't be surprised if we saw school districts in the first half of the year trying to get ready for spring 2015. Jerry Liu : Got it. And the follow-up is on a strong NetComm growth that you commented on. I assume a lot of that is related to the client refresh. Is any of that related to customers going to a hybrid model or using the cloud, I mean just trying to figure out if that momentum is going to continue as well. Tom Richards : I think the thing about the NetComm growth is it has been really consistent both before the big client refresh and through the client refresh. I think it's a function of kind of the popularity and growth in mobility inside of businesses. It's a function of the increased use of cloud computing. So there's a number of things that are driving it that are in addition to the client refresh. So that is why we would expect it to continue to be a good growth category for us. Jerry Liu : Got it. Thank you. Tom Richards : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Two questions for me. One, maybe you could just talk a little bit more in Kelway maybe you've had some more time to spend with them, I'm sure. Do you think there's some structurally that at Kelway that prevents the operating margin over time getting closer to what CDW has which is currently, I believe, at 2.5%, 3%? Tom Richards : Well look, we have spent, obviously additional time with Kelway. We've had three or four months of working closer with the team. And as I said I think on the last call, we think there are learning opportunities for both sides both operationally, go-to-market. So our focus has been on the pilot that we've been operating for 18 months. We're going to continue to operate in that role even though we're a 35% investor in Kelway. But I don't think you should be sitting here going, okay, CDW is going to increase its ownership automatically Kelway's margins are going to dramatically increase. I think that's an unfair assumption. We do think there are lots of opportunities though for us to improve the efficiencies on both sides of the pond. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. Then if I could just look at the 2015 outlook that you guys have provided a mid-teens EPS growth. I'm curious is that the way to think about, what do you think operating income dollar growth would because I assume there's some sort of deleverage and potentially in buybacks that that's built into the mid-teen EPS growth, so just trying to get a sense how much of that is operating income driven versus leveraged below the operating income line? Ann Ziegler : Yes. I mean I think the way you need to think about it is we focus on EBITDA, EBITDA margins and we're looking at maintaining those margins. So we would expect the EBITDA margins to be relatively consistent with the rest of the growth coming from further interest reductions as well as stock buy backs. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jayson Noland : Great. Thank you. Tom Richards : Hey, Jason. Jayson Noland : Hello. Ann, a question on seasonality. You mentioned on your slide on modeling on the revenue side, would that look normal in comparison to past years for cal 2015 about 48, 52 first half, second half? Ann Ziegler : At this point we are expecting relatively normal seasonality as we move through the year. Now that can obviously change as exogenous factors happen during near but right now we are looking for roughly normal seasonality. Jayson Noland : Okay. And then a follow up question, I think in the script your business in Canada, FX is mentioned as a headwind. I assume that's true with Kelway to a certain extent. How do you manage a strong dollar with your business outside the U.S.? Ann Ziegler : At this point, it's all translation adjustment. I mean Canada buys in dollars and pays in dollars and so it's a translation adjustment. We did take about a 40 basis point hit to top line growth in 2014 because of that translation adjustment. When you look at Kelway at this point it's a relatively de minimis part of the business, you saw the small amount that we reported in other income net. And again, its translation adjustment so at this point we are not doing any hedges. Jayson Noland : Okay. Congrats on the success. Thanks. Tom Richards : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Doradla : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. A couple of questions. Tom, you talked about K-12, some of the education trends, but when I look at 2015, do you think this is going to be a growth business? Tom Richards : Oh yes. I do. Yes, absolutely. It'd be pretty hard for them to repeat the incredible growth they had in 2013 and 2014, but we do believe K-12 remains a growth business for CDW. Anil Doradla : Great. And one of the kind of secret sauces that you've always talked about is the culture, work culture. Can you share some attrition numbers? I mean whether it's 2014 or during the quarter, employee attrition numbers and compare that against your competitors? Tom Richards : We don\u2019t share those kind of attrition and quite honestly I don't know the competitors. I can't tell you this that it continues to be a place where people start and in many cases finish their career, and I think that speaks volumes about the work environment. And I've often said this, I think the reason CDW takes such good care of its customers is because the co-workers take such good care of each other first. Anil Doradla : Great. All right. Thanks about that. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Tom Richards for closing remarks. Tom Richards : Okay. Thank you again to everybody for taking time out of your morning to talk about CDW. We appreciate your interest. We are very proud of 2014, and equally as excited about 2015 and the things we're going to be able to do to help customers. So if your company isn't taking advantage of CDW you know where to find us. And as always it's Valentine's Day. Go hug somebody. Thanks everybody, see you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thank you, Sari. We had a good start to the year as we successfully address transitioning customer priorities and leverage the strength of our business model to deliver excellent profitability on solid top-line growth. Net sales were $2.76 billion up 3.9% above last year, 4.5% when adjusted for the impact of currency translation. We delivered Adjusted EBITDA growth of 8.8% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 19.5%. These results reflect the impact of three key drivers; our balance portfolio of channels, our broad product and solution suite and the impact of mix on our profitability. The first driver of our results, our balance portfolio of sales channels, helped us offset the impact of changes in some of our customers' focus and priorities. Corporate performance of 4.5% growth reflected the benefit of our channel balance. MedLar grew 3.1% as customers pivoted from last year's focus on client devices toward data center and other integrated solutions. MedLar solutions increased in mid-single digits while transactional sales declined low-single digits. Small business performance was more balanced between solutions and transactions with excellent growth across the board up 12.7%. Balance also contributed to public performance which was up 3.7% as government and education helped offset a 5% decline in healthcare. Healthcare results reflect the lumpiness we discussed last quarter as a handful of our largest customers shifted their focus to reducing cost as part of merger consolidations. We also saw continuation of budget compression given the ongoing reimbursement pressure. Government results were excellent up 13.5% reflecting the overlap of last year's decline in federal and solid state and local performance. Education increased 6.8% reflecting high teens growth in higher ed and low-single digit growth in K-12. As expected, K-12 buying activity slowed in the quarter as school district shifted focus to spring common core testing as well as completing E-Rate funds applications. Higher ed delivered excellent increases as we helped campuses across the country meet increasing demands for wireless. ATS increased low-double digits driven by increases in managed services like remote network monitoring and field services. While Canada showed continued momentum in local currency growing high-single digits in Canadian dollars given currency impact, Canadian results were down mid-single digits in U.S. dollars resulting in our other results line declining just under 1%. The second driver of results was our broad product and solutions suite backed by deep technical resources which helped us make sure our customer priorities are CDW's priorities. This quarter customer focus shifted from desktop refresh towards integrated solutions. Our solutions business grew more than 50% faster than transactional business. While the sales cycle is longer for solutions, solutions sales take us deeper into our customers IT infrastructure, this leads to richer relationships and sticker customers. On a net sales basis, hardware was up 4.3% and services increased 12.1% while software was essentially flat. Excellent low-double digit increases in notebook and mobile devices were partially offset by a fairly sharp decline in desktops as customers XP refresh waned. Overall client devices increased low-single digits. On the solutions side, we saw continued momentum in servers which improved for the fifth quarter in a row, up low-double digits as customers continued to refresh compute as the end of Win 2003 nears as well as meet their overall need for compute capabilities. Overall storage was down low-single digits as rapid growth in several emerging technology solutions including Flash was more than offset by a fairly steep decline in solutions from one major partner. In fact all of our top storage partners had increases in the quarter except one. Networking also had solid mid-single digit growth. Our ability to meet both transactional and integrated solution needs of our customers is one of the fundamental reasons for our consistent performance, and that's why we are laser focused on making sure we have the right product portfolio backed by extensive technical resources. This is a key point of differentiation for us and the marketplace. Let me share a couple of recent examples that demonstrate how this works? As you know security is an increasingly important area for our customers, in fact security was a bright spot in our solutions practice this quarter with security, hardware, software and service revenues up more than 30%. Our expertise in this area was a key reason why we won a fairly complex project for a major beverage company. The company wanted to replace an outdated wireless infrastructure with a scalable solution that would provide robust security and visibility. That required the ability to provide levels of differentiated network access for (8:48) assets, nonstandard and guest assets. Convenience and flexibility to provide secure access for guest were also a key requirement. Finally, given the complexity of solution, the customer wanted turnkey project management expertise. By bringing in solution architects from our security, wireless and mobility practices as well as project management, we won the more than $3 million project. Another example of the value of our broad technical expertise is the data center solution we architected for a transportation company in the South East. This example also highlights how long the sales cycle can be for more complex sales. We first met with the prospect in late summer 2014. It was a fairly significant engagement, so there was heavy competition. It took five months to close the deal, but when we did, we became the customer's single source provider for an integrated solution that captured approximately $5 million in revenues across networking, security, server, storage, virtualization and services from three different vendor partners and our own CDW services team. That was just one engagement that helped drive our overall services growth of 12% in the quarter. Services performance reflected excellent managed and field services growth including the impact from two new markets last year. On the software side, SaaS growth continued robust. Although SaaS sales were up meaningfully in the quarter, given sales are recorded net they also compressed top-line growth. The impact of SaaS combined with lower growth in certain licensed products resulted in total software sales essentially flat for the quarter, but once again gross profit from software increased at a faster rate than sales, contributing to our overall gross margin improvement. And that leads us to the final driver of our results this quarter, the impact of mix on our profitability. An essential element of our long-term success has been our ability to consistently deliver profitable growth. This quarter's results provide an excellent example of how the mix of our business influences our ability to achieve this goal. The combination of improved profitability in notebooks with higher contribution from 100% gross margin revenues which we call net service contract revenue or NSCR helped us achieve a gross profit margin of 16.6% in the quarter, the highest level in seven quarters. Net service contract revenue includes hardware warranties, software maintenance, third party delivered service and Software-as-a-Service. What all of these have in common is that while we have the customer relationship and sell the solution, it is delivered by one of our vendor or third-party partners, so we book the revenues net without a cost of goods sold attached. Since it is booked net, NSCR is 100% gross margin. As you know, we have made significant investments in our cloud practice to ensure we have the broadest portfolio of SaaS, IaaS and Platform-as-a-Service. So for us, cloud is not only a great growth opportunity and one that ensures we stay relevant to our customers; it enhances our profit mix. We have also been making investments to capture more margin-rich net service contract revenue from warranties and assurance, including our 2013 investment in a team of co-workers focused 100% on hardware warranties. The team is tasked with improving both attach and renewal rates for hardware warranties from a specific partner. Over the past 12 months that team helped generate 50% more gross profit than was produced the year before the investment was made. Delivering long-term sustainable profitable growth requires a constant focus on the balance between expense management and investment. The largest investment we make is adding new customer-facing co-workers to enhance our capabilities to deliver a broad spectrum of IT solutions that includes cloud, mobility, data center, virtualization, collaboration, networking and security just to name a few. We began 2015 with more than 140 additional customer-facing co-workers than we had at the beginning of 2014. To ensure we effectively utilized capacity from the new hires made last year, we continue the pause we began late last year, adding only 15 customer-facing co-workers in the quarter. We intend to continue to invest prudently to ensure we have the capacity to support acceleration in our solution sales. As we shared with you last quarter, we continue to plan for an additional 150 to 200 customer-facing co-workers during 2015. But, just as we always do, we will monitor the marketplace and adjust our hiring plans up or down as needed. And that leads to our expectations for the rest of the year. We look for K-12 to improve as we move through the year, now that Common Core testing is complete and E-Rate funds begin to flow. I'm very pleased to report that CDW was named as partner in both the highest number of requests and largest dollar amount of request for all Form 471s filed for E-Rate Category Two services, which are for internal network connections. These are official requests where the applicant identifies the specific products and solutions they will use and names the partner they intend to use. There's no guarantee that these requests will convert to revenue, but we feel good about where we are positioned. Schools should start spending approved funds this summer, and the bulk of spending occurring in the fall. We expect healthcare results will remain lumpy throughout 2015, as our larger customers continue to focus on cost savings and integration from recent mergers and budgets remain under pressure from lower reimbursements. Healthcare remains an important part of our long-term growth strategy as providers look to technology to help them deliver more effective and efficient care. We expect federal to be a strong contributor to full-year results despite tough comparisons at the end of the year, and in our corporate business, we expect MedLar to see benefit from a building pipeline as earlier customer conversations play out and small business to continue to execute well, although we remain watchful for any signs of slowdown due to concerns over economic conditions. Given these expectations, we remain committed to our target of delivering profitable growth in 2015 and the achievement of our medium term annual target of growing 200 basis points to 300 basis points above the U.S. IT market, holding our margins in the mid 7% range and growing earnings in the mid teen. You may recall that on our last call we indicated, we've looked for the U.S. IT market growth in the 3% to 4% range. Now let me turn it over to Ann, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, we had a good start to the year as we successfully addressed transitioning customer priority and leverage the strength of our business model to deliver excellent profitability on solid top-line growth. Turning to our P&L, if you've access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide seven. Net sales were $2.76 billion, 3.9% higher than last year. Average daily sales were $43.7 million, on a sequential average daily sales basis, sales were down 9.7% versus Q4, 2014 below recent Q1seasonality. While sales in Canadian dollars are a relatively small portion of our total revenue less than 5%, the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted consolidated net sales by approximately 60 basis points in the quarter. This compares to Q4 and full year 2014 impact of 40 basis points. Gross profit for the quarter increased 7.4% to $456.5 million. Gross margin in the quarter was 16.6%, 60 basis points above last year. Improvement was primarily the result of four factors; first, higher product margin which is primarily driven by improved notebook margins reflecting the impact of fewer large low margin refresh project as well as mix into higher margin notebook. Second, the positive impact of higher margin advanced technology services which grew faster than overall sales and third, the higher mix of net service contract revenues which are booked at a 100% gross margin including roughly 10 basis points from the higher mix of SaaS. Keep in mind that this reflects mix. This Q1 product sales and associated margin growth was substantially slower than last year, although net service contract revenue was still relatively small, its year-over-year impact this quarter is magnified. As product growth reaccelerate, the net service contract revenue mix impact on gross margin will subside. The last factor that benefited gross margin with the absence of prior year inventory adjustment which added approximately 10 basis points. As you may recall from my comments on last year's first quarter call, gross margin was negatively impacted by inventory adjustments which included a reserve for a large shipment that was received by our customer frozen. While this particular circumstance certainly was unusual, in the normal course of business, we have both positive and negative inventory adjustments all the time. Typically they about balance out. But from time-to-time, we have either a more positive or more negative impact like we did this quarter, and by the way we did receive payment from our insurer for the frozen product late in 2014, so we reversed the reserve in Q4 and growth margin benefited. Reported SG&A including advertising expense was $304.9 million, 5.3% higher than last year, attributable to a higher coworker count and other coworker related cost such as health benefit. We ended the quarter with 7,254 coworkers up 214 coworkers since the end of Q1 2014. Net advertising expense increased by 3% or $0.9 million in the quarter versus last year. As you can see on the next slide, slide eight, our adjusted SG&A including advertising was $246.8 million, up 6.1% over last year. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter excludes $4.7 million of non-cash equity based compensation and other adjustments including historical retention cost and cost related to the plant consolidation of our leased offices North of Chicago. To make it easier to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our gross profit less adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. Slide nine shows our Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter up $210.8 million, up 8.8%. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.7% up 35 basis points versus last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was higher than anticipated as we build our plans and managed our cost structure as we always do to an expected mix of sales in a normalized gross margin level. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 10, interest expense was 10.7% lower than last year at $44.8 million and we continue to benefit from refinancing activities completed this past year. Continuing down the P&L, you see our other income net line where we report our Kelway minority interest income. The majority of this line is Kelway but other income net also includes other de minimis item. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate was 37.1% compared to 37% in last year's Q1, which resulted in a tax expense of $32.3 million versus $29.9 million last year. On a GAAP basis, we earned $54.7 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance was $97.6 million in the quarter up 20.3% over last year. As you can see on slide 11, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add backs that fall in four general buckets; the ongoing amortization of acquisition related intangibles, any non-recurring costs related to financing including debt extinguishment, ongoing non-cash equity based compensation and other one-time non-recurring income or expenses. These adjustments are tax-affected at statutory rate of 39%. With Q1 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $173.5 million, we delivered $0.56 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 19.5% over the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 12, on March 31, we had $447.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $2.8 billion, $106.9 million less than a year ago. Net debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 3.0 times within our target range. During the quarter, we issued a new $525 million senior note facility at 5% and redeemed all the outstanding $503.9 million of our 8.5% senior notes. With this new issue, our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.5%. We did incur an extra $3.6 million of interest on the amount redeemed as the redemption required 30 days notice. As a reminder, over 96% of our outstanding debt is effectively fixed or hedged as we have $1.4 billion of interest rate caps in place. We believe rates would have to move significantly before they have a material impact on our interest cost. As you can see on slide 13, we maintained strong rolling three-months working capital during Q1. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 1 day versus last year's first quarter and at the low end of our target range. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditure was $125.4 million compared to $230.6 million in Q1 of 2014. As you recall, our free cash flow was higher than expected in Q4 of last year due to approximately $100 million of one-time items and timing. And just as I indicated on last quarter's call, these items reversed in Q1. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $4.3 million and cash interest was $53.1 million up $37 million over last year reflecting an incremental $20 million associated with the April refinance of our outstanding 8.5% note and the inclusion of cash interest payments, we now make on the 6% note we issued in 2014 of another $19 million. Our priorities for uses of cash remain consistent with our capital allocation strategy and will depend on market conditions and opportunities. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you can see on slide 14. First, to increase dividends annually with the goal to hit a payout of 30% of free cash flow over the next five years. For Q2, we will pay a dividend of $0.0675 per share on June 10 to shareholders of record May 25 which represents a 59% increase from a year ago. Second, to ensure we have the right capital structure in place and we have set a target to generally maintained net-debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended Q1 at 3 times. There is supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisition. As a reminder, we structured the Kelway transaction to provide CDW the right but not the obligation to acquire up to 100% ownership in Kelway. The option to purchase the remaining stake in Kelway runs from June 2015 through June 2017 and forced to return excess cash after dividends in M&A to shareholders via share repurchases for which we currently have $500 million authorization. As a reminder, we're committed at a minimum to buying back enough shares to offset dilution from our equity plan which we expect to be roughly 2 million shares this year on a weighted average shares outstanding basis. Now that we have refinanced the remaining 8.5% note that had tighter restricted payment limitation, we have more flexibility to be in the market. As a reminder our repurchase authorization is structured to permit us to buy along with any secondary that our sponsors may do. Our capital allocation priority support our medium term targets which you see on slide 15. We continued to target growth of 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market, delivering an Adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid 7% range and through 2015 delivering mid teens non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Our mid teens EPS target for 2015 includes the benefit of share repurchases and equity investment income from our 35% investment in Kelway. Now that we have concluded the initial refinancings of our high cost debt, we will start to see the absence of earnings amplification from lower interest expense. Starting in 2016 through 2018, our new medium term targets offer low-double digit EPS growth. Share repurchases and accretive acquisitions will continue to amplify operating results and help achieve this target. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our current and refresh medium targets on an annual and not a quarterly basis. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those of you modeling the rest of our 2015 financials. I am on slide 16. Based on Q1 results and expectations for the rest of year, we continue to expect the balance of sales between first and second half to be generally consistent with normal seasonality, which has averaged in the range of 47% to 48% to 52% to 53% weighted towards the back half of the year. We expect gross margin percentage to be lighter in the balance of the year without the impact of one-time item and mix benefit including from net service contract revenue we experienced in Q1. We also expect SG&A to grow faster than sales in Q2 as we continue to invest in our business. Since we don't build our plans for one-time impacts to gross profit margin which can be both positive and negative, the key to understanding our profitability is to focus on our Adjusted EBITDA margin that is what we do. We manage our cost to normalize sales and leverage our variable cost structure, and for 2015, we continue to target Adjusted EBITDA in the mid-7% range. Reflecting the impact of refinancing the balance of our 8.5% senior notes due 2019 during the quarter, we expect full-year book interest to now be in the $157 million to $159 million range. For our other income line, although Kelway delivered excellent results in Q1, given the seasonality of their business where our first quarter is their year-end and their busiest quarter, we expect lower contribution for the remainder of our year. We continue to look for our 2015 book tax rate to be in the 37% to 38% range. Finally a few notes for those of you modeling cash flow. Our capital expenditures, which tend to run 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis, will be higher in 2015 at approximately 0.7% of net sales as a result of gross capital investments we are making related to consolidating our headquarters and sales locations north of Chicago. Adjusting for the impact in Q1 of the approximately $100 million that moved to Q4 2014, we continue to expect 2015 free cash flow to be at the high end of our target range of 2.5% to 3% of net sales. Keep in mind that our second quarter tends to be the lightest cash flow quarter of the year. This reflects both our payment of estimated cash taxes for the first and second quarter and increasing working capital needs to support what is typically our highest quarterly sequential sales increase. While we've made excellent progress in managing our working capital, we do not expect to stay in our current cash conversion cycle level, while we should look for us to maintain our cycle within our target range of the low to mid-20s for 2015. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 39% range to be applied to pre-taxable income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $40 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually related to the cancelation of debt income we incurred in 2009. That concludes the financial summary. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up? Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Good morning. Ann and Tom, if I apply normal seasonality for the second quarter, which is typically up I think around mid-teens sequentially, and then use your roughly 48%-52% split for first half, second half, I get roughly $12.5 billion in revenue for 2015, which is up about 3.5% year over year. So if that math is roughly right, can you just reconcile that with your goal of growing 200 to 300 basis points above the market and just indicate whether your market assumptions have changed from the 3% to 4% range you gave a quarter ago? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, good morning, Brian, it's Tom. So let me answer the last part first. The market assumptions haven't changed. We still think the market's going to be in the 3% to 4% and as I stated, we're committed to outgrowing the market by 200 to 300 basis points. I think one of the things that people need to keep in mind is while I think there will be some sense of normal seasonality, the uniqueness of last year, because of the client refresh and the impact on the business, I think will make comparing normal seasonality a little unusual this year. Just because as you heard us talk about the shifting priorities of customers moving from transactional back to client. So \u2013 and also I alluded to a number of things that I think will accelerate some of our top-line performance. As an example the K-12 organization and the success in E-Rate as we go through the rest of the year. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right, thanks. And just a follow up will just be on Kelway. It sounded like you were very pleased with the results in the quarter, but there's maybe some positive seasonality to the business. Just any more color on the operating performance? I know it's early in the relationship, but just how is the relationship going relative to your expectation? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Your assessment is accurate. We are pleased, although it's still relatively early in the process, but Kelway continues to perform well. We're very encouraged by as we get closer and work closer together about the way we're going to be able to serve multinational customers. And I would tell you that it's going as planned at this point. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, okay. Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Tom, I was hoping to get a little more detail on your thoughts about the PC business, obviously we had a refresh last year, and now we're seeing some weakness on the desktop side, but are you hearing anything from your customers or suppliers about their expectations for the second half of the year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hi, Sherri, good morning. Thanks for the question. I would tell you, I've said this to our team, I think the PC business for us feels like it felt in 2013 and 2012 which is, you know, when I think people were reporting the death of the PC business for us, it continued to be a good growth category because of our exclusive focus on B2B. And that's, it feels like that's where we are again. If you heard me talk about our notebooks and mobile device growth that was, we had a good quarter. I think we're going to work our way through the desktop issue which really was driven by Windows XP. So \u2013 and I think I talked about this last quarter, we wouldn't expect to repeat the kind of exponential tailwind we had last year in the client business. Having said that, we still expect the PC business to be a good part of our growth profile for this year. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just following up on the previous question, thinking about gross longer term as you shift to more of these cloud services businesses and other things that are 100% gross margin, how do you think that affects your long-term growth profile, how much of a percentage of your business is that now and is that a drag for you? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: It's still a relatively small part. When you think of the $12 billion company, but it's an increasing part as customers look to implement what we have said for a while is hybrid solutions to their computing needs so to speak. I would say, again I would point back to the profile for this year feels like the profile of 2013, where we had real balance between client devices and solutions, and had the kind of growth trajectory that I think we're talking about this year. I don't envision while we had a really strong quarter from a gross profit perspective and both Ann and I alluded to some of the reasons why. At this point, I wouldn't say it is so big that it is going to be a meaningful pressure on our top-line growth. I think the bigger challenge as many of you pointed out to me in the first quarter will be just jumping the comps that we had from last year's phenomenal season is part of the challenge this year. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Sherri. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, this is Mitch Steves filling in for Amit here. I just had a quick question in terms of your debt level. So you guys are already at 3 times, so does that imply that you guys are going to do some refinancing or keep the debt levels where they are going forward? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Hey, (34:58). We've said that our target ratio is about 2.5 to 3 times. We're at 3 times. We have finished the refinancing of all the high cost debt at this point, so I wouldn't expect us to be doing any refinancings over the short to medium term, and we do expect to maintain our leverage ratio in the 2.5 to 3 times range. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it and then on the gross margin side, so since you guys are guiding it to essentially decline a little bit, is that going to be more of a mix issue or revenue deleveraging or how do I think about that for the next, call it three quarters. Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: It is more of a mix issue as well as I called out in my remarks, we did have a one-time item that benefited us in the quarter, so that obviously wont reoccur, in fact it will reverse in the fourth quarter and then the other items are more attributable to mix. The mix into net service contract revenue in the quarter because net service contract revenues grew at a higher rate than product, you don't see that impact on the top line, but you do see it in the gross profit line and again as product growth accelerates a bit as we move through the year that mix impact will dissipate. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it and just real quick to clarify, so for the one-time item in the gross margin, what was the impact on the percentage there? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: It was 10 basis points. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : 10 basis points, okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, good morning. Just on the \u2013 a question on the solutions side, any comments or call out on average deal size, it sounds like it could be expanding, so just trying to get some color on that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, it would be tough to give you the perspective and dimensionalize average deal size. I think you heard me give you a couple of examples in the text about those kind, but not all solutions are that complex and of that magnitude. I think the best way to think about it is they tend to be more margin rich as we think about the solutions business, I think that played out a little bit this quarter and will play out as we kind of mix back into a more balanced approach between transactional and solutions. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got you. And so just to clarify again on the last comment, did you change in anyway your outlook for the year in terms of transactional versus solutions growth? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I don't think we gave an outlook on transactional versus solutions. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: When we talk about it, we just generally talk about our commitment to outgrow the IT market by 200 to 300 basis points, and I think one of the things Ann just alluded to, you know, we would expect the hardware business to accelerate a little bit from what we saw in the first quarter and that will help drive top-line growth but it also then puts a little more pressure on the margin. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thank you. Good work on the margins. Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. In your remarks, you mentioned that you're watchful of the impact of economic conditions on the small business segment. I just wonder if you can give us some more context given that that segment actually accelerated in terms of growth in the first quarter. So I guess what drove the acceleration in Q1 and why would you be watchful for the remainder of the year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Katy. Good morning. Couple of things. One, if you think about small business, they started to accelerate the middle of last year and had a strong quarter in the third and fourth quarter. It obviously continued from an execution standpoint but the reason I make that comment is because that group probably sooner than any other group recognizes anything that we see as kind of an economic shift whether it's a change in consumption, a reaction to interest rate and so we probably look at them closer when it comes to what's going on with the economy. So it was just the kind of keep that out there as we kind of see how the economy plays out for the rest of the year and what happens with as I said interest rate and what impact that might have. That's kind of the reference. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And as you noted, you're happy with the Kelway results. Can you remind us what the factors are that would influence you to potentially hit the option of acquiring the full business earlier in the timeline versus later in the June 15 to June 17 timeline? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I don't think we laid out a set of factors, Katy. When we talked about the acquisition, part of the reason we structured it the way we did was the kind of follow the typical CDW measured and thoughtful approach to looking at something as significant as this type of acquisition. Like I said, we're pleased with how things have started. You know it will be a function of how CDW is doing, how we feel about our readiness to do the integration, how Kelway is doing? All of those things kind of enter into doing one of these type of things successfully and that's our most important priority. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, got it thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, thanks, Katy. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great thank you, good morning. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hi, Jay. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I'll ask on data, data center. Storage was down, and it sounds like that was one partner driven, are you comfortable with how you're positioned broadly going forward in storage? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, really, really comfortable. If you heard the preamble to that lots of growth in the, what I'll call the newer technologies, disruptive technologies, you heard me mention flash, you also heard me mention that 7 out of our 8 top partners grew. So feel really good about that. And I think if you look back, I was looking at it yesterday at our storage performance, it's been kind of lumpy, it kind of \u2013 we'll have a really good quarter then we'll have a flat quarter and I think some of that is just the shifting that's going on in the storage marketplace both with the incumbents and the new entrants, and as you know, Jayson, we bring on a meaningful number of new partners every year, a lot of those partners have been in the storage space and so you've got little bit of a transformation going on. And then you couple that with the success of converged infrastructure and the impact that has, it's no wonder that it's kind of got this inconsistent behavior at this point. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, that makes sense and then elsewhere in the data center, it looks like server and network is a little more predictable, a little more visibility? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I would say, I don't know about predictability and visibility, I will say the performance has been more consistent. If you think about it, like I said, I think we've had five quarters of improvement in our server performance, and you know, lot of that is us being very focused on that part of the marketplace, a lot of it is the Win 2003 expiration and the little bit of tailwind that gives you \u2013 and if you look at net comp for us, it has been one of if not the most steady product set of the data center that we've had. They have been a pretty steady performer, I think back to almost two years to three years now. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Jayson. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks. I wanted to get a bit more color on that net service contract revenue just to make sure I'm understanding it on a go-forward basis. I guess, how should we think about the magnitude of that contribution of gross margin? Is it something we should assume is a naturally lumpy stream, and I guess for this quarter, was it larger than expected on an absolute basis or was it really just a mix dynamic as you mentioned with the products coming in a bit \u2013 or transactional coming in a bit lower? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: In terms of the magnitude, the dollar amount that it contributes to gross margin or gross profit \u2013 to gross profit, that's relatively consistent, it's a good, steady grower, quarter in and quarter out. This quarter, it grew more rapidly than our product gross profit, and therefore it had an outsized contribution in the growth and was therefore \u2013 it was really a mix impact that you were seeing. William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: But it is a good steady grower. We do expect it to continue to grow and contribute to gross profit. William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. And then the relative strength you're seeing in small business, I just want to clarify. Could you highlight whether that includes accelerating strength in PCs and across the transactional segments as well? I understand that you're seeing the solutions activity and it's balanced, but are you still seeing accelerating strength across the client side as well within small business? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, we did see growth in client but it was balanced with equal amount of strength in our solution business, Bill, which was really encouraging. When we get that kind of balance, it really enables us to not only expand or maintain the margins that you just talked about with Ann but also gives us a level of consistency. William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Tom, I had a couple questions. On the healthcare side, can you give us a sense of what's going on? Clearly, I mean, we had Obamacare from last year, there was some pause. We get the sense that people are kind of rushing towards embracing digital technologies, a lot of chaos in the IT systems. So clearly there's a very positive trend. So trying to reconcile some of your commentary. And as the year progresses, how does it play out? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think \u2013 what you say is true. I think technology will be an important part of some of the efficiencies and effectiveness. But at least in our customer base, we've had a number of mergers. And that's not, I don't think unique to our customer base. And when those mergers happen, you're going through the process of integrating the two companies and trying to create synergies and cut costs, and I think when that happens that becomes an important priority for the business. That isn't to say, as I tried to allude to, that we don't think that when that dust settles that we'll continue to see healthcare as a growth segment for CDW. The second was, look, everybody's under the, what I would call the pressure of the reimbursement process, the demonstration of meaningful use when it comes to technologies, and I don't think that is going away. That I think will be a consistent for all healthcare organizations. So when I think about our healthcare business for this year, I think, I wish I had a more articulate word than \"lumpy,\" but I think that's what it's going to be. I think it's going to bounce around. We're going to have quarters where we do better than other quarters. But I continued to maintain that long term that is a growth segment for us, because in spite of how well it's done, we still have a relatively small market share in this segment, and therefore the opportunities are really significant. That was really reinforced recently at the HIMSS conference with the number of people that we talked to and their excitement about ways in which CDW can help them. I just think it's going to be a little bit of a lumpy market for the rest of this year. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good. And, Tom, as a follow-up, when you look at the commentary by some of the IT service providers, whether it's the Cognizants, (47:26) and everything. Clearly there's been a very material shift in their commentary where they're talking about budgets really freezing, reallocation towards digital solutions. We're seeing some of that in your results, too. But can you walk us through \u2013 if client budget are frozen and they're talking about not even expanding it, how does it percolate down to you, this whole shift towards digital? Is that shift good enough for you to offset some of the headwinds? Well, this quarter we saw some of the positive impacts by that. But just walk us through qualitatively how you're looking at the remainder of the year with some of these kind of budget freezes going on across the board? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'll tell you, I'll answer that the same way I've answered it with my sales leaders. While there are budget freezes, those budget freezes are on top of budget growth that has happened for the last two or three years. So there still, I think, represents a significant amount of spend out there for us to kind of go after and help customers with. What I worry about is when budget freezes turn into budget reductions, because then that reduces the market opportunity. So at this point, we still believe based on my comments about our growth for the year that there's a significant opportunity out there for CDW, and despite the fact that we're the largest player of our type by a meaningful factor in the marketplace, we still only have 5% to 6% share of our addressable market. So feel comfortable there's enough opportunity out there at least at this point. Now again as I answered Katy's question, you got to kind of monitor what goes on with the economy and as one example clearly we had customers impacted this quarter by the foreign exchange issue and you just got to look at that and how does that impact their decisions going forward. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great thanks a lot, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Tom Richards for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you again to everybody for taking the time and joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest and your questions. And as I always say, if you need some help with your technology, CDW is more than happy to help, and you know, how to get hold of me, and the last thing is, it's a big weekend for everybody, so Happy Mother's Day out there to all you moms, see you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

I also want to remind you this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. So with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. Second quarter results were strong and I'm pleased to report that we once again reached all-time records for three key financial metrics. Net sales rose 6.7% to $3.3 billion and 7.2% adjusted for currency. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4% to $268 million and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 20.1% to $0.81. This quarter's results reflect combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, our breadth of product offerings, particularly our ability to bring innovative, emerging technologies to our customers and the success of our three-part strategy. Let me walk through how each contributed to performance. First, our balanced portfolio of customer channels. On a segment basis, corporate grew 6.3% with medium/large business up 6.9% and small business up 3.3%. We saw balanced growth in MedLar, with solutions and transactional sales increasing at similar rates. Small business delivered excellent growth in solutions, including continuing growth in net service contract revenue from software-as-a-Service and warranties. While this did mute top line growth, gross profits grew faster within sales. Public increased 8.1%, driven by government up 22.9% with both federal and state and local delivering excellent results. Federal continues to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with new purchasing programs implemented by the government last year. We continue to have success in helping the government implement private cloud solutions, including the Navy's floating pilot (04:47) cloud program called CANES. Public safety continues to drive state and local results. Education increased 3.6%. K-12 delivered a mid-single digit increase as activities slowed especially on the network side as our customers waited before moving forward with projects until eRate rate funding commitment letters were in hand. Higher ed delivered a low single digit increase, bringing six months' growth to high single digit. Healthcare increased 2.7% as we continue to see the impact of consolidation in the marketplace. Our other results line, which includes Canada and advanced technology solutions was essentially flat as a mid-teens increase in advanced technology solutions was dampened by currency impact on our Canadian results, while Canada was up high single digits in local currency and U.S. dollar sales were down mid-single digit. The second driver of our performance was the breadth of our product offering and our ability to bring innovative, emerging technologies to our customers. With over 100,000 products, services and solutions from over 1,000 vendor partners, we remain well-positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. Staying relevant to our customers is critical for value proposition and one way we do that is by bringing on between 15 and 16 new partners each year. This constant refresh of our portfolio is one of the key ways we outperformed the overall market and you see the impact of this in our second quarter performance. Overall, hardware sales increased 8%. Customer demand for the clients' license was strong, up high single digits. As expected, customers added notebooks and mobile devices at a good clip and sales increased by low double digits, while desktop sales declined, although at a lower rate than last quarter. The impact of new technologies was clearly implied here as more than half of the notebook and mobile device growth came from a recently introduced form factor. We also continued to benefit from Chromebook sales to support Common Core testing. Also as expected, solutions growth accelerated and was more than two times faster than transactional coverage. Solutions focused products delivered excellent results with both net comp and servers up double digit. Once again we experienced strong growth in emerging technologies. Storage grew mid-single digits with emerging technology growth more than offsetting decline in more traditional categories. In total, revenues from flash products grew more than triple digits. Software sales increased 5% reflecting strong security and storage performance. Gross profit from software increased at a higher rate, reflecting higher contribution from sales that are booked net like warranties, cloud and agency sales. Services increased 9% driven by excellent increases in configurations, managed services and field-based services. The final driver of our second quarter performance was the success we've had executing our three-part strategy, which is to first capture market share from existing and new customers. Second, expand our solutions suite. Third, build our services capability. Capturing market share has been and will continue to be a core competency of CDW. We know the power of the disciplined approach we take towards driving productivity, programs like book management and category penetration programs and we continuously refine and enhance them. Our teams continue to find ways to work together with our partners. One great example is with our new customer acquisition program where nine partners joined forces to collectively equip our sellers to call our new customers that had zero business with both us and the partner. The result, our sellers added nearly 3,000 new customers to both our partners and CDW in the second quarter from this program alone. That proved win-win-win for our customers, partners and CDW. Our second strategy is to continuously expand our solutions capabilities. By doing so, we've remained relevant to our customers and capture sources of growth across the IT landscape. Security is a great example of this. You can't open a newspaper today, if that's even still how you get your news, without seeing some security breach reported. Because of the investments we have made in our dedicated security practice, we can help our customers address this vital need and participate in one of the fastest growing areas in technology. In fact, the security practice was our fastest growing solutions practice, up more than 30%. It is not coincidental that security partners represent the largest category of new partners we have added in the last five years. This quarter revenues from new security partners added in the last five years were up over 70%. To help continue our momentum in this area, last week we introduced security Threat Check Version 2, our next-generation solution that enables small businesses and midsize businesses to assess security threat in a cost effective and scalable manner. Version 2 is another great example of how we work together with our partners to create win-win-win solutions. We introduced security Threat Check in 2013. Version 1 helped hundreds of customers identify and address security risks. Working with our initial partner and two new partners, Version 2 provides state-of-the-art testing for network intrusion, internal systems vulnerability and infected files, and because protecting against security threat takes more than technology, the new solution also includes consulting on enhanced internal processes. We just launched Version 2 last week and expect that it will help us stay ahead of the curve and continue to capture above market growth. Another way we will continue to capture above market growth is through our third strategic priority, which is to continue to build our services capabilities. Services capabilities are an integral component of many high end solution sales. We continued to judiciously invest in the capabilities required to deliver services. Just last week, we opened our national Enterprise Command Center. The ECC is a state-of-the-art network operations center that provides 24x7 capabilities. This enables us to deliver advanced managed services so our customers can take advantage of emerging technologies, like our recently announced managed services offering for Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Office 365 as well as VMware vCloud Air. Once again, this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence in our ability to deliver consistent, sustainable profitable growth and cash flow. This confidence underpins our capital allocation strategy. Our capital allocation strategy is focused on providing both near-term and long-term returns to shareholders while ensuring we continue to invest in our future. Reflecting this balanced approach, we have four capital priorities. First, increase dividends annually; second, ensure we have the right capital structure; third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions and fourth, return excess cash, after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchase. Today's announcement of the acquisition of the remaining 65% of Kelway fits squarely within this framework. Our acquisition of Kelway is a natural extension of our long history of following the customer. Over the past several years, we have been increasingly asked to help our U.S.-based customers with their international IT requirements. Just over two years ago, we performed a thorough analysis and determined the best approach at the time to meet these needs was through referrals and we entered into a strategic relationship with Kelway. Last November, we took a 35% minority position in Kelway. Over the past two years, this relationship has delivered excellent results, that's because having the ability to bill in multiple currencies, deliver products and services locally and manage complex international tax requirements is no small task. Working with Kelway, they helped us meet these challenges and gave us a seat at the table for deals that we would otherwise have lost; deals that often had a small overall percentage of international revenues but represented significant U.S. opportunity. A great example of how we've been able to work together via our referral relationship is the solution we provided to a technology company with offices around the world. Because of Kelway's ability to deliver solutions to Asia Pacific, we were able to help the customer establish a new data center in Singapore. We customized the hardware and services and met the customer's currency and tax requirements. Extending our great U.S. relationship with this customer to include Asia Pacific led to an incremental $10 million order for CDW. Let me share a quick snapshot of Kelway. Kelway has nearly 1,000 coworkers and was founded in 1990. It's one of the leading integrated technology services and solution companies in the U.K. focused on the mid-market similar to CDW. Also, similar to CDW, approximately two-thirds of its coworkers are customer-facing, and they are very customer-focused. One way Kelway has delivered on this promise is by providing solutions and services to their U.K.-based customers' international locations through cross-border supply chain relationships. Roughly 10% of Kelway's sales are derived outside of the U.K. Headquartered in London, Kelway has regional offices around the U.K. and locations in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. They also provide data center capabilities in the U.K. As of March 31, 2015, which is their fiscal year end, at today's currency rates and on a U.S. GAAP basis, Kelway generated roughly $850 million in revenues. When we made our initial investment, we identified several key benefits for this transaction. Our due diligence over the past eight months validated our initial investment thesis, whether it was meeting with customers both in the U.S. and U.K., who told us how much they valued a simplified approach to solving their international IT requirements or the annual accounts audit or our review of Kelway's data center capabilities, every check we made confirmed our expectations. At its very core CDW is about meeting the needs of customers, better than anyone else, and Kelway enhances our ability to do that. Kelway provides our customers with international technical expertise, localized (15:55) solutions and accelerates our ability to profitably grow our core business through increased share of wallet of existing and new U.S. and U.K. multinational customers. Most importantly, as I said when we announced the first step; whenever you make an investment in another business, culture is the key determinant of its success. Having worked with Kelway as a strategic partner for nearly 18 months at the time we made the first step investment, we thought their values, culture and value proposition to customers and vendor partners was very much aligned with ours. Now having worked with them for over two years, we are more convinced than ever that this is the case. It's a great fit all around and as I've said before, if you close your eyes and ignore the accent, you think you are talking to a CDW coworker. You may recall that we structured our initial investment last November with a call option to purchase the rest of the company over a 24-month period beginning in June. The terms of the call were based on Kelway's performance. During the last eight months, Kelway's top line and profit (17:02) performance continued the improvement that began when we first entered into the referral relationship with them, making now the right time for us to acquire the balance of the company. This way, we capture ongoing earnings and value creation benefits. As is our practice, we will take a measured approach to integration. Initially, Kelway will operate as a standalone CDW business. Teams are in place and work is already underway to determine the steps necessary to create a seamless one company experience. There will be much more to come as we make progress on the plan, but as we do, we'll reap the benefits from consolidating 100% of their results. Ann will provide more detail on how consolidating their results will impact our performance, but before I turn the call over to Ann, let me leave you with a few comments on hiring and our expectations for organic growth for the remainder of the year. During the quarter we continued the pause on hiring we put in place late last year to absorb the capacity we created when we added 140 customer-facing coworkers in 2014. This pause, coupled with our natural attrition, resulted in a decline of about 15 customer-facing coworkers since the beginning of the year. To make sure we invest ahead of future growth, we have re-ignited our hiring and now expect to add between 100 and 150 customer-facing coworkers in 2015. In fact, the Sales Academy class that just started in July has over 40 sellers. As we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust our hiring plans as appropriate. Given the first half market performance, our current view of the 2015 U.S. IT market growth is for it to come in at the low end of the 3% to 4% range we shared earlier in the year. We continue to target organic top line growth between 200 basis points and 300 basis points above the market. Now let me turn it over to Ann. Ann? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our second quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels and our breadth of product offerings, particularly our ability to bring innovative, emerging technologies to our customers and the ongoing success of our three-part strategy. They also reflect the progress we are making against our financial strategy to deliver double digit earnings growth, drive strong cash flow and return cash to shareholders. Let me begin with our P&L. If you have access to the slide posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 11. Top line growth was strong this quarter with net sales of $3.31 billion, 6.7% higher than last year on both the reported and average daily sales basis. Average daily sales were $51.8 million. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales were up 18.4% versus Q1 2015, which is well above normal seasonality. While sales in Canadian dollars are a relatively small portion of our total revenue, less than 5%, the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced consolidated net sales in the quarter by approximately 50 basis points. Gross profit for the quarter increased 7.6% to $534.5 million. Given product growth acceleration from Q1, as expected, gross margin declined on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was up 10 basis points. The impact of a higher mix of revenues reported at 100% gross margin, such as our net service contract revenue and higher partner funding was partially offset by lower product margin due to a higher percentage of sales coming from larger order tiers. Reported SG&A, including advertising expense, was $328.6 million, up 6.5% over last year. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales compensation from higher growth in solutions related compensation paid to specialists and technical experts and overall growth in sales and gross profit. We ended the quarter with 7,278 coworkers, up 67 coworkers since the end of 2014 and up 127 coworkers since the end of last year's second quarter. Annualized sales per coworker were $1.82 million, up 4.2% over Q2 2014. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising was $267.6 million, up 6.7% over last year. Advertising expense increased 9.4%, as we continue to invest in the business. As you can see on the next slide, slide 12, adjusted SG&A for the quarter excludes $7.5 million of non-cash equity compensation, $1.4 million of acquisition and integration costs and $0.6 million of historical retention costs and other expenses to make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA which is essentially our gross profit plus adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. Our non-cash equity compensation expenses increased $3.2 million year-over-year primarily due to annual awards granted in Q1 for our long-term incentive plan. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $268 million, up 8.4% year-over-year, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%, up 10 basis points from last year's strong result. Let's look at the rest of the P&L on slide 13. Interest expense was 22% lower than last year at $37.8 million reflecting reductions driven by repayments and refinancing activities completed in 2014 and Q1 of this year. Our effective tax rate was 37.1% versus 36.9% in Q2 2014. On a GAAP basis, we earned $108.2 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income which better reflects our operating performance was $139 million in the quarter, up 20% over last year. As you can see on slide 14, non-GAAP net income reflected after-tax add backs in four general buckets; the ongoing amortization of acquisition related intangibles, ongoing non-cash equity compensation, acquisition and integration costs and other non-recurring income or expenses. These adjustments were tax affected at a statutory rate of 39%. With Q2 non-GAAP weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 172.5 million, we delivered $0.81 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 20.1% over the prior year. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $91.7 million under our previously announced $500 million repurchase program. 2 million shares were repurchased from our sponsors concurrent with their May offering and 0.5 million shares were repurchased on the open market. Turning to first half results on slide 15; revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 5.4% on both the reported and average daily sales basis as average daily sales grew to $47.8 million. On a constant currency basis, net sales were up 6%. Gross profit during the first half of 2015 was $991 million, up 7.5%. Gross profit margin was 16.3%, up 30 basis points from 2014. SG&A including advertising expense increased by $35.4 million or 5.9%. Adjusted EBITDA was $470.8 million (sic) [$478.8 million] (24:14), 8.6% of our first half 2014. Non-GAAP net Income for the first half of 2015 was $236.6 million versus $197 million in 2014, up 20.1% driven by our higher operating results and lower interest expense, which was down $16 million. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 16; on June 30, we had $335.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. We finished the quarter with $2.83 billion of net debt, $32.9 million less than our June 30, 2014 balance of $2.87 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.22 billion. Net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA at the end of Q2 was three times, 0.4 times less than Q2 2014. Our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is now 4.5%. In this potentially increasing interest rate environment, I would like to remind you that our $1.5 billion term loan facility is subject to a 1% LIBOR floor and we have in place $1.4 billion notional amount of interest rate cap at a weighted average rate of 2%, which don't expire until Q1 2017. Remainder of our outstanding debt is fixed rate. So approximately 97% of our outstanding debt is effectively fixed or hedged and rates would have to move significantly before they had a material impact on our interest costs. Free cash flow, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures, was negative $8.1 million for the quarter, better than last year's negative $20.7 million. Remember that Q2 is typically our lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we pay cash taxes for both Q1 and Q2 in the second quarter, and we typically have our highest sequential quarterly growth which drives working capital investment. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $119 million. Cash interest paid was $28 million, $56 million lower than Q2 2014. This reflected the redemption refinancing of our 8.5% notes previously paid semi-annually in April and October with 5% notes that will be paid in March and September. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was $363 million for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $316.1 for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014. While higher than normal sequential growth drove higher absolute working capital needs, as you can see on slide 17, we maintained strong rolling three-month metrics. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 19 days, which was flat compared to last year's second quarter. While pleased with this result, we don't expect to sustain this level and look for our cash conversion cycle to be within our target range of the low-20 days-s to mid-20 days-s for the remainder of the year. Turning to the rest of 2015, let me start with the impact Kelway will have on our results. I'm on slide 18. Starting with revenue; given our current expectations for Kelway, we anticipate the impact of consolidating revenues for the remainder of the year to add between 500 basis points and 600 basis points of incremental growth. Remember we will be consolidating five months at 100% with no revenues in July since we only held a minority interest at that point. Also keep in mind that Kelway sales and profit are calendar year front end loaded. For earnings, we expect Kelway to contribute between $0.06 per share and $0.08 per share on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of 2015. This assumes one month of 35% ownership and five months of 100% ownership and exchange rates consistent with current rate of $1.55 to the pound. Remember, this is non-GAAP earnings per share, so it doesn't include amortization of purchased intangibles or acquisition and integration costs or one-time gains and expenses. You see the impact of this on our expectations for consolidated results on slide 19. As Tom mentioned, we continue to target organic growth 200 basis points to 300 basis points above U.S. IT growth which we expect to be at the low end of the 3% to 4% range. As I just mentioned, Kelway will add another 500 basis points to 600 basis points to second half revenue growth. Given our first half results, we expect to be at the high end of our annual adjusted EBITDA margin target of the mid-7% range, and for EPS given our first half operating results and the ongoing impact of lower interest expense, we now expect to exceed our mid-teens non-GAAP earnings per share growth target coming in pre-Kelway in the high teens. The $0.06 to $0.08 of non-GAAP EPS from Kelway is incremental. Let me provide some additional comments for those of you modeling our 2015 financials. I'm now on slide 20. On the expense side, we expect adjusted SG&A to increase at a rate higher than net sales for the balance of the year from four key drivers; cost related to higher coworker count, planned infrastructure and productivity initiative investments; overlap of last year's lower cost to serve from transactional sales and incremental Kelway SG&A. While these puts and takes brings us to a lower adjusted EBITDA margin for the second half of the year than we delivered in the first half, again, we expect our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be at the high end of our mid-7% target range. Moving down the P&L including Kelway, we expect our book interest to be in the $162 million to $164 million range and our effective tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. For full year 2015, we continue to expect a cash tax rate of 39% to be applied to pre-tax book income before items related to the Kelway transaction and acquisition related intangibles amortization. In addition, we will pay $20 million to $21 million related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. Adjusting for the pull-forward of approximately $100 million of free cash flow in the 2014 and incremental Kelway cash flow we expect to slightly exceed the high end of our normalized cash flow target of 2.5% to 3% of net sales. Keep in mind that Kelway's cash flow is higher in the back half of the calendar year, and don't forget that CDW cash flow tends to increase sequentially in the third quarter. This Q3, we will have an incremental cash interest paid on our new 5% notes, including interest on incremental net debt we consolidated in the Kelway transaction, we expect our cash interest to be in the range of approximately $156 million to $158 million for the full year. In total, we paid $372 million in cash and $59 million in stock before transaction fees and expenses and we will consolidate approximately $80 million of Kelway net debt for our 100% interest in the company. Reflecting this, given the consolidation of Kelway's net debt and EBITDA, our net leverage ratio for our credit agreement will pick up, but pro forma for Kelway we expect to end the year within the high end of our target range of 2.5 times to 3 times. This takes us to our capital allocation priority. We remain committed to all four of our priorities. I'm delighted to report that our Board of Directors declared the payment of a dividend of $0.0675 per share on September 10 to shareholders of record on August 25. This is 59% higher than last year's September payment and consistent with our target of achieving a 30% payout of free cash flow and dividends over the next four years. There was no change to our commitment to revisit our dividend payments annually. There was also no change to our intent to continue to make share repurchases under our existing authorization, either alongside our sponsors or in the open market at a minimum to offset dilution including the shares issued as part of the Kelway transaction. These shares issued in the Kelway transaction to facilitate the rollover of a portion of the transaction proceeds into CDW stock; all of that stock is subject to a multiyear lockup and a portion of that stock, which was funded by Kelway's founder, has been set aside for a retention pool for the broader Kelway leadership team. Finally, a few thoughts on how Kelway impacts our medium-term targets on slide 21. Once we anniversary the full acquisition, we currently expect the U.K. market to grow roughly in line with our North American operations. So there is no change to our 2016 to 2018 top line target and since strategic acquisitions were included in our 2016 to 2018 medium-term target as one of the ways we intend to grow earnings per share faster than revenues, there is no change to our low double-digit earnings per share target. Of course for 2016, we will have the benefit of incremental Kelway sales and earnings for seven months of the year, so we expect to exceed these targets with non-GAAP EPS growing in the low teens. When we release year end results, we'll provide more on our expectations for next year. This concludes the financial summary. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up? Operator, could you please provide the instructions for asking a question? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Rich. Thank you. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: So, you had been talking about a situation with some partners where you were able to collaborate together and get business that you weren't \u2013 any of you dealing with before, can you just elaborate on that situation and then I've a follow-up. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. It's an initiative or a program, if you will, to go after what we would call white space, and you \u2013 we've \u2013 we found a \u2013 like I said, I think it was nine partners that said, we think this is a great idea. So you build a program that involves sharing data about the target market opportunity, it involves putting combinations of products together, to solve particular customers' needs, and the objective is to get new incremental CDW and partner customers and I think, we consider it a pretty strong success, we brought on about 3,000 new customers. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Interesting. Okay. And then obviously, we get a lot of inbound questions on the eRate program, and it seems to be making some progress again. Can you just talk about what you see in the market there and your expectations for your public opportunities over the balance of the year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. It really, Rich, is directly impactful to K-12, and the data we have suggests that only about 20% of the funding letters have been released at this point, and school districts have remained fairly patient to wait until they get their funding letter to begin the network upgrade progress. I think as you remember from last quarter's call, were named on a significant number of the funding requests, and so it's one of the reasons we remain pretty optimistic about the impact it's going to have. Having said that, it looks like now, if you think about it, school districts really only can implement during what I'll call vacation time or holiday time. So if \u2013 a lot of \u2013 80% of them haven't yet received their funding letters. That's why we're believing at this point it's going to be later in the year, maybe some of the implementations will take place over the Thanksgiving holiday or the end of the year holiday. And so, we feel it's going to be a little more backend loaded and then obviously carry into next year. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I was hoping you could elaborate a little more on the opportunities you see with Kelway internationally. I know they're U.K.-based, but they do have some business in Asia. And what are the synergies there between being able to sell your solutions internationally? Are there any possibilities, I think you mentioned a couple where you're able to cross-sell across geographies? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. The driver \u2013 I think the best way is to go back to the initial kind of thesis. And that was \u2013 the primary focus initially was to help us better serve those U.S.-based multinational companies that had international needs. And that prior to the partnership with Kelway, we would have to excuse ourselves sometimes from what I'll call combined international opportunities. Obviously, the reverse is also true. Kelway has customers that have needs obviously internationally but back in the United States. So really the combination is about better serving those existing customers and then looking for opportunities for growth. One of the things that is appealing to us about Kelway, if you've heard, 90% of their business comes from the U.K. and that also is a significant area for a lot of our U.S.-based customers, so there is a strong synergy there, but they've done a nice job of building a platform that enables them to follow their customers and that's how they've opened those facilities I alluded to in other parts of the world. So, what we've experienced through the referral relationship is the growth in each of our businesses and we would expect that to continue. As you heard me allude to we're going to start out operating Kelway as a standalone business unit and continuing to perform on the referral model until we're comfortable that we've built kind of a single platform front for our customers. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess with the acquisition and integrating this 100% now, what capability do you have to do new acquisitions? Are you taking a pause now or do you see opportunities? So is there still bandwidth? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, look, if you think about CDW, we tend to do things in a deliberate way and we don't take lightly the integration and what it takes to do this well, which is why we've been pretty thorough in the acquisition process and some would say very deliberate and we're going to take the same approach on integration. So that I would say right now we've got our hands full and want to stay focused on both the integration of Kelway and our customers because that's important to us. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on Kelway also, just could we see, Thomas, in the short-term impact on revenue and expenses. I'm just curious if it could energize sales or possibly could we see some risk of attrition? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, are you talking about attrition attention from customers or coworkers? Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. I'm thinking about both actually; both on the revenue side as well as on the employee or coworker front given sort of change in control and the event itself? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes, well, let me take the first one about growth, you've heard us allude to the fact that we think the Kelway acquisition is going to add between 500 basis points and 600 basis points to CDW's top line growth between now and the end of the year, and one other things I'm really thrilled with is we built a I think a strong retention program for the people at Kelway and happy to report that they are signed up and ready to go and excited about the prospects for this joint company. So we feel really good about both rolling the business, retaining and growing customers and retaining the coworkers on both sides. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right, terrific. And then will you we rebrand, sorry if I missed that Kelway itself and then separate from that, I wanted to ask on the healthcare in Canada up and watching what's going on there in terms of just underlying trends, any call outs in what you see in healthcare in Canada? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, right now let me answer the first one. It will be Kelway as CDW company. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: We feel that that takes advantage of Kelway's brand recognition and acknowledges the new partnership. As we move through the integration process, we will think about if there is enhanced advantage for changing that, but right now that's kind of the go-to-market plan and we're both really excited about that. And the second part of that question was any other call outs about healthcare and in Canada. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Canada? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So Canada was if you heard they did a nice job in constant currency, are up high mid-single digits, continue to take share in the market, its currency issue and that kind of about calls it out, you guys know as well as I do the challenges in the Canadian economy, and they've continued to kind of upgrade successfully within that environment, and healthcare continues to be, by paperwork, lumpy from the perspective of, we've got a lot going on in healthcare with mergers and the impact on a merger can go one way of two ways when you're involved in one of those. And so, I think the fact that we got some growth that it helps through this quarter is a nice sign, and we'll take it. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. That's great. Congrats on the deal. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Oh, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess I'll start my first question with Kelway as well. Could you just talk about what even the current EBITDA margin structure for Kelway is? And to get them to be in line is the target of CDW. What sort of initiatives would you have to take from integration perspective and what sort of charges I mean entail eventually when you decide to do it? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, let me take the first part; one of the things that I alluded to is their profit picture is roughly similar to CDW today, and a lot of that is to their credit that since we started the process, they have been aggressively looking at how do they improve their profitability of the business, they have been exchanging ideas with CDW, and so we're thrilled with performance they've made up to this point from a profitability perspective and expect it to continue. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Got you. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: I think you also asked about integration charges. Keep in mind that this is not a transaction that's about taking cost out of the combined businesses. So, there will not be a significant, won't be any severance charges things along those lines. There is obviously no facilities to shut down. So you shouldn't be looking for charges along those lines. As we develop an integration program, there will likely be some expenses related to systems integration and we'll talk about those as we have better clarity around those. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And I guess really just to follow-up, Ann, how do you think about hedging as you go forward, especially with Kelway getting integrated into business and you're having more international exposure? And on the buyback front, is the talk process to continue to participate along with the sponsors as they do secondaries on a go-forward basis? Thank you. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Sure. On the hedging, I'm not a big fan of hedging merely translation risk, which is the majority of the exposure that we have today, both from Kelway today and \u2013 I'm sorry Kelway today and Canada. Now, to some extent, as you've heard, Kelway has about 90% of their revenues based in the U.K. There is that 10% that is non-U.K. and they've done a very good job where appropriate where they actually have a translation risk hedging that risk. So we anticipate that we would continue to do that going forward, but that we would not be hedging merely translation risk. In terms of the buyback; yes, I mean we obviously have a $500 million program out there. We have a fair amount of way to go on that program. And we certainly continue to expect to participate with our sponsors in secondaries. And as I indicated, the stock that was issued in the Kelway transaction will be bought back. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Oh, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. This is Adam in for Brian. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the competitive environment, given we've seen some major competitors growing double digits, but seeing triple digit decreases in gross margin. Talk a little bit more about the competitive environment and would you consider looking at gross profit dollar growth going forward as a possible metric, given the focus on profitable growth? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. A couple of different things; one, Adam, as we've said that is why we focus on EBITDA is because, it gives us the ability to focus on that which we can't control and it gives us the flexibility to kind of what I'll call manage the profitability of the business. From a gross profit perspective, it's been fairly constant here for a couple of quarters. We've been in the 16% range, which is where we'd like to be. But to be honest with you, we're not going to focus on GP growth per se. We're going to continue to focus on probably growing the top line and that profitability is defined by the mid-7% EBITDA margin that we've set as the target for the business. I can't really comment \u2013 I don't notice the competitive market being any more intense or any less intense than it was three months ago. And I think one of the things that I'm proud of is CDW has continued to grow the business profitably on top of some pretty incredible costs as you guys have pointed out to us. And so I think that's a great testament to the disciplined approach with which we go about serving customers. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And a question specific to the hiring; I know you mentioned that IT markets kind of at the low end of that 3% to 4% range. We've seen all three primary distributors in North America failing to grow and missing their own forecast. Consolidating, I think 1,000 Kelway employees that you mentioned, but going to reignite the hiring and adding 100 head count to 150 head count in 2015. Can you help us reconcile those kind of two differences? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes, I don't know that there is a reconciliation. To think about it, Adam, you just kind of think about them discretely. If you think about past earnings calls, one of the things that I was paying attention to was kind of the capacity we had already added into the CDW model with the kind of aggressive hiring we had done last year and the year before and felt like we have the capacity to handle the growth for a number of quarters. If you think about it, the IT growth rate of 3% to 4% has been pretty constant from our perspective. We said it was at the low range, but we're talking about 3% to 4%. And so, we feel like now we're at a point from a capacity standpoint that adding those incremental customer-facing coworkers in the U.S. is the right time for us to make that investment now, so that we can take advantage of market growth opportunities, when they're productive and ready to grow \u2013 go, excuse me, and grow, now that I say it that way. So I don't know that there is any disconnection there. I think it's really us monitoring as we always do the productive capacity of the CDW engine. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Appreciate the color, and congrats on the quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just a question on your hardware sales growth; Tom, you've talked about 8% growth in hardware, double digit server. Did you see some continued positive impact from the Microsoft Server upgrade cycle, and do you see that trailing off at the end of the year? And also relative to Windows 10, do you see any catalyst in terms of refresh in the corporate environment at the end of this year or into next year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay, Matt. So first, I think the word that I've been using to describe the impact of Win Server 2003 is kind of a mild breeze at our back so to speak. I would say that a lot of the customers, and I think I alluded to this last quarter, had really started preparing for the Win Server 2003 expiration late last year, it has carried into this year, but I also think there's what I would call a natural refresh going on, you have great new technologies like converged infrastructure, which is driving some of the behavior in the marketplace. So, I would say that I don't know we're in any particular inning. And since it hasn't been such a big driver, I don't know that we are thinking about some drop-off as far as its impact on the marketplace. And as far as Win 10, I think, as you know, a lot of the early benefits I think are going to be to the retailer/consumer market, which is not part of where we're focused. I think customers, typically in the enterprise space, take a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude like play with it, wait till the first patch comes out, let's see how it works. I think there is a fair amount of excitement about the product. I think there has been lots of stuff written about the fact that it may not drive hardware sales, but what I would say for us, if you look at our PC sales all the way back to 2013, there has been this constant drumbeat of growth. Even before the Windows XP accelerant, if you will, and I think that's because the businesses stay on a normal cycle of investing in PCs for the purpose of productivity. Then you get the incremental benefit of new form factors like I alluded to, so we're anticipating that it will continue to be steady growth with or without Windows 10. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And on the government business, you've had a several quarters of pretty strong growth here both on the federal and the state and local. You talked about projects on both sides that sound encouraging. As you look out at the next few quarters, obviously, comps are going to get tougher, but do you continue to see positive catalyst there? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. We continue to expect it to be a growth part of the business going forward. As you point out, they are going to be facing some tougher comps, but as I just said to the last question that's kind of more or the same for us it seems like, but we are looking at them to continue to grow maybe not at the exponential rate but at a good growth rate for the remainder of the year and into 2016. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Osten Bernardez with Cross Research. Your line is open. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom, I just had a quick question with respect to your outlook for the overall market being at the lower end of your original rate \u2013 original outlook of 3% to 4%. Could you sort of highlight for us what you are seeing that leads you to believe that you'll be at that low end rate, is it primarily sort of the PC declines that we've seen or are you seeing evidence of elongated decision-making by some of your customers or is it a macro call in terms of what you are seeing from an overall demand perspective? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. I think it feels more of a macro call. If you think about one of the earlier questions that cited some of the forecasts made by some of the distribution companies, I think you've seen other technology companies talk about a more muted growth picture maybe in the back half of the year. I don't know that I'm smart enough to tell you what's driving the macroeconomic perspective. I do hear people talk about well, we'll see what happens with interest rates and we'll see what happens with currency, and so I think all of those kind of filter into this macro perspective, but we aren't seeing it from a particular product perspective, more so a macro. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Got it. And then secondly, could you highlight, I don't know if I missed this earlier, but how did Kelway grow, what was Kelway's growth in the first half of the year, year-on-year? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: We didn't provide that detail. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes, we didn't share that. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : And you won't I guess? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: No. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : All right. Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned several times the ability for sales people to bring newer innovative technologies to market and I imagine that's helping you offset some of the macro pressures you just talked about. You said security a number of times, but I imagine it's broader than that, can you just talk about where, what buckets or it seems you've been able to sign on new partners and where your sales people are having the most traction in new technologies? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes, well, you're right; security remains one of the big drivers of new partners. Converged infrastructure is another area that has been a source of new partners. Our whole cloud strategy is another area that brings in new partners. And then even inside of the storage business, there are new storage partners. So I would say it happens in a broad perspective, Katy, but those are the ones where we've had I think the most significant additions in the last year or so. Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then the small business segment growth decelerated to 3%, but you talked about strong solutions growth there? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: What was it that decelerated in small business and what do you think is driving that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. It's generally, well, desktops as I alluded to declined across the whole business, but declined in a meaningful way in small business. So, I think a lot of that was driven by just the expiration of the Windows XP expiration, if you will, and they've continued to be a cloud growth engine for us, which is why the gross profits have been growing at an even faster rate than top line. Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Katy. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew N. Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. This is Matt Cabral for Bill. So, can you help us understand the biggest drivers of the step-down in gross margin that you saw from the first quarter to the second quarter? And then, just related to that; so you mentioned that a portion of your business is coming in at that 100% gross margin level. How big is that within the mix and then how should we expect that to grow going forward? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yes. As you recall from the first quarter call, we had a very strong gross margin in the first quarter, and as we explained on that call, a big piece of it was driven by mix we saw with product growth muted in the first quarter; our 100% gross margin items, particularly our net service contract revenues, continued their double digit growth, and therefore, it was really a mix impact on the gross margin that you saw in Q1 and we indicated that we thought as product growth reaccelerate as we move through the year, that mix impact would fade and that is indeed what we've seen. We also had in the first quarter we mentioned we had a benefit from a \u2013 from not repeating an inventory write-off that occurred in the first quarter of the prior year. So you have that pickup as well. Matthew N. Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up first, Tom, on the cross-border synergy comment. Is that common and is it significant to CDW. I could imagine a lot of companies have offices all over the world and there could be a situation where you couldn't win or couldn't bid on deals. Is that something you see a lot? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. That was actually the driver, Jayson, that got us started down the path with Kelway in the first place, was it \u2013 and then we went out and studied it externally. So it was a combination of feedback from our sellers and the selling experience. And then some external analysis we did that said the number of situations was increasing and therefore, if you didn't have the ability to help a customer with delivering IT internationally, so to speak, you were going to reduce the likelihood of your ability to protect and grow your core business. So that was kind of the genesis of the thesis. And we have just seen that increase as time goes on. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then a follow-up; I wanted to ask about Public Cloud as a competitor. It comes up somewhat with investors asking about your small business segment specifically, but maybe some updated thoughts there on what you see? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. It's been \u2013 as I said, Jayson, our cloud business across CDW has been growing and we're thrilled with the different ways that we've been able to help customers, as they think through which workload, how to build out a hybrid architecture so to speak. And as I've said, I think earlier, the small business organization has been one of the leading organizations in selling cloud-based solutions, be it SaaS-based, be it infrastructure-as-a-Service-based or agency-based. So I think the breadth of our cloud portfolio truthfully is one of the key reasons we've continued to see the levels of growth because just like the value proposition of CDW, it enables us to bring multiple choices to a group of customers that typically wouldn't be able to avail themselves of that kind of choice and that tends to be rewarded to CDW. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Our final question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair. You line is open. Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, good results, congrats and thanks for squeezing me in. Tom, kind of big picture questions; so when I look at the security business, obviously you're very positive on that. When I extrapolate this business call it two years, three years, four years from now, is this going to be increasingly more services-oriented or is it going to be primarily a product-oriented business? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I have enough time \u2013 tough time figuring out next quarter, let alone two years out to three years out. This is a gut response. I think what we're seeing as I mentioned when we talked about security Threat Check Version 2, which includes some consultation aspect on process analysis. I would expect there will be an increasing service aspect to this as we go forward because as I think you guys that live in this world know it's just not about the technology, it's about the, what I'll call, security policies inside of a business, the security practices. And they all tend to contribute. So, if you force me to answer, I would say yes, I think there'll probably be a bigger services practice as part of security going forward. Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And as a follow-up, Tom, I mean taking that as a basis and looking at all the other trends, clearly, I mean there is greater need for customization, greater need for software development. So again, longer-term, could you guys be more involved in the IT services, I mean you are involved, but what I'm talking about is get into the businesses of the TCS', the Infosys and get into some of these more IT services, product development or IT services businesses? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: We have been as you pointed out investing and growing our services practice for about three years or four years now in a meaningful way, and the growth isn't just in coworkers, it has been in capabilities. I don't know that I could sit here and forecast now kind of which of those will be most important to our customers, that will always be the driver at CDW for the market we serve, but I think it's fair to say, we are getting asked to consider services that are more expansive and different than we do today, but again we got to make sure we can deliver on the customers' expectations. So that's probably a long-winded way of saying I'm not really sure, but we're going to continue to expand our services portfolio. Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great and congrats once again. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Richards for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, everybody. I appreciate your interest this morning, and as always, if your company needs some help with IT, we would hope you would come to CDW, and now we can say CDW plus our international partner, Kelway, would be more than happy to help you, and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and, everyone, have a great day.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. So with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. I'm pleased to report that once again CDW delivered profitable growth. Net sales were up 7.2% with excellent profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA grew at more than twice our top line, up 16.3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 30.8%. On a constant currency organic basis, which excludes Kelway results, net sales increased 3.6%. Our ability to deliver this profitable growth was the result of three key drivers : our balanced portfolio of sales channels, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio including emerging technologies, and our focus on cost control while we continue to execute against our three-part strategy. Let me walk you through each one of these and share some detail about how they contributed to our performance. First, our balanced portfolio of sales channels. As you know, we have five U.S. channels, medium and large business, we call MedLar, Small Business, Healthcare, Government and Education, each generating annual sales of more than $1 billion. This portfolio of unique end markets serves us well when a channel is disrupted by macro or external challenges. The power of this diversity was clearly evident this quarter with our Corporate segment growing 6.3%, while Public was flat. On the Corporate side, we had excellent performance across both MedLar which increased 6.1%, and Small Business which increased 7.1%. Both channels grew solutions revenue more than 60% faster than transaction revenues. Our other segment which now includes Kelway along with CDW Advanced Technology Services, ATS, and Canada, increased $134 million in the quarter. ATS posted a mid-teens increase driven by field services. Canada continued to gain share in local currency growing nearly double digits in Canadian dollars. But after currency translation, it declined nearly double digits in U.S. dollars. Kelway contributed sales in U.S. dollars of $138 million. Performance was excellent in Government, which increased 10.7%, driven by balanced performance in both state and local and federal. State and local continues to benefit from addressing public safety needs while efforts by our federal team to align against new strategic programs implemented over the past couple of years helped us benefit from more normal fiscal year-end buying. Healthcare continued to experience expected lumpiness due to ongoing industry consolidation and increased 1.5% in the quarter. The combined performance of all of these channels more than offset the impact of an 8.5% decline in our Education channel. Education results reflected two channel specific issues. First, the pace of eRate funding. You will recall that CDW was named on both the largest number of application requests and received the largest dollar amount of requests for category 2 eRate funds, which are SEC funds designated for internal connections for public schools and libraries. On our second quarter call in August, we shared that while that was certainly good news it was not clear how the timing of approvals would impact our customer's ability to implement solutions. We also shared that as of the end of July just over 20% of the requests by our customers have been approved. A few days prior to the call, the eRate administrator said that the intent was to issue letters for all approved funding by the third week of September. While more than 90% of all applications were approved by the end of the third quarter, those applications represented less than half of the total funds requested. We ended the third quarter with just below 50% of customer dollar requests approved. This lower than anticipated funding clearly impacted Education results in the third quarter. The second factor that muted Education growth was the market dynamic for K-12 Chromebooks, with average selling prices down significantly in the quarter. Given our focus on profitable growth, our Chromebook sales were down in a market where units were growing. The second driver of our performance was the balance of our product portfolio. Looking at broad product categories on an organic basis excluding Kelway, hardware grew 4.2%, services grew 10.3%, while software declined 3% in the quarter. As expected, we continue to see faster growth from more complex integrated solution sales. Revenues were balanced between solutions and transactions as transaction sales were flat and solutions sales were up high-single digits. Cloud adoption remains strong for both software-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service, with total customer spend growing significantly double digits. Because these revenues are netted down, their impact is quite small on our top line, but is becoming meaningful to our gross profit. In fact, year-to-date cloud represents nearly 5% of total gross profit. Hardware results were fueled by strong growth in categories that support solution sales including NetComm, which was up nearly 20%. Servers were up high-single digits, and enterprise storage was in the low-single digits. Once again, the balance of our storage portfolio with a wide offering of emerging technologies helped to more than offset declines in established products. And once again, security was our fastest growing practice area. Sales of new security products added in the past couple of years grew nearly 35% in the quarter while new flash products grew triple digits. Together, these two categories contributed nearly one-fifth of the total organic revenue growth in the quarter. Once again, gross profits grew faster than software sales, up mid-single digits, as we booked more revenues net for both cloud based solutions and software assurance. Double digit increases in software that supports solutions, including security, storage, and networking, weren't enough to offset declines in licensed software and the netting down impact of software-as-a-service. Software growth also was impacted by the absence of a large deal we spoke about last year. Overall, we delivered excellent results for the quarter, driven by both our balanced channels and portfolio. We also made excellent progress against our three strategic priorities in the quarter. First, our strategy to gain share of wallet and acquire new customers. As you recall, our acquisition of Kelway is about following our customers' needs for international IT solutions. Kelway enables us to gain wallet share of U.S. based customers with international locations as well as acquire new U.S. based customers who have international needs. A great example of the impact of how Kelway helps us gain share of wallet is a solution we are providing to a U.S. based cosmetics, fragrance and personal-care company that needed assistance with their global telephony environment. Initially, a CDW U.S. unified communications customer, they recently contracted with us to upgrade their unified communications environment in the UK and Spain. In early 2016, we'll begin implementation in Australia. The non-U.S. hardware was procured through Kelway. CDW-badged engineers and project management are overseeing design, configuration and cutover for the entire project. Kelway is tackling the on-site tasks of rack and stack, training and cutover support. Opportunities like this contributed to Kelway performance which was in line with expectations. Kelway delivered mid-single digit top line growth in constant currency during the quarter. We also moved full-steam ahead building our integration plans to develop a seamless experience for customers on both sides of the pond. During the quarter, we continued to make strategic investments in building our brand and driving sales. In September, we launched our newest integrated digital, social media, print and TV campaign once again built around NBA Hall of Famer and All-Star IT guy, Charles Barkley. This time Charles gets trapped in the Internet and CDW comes to his rescue. This year's campaign features more partners than we have ever had. Non-paid media placements highlighting the Save Barkley ad campaign so far have reached more than 3.6 million unique viewers. You can catch the television ads on NFL Monday Night Football, ESPN SportsCenter and College Football, as well as hear them on the radio. You can also check out the campaign by visiting our website, and if you are so inclined, you can use social media to help us rescue Charles with the hashtag, #SaveBarkley. We also made progress during the quarter in our second priority and third priority to enhance our solutions and services capabilities. Services capabilities underpin our ability to deliver advanced solutions. And for us, the main way we have been building these capabilities is via adding technical coworkers. Since our IPO in 2013, we've added more than 100 North American service delivery coworkers who are primarily focused on helping deliver customer solutions. Service delivery engineers design, implement and manage solutions for our customers, and they deliver managed services from our operations centers, including our new Enterprise Command Center which we opened this August. The ECC is a 24 by 7 by 365-day operations center that expands our managed services, cloud and mobility capabilities. A great example of how this will help us deliver on our value proposition is a managed cloud solution that includes mobility for a U.S.-based sports clothing retailer with locations around the world. The customer needed a simple, easy way to implement its enhanced online presence and virtual buying experience. Our answer, a cloud-based mobility solution that runs out of our new Enterprise Command Center. Since the customer was never offered a mobile purchasing option before, compute and storage requirements are unknown. Our solution provides burstable resources when needed for the new application to provide a consistent, positive customer experience, and via managed services we will monitor usage and expand or shrink resources based on utilization. All aspects of the environment will be monitored and managed by CDW. Over this three-year agreement, this solution will deliver a total value of more than $400,000. A great example of the return we are generating on our ongoing investment in enhancing solutions and services capabilities. While we continue to build our capabilities to deliver solutions and services, we were cautious hiring this quarter. Despite a good start to the quarter, the macro environment in late summer caused us to remain cautious and we held North American customer-facing coworkers essentially flat with the second quarter. Given the strength we saw in September and the need to support 2016 growth, we turned hiring back on and currently expect to come in for the full year close to 100 new customer facing coworkers. Of course, as we always do, we will continue to monitor the marketplace and adjust our plans if we feel necessary. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have an effective strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro or channel specific challenges and positions us for sustainable growth in the future, a strategy designed to continue our evolution into the leading IT solution provider in North America and the U.K., and most importantly a strategy that delivers both excellent profitability and strong cash flows. This confidence has led our board to approve a 59% increase in our annual cash dividend consistent with our capital allocation priority of achieving a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow by year end 2019. Let me leave you with a few comments on our expectations for the balance of the year. You'll recall on last quarter's conference call we shared our expectation for U.S. IT market growth in 2015 to come in around 3%. There is no change to our view for the market. And given results year-to-date and expectations for the fourth quarter, we continue to look for 2015 organic growth to meet our annual medium-term target to outgrow the U.S. IT market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points on a constant currency basis. This expectation reflects three key factors. First, we expect to see continued momentum in our Corporate segment. Second, while the eRate administrator indicated that they expect to fund all workable requests by the end of the year, given school is in session we do not anticipate an eRate spending uptick over the near term. And finally, although there is no change to our view that Healthcare will return to being a growth driver given the benefit technology provides through improving outcomes, industry consolidation continues and we expect Healthcare results will remain lumpy over the near term. Keep in mind, this look forward does not include the impact of Kelway. Kelway is on track to deliver the 500 basis points to 600 basis points of incremental top line for the second half of the year we shared with you last quarter. So no change there either. What has changed is that as you know, in October, we added Dell to our portfolio of products and services providing another great choice for our customers. While we are very enthusiastic about the addition of Dell, we are also realistic in terms of its impact. When we made the announcement in mid-October, we were careful to note that we do not expect a material impact on 2015 results. The reason is twofold. First, we have done business with Dell prior to this announcement with limited SKUs in the federal channel as well as both SonicWALL and Wyse. So revenues from this broader relationship will not be entirely incremental. And second, ramping up the build cycle to support a partner of Dell's magnitude is not a simple undertaking. Our number one priority is to ensure that we provide the same excellent sales and service experience to our customers that we do with all of our partners. To accomplish this requires that we have the right internal systems, tools and processes. And that will take a little time, time to train the sellers and solution architects on Dell products, solutions and systems, time to ramp up the marketing activity including digital outreach, sales enablement tools and marketing collateral, time to hire both incremental sellers and backbone to support Dell transactions. And finally, importantly, time to align our systems and processes including data flows via EDI, lead sharing and executing our customer-specific requests. As we do with all of our strategic initiatives, we will execute this deliberately and thoughtfully. So for now, we don't expect any material impact on 2015 results from Dell. Let's turn briefly to what we expect for 2016. We're in the middle of our planning process and as we always do, we'll provide our 2016 outlook on our year-end conference call. In the meantime, we can share that Kelway will impact top line growth incrementally. Until we anniversary the 100% acquisition in August of 2016, we currently expect it to grow in line with overall CDW. And given the pace of our ramp, we currently expect incremental annual growth from the Dell partnership to add roughly 150 basis points of annual growth in 2016. This is on top of our medium term target of 200 basis points to 300 basis points over the U.S. IT market which we expect to continue to grow around 3%. More to come on the fourth quarter conference call in early 2016. With that, let me turn it over to Ann, who will share more detail on our financial performance and capital action we took today. Ann? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our third quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, our breadth of product offerings, particularly our ability to bring innovative emerging technologies to our customers and our focus on profitable growth. Our results also reflect the progress we are making against our financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver double digit earnings growth and return cash to our shareholders. Let me begin with our P&L. In case you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 8. Consolidated top line growth was strong this quarter with net sales of $3.5 billion, 7.2% higher than last year on both a reported and average daily sales basis including two months of Kelway. Average daily sales were $54.7 million. While sales in Canadian dollars remain a relatively small portion of our total revenue, less than 5%, the strengthening U.S. dollar continued to depress organic net sales. Currency shaved approximately 60 basis points off of organic growth in the quarter, 40 basis points more than last year and 10 basis points higher than last quarter. On a constant currency basis, organic sales were 3.6% higher than last year. On an organic average daily sales basis, sequential sales were up 1.5% versus Q2 2015, which is below recent Q3 seasonality. As you remember, Q2 was well above recent normal seasonality, up 18.4% sequentially. Gross profit for the quarter increased 11.8% to $567.2 million. Gross margin was 16.2%, up 10 basis points versus Q2. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was up 70 basis points. Given its higher mix of solution and services, Kelway added approximately 10 basis points to gross margin. More than half of the total gross margin improvement reflects the combined impact of a higher mix of revenues recorded at 100% gross margin such as our net service contract revenue and higher partner funding. Consolidated reported SG&A, including advertising expense was $362.6 million, up 12.4%. Consolidated adjusted SG&A including advertising was $287.4 million, an increase of 8.1%. This reflected the impact of consolidating two months of incremental Kelway expenses, increased sales payroll consistent with the growth in solution related sales and higher gross profits as well as increased advertising expense, which was 10.6% above last year as we continue to invest in the business. As a reminder, Kelway sales compensation as a percentage of sale runs higher than our North American operations given their higher mix of solutions and services revenue. We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 North American coworkers, up roughly 75 coworkers since the end of 2014. Consolidated coworkers including Kelway were approximately 8,300, up over 1,000 since the third quarter of 2014. As you can see on the next slide, slide 9, adjusted SG&A for the quarter excludes $7.8 million of non-cash equity compensation, $7 million of acquisition and integration costs and $2 million of historical retention cost and other expenses. Our non-cash equity compensation increased year-over-year primarily due to ongoing annual long-term performance awards granted in Q1 and incremental Kelway awards. To make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our gross profit less adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. We retained a significant portion of this quarter's gross profit improvement and converted top line growth of just over 7% to adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.3% to $282.1 million. This translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%, up 70 basis points over last year. Let's look at the rest of the P&L. On slide 10, interest expense was 23.2% lower than last year at $38.5 million reflecting reductions driven by retainment and refinancing activities completed in 2014 and Q1 of this year. Our effective tax rate was 38.7% versus 37.9% in Q3 2014. On a GAAP basis, we earned $150.9 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income which better reflects our operating performance was $143.2 million in the quarter, up 29.3% over last year. As you can see on slide 11, non-GAAP net income reflects after tax add backs in four general buckets : the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, non-cash equity compensation, acquisition and integration costs, and other nonrecurring income or expenses. This quarter, our non-GAAP net income also adjusts for a pre-tax gain on our Kelway minority investment of $98.1 million. This gain represents the required accounting treatment of our previously held 35% minority investment to reflect the fair value assessment at the 100% ownership level. With Q3 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $171 million, we delivered $0.84 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 30.8% over the prior year. As anticipated, Kelway contributed roughly $0.03. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at an average price of $38.19 per share for a total of $101.6 million under our previously announced repurchase program. 2.25 million shares were repurchased in the most recent block transaction by our sponsors and 411,000 shares were repurchased on the open market. Approximately 1.6 million of these shares were repurchased to offset the dilution from the issuance of shares in connection with the Kelway transaction. Turning to the first nine months of the year on slide 12, consolidated net sales were $9.6 billion, an increase of 6% on both a reported and average daily sales basis, as average daily sales grew to $50.1 million. On a constant currency basis, organic net sales were up 5.1%. Consolidated gross profit during the first nine months of 2015 was $1.6 billion, up 9%, and gross profit margin was 16.3%, up 50 basis points from last year. SG&A including advertising expense increased $75.4 million or 8.2%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $761 million, 11.3% higher than last year. Non-GAAP net income for the first nine months of 2015 was $379.8 million versus $307.7 million in 2014, up 23.4% driven by our higher operating results and lower interest expenses, which were down $27.6 million. Turning to our consolidated balance sheet on slide 13, we finished the quarter with $3.17 billion of net debt, $348.8 million higher than the beginning of the year. This increase reflects the use of cash and consolidation of net debt for the Kelway acquisition. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1 billion. As expected, net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA at the end of Q3 was just above our target range of 3.1 times, 0.1 turn less than Q3 2014. Our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.4%. In this potentially increasing interest rate environment, I'd like to remind you that our $1.5 billion floating rate term loan facility has a 1% LIBOR floor, and we have in place $1.4 billion notional amount of 2% interest rate caps, which don't expire until Q1 of 2017. With the exception of a $94 million facility at Kelway, the remainder of our outstanding debt is fixed rate, so approximately 94% of our outstanding debt is effectively fixed or hedged, and rates would have to move significantly before they had a material impact on our interest cost. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $94.6 million. Cash interest paid was $44 million, $17 million higher than Q3 2014. This primarily reflects the change in interest payment timing as we replaced our 8% notes that we previously paid semi-annually in April and October, with 5% notes on which we pay interest in March and September. Free cash flow, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures, was $156.2 million for the quarter, $7 million more than last year's $149.3 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $273.6 million, down $86 million from last year, reflecting the ongoing impact of the roughly $100 million of anticipated Q1 2015 cash flows that were reported in Q4 of 2014, which we have discussed in the past. As you can see on slide 14, we maintain strong rolling three-month working capital metrics. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 18 days, which was down compared to last year's third quarter. While very pleased with this result, we don't expect to sustain this level and look for our cash conversion cycle to be within our target range of the low to mid-20s for the remainder of the year. Let me provide now a few additional comments for those of you modeling our 2015 results. I am on slide 15. Starting with revenues, as Tom mentioned, we expect organic constant currency growth to come in for the full year within our annual medium-term target range of 200 basis points to 300 basis points over the U.S. IT market growth, which we continue to expect to be about 3%. Given our current expectations for Q4, we continue to expect to deliver organic seasonality at our past three-year average, first half-second half split of 48% to 52%. In addition, we expect Kelway's second half growth contribution to be in line with our initial 500 basis point to 600 basis point view, with Kelway delivering roughly 700 basis points of growth year-over-year in Q4. Remember, Q3 reflected two months of Kelway revenues. The fourth quarter will have Kelway in all three months. Also note that while Kelway, like Canada, is impacted by currency, because we won't have them in our prior year period until we anniversary the full acquisition, our P&L won't reflect any year-over-year translation impact. On the expense side, we expect our adjusted SG&A to increase at a rate higher than net sales in the fourth quarter driven by ongoing mix into solutions, incremental Kelway SG&A and our continued investment in the business. This brings our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of the year at or slightly below the low end of our mid-7% annual target range. That said, given year-to-date performance, we now expect our full year margin to be slightly above the high end of our mid-7% target range. Moving down the P&L, including Kelway we expect full year book interest to be in the range of $160 million and our effective tax rate between \u2013 to be between 37% and 38%. For earnings, we continue to expect Kelway to contribute between $0.06 and $0.08 per share on a non-GAAP basis for the second half of 2015. With just under $0.03 contributed this quarter, that leaves roughly a $0.05 for Q4. This assumes a currently \u2013 currency rate of roughly $1.55 to the pound. Remember, this is non-GAAP earnings per share, so it doesn't include amortization of purchased intangibles or acquisition and integration costs or one-time gains and expenses. Given first nine months results for full year 2015, we continue to expect to exceed our mid-teens non-GAAP earnings per share growth target delivering growth in the low-20s. Moving to cash flow on slide 16, for full year 2015, we continue to expect a cash tax rate of 39% to be applied to pre-tax book income before items related to the Kelway transaction and acquisition-related intangibles amortization. In addition, we will pay $20 million to $21 million related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. We expect to deliver full year cash flow within our target of 2.5% to 3% of net sales. Adjusting for the pull forward of Q1 cash flow into Q4 2014, normalized free cash flow as a percentage of net sales would exceed this target. Note that while Kelway's cash flow was higher in the back half of the calendar year, our organic CDW cash flow tends to decrease sequentially in the fourth quarter due to working capital requirements. And finally, we expect our cash interest to be in the range of approximately $153 million to $155 million for the full year. This takes us to our capital allocation priorities on slide 17. There was no change to our commitment to revisit our dividends annually. Today's 59% dividend increase is consistent with our target of achieving a 30% payout of free cash flow in dividends over the next four years. And there was no change to our net leverage ratio target. We expect to end the year at the high end of our target of 2.5 times to 3 times. And while we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities, our focus will be on creating a seamless customer experience for our U.S. and U.K. customers for some time to come. So while strategic acquisitions remain a priority, we do not anticipate any near-term acquisitions. Finally, there was also no change to our intent to continue to make share repurchases under our existing authorization either alongside our sponsors or in the open market. Before we turn it over to questions, let me share a few thoughts on our medium-term targets on slide 18. There is no change to our 2016 to 2018 annual medium-term targets. We currently expect the U.K. market to grow roughly in line with to slightly below the North American market. As acquisitions are one of the ways we intend to grow earnings per share faster than revenues, there was no change to our low double-digit earnings per share growth target. That said, for 2016, we will have the benefit of incremental Kelway sales and earnings for seven months of the year and an incremental contribution from Dell, so we do expect to exceed these targets. We currently expect non-GAAP EPS to grow in the low teens for 2016. When we release year-end results, we will provide more on our expectations for 2016. That concludes the financial summary. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up? Operator, can you please provide the instructions for asking a question? Operator : Thank you. And the first question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Tom, you mentioned some additional costs related to ramping the Dell business. Can you give us some sense of how much additional cost that will add to the operating expenses? And how do you expect that to ramp through 2016? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, good morning, Sherri. First of all, thank you. Yeah, we're not going to be that specific truthfully because it would be hard to be precise and I don't want to lead you down a bad path. I would tell you that there's going to be a meaningful addition of coworkers and let me just give you the categories. So you got coworkers, you have marketing investment, you've got systems, all of those kind of things. But I will say that despite all of that, we obviously think the upside is pretty meaningful as I said. And we plan to deliver consistent with the targets we've said to people about adjusted EBITDA, so you should not expect to be what I'll call an aggregate negative relative to the targets we talked about for profitability. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. And then thinking about the Education segment, you mentioned sort of a stall in eRates and not everyone has been approved yet. Would you expect that to resolve itself in 2016? I know it's a bit early, but trying to get a... Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I hope so, Sherri, I hope so. When I think about the length of this process and all of the work that's gone into winning many of those awards, if you will, from a CDW perspective and the time invested, I think it's going to be a function of not only when they finally get what I'll call completed, but then when we have the window of opportunity to implement the solutions in the school districts, I think that will be probably the biggest gauge. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Sherri. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. On the Dell contribution, Tom, it sounds like this might only impact 2016 revenue by about $200 million for some of the reasons you talked about. How big has Dell been for CDW in the past in terms of total revenue with federal and Wyse, et cetera? And is there any reason why CDW wouldn't represent a similar market share of Dell as it does for other large vendors like HP or Cisco? Because I think if that happens, this could be more than a $1 billion opportunity over time for CDW and I think Michael Dell actually stated publicly that CDW could be billions of dollars to Dell. So maybe just talk about the longer term opportunity. Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Brian. First of all, good morning and second of all, I hope I answer all of those sub-questions that are in there. So I know you'll call me on it if I don't. So let me start down the path and say we do think \u2013 obviously, let me start with the big picture. I think it's reasonable to assume over some period of time and I don't know that I can tell you, Brian, exactly when that is when we'll be at full production and it's reasonable to assume that for a large partner that we could take a meaningful part of their channel revenue. So I think all of those are fair assumptions. Your math is the same as ours relative to what 150 basis points will probably mean to us next year. But I can tell you that the business we did have with Dell which really was a couple federal contracts and SKUs on SonicWALL and Wyse was in the $120 million, $130 million, $140 million, $150 million kind of range. So that'll give you one of the reasons why it's not a total incremental lift when you're thinking about next year, which is some of the early press, I think people didn't appreciate that and they were running to these numbers that didn't really understand that obviously you knew a little bit about that. I don't know, did I answer most of those questions? If I missed one, go ahead and ask it again. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Just longer term, can this be a business that you think is in excess of $1 billion? I know it's going to take time, but trying to think longer term. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, it is. Well, it depends on how long long-term is for me on this question. But as you know, we have some other large partners that are $1 billion. I love the fact that Michael is so excited about CDW and the prospects. But I'd be really hesitant to say, yep, I see it being $1 billion by some timeframe, because there's just so many things. Let me just \u2013 suffice it to say, we did it with the expectation that it's going to help us meet a set of customers' needs that we've not been able to address in the past and we think it's going to have a meaningful impact on CDW. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then just as a follow-up on Kelway, if I look at their productivity, revenue per employee is about $900,000 per year. And I think CDW has been basically 2X that. So how is it that Kelway's operating margin profile is comparable to CDW, given that gap in revenue per employee? Is that just the richer mix of offerings that they have? Or what else would explain that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Bingo. It is they have a much higher \u2013 not much higher, they have a higher mix of solutions, which trickles itself all the way down through the business from a profitability perspective and that drives the bottom line number you alluded to. So you're right on target. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right, thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is open. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks and good morning. A question just regarding your comment on the education market, I appreciate why, obviously, the revenue is down year-over-year for the reasons you stated. But on the issue of lower sales due to Chromebook and ASP declines there, can you quantify what the gap was there in terms of lost revenue or revenue opportunities that you walked away from? And as you go forward, is that the new normal where you're being more selective on lower margin, lower returns type of products? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, Matt, I would say it's not the new normal. It is the normal for CDW to \u2013 if you think about, we've talked about how people are focused here and profitable growth has always been the guide, so to speak. So I think it's normal. If you think about what happens when you see a market and the ASPs drop in the meaningful way they did, and the margin comes out of it, that doesn't mean you're never going to go after that kind of business. There may be strategic reasons. But as a general course, it's just not worth it to chase those kind of deals for the sheer purpose of revenue and that's not the way we focus on CDW. Now, going forward, I think you are always going to be looking at ways to cut the cost so that you can find ways to make those kinds of sales and do it in a profitable way. And I think as we have always done in the past, we will continue to look for those. But we're just not going to be in it for the revenue chase, would be the way I would ask you to think about it. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then just another question on Dell, if I can. It looks like Kelway has had a pretty good relationship with Dell there and if you could comment on that. And then also you looked at \u2013 you're talking about incremental revenue opportunities next year. But my question is, are you looking at any potential share shifts against your existing vendor base and how are those conversations playing out in terms of your relationship with your top vendors and top competitors for Dell? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. So it's another one of those multiple question questions. So let me see. I can comment on your first question which I think was the relationship between Dell and Kelway. It's been a good relationship, very productive. And I think it's a great example of how when Dell is in the lineup with other ones, they have great relationships with the other partners. It's all about focusing on the customer. So I would say that one of the things that we did here when we thought about this was and the sales guys weren't necessarily in love with this, but we added incremental targets to people's book, so to speak, so that you wouldn't have people just doing share shift to make numbers, and I think we've shared that with everybody. I think the second thing we did, Matt, was we were very transparent with people, we talked to people, we explained the fact that this was driven by the number of times where a customer may have standardized on two different technologies, and we have to walk away from half the business. And that's not consistent with CDW. So I think on the whole and on the average, people were \u2013 appreciated our transparency. They appreciated the fact that we added the incremental goaling (43:12) to people to drive the behavior you'd want which is not share shift, but grow the business. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I will start not with a Dell question. Could you talk about what happened with your ARs in the quarter? It was up about $150 million. It seems like a big uptick versus what we've seen seasonally in the past. So was it just a more back-end loaded quarter? Could you maybe walk through what happened there? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah, the thing you have to be careful about when you look at the components of our cash conversion cycle as opposed to the actual cash conversion cycle or working capital in total. One of the other things I mentioned was the impact of net service contract revenue on our gross margin. When we do things that are netted down, so to speak, and we go through this in our 10-Q, the revenues for AR are in many cases gross because we're collecting the gross amount for the customer, even though we're only recognizing the netted down amount in our GAAP revenues. So as you mix in to items that net down, it has a negative impact on your accounts receivable. It has a positive impact on your DPO. So those two things tend to offset. So if you look at the entire working capital or cash conversion cycle, it nets out. But if you look at individual components, it distorts the individual components. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And then if I just get back to the Dell question as well, basically the way you guys are describing this, should we think that maybe the near term for 2016 you could see some sort of margin headwind because you add a lot of expenses but the revenues don't show up, and then over time it normalizes? Is that the right way to think about it? And then sort of Brian's take on this could be a $1 billion business over time. If it becomes that, do you think it's going to be all organic? Or would there be some cannibalization away from your other larger vendors potentially? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Let me answer the first question. Look, I kind of reinforce the notion is we don't anticipate not meeting the targets you guys have heard from us from an adjusted EBITDA perspective. So that would suggest that we think the growth that we'll get both in revenue and profitability will offset the investment as we move forward. And the second thing, look, I mean I said we're doing this because we think it's a growth catalyst for CDW that's driven around customers. I think it can be a meaningful part of the business. And we've tried to structure it so that there isn't cannibalization. Now, does this suggest that may never happen? Look, I'm not going to be that prescriptive and na\u00efve. But I do believe that we've done this in a way that it should be focused on additional growth to CDW. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Osten Bernardez of Cross Research. Your line is open. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Hi, yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question with respect to the cadence of OpEx as we consider the addition of Dell. And I understand that you \u2013 the intention is to meet your stated goals for the year of looking into 2016, but I guess should we \u2013 how long do you think it would take for you to meet that goal? Will there be, I'm assuming there will be some startup costs associated with adding Dell on as a partner? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: I did say in my comments that we do expect SG&A to grow more rapidly than revenues in Q4. So you'll see that in Q4. Remember, our medium term targets, as we start thinking about 2016, our medium term targets are annual targets, and we have from time to time a little bit of lumpiness in the quarter in terms of SG&A. Remember, in particular, Q1. Q1 declined on a revenue basis in general sequentially from Q4, right? And we carry the SG&A over. So you generally see SG&A being a higher percentage in Q1, and then that tends to normalize as you move sequentially through the year. And so again, there's no change to our medium term targets, and beyond Q4 of this year, I don't think we're pointing to any material change to the trends in the business in terms of how SG&A flows through. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Got it. And then secondly, when I look at the business and how you were able to grow your solution sales much rapidly than your transactional business for the quarter, how do we think about, or how are you thinking about the mix of that business as you look ahead? Are you in a place where you believe you can better predict where solution sales will end up on a relative basis looking into 2016? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, I think a lot of it starts with what's important to customers and what customers feel like they need to get addressed. Some of what you're seeing this year is a function of the focus they had on client devices and transactional products last year. I think we actually talked about the way to think about this. They have budgets and when they have priorities that drive a spend, like last year it was a lot of the client refresh, then solution projects get pushed out, and then when you get a new year, you have the ability to have, what I'll call, the balance. We love the balance we have in our business between transaction and solution products. It gives us the ability to constantly be in the mode of helping customers, and as you heard me say in my formal comments, we're in the 52% \u2013 48% perfect balance. And as we think about going forward next year, we've continued to invest in our solutions business as you've heard me talk about, whether it's in the term of coworkers, in the term of the ECC that I mentioned. And so we would continue to expect to see our solutions business growing at a good clip going forward. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. If you achieved your target of growing 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market, it suggests the market was flattish in the third quarter, so I just wonder how that impacts your view of market growth going into the fourth quarter and next year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Well, first, Katy, first of all good morning. Second, that's in the annual number that we try to benchmark on, the 200 basis points to 300 basis points, it does jump around, obviously. As you know, there are all kind of mixed signals going on right now about the economy and on one hand you read the facts about GDP was readjusted to what, like 1% or something in the quarter, and then I saw a survey by CIOs that said they had back end funding available. So we're just going on the operating assumption that it's going to be the kind of same kind of growth into the last part of the year that we've seen to this part. Would I love it to be more? No one would be more happy than me. But I think from an assumption standpoint, the 2% to 3% \u2013 the 3% growth is about what we expect. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And then over the last month a number of companies, Rackspace, Teradata, HP, Oracle capitulated and partnered with AWS. Any updated thoughts as to whether that could be a sales channel, Amazon, Microsoft Azure over time? Or is the opportunity still around consulting and helping companies transition to cloud with more of a direct relationship with the customer? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. We've got a really meaningful Azure practice today, and growing at a really exciting clip. So I think that is part of our strategy long-term. And while we don't have a formal relationship with AWS today, we have ways with other partners if that's something that's important to a customer, we can help them there. But I think your instincts are correct, as I alluded to the kind of growth numbers we're seeing in our cloud business, Katy, is very much driven by infrastructure-as-a-service and that is right along the lines of the Azure question that you asked. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Katy. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the hiring pause in North America, your Corporate numbers look good but you must have seen something in the quarter. Was it slippage or smaller deal sizes? What made you rein in hiring? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, it was a lumpy \u2013 my favorite economic term here, it was a lumpy quarter from a growth perspective and we saw in August it felt like a pause. And I don't know if it was just CDW or a bigger economic issue, and that's really, Jayson, what caused us to say, you know what? We've got existing capacity. This is not talking about Dell and Kelway and that. This is on a pure organic basis. So we're going to just hold where we are. But then we did see a nice comeback in September and dripping into October, so felt pretty good about turning on the faucet again, so to speak. And that's why I'm pretty optimistic we're going to be able to get close to that 100-plus customer-facing coworkers that I've challenged the sales executives to deliver. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That sounds good and makes sense. And I wanted to follow up on the solutions business, so strong and more than offsetting some softness in transactions. But specifically the drivers there, it sounds like security and emerging storage were strong. Could you detail a little more what's going well in solutions and why it's expected to continue? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. So if you think about \u2013 I'll talk about the high-level categories. So NetComm which was \u2013 had a really strong quarter and I think that is in part driven by security as people upgrade, what I'll call, the physical part of their security infrastructure. I think that had a lot to do with the NetComm growth. We continue to have good growth in servers and storage in the mid- to high-single digits. I think some of the server growth is by people as we had a program focused on the expiration of 2003 last year. I think when you're engaged in those kind of discussions, whether the customer makes a decision right then or you plant the seed for some future upgrade. We are seeing interestingly enough in the server space, a lot of people taking advantage of upgrading with options, whether it's adding hardware or memory. That helps drive some of that growth, which means that some of the software investment people made in virtualizing and creating an incremental capacity is now being consumed. So that's all kind of goodness. And in the storage space, the, what I'll call, emerging technology people whether it's flash or if you consider CI part of that, those have been great growth engines for us and I think suggest that customers are always on this track to look for more efficient ways to manage the exponential growth in data that just is the nature of the world we live in would be the areas I would say. I also don't want to miss the constant, double-digit growth in our services business, which is an important part of the solutions story. And that's been pretty a Steady Eddie double-digit growth business for us and that's an important part of why solutions has continued to grow. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks a lot, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Jayson. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thank you again to everybody for taking the time to be with us today, and for your interest in CDW. And I'll leave you with this thought. It's Thanksgiving time, so go hug a turkey, they need it. All right, thanks, everybody. See you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Please note that all references to growth rates or dollar amount increases in our remarks today are versus the comparable period in 2014 unless otherwise indicated. In addition, all references to growth rates for hardware product, software and services, today represent organic net sales only and do not include the results from Kelway. The number of selling days for the fourth quarter and full-year are the same in both 2015 and 2014, so there is no difference in growth rates for average daily sales and reported sales for either period. A replay of this webcast will be posted to our website by this time tomorrow. I would also like to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. 2015 was a year of both strong financial performance and strategic progress. For the year, we delivered a net sales increase of 7.6% with excellent profitability. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 23.6%. On a constant currency organic basis, which excludes results from our August 2015 acquisition of Kelway, net sales increased 5.3%. Our performance in 2015 demonstrates the strength of our business model and highlights the power of our balanced channel portfolio, diverse product suite, and variable cost structure. Let me briefly walk through each of these and how they contributed to performance. First, the power of our balanced portfolio of five U.S. channels each with over $1 billion in annual net sales. In 2015, we had balanced performance across our two segments with both Corporate and Public increasing 5%. MedLar and Small Business each delivered mid single-digit growth. On our Public side, strong results from our Government business both from federal and state and local, offset flat sales in Education and lumpiness in Healthcare. On a constant currency basis, Canada grew mid single-digits. Second, our diverse product suite, of more than 100,000 products from over 1,000 leading and emerging brands, which ensures we are well positioned to meet our customers' needs, whether transactional or highly complex. As you will recall in 2014, we had strong client device demand from both XP exploration driven PC refresh and Common Core curriculum digital testing requirements. That led to client device sales of nearly 6 million notebooks and desktops, which drove strong transaction growth. This year, solutions grew more rapidly than transactions, continuing the acceleration we saw in the second half of 2014. With nearly double-digit increase for the year, solutions represented a more typical 50-50 split, up from the 47% they represented in 2014. This improved mix drove a higher gross margin. And that leads to the third element of our business model that drove performance this past year, our variable cost structure and focus on cost control. Between gross profits growing faster than net sales, our ongoing focus on cost control, and our conservative approach to hiring, we delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin for the year above our medium-term annual target. Interest expense reductions combined with share repurchases helped leverage our 12% increase in adjusted EBITDA to a 24% increase in non-GAAP EPS. These excellent results would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated and talented team of approximately 8,500 coworkers, including the nearly 1,000 new Kelway coworkers, who joined us in August. CDW coworkers are a true source of advantage in a highly competitive market and are a key reason why our business model is successful in delivering industry-leading performance year-after-year. Let me take briefly a second to turn to fourth quarter performance. Net sales were up 12.1% and we delivered excellent profitability. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.1% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 23.3%. On an organic constant currency basis, net sales increased 5.8% as currency shaved about 70 basis points off reported results. Corporate increased 3.9% with Small Business up 5%, and MedLar up 3.7%; Public increased 9.2%, led by Government's 16.5% increase. This reflected both continued strong federal results and excellent state and local growth. As expected, Healthcare was lumpy, posting a nice rebound in the quarter, up 10.2%. Education was down just over 1%. Higher ed declined mid-single digits, reflecting ongoing state budget issues. K-12 posted flat results as lower client device sales were offset by eRate-driven net comp spend. Our other category more than doubled in the quarter, reflecting the combined results of Kelway, Canada and Advanced Technology Services. Kelway delivered results in line with our expectations, contributing roughly 700 basis points to our consolidated fourth quarter growth. Sales were flat in local currency despite a challenging macro environment and last year's 20%-plus organic growth. Canadian sales were also flat in local currency, as slumping oil prices drove lower sales in western territories, which represent roughly a quarter of our Canadian sales. Strong solutions activity helped drive high single-digit growth in our Advanced Technology Services business. Continuing the trend we saw earlier in the year in the U.S., solutions picked up further momentum in the quarter increasing low teens and more than offset flat transaction sales. Hardware increased 4%, driven by solution categories including another quarter of nearly 20% growth in netcomm and high single-digit growth in servers. As expected, desktops declined. Notebooks and mobile devices were down slightly in the quarter as double-digit growth in Corporate was more than offset by declines in our Public segment. Our balanced portfolio helped deliver solid storage results. Storage increased mid single-digits. Excluding emerging technologies, storage would have declined high single-digits. Flash increased triple-digits. Software delivered an excellent quarter, up 11%, driven by security and network management. This strong performance more than offset the ongoing impact of a higher portion of revenues from SaaS sales and net service contract revenue, which are recorded at 100% gross margin and are netted down. Cloud adoption remained strong in the quarter for both software-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service with customer spend increasing significant double-digits. So as you can see, 2015 was a year of excellent financial performance. It was also a year of excellent strategic progress. For CDW, everything we do starts with our customers. What do they need and how can we meet that need. Our customers want to take advantage of all of the productivity and growth benefits integrated IT solutions provide, but given limited IT resources in the ever-increasing pace of IT change, they need help deciding what path to take and most importantly, they need help implementing the best solution. Our three-part strategy is designed to make sure that they turn to us, as their trusted adviser, an extension of their IT resources. In 2015, we made progress against all three of our strategies. Our first strategy is to gain share of wallet and acquire new customers. In 2015, we added international capabilities through our acquisition of Kelway. Kelway enables us to better serve existing customers with multinational needs and add new customers we may not have been able to serve in the past. Integration is moving along as planned, and we are seeing cross-national business build. To further, this next quarter, we will have an exchange of sales leaders, with a senior leader from CDWS, moving to London and one of Kelway coming to the United States. In October, to provide greater choice to our customers, we added Dell to our North American portfolio of products and services. As we shared last quarter, bringing on a partner of Dell's size requires significant work to ensure we deliver the same sales and customer experience we provide for all of our partners. This work is underway and our ramp program to bring them fully onboard is on plan. And throughout the year, to help customers and prospects understand the full breadth of our offerings, we hosted over 1,700 in-depth customer briefings, including site visits and tech seminars and maintained our ongoing drumbeat to optimize our sellers' books and enable them to sell more effectively. We made excellent progress against our first strategy in 2015. Though final market numbers are not yet available, given our performance, we estimate we grew faster than the U.S. IT market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points on an organic constant currency basis. Our second strategy is to continue to enhance our ability to deliver high growth integrated solutions. This is vital to our ability to stay relevant to our customers and requires that we invest the right resources and capabilities at the right time. In fact, it's not prudent for us to invest too far in front of adoption. Over the years, we've learned how to cost effectively enter new solution areas, build a beachhead and then leverage our success across key verticals. A great example of this is how we are moving forward with the Internet of Things. In 2015, we launched a pilot IoT practice with a partner funded investment in solution architects. This pilot resulted in an innovative solution for a food manufacturer in the Midwest that wanted to optimize its production processes and add new factory capabilities and strengthen quality control. Our IoT solution connected an array of devices, sensors, and systems throughout the production process. With real-time analytics, the customer can streamline production, improve inventory management and quality control, and increase security in operations. We are now leveraging our success from this engagement with other manufacturing customers and we intend to move into additional verticals. Like so many of the innovations in technology, the technology that drives the Internet of Things isn't new, the way it's integrated and the software layered on top is. We estimate that today we offer more than 85% of the components required to implement a full Internet of Things solution. What's exciting for us is that in the 85% we provide are solutions where we have a long history of helping customers harness the power of IT, like networking and security. In 2015, we continued to enhance our capabilities in security which not surprisingly is one of our fastest growing solution areas. In addition to launching our new CDW Threat Check version 2.0, we added several fast-growing security partners during the year, partners that are growing at triple-digit rates. To support our cloud business, we deployed a proprietary cloud provisioning platform that automates the fulfillment of select cloud services as well as provides customers with additional online purchase and service management capabilities. Staying ahead of the curve with new and innovative solutions for our customers remains a key priority for us. Another key priority for us is our third strategy, to expand our service capabilities. In 2015, we opened another market and now have technical specialists, service delivery and sales coworkers in more than 20 major U.S. metro markets. These markets are supported by a national traveling team and a nationwide partnership of OEMs and product partners and local service providers across the country. We also opened our new 24x7 Level I and Level II Enterprise Command Center that operates and manages customer IT infrastructure remotely. To help ensure we have a strong pool of technical resources in 2015, we expanded our associate engineering or our ACE Program to 85 coworkers including hot areas like information security. ACE is a true differentiator in our space as we bring on lower cost engineers and train them in the CDW way. Expanded service delivery capabilities underpin our first two strategies to capture market share and expand our solutions capabilities by enabling us to deliver end-to-end solutions. Our sellers develop and manage the customer relationships, identify the opportunities and bring the right combination of products and services to solve a customer problem. Our specialists work with the customers and partners to whiteboard the design, create a bill of materials for products and services required and draft the statement of work for the services. And our professional services and service delivery engineers install and maintain the solution. All of these workers that I've expressed are customer facing. So you can see that investing in customer facing coworkers is vital to our ongoing success, but just as we have built our knowledge about when to enter new solution areas, we have built our knowledge about when to calibrate our hiring. As you recall, we were conservative in our hiring for the first three quarters of the year and instead focused on absorbing the more than 150 new customer facing coworkers we added in 2014. You will also recall that to prepare for expected market share gains and incremental Dell revenues in 2016, we reignited hiring in November. Given excellent recruiting success, we ended up the year with more than 165 customer facing coworkers in line with our initial plan to add between 150 and 200. We like where this puts us given the uncertainty in the economy. Having these new hires on board gives us the flexibility to either absorb the capacity we have or add as the year moves along. We currently look to add between 50 and 75 new customer facing coworkers in 2016, but as always, we will closely monitor market conditions and adjust as appropriate. Let me close with a few thoughts about what we see for the demand picture in 2016. With 2014 client device headwind behind us, we expect continued balanced growth across solutions and transactions. In addition, we expect to benefit from ongoing success in Government from both public safety at the state and local level and federal program alignment. On the Education side, we expect more normal spending now that we have overcome 2014's headwinds and remaining 2015 eRate funds are spent and new 2016 funds come on line in the back half of the year. We are optimistic that state budget issues will get resolved. Healthcare is expected to remain lumpy with ongoing pressure on sales and profitability from industry consolidations. With the addition of Kelway and Dell to our portfolio, we look for Corporate to continue to build on its strong 2015 performance. Our current view of U.S. economic growth has us looking for 2% to 3% growth for the U.S. IT market with a slow ramp through the year. As you know, we hold ourselves accountable to outperform the market and continue to target organic constant currency growth of between 200 basis points and 300 basis points above the U.S. IT market. In addition, we look for our partnership with Dell to add an incremental 150 basis points. Just like the rest of our business, Dell results will depend on market conditions. For Kelway and Canada, we are targeting performance at least 200 basis points to 300 basis points better than their respective market in local currency. We currently expect IT growth in local currency for both markets to come in below the U.S. in the 1% to 2% range. As we always do, you should expect us to refine our views both for the market and our growth premium, as we move throughout the year. In 2016, you should also expect us to continue to execute our three-part strategy to ensure we will help our customers, navigate their options and maximize the return on their IT investments. As we do, we'll further penetrate our core customers and acquire new ones. This in turn will strengthen our relationships and importance to leading and emerging IT brands. By strengthening our value proposition to both customers and partners, and leveraging our business model, we intend to continue to profitably grow faster than the market, while generating superior returns, today and in the future. And with that, let me turn it over to Ann, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our fourth quarter and full-year financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, our breadth of product offerings, particularly our ability to bring innovative emerging technologies to our customers and our focus on profitable growth. They also reflect the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver double-digit earnings growth and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to the P&L, if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide eight. Consolidated top-line growth was excellent this quarter with net sales of $3.42 billion, 12.1% higher than last year, while sales in Canadian dollars remain a relatively small portion of our total net sales, less than 4%. The strengthening U.S. dollar continued to depress organic net sales. Currency shaved approximately 70 basis points off of organic growth in the quarter, 30 basis points more than last year and 10 basis points more than last quarter. On a constant currency basis, organic net sales were 5.8% higher than last year. On an organic average daily sales basis, sequential sales were down 3.1% versus Q3 2015, which is in line with our usual Q4 seasonality. Gross profit for the quarter increased 13.4% to $557.6 million. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 16.3%, up 20 basis points above last year. Kelway continues to favorably impact margin given its higher mix of solution and services and we continued to mix into revenue recorded at a 100% gross margin such as our net service contract revenue. As you know, net service contract revenue favorably impacts gross margin, but does temper revenue growth. Consolidated reported SG&A, including advertising expense, was $377.7 million, 15.3% higher than last year. Advertising expense increased 4.7% or $1.7 million in the quarter versus last year. As expected, we accelerated hiring in the quarter and you can see the impact of this on our consolidated adjusted SG&A excluding advertising, which grew faster than sales, increasing 13.4%. In addition to incremental coworkers, the SG&A increase was attributable to higher compensation due to ongoing mix into solutions and mix into Kelway, which has a higher SG&A as a percent of sales. Including advertising, adjusted SG&A increased 12.2% as you can see on the next slide, slide nine. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter excludes $11.2 million of non-cash equity compensation, $1.5 million of acquisition and integration expense and $2.1 million of historical retention costs and other expenses. Our non-cash equity compensation increased year-over-year, primarily due to ongoing annual long-term performance awards granted in Q1, incremental Kelway awards and performance against long-term incentive program target. To make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our gross profit, less adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. We converted top-line growth of just over 12% to adjusted EBITDA growth of 15.1% and delivered $257.5 million of adjusted EBITDA at a margin of 7.5%, up 20 basis points over last year. As expected, this margin was lower than our Q3 year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 10, interest expense was 21% lower than last year at $38.4 million, reflecting reductions driven by repayments and refinancing activities completed in 2014 and Q1 2015. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate was 37% compared to 35.4% for Q4 2014, which resulted in a tax expense of $52.4 million versus $28.3 million last year. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in state taxes. On a GAAP basis, we earned $89.3 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance, was $123.7 million in the quarter, up 21.1% over last year. As you can see on slide 11, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add-backs that fall in four general buckets : the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, non-cash equity compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and other non-recurring income or expenses. Our Q4 weighted average diluted shares outstanding was 170.1 million, so we delivered $0.73 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 23.3% over Q4 2014. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at an average price of $43.77 for a total of $48 million under our previously announced share repurchase program. 1 million shares were repurchased in the most recent block transaction and the remaining shares were repurchased on the open market. Quickly turning to full-year results on slide 12. Revenue was $13 billion, an increase of 7.6% and average daily sales grew to $51.1 million. Gross profit in 2015 was $2.1 billion. Gross profit margin was 16.3%, up 40 basis points from 2014. Adjusted SG&A, including advertising, increased 8.4% and we delivered full-year adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, 12.3% higher than last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for full-year 2015 was 7.8%, above our annual target of the mid-7% range. Non-GAAP net income for 2015 was $503.5 million versus $409.9 million, up 22.8% as operating results were amplified by lower interest expense, which decreased $37.8 million. Non-GAAP net income per share was up 23.6% at $2.93. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 13, on December 31, we had $37.6 million of cash and cash equivalent and net debt of $3.2 billion, $400.6 million more than at the beginning of the year, reflecting cash paid and debt consolidation related to the acquisition of Kelway. Net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA at the end of Q4 was three times, 0.1 turns less than the end of 2014. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.4%. Given today's uncertain interest rate environment, I'd like to remind you that our $1.5 billion floating rate note term loan facility has a 1% LIBOR floor, and we have $1.4 billion notional amount of 2% interest rate caps in place, which don't expire until Q1 2017. With the exception of an $88 million facility at Kelway, the remainder of our outstanding debt is fixed rate. So, approximately 94% of our outstanding debt is effectively fixed or hedged and rates would have to move significantly before they had a material impact on our interest costs. As you can see on slide 14, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q4. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 21 days, the same as last year's fourth quarter. Cash taxes paid in the quarter were $82.2 million and cash interest was $29.2 million. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow, plus the net change in our flooring agreement, less capital expenditures, was $9.6 million compared to $96.3 million in Q4 of 2014. As you recall, free cash flow in Q4 2014 was benefited by one-time items and timing, which pulled forward into that quarter roughly $100 million of free cash flow from Q1 2015. Reflecting the impact of some larger Public customer deals, where payment extended beyond year-end, our free cash flow was lighter than anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and our full-year free cash flow was $283.3 million or 2.2% of net sales. Adjusting for the pull-forward into 2014 of the $100 million of cash flow I just mentioned, we ended the year with adjusted free cash flow as a percent of sales for full-year 2015 at the high end of our target range of 2.5% to 3% of sales. We made excellent progress during the quarter on our capital allocation strategy. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the four following components, which you can see on slide 15. First, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases, we have set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over the next five years. For this quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.1075 per share on March 10 to shareholders of record as of February 25, up 59% from a year ago. Since the IPO, our dividends have more than doubled, and in 2015, we paid $53 million of dividends to our shareholders. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 times to 3 times. We ended 2015 at 3 times. Third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our Kelway investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. Our initial authorization in November 2014 was for $500 million. To-date, we have repurchased 6.3 million shares for $241.3 million at an average price of $38.57 per share. These capital allocation priorities support our 2016 to 2018 medium-term targets, which you see on slide 16. Similar to 2013 to 2015 targets, we continue to target growth of 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market. We also continue to target an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-7% range. Reflecting the conclusion of our initial refinancings and absence of earnings amplification from lower interest expense, starting in 2016 through 2018, our medium-term targets call for low-double-digit EPS growth. We intend to use share repurchases and accretive acquisitions to amplify operating results and help achieve this target. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our medium-term targets on an annual, not a quarterly basis. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those of you modeling our 2016 financials, I am on slide 17. We expect full-year organic constant currency growth within our annual medium-term target of 200 basis points to 300 basis points above U.S. IT market growth. Given current market volatility and overall macro uncertainty, we currently look for growth to be closer to 2% earlier in the year. As we continue to ramp our Dell business, we expect it to add up to 150 basis points of incremental growth, with revenue split roughly 40/60 between the first half and the second half of the year. Currency headwinds are expected to continue to have a roughly 70 basis points impact throughout 2016. Canadian currency will drive first half translation, while British pound/U.S. dollar will drive second half. This assumes average annual translation rates of C$1 to US$0.69 and US$1.42 to the pound. For seasonality, we expect to deliver sales roughly in line with our historical average first half/second half split of 48% to 49% in the first half and 51% to 52% in the second half. Remember, in 2016, we will have an extra sales day in Q1 and one less day in Q4. We expect Kelway first half contribution to be 650 basis points to 700 basis points to top-line growth. This is based on a conversion rate, which is about 6% lower than what we experienced in Q4 2015. Remember, second half 2016 revenues will include Kelway in the base. Turning to expenses, for the year, we expect adjusted SG&A to grow faster than consolidated sales. There are two main drivers of this : First, increased coworker count, consolidated coworkers, including Kelway, were approximately 8,500, up over 1,200 since the fourth quarter of 2014. We ended the year with approximately 7,500 North American coworkers, up roughly 270 coworkers since the end of 2014, with most of these coworkers added in the fourth quarter. Second, given Kelway's higher mix of services and solutions, sales compensation of a percentage of revenues will be higher. Keep in mind that based on the normal rhythm of our business, first quarter sales are typically sequentially below our fourth quarter. In addition, new coworkers added in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2015 will drive incremental expense. These factors, coupled with our normal revenue seasonality, will drive adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to run higher in the first half of the year than the second half. For the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin will likely be slightly below the low end of our full-year target range of mid-7%. For the full year, we expect to be at the high end of that target range. Moving down the P&L, including Kelway, we expect our full-year book interest to be about $155 million and our effective tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. Q1 interest expense is expected to be slightly lower than 2015 due to the refinancing activity we completed at the end of Q1 2015. Otherwise, interest expense will trend similarly in 2016 as the back half of 2015. There is no change to our intent to continue to make share repurchases under our existing authorization and we continue to target low-double-digit EPS growth, with this including our expectation that Kelway will deliver roughly $0.04 to $0.05 per quarter in the first half of 2016. Another item to note for your modeling, going forward in 2016, our Other category will be comprised of our international businesses, Kelway and Canada. Prior to 2016, Other included our CDW Advanced Technology Services business, which will now be included in our two segments, Corporate and Public. Advanced Technology Services runs under 2% of our North American sales, the majority of which are generated by our Corporate segment. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling our cash flows. First, we expect our annual cash flow to come in at the high end of our 2.5% to 3% of net sales target. Second, our capital expenditures will be about 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. We also expect to continue to maintain our cash conversion cycle within our target range of the low to mid 20 days for 2016. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 37% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $45 million per quarter. In addition, we continued to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually related to cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. That concludes the financial summary. Before we open for Q&A, let me briefly address the SEC investigation we disclosed last quarter, relating to vendor partner program incentives. We continue to fully cooperate with the SEC, and although we cannot predict the outcome, based on what we know to date, we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on the company. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up? Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may begin. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks and good morning. Tom, in regard to your commentary regarding cloud adoption and the acceleration of SaaS application sales, we've seen similar commentary from several of your vendors and distributors, and concern about legacy hardware demand. Do you have similar concerns? Or are you capturing that revenue in different ways such as from emerging products or selling a SaaS application, cloud services, et cetera, and do you see that accelerating further this year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for your question. Yes, first of all, let's start with kind of the premise that despite our success, we still only have 6% of the addressable market. So I think that's a great starting point. Yes, we do expect our cloud success to continue. It's of interest to customers, but I think I've said this at least for the last three years or four years, I do believe that customers will settle in on a hybrid model for their IT infrastructure, and as such that will include parts of the platform being on-prem. If you think about our results this quarter, Matt, I think it's an interesting example. Servers grew very nicely in the quarter, which indicates that you can have both and you will have both as customers kind of look at workloads and make the decision where the workload is best positioned. I think if you look at our storage results this quarter, mid-single digits, a lot of that driven by emerging technology. If you think about converged infrastructure, which I would argue is kind of an on-prem response in some ways to a pure cloud model, I think you've got lots of opportunities. And then the last one is think about the netcomm. We've had this drumbeat going, if you will, on successful netcomm growth \u2013 meaningful successful netcomm growth. So I think all of those can co-exist and it's especially exciting for us, because we still have a relatively small percent of the overall addressable market. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. That's helpful. And on the Education market, you talked about the puts and takes there with the hardware slowing but eRate picking up. Do you see more of the same this year or will there be an equal offset and you won't get much growth from that market? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think, it's best, Matt, to actually break it into the two subcomponents, because each of them have a little different dynamics going on. If you think about K-12, a lot of what was a real challenge from a growth perspective to that group this year was the bizarre success they had in 2014 and most of it driven by Common Core curriculum. So as many of you pointed out to us when we were on the road last year, how are you going to grow on top of that, that now is kind of behind that group. I think another interesting thing, and you saw it in the results in the quarter, is as the eRate funds begin to flow that you see an increase in solutions business. And so K-12 had a nice quarter in some of the, what we would call, data center products, be they netcomm, be they servers and storage. And so we would expect that balance to be more representative going forward and as you also know. And I don't want to become an expert on eRate here, but the eRate of 2015 is still being deployed and we're yet beginning the eRate process for 2016. So you will look at that as a great opportunity for the people in K-12. If you go to higher-ed, it's a function of a lot of those institutions depend on state funds. And I think some of what you saw in the last half of last year was just directly tied to state funding. I know I serve on the board of a higher education institution. That certainly was a challenge for that institution, and we're anticipating that that's going to get resolved sometime during the year and things will return to normal in higher-ed. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Kugele with Needham. You may begin. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Rich. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Good to see the leverage in the quarter. I wanted to just ask specifically then about the broader IT spending market in the U.S. You said that you thought that it would be closer to 2% and then I suppose ramping as the year goes on to the 3% range. Can you just talk about where you might be seeing the weakness to back that up or do you think it's more of a high-end enterprise problem? Any comments on that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, I think, look, if you just think about the mixed economic signals here in the last probably 30 days or 60 days, on the strong side, you've got the labor market, you've got unemployment, you've got gas prices, you've got all of those things that would typically drive the consumer spending. But at the same time, as you guys know you've got weakness in manufacturing and the oil industry and you've got kind of general macro worldwide economic concern, and I think you just sense. Now, I don't have a statistic, Rich, but you just sense a little bit of angst and we think while that's angst driven by the financial markets, we do think it causes people to be a little more thoughtful and cautious. But you also, I think, have confidence that as we move through the year, we kind of get some stability that we'll get back to that 3% range. So it's more of what do we sense. If you're asking like are customers coming to us saying, we're delaying our decisions, I would say it's not that stark. I think there are people just being more cautious right now as we kind of see how this plays out. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, is any of that causing you to change your inventory buying or are you trying to play things little closer to give yourself a little bit more flexibility or do you think your own plan is sufficient? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, look, we're pretty thoughtful about that on an ongoing basis, Rich, and so we are going to be opportunistic where it makes the sense to do that from an inventory standpoint. And so much of the business today doesn't necessarily just come into the warehouse, whether it's because it's customized or it's driven by software, that isn't quite kind of the big challenge it probably was five years ago. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Excellent. Well done. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Rich. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Couple of questions for me. First off, just to start off with the Dell relationship. I'm wondering, as you go beyond 2016 and the $200 million contribution, do you think it kind of stabilizes at these revenue run rates or is there a bigger ramp up beyond the $200 million you're going to see this year with them? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Amit. Look, I think it obviously continues to grow. I think Michael put the number out there, a $1 billion, which I told him thanks a lot. But we do see the relationship expanding and again not necessarily at the cost of our other partners, because at 5% or 6% market share, there's lots of opportunity for us. I think we're trying to be thoughtful about it, because of the customers' expectation of what we deliver and wanting to do it right. And so we think that kind of 2016, if you will, will be kind of the first full year of the ramp. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And I guess, Ann, you talked about fiscal 2016 EBITDA margins to be at the higher end of the target range, I assume kind of high-7%s, close to 8%. This would be the second year in a row you're well above the target range which you guys have talked about. I'm curious I mean do you think do we start to think about your EBITDA margins as high-7%s to 8% longer term? Or you don't want to go that far quite yet? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: No, we actually think we'll be within our target range in 2016 of the mid-7% range, which we defined as 7.4% to 7.6%. So we do actually expect \u2013 because of investments in SG&A, we do expect the adjusted EBITDA margin to be lower in 2016 than it was in 2015 and at the high-end of our medium-term target range. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Fair enough. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Amit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. You may begin. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hi, Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. A couple of questions if I could. Just kind of curious if you could talk about how we should think about the contributions to revenue growth in 2016 versus 2015 from your emerging vendors' bucket versus your more traditional vendors' bucket? And I have a follow-up. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. Gee, it's tough to quantify that for you, Mark, truthfully. I think if you think about it by product family, obviously in the storage business, you continue to see this incredible growth, that is offsetting some of the legacy products and it produced in the quarter, what, mid-single-digit. So, I think that's probably representative of where most of the emerging players are coming from with the exception of security where we, as I think mentioned in the script, continue to add new security partners and the growth rates are triple-digits. It's not necessarily that way in every one of the product suites where you have an influx, it really is in specific product areas and right now, we're seeing most of the emerging vendors in converged infrastructure, storage, if you keep that as a separate category, and software, I think, are where the biggest new players are. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up on the commentary today around services and just the increased SG&A related to the services thrust going forward, how should investors think about kind of the multi-year tail there in terms of \u2013 is there really a nice deeper penetration in terms of the current revenue opportunities as you think about the services, engagements kind of taking full strides one to two years out? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, look... Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And with deeper penetration of the wallet? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Well, from a penetration of wallet, Mark, you're kind of dead-on to the strategy so to speak is that if you think about our historic legacy, which was predominantly kind of a hardware driven and you think about the evolution of technology, the more dominating position software is playing, even in hardware like network is a great example or netcomm. And then you expand it to kind of the issue for our customers, this is IT resource issue and the need to have a partner that can take on some of those implementation and service activities, we would expect that to become an increasingly large part of our business and you add on top of that, cloud computing, which you could argue is more of a services play. I think you should look to and we expect the services business and therefore the good margins, which is implied that go with that business to be an increasing part of our profile going forward. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Matthew N. Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. So I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into where you stand with the integration of Kelway relative to your plan, both in terms of increasing share with your existing customers as well as the opportunity to add in new customers? And then related to that, I just wanted to know what the experience so far has really taught you about the potential to \u2013 potentially further expand internationally in the future? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Well, Matt, first as I think I alluded to in the script, the integration itself is on plan and going well. And more specifically, you heard me mention that the cross business is building, so to speak, cross-border business. Just to give you a perspective, since we started this process, I can tell you we've got 10 or 11 pretty significant deals that have come as a result of this integration and it's generated north of $50 million in business. So as we would have expected, you're beginning to see the momentum build. Having said that, I think we're still at the tip of the iceberg, only because we are being pretty careful about the customers and what they're looking for and how we respond to those customers, just because the subject of international can be \u2013 if you just say, are you in the international business that can be a pretty large part of the world, so to speak, and so we're being thoughtful. If you remember, Kelway is a UK-dominant company at this point with, I think I'd shared last time about 90% of their revenue is coming from the UK. But they have built a hub-and-spoke strategy, where they have locations in other parts of the world and that will be the way we will continue to expand our capabilities is by following that kind of hub-and-spoke expansion. And typically, it's done by following a customer to a particular area and then using that to expand in the area. Matthew N. Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then as a follow-up. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the PC market right now and what you're expecting out of that going into 2016? And also just what level of client interest you're seeing right now around Windows 10? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, let me take the second one first. And keep me honest here, if I don't answer the first one second. So, on Windows 10, I think there's a decent amount of interest. I think though, Matt, what they're doing is following their normal refresh cycle. And when the opportunity presents itself then they would implement Windows 10. I don't believe it's a kind of full course spread, let's go get it done now, it's more of we're on this normal cycle, it appears to be from many different vantage points, it provides power and different efficiencies, but it's not a \u2013 if you're thinking about is it a massive tailwind, the way Windows XP expiration was, I would say no, the word I've used is, it's going to be a gentle breeze at our back. The second thing is, this year was an interesting year for us in the client devices, especially notebooks, and to a equal degree, tablets, because we had that incredible 2014. If you think about it, even from a notebook and mobile device perspective, on top of \u2013 I think in 2014, that category grew something like 36% or some ridiculous number, this year we were in the mid-single digits. So I think pretty impressive considering that we would expect it to continue to be kind of a normal part of the growth trajectory. In fact, I tell people all the time, even before 2014, if you look at our performance in client devices in 2011 and 2012, even when all people reporting death of the PC, et cetera, et cetera, that continued to be a growth business for us, a steady growth business. We have no reason to believe that's not going to be the case continuing going forward. Matthew N. Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. You may begin. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, good morning. Tom, just focusing on the first half of the year and looking at the guidance you gave. It looks like you are expecting revenue to be up around 12%, if I take all the components that you messaged market up to share gain, Dell, Kelway and add it all up. I just want to make sure we're on the same page that you're looking for low double-digit growth, because consensus is closer to about 14%. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Are you talking about at a consolidated level, that's what you're talking about? Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Consolidated sales in the first half year. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: And, I think you have to start with, Brian. I think even as you noted in some of your published material is that we originally built the original targets on a 3% and we're saying we think it's going to start at 2%. That has a corresponding impact all the way through the business, nothing has changed about how we feel about Kelway, nothing has changed about how we feel about Canada. I think you also though have to then consider the currency impact which is obviously a little different than it was and if you kind of take those two things out of the equation, I think it looks pretty much exactly the way we stated so that hopefully gets you squared with the number. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yep. That's helpful. And then Ann, just to follow-up on DSOs up six days I think year-over-year. How much of that was driven by the impact of net revenue accounting as you go more to services, et cetera and the mix that affects DSOs, how much of it was that versus an actual underlying increase in DSOs, I know you talked about extending payment terms to large customers, should we expect that to continue? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah, a couple of things. It was really on the Public side of the business. Public had significant strength in Q4 and in general our Public customers have longer DSOs than the Corporate side of the business. So that was the impact I was referring to; in particular, we had some large deals where payment extended into 2016. You get eRate business for example, which just takes longer to collect because of all the administrative burden associated with it. In your first question, if you're looking at the impact of netted down revenue so to speak, a very high level way to look at that is to look at the corresponding increase in DPO because remember it causes DSO to go up and it also causes DPO to go up in a way that generally offsets it. So at a very high level if you look at the change there, that will be the part that will be attributed to netting down and then the rest would be the mix into Public. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thank you. I wanted to get a little more detail on the strength you're seeing in the storage segment. It sounded obviously like the emerging segments are seeing growth and I know you mentioned converged, but are you seeing an increased adoption of flash-based storage at your customers, is that transition accelerating? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes, Sherri, I think in the script I actually remember the numbers, triple-digit growth, in our flash business. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So, your instincts are right on, it is becoming like any other new technology, the more it gets deployed, the more costs come down, the greater customers deploy the technology. And so, it is driving a big part of the emerging growth in our business, which has at this point more than offset the, what I will call the legacy business. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then, I just wanted to circle back on the services business and the recurring aspect of that. I guess when I think about your services, I think of it more as helping customers adopt new technologies, but not necessarily as a recurring service like a traditional service. Can you maybe help us think about that and maybe gauge how to think about how it recurs? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I can help, I think that's a great question, because it does sometimes get lost in the shuffle so to speak. If you looked at it today, the lion's share of our services business is kind of project management driven, right, that's implementing a netcomm solution for somebody, but if you think about areas like infrastructure-as-a-service, remote network management and monitoring, some of the SaaS products, those are all more in the what I'll call recurring revenue stream even though that today still isn't pure Sherri, because I think people are still adopting to how do I deliver a recurring revenue capability. But I would tell you my instincts are that over time, that will increase, now I don't know what the pace is going to be, but I do see if you just think about us building our command center, it was to address an ongoing opportunity in remote network management and monitoring and that is more of a recurring revenue service capability. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, thanks Sherri. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I'm going to turn the call back over to Mr. Richards for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks again everybody for taking the time this morning. I appreciate your questions and your interest in CDW. And I'm going to close with, it's Valentine's Day and Sari holds her breath when we get to this part of the call. So for all you guys out there, don't blow it, you'll pay for it for a long time. And if I can appeal to your emotional quotient, I read yesterday that $13 billion are spent on Valentine's Day. So from an economic perspective, please contribute to the economy. Thanks everybody. See you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. We had a good start to the year as we successfully leveraged the strength of our business model to deliver excellent profitability on solid top line growth. Consolidated net sales were $3.1 billion, up 11.4% above last year. Organic constant currency average daily sales, which exclude the results from our acquisition of UK solutions provider Kelway, increased 3.5%. Gross profit increased 14.9% to $525 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.4% to $233 million and non-GAAP net income per share increased 18.5% to $0.67 per share. These results reflect the impact of three key drivers this quarter. Our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product and solutions suite, and the impact of mix on our profitability. First, our balanced portfolio. We have five U.S. channels each generating an estimated $1 billion or more in annual sales. Our UK and Canadian operations add another $1 billion plus of geographically diverse annual sales. The benefit of this balance was clearly evidenced across the business this quarter. Reflecting the anticipated slower start to the year that we shared with you on our last earnings call, corporate sales increased 3.4%, results were balanced with MedLar up 3.5% and Small Business up 3.2%. As expected, we saw pockets of industry weakness with a generally overall slower economic picture. Public increased 3.5%. Government results were excellent, up 13.7% reflecting ongoing success in meeting public safety needs at the state and local level and program alignment at the federal level. As expected, healthcare increased 1.3% as customers continued their focus on reducing cost as part of merger consolidations and ongoing reimbursement pressure. Education decreased 2.8%; K-12 was down just over 1% while higher-ed was down high single digits. Higher-ed continued to be impacted by large state budget log jams and ongoing budget prioritizations. K-12 delivered excellent increases in infrastructure based on solutions, including netcom and storage, which offset a decline in client devices and accessories. Our Canadian and UK business, which we report together as other, combined to deliver just over $350 million this quarter. UK contributed roughly $230 million. They had an excellent quarter growing low double-digits in local currency. The first calendar quarter is typically a strong quarter in the UK; as they benefit from March fiscal year-end spend by both public and many corporate customers. Canada overcame ongoing macro softness in the West from depressed oil prices, increasing mid single-digits in local currency. However, while moderating in impact, currency continued to provide headwinds for Canada and they posted a 5% decline in U.S. dollars. The second driver of our results, was our broad product and solution suite, with more than 100,000 products and solutions backed by deep technical resources, we help our customers across the entire spectrum of IT needs. This was evident in our balanced organic growth across solutions and transactional sales, both increasing between 3% and 4%. Public solutions increased low double-digits, while transaction sales were flat. Corporate performance was the opposite, with solutions flat and transactional sales up high single-digits. On a net sales basis, hardware was up 3%, software increased 7% and services increased 9%. Adoption of new form factors helped drive high single-digit increases in notebooks and mobile devices, which were partially offset by a slight decline in desktops. Overall, client devices increased mid single-digits. Storage also increased mid single-digits. We saw solid increases from more traditional partners, as well as continued benefit from emerging names. Flash storage remains strong; in fact, flash delivered roughly 5% of total organic growth in the quarter. As more and more of our customers adopt collaboration solutions and digital communication, video equipment, including digital signage, delivered a double-digit increase in the quarter. Our contribution from Dell was as expected, and we are moving along as planned with our ramp activities. Server solutions, which includes the server box plus the software and services tied to servers, increased mid-single digits. On a standalone basis, server hardware declined as virtualization and memory options expand existing capacity, you should expect to see more lumpiness in server hardware results. Network hardware growth was low single digits. This reflected both product cycle timing and a greater portion of solutions coming from software as evidenced by network management software's high single digit growth. This move to a greater percentage of solutions coming from software helped drive continued excellent results in other software categories, including security software and server virtualization. We also saw continued excellent results in cloud-based software as a service. Our cloud practice continued to grow at a rapid clip, with first quarter customer cloud spend up over 50%. Since cloud revenues are booked on a net basis, cloud was a strong contributor to our gross profit line. Given the size of our base, cloud gross profit is a small, but growing piece of our total gross profit. In fact, for the first quarter of 2016, the percentage of organic gross profit that cloud represented increased 5%, up nearly 100 basis points over the first quarter of 2015. Rapid cloud growth contributed to overall software profitability. First quarter gross profit from software grew at a faster rate than sales. Nearly double-digit services growth was primarily driven by warranties and CDW-delivered services, including the impact from a new market we opened last year. Excellent growth in the quarter from software as a service and warranties resulted in higher mix of 100% gross margin revenues, which we call net service contract revenues, or NSCR. And that leads us to the final driver of our results this quarter, the impact of mix on our profitability. An essential element of our long-term success has been our ability to consistently deliver profitable growth. This quarter's results were an excellent example of how the mix of our business influences our ability to achieve this goal. We have a long history of profitable growth; an important reason for that is our focus and discipline in the market that is underpinned by our compensation structure. Since our sellers are compensated on gross profit, they aren't incented to constantly chase low margin deals. This quarter, product sales grew slower than SCR. Since NSCR sales are booked net and translate into 100% gross margin, this mix shift drove improved gross margin and excellent profitability in the quarter. In addition to delivering profitable growth during the quarter, we made good progress against all three of our strategic priorities. Our first strategy is to take market share through further penetrating existing customers and acquisition of new customers. Our second strategy is to continue to expand our already strong solutions offerings, which include virtualization, collaboration, security, mobility, data center and cloud computing. Our third strategic priority is to continue to enhance our service capability. Service capability underpin many solutions and are a key way we add value to both customers and partners and gain market share. Reinforcing our brand position is an important way we increase customer penetration and attract new customers. During the first quarter, we rolled out our new brand campaign called Orchestration. Orchestration focuses on our role as a trusted adviser and highlights the unique role we play with our customers. It is not focused on what we sell, but rather how we serve. It's not focused on our products, but how we bring them together to help our customers achieve their goals. Our ability to orchestrate IT is possible because of the investments we have made in people and solutions to evolve with the market. By executing against our strategy, we have built deep technical expertise and a broad solutions portfolio with nationwide services and multi-national capabilities. Our ability to orchestrate IT is also possible, because of our deep understanding of the unique needs of our customers. By sub-segmenting the market and aligning the resources around key verticals and geographies, we build deep industry knowledge that helps us not only meet but anticipate customer needs. Let me share a recent solution that epitomizes how we do this in our state and local business, which, as you know, has been a standout performer for several years. A western state passed legislation designed to reduce incarceration and recidivism rates. Their goal was two-fold: improve the lives of its citizens and save money for tax payers by prioritizing prison space for serious and violent offenders, and improving and expanding treatment services. Prioritization and service decisions will be facilitated by pre-incarceration interviews for every person arrested. Since interviewing every newly arrested person is a significant undertaking, grant funds were included in the legislation to help local authorities accomplish this. Here's where CDW came in; we brought together endpoint hardware, cloud-based collaboration using a secure and encrypted cloud, and managed services to help local authorities overcome some of the complexity and cost of implementing the legislation. With our solution, trained interviewers conduct evaluation interviews from centralized locations, or hubs so local authorities don't have to dedicate resources at every jail. And local law enforcement doesn't need dedicated IT personnel to install, train and maintain the system since it is all handled by CDW. This solution is on track to deliver nearly $200,000 of annual revenues, while helping us solve an important societal issue; a great example of the power of Orchestration. In April, we introduced our Orchestration campaign to customers in the UK with print, digital, out of home components including taxi, rail and office signage. This was an important step in our acquisition strategy. As you know, we made the acquisition to further our ability to better meet the needs of our U.S.-based multinational customers and acquire new multinational customers. It's a protect-and-grow strategy and one dependent on delivering a consistent experience for our customers regardless of where they are located. One element to this strategy is to leverage the power of the CDW brand across markets. So in April, we flipped the switch to rebrand the entire Kelway organization to CDW. To-date, we have rebranded the website, office decor, packaging, sales collateral and e-mail addresses for the entire organization. Of course, delivering that consistent customer experience is a major initiative and requires much more than a name change. And, as with any other major initiative, it will take time to do it right \u2013 time to build the reputation, time to develop the systems and process alignment, as well as implement the training required to deliver that constant one company experience for all of our coworkers, customers and partners across the U.S., Canada, UK, Ireland, South Africa, Asia and Australia. In the meantime, we continue to benefit from our cross national capabilities and continue to see referral business grow. A great example of this is the success we are having with a U.S.-based shared economy company. We originally helped them with data center solutions in the U.S. They liked our approach and asked us to help them implement the same solution in other markets. Because of our multinational presence through CDW UK, we've been able to help this customer implement the same solution in Asia, Europe and Australia. A clear demonstration of the value of a consistent IT solutions experience across a company's infrastructure and how our capabilities result in greater share of wallet. To-date, this customer has generated more than $10 million in incremental revenue outside the U.S. and we have cemented a long-term relationship with this U.S.-based customer. During the quarter, we continued to invest in customer-facing coworkers. Adding new customer-facing coworkers is vital to our ability to continually enhance our capabilities to anticipate and meet our customers' needs. We added 50 customer-facing North American coworkers in the quarter in line with the 2016 plan we shared with you last quarter for adding between 50 and 75 customer-facing coworkers during 2016. We also added another 55 customer-facing coworkers in the UK to further support their growth, primarily in services. With what we are seeing in the market right now, this feels like the right level for the year. Our focus now is on boarding and driving productivity for the 275 customer-facing coworkers we have added since last year's third quarter. Of course, just as we always do, we will monitor the marketplace and adjust our hiring plans up or down as needed. And that leads to our expectations for the rest of the year. You'll recall that on our last call we indicated we thought the U.S. IT market growth would be between 2% and 3% in 2016, ramping with improved economic activity as we move through the year. At this time, given what we are seeing in the market, we continue to expect that pattern to play out. We expect education to improve as we move through the year as remaining 2015 E-Rate funds are spent and new 2016 funds begin to flow. Higher-ed has a number of initiatives that are designed to leverage states with greater available funds, as well as help institutions leverage every IT dollar spent. And while it is still early, we are seeing signs of some budget log jams breaking. We expect healthcare to be a low growth market in 2016, as the industry focuses on cost savings and budgets remain under pressure from lower reimbursement. Governments should continue to perform, but at a slower clip, as we now are lapping last year's double-digit growth. Since corporate is more correlated to U.S. macro trends, we expect to see improvement as we move through the year and we'll remain laser-focused on finding opportunities to ensure we continue to outperform the market. We look for small business to continue to execute well, although we remain watchful for changes in customer buying behavior stemming from real or perceived worsening economic conditions. In UK and Canada, the expectations remain the same, grow at least 200 basis points to 300 basis points above local market growth, which we continue to see in the 1% to 2% range for both countries. Canada will continue to focused on covering growth opportunities to offset macroeconomic pressures in the Western territories. We continue to look for UK to deliver 650 basis points to 700 basis points of total growth in the first half of the year. Given first quarter performance, we expect to be at the high end of this range. In addition, we continue to look for Dell to ramp its contribution as we move through the year, to the end of the year, at roughly 150 basis points. As you recall, UK and Dell growth is incremental to our organic constant currency growth, which we continue to target at 200 basis points to 300 basis points above the U.S. IT market. As this is our practice, we will update our view on the market growth as we move through the year. Now, let me turn it over to Ann, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our first quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, breadth of product offerings, and focus on profitable growth. They also reflect the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver double-digit earnings growth and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to our P&L, if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide seven. Consolidated top-line growth was excellent this quarter with net sales of $3.1 billion, 13.1% higher than last year on a reported basis and 11.4% on an average daily sales basis, as there was one more selling day this quarter than last year. Average daily sales were $48.7 million. While Canada represents a relatively small portion of our total net sales at just over $120 million this quarter, Canadian dollar translation continues to impact our organic net sales growth, shaving approximately 40 basis points off of organic growth in the quarter, 20 basis points less than the first quarter of last year, and 30 basis points less than last quarter. On a constant currency basis, organic net sales were 3.5% higher than last year. Organic sequential sales were down 11.4% on an ADS basis versus Q4 2015, which is slightly higher than our historical Q1 to Q4 sequential decline. Gross profit for the quarter increased 14.9% to $524.5 million. Gross margin in the first quarter was 16.8%, 25 basis points above last year. Product margin declines were more than offset by our higher mix of net service contract revenues, including 10 basis points from SaaS and higher vendor partner funding. Turning to SG&A on slide eight, as expected, consolidated reported SG&A, including advertising expense, grew faster than sales coming in 19.2% higher than last year. This reflects the impact of more than 300 incremental North American coworkers added since first quarter of 2015, incremental CDW UK SG&A and a 16% increase in advertising, including costs related to our new Orchestration campaign. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter, which also grew just over 19%, excludes $8.4 million of non-cash equity compensation, $1.6 million of acquisition and integration expense, and $2.7 million of other miscellaneous adjustments, including a favorable resolution of a local sales tax matter and office consolidation expenses. The non-cash equity compensation increase reflects ongoing long-term annual performance awards granted in Q1, incremental CDW UK awards and performance against long-term incentive program targets. To make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our gross profit less adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased $7.2 million in Q1 versus last year, primarily due to the UK acquisition. Depreciation and other amortization increased $3.6 million, primarily due to our new office locations and the inclusion of CDW UK. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $232.7 million, up 10.4%. As expected, our adjusted EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points year-over-year to 7.5%. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 9, interest expense was 14.9% lower than last year at $38.1 million, reflecting reductions driven by repayments and refinancing activities completed in Q1 of 2015. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate was 37.2% compared to 37.1% in last year's Q1, which resulted in a tax expense of $46.1 million versus $32.3 million. On a GAAP basis, we earned $77.8 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance, was $112.7 million in the quarter, up 15.5% over last year. As you can see on slide 10, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add-backs that fall into four general buckets : the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, non-cash equity compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and other non-recurring income or expense. With Q1 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 169 million, which is roughly 1 million shares fewer than Q4, we delivered $0.67 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 18.5% over the prior year. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 11, on March 31, we had $248.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3 billion, $271 million more than a year ago, reflecting cash paid and debt consolidation as part of the acquisition of CDW UK. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. Net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 2.8 times, within our target range. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.4%. Given today's uncertain interest rate environment, I'd like to remind you that our $1.5 billion floating rate term-loan facility has a 1% LIBOR floor, and we have $1.4 billion notional amount of 2% interest rate caps in place, which don't expire until Q1 2017. With the exception of an $83 million facility at CDW UK, the remainder of our outstanding debt is fixed rate. So approximately 95% of our outstanding debt is effectively fixed or hedged and rates would have to move significantly before they had a material impact on our interest costs. As you can see on slide 12, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q1. Note that when we have a higher proportion of sales being netted down, we see increases in both DSO and DPO. This is because sales are booked net, but receivables reflect the gross billings to the customer, while payables are matched against zero cost of goods sold. Both measures increase and essentially the impact is a wash; that's why we focus on our cash conversion cycle, because this is the best measure of our working capital efficiency. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 20 days, down one day versus last year's first quarter and at the low end of our target range. Cash taxes paid for the quarter were $6.8 million and cash interest was $44.1 million. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures, was $350.1 million compared to $125.4 million in Q1 of 2015. As you recall, free cash flow in Q1 2015 was $100 million lower than normal due to one-time items and timing which pulled forward roughly $100 million of free cash to Q4 2014. This year's organic performance is more consistent with our typical pattern where we see strong cash flow in the first quarter due to our sequential sales decline from Q4 and payment of Q1 cash taxes in Q2. In addition, this quarter we had the incremental impact of CDW UK cash flow. During the quarter, we made excellent progress on our capital allocation strategy, and we repurchased 3 million shares for $118 million at an average cost of $39.29 per share. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you can see on slide 13. First, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases, in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.1075 per share on June 10 to shareholders of record as of May 25, up 59% from a year ago. Since the IPO, our dividends have more than doubled. Second, ensure that we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 times to 3.0 times. We ended Q1 at 2.8 times. Third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. In the first quarter, UK contributed roughly $0.05 per share, in line with our expectations. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. We had an initial authorization of $500 million November 2014 and through the end of the first quarter this year, we had $141 million remaining of that authorization. To further support this priority, our Board of Directors have authorized a $750 million increase to our share repurchase program. These capital allocation priorities support our 2016 to 2018 medium-term targets, which you see on slide 14. Similar to those in place for 2013 to 2015, we are targeting growth of 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market and an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid 7% range. Reflecting the conclusion of our initial refinancings and absence of earnings amplification from lower interest expense, our 2016 through 2018 medium-term annual targets call for low double-digit EPS growth. We intend to use share repurchases and accretive acquisitions to amplify operating results and help achieve this target. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our medium-term target on an annual, not on a quarterly, basis. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those of you modeling the rest of our 2016 financials. I am on slide 15. Based on Q1 results and expectations for the rest of the year, we look for the balance of sales between first half and second half to be generally consistent with our normal seasonality, roughly 48% to 52% weighted towards the back half of the year. As we shared with you on our last call, we look for Dell to contribute up to 150 basis points in 2016 with revenues split 40%, 60% between the first half and second half. There is no change to our expectation that CDW UK will contribute between 650 basis points and 700 basis points in the first half. However, given first quarter performance, we expect to be nearer to the high end of that range. Also, there is no change to our expectations that currency impact for the full year will be very roughly 70 basis points. Canadian currency will drive first half translation, while the British pound, U.S. dollar will drive second half. This assumes the same average annual translation rates we shared last quarter of C$1 equal to US$0.69 and US$1.42 to the pound. Moving down the P&L, we expect gross margin percentage to be lighter for the balance of the year as margin mix reverts back to a higher percentage of product versus NSCR. We continue to look for adjusted SG&A to grow faster than sales due to increased coworker count and related coworker expenses as well as CDW UK sales compensation impact due to its higher mix of services and solutions. We continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin to come at the high end of our medium-term annual target of the mid 7% range. With the impact of our last refinancing in March of 2015 anniversaried, year-to-go booked interest per quarter will run in line with Q1 at roughly $38 million per quarter. We also expect year-to-go depreciation and amortization and non-cash equity compensation to run similar to Q1 at roughly $62 million per quarter and roughly $8 million per quarter, respectively. We continue to look for our 2016 booked tax rate to be in the 37% to 38% range. There is no change to our buyback strategy of repurchasing shares to both offset dilution and contribute to earnings growth. Our target of low double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth this year remains the same, with CDW UK contributing roughly $0.04 to $0.05 in the second quarter and then becoming part of the base at the anniversary in Q3. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling cash flows. We continue to look for capital expenditures to come in at roughly 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. For free cash flow, we continue to expect to be at the high end of 2.5% to 3% of net sales. Keep in mind that our second quarter tends to be the lightest cash flow quarter of the year. This reflects our payment of estimated cash taxes for the first quarter and second quarter and increased working capital needs to support what is typically our highest quarterly sequential sales increase. We have made excellent progress in managing our working capital and you should look for us to maintain our cash conversion cycle within our target range of the low to mid-20%s for 2016. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 37% range to be applied to pre-tax booked income, before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $47.5 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. That concludes the financial summary. Before we open it up for Q&A, let me briefly address the SEC investigation we disclosed last year relating to vendor partner program incentives. As we shared with you last quarter, we continue to cooperate fully with the SEC and, although we cannot predict the outcome, based on what we know to date, we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on the company. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up? Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Matt Cabral from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. On last quarter's call, Tom, you talked about some macro volatility that was causing your customers to be a little bit more cautious at the start of the year, did that change at all as you went through the quarter? And then how would characterize your customers' current views on the macro and how that impacts their setting patterns today relative to how they were thinking about it three months ago? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Matt, I would tell you one of the things that I think is a benefit to the CDW business model is the diversification of segments, and so the answer to that question kind of depends on the segment you're thinking about. The segment that probably ties the most to the macro-economic marketplace is our corporate segment, and as you heard me state, it feels like there's still in caution out there. And I think even within our corporate segment, you can see differences in different parts of the country depending on which industries they support. For example, our West Coast gang was continued to be fairly optimistic; the people that handled the oil and gas part of the world continue to be conservative. So I think it's mixed, and it still feels like there's a dose of caution out there. I don't know that there was a dramatic change as we kind of move through the quarter. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then as a follow up, it's been about nine months or so since you closed the Kelway acquisition, what's your current appetite for further tuck-in acquisitions and are there any particular areas that you're focused on? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Our current appetite is, we've got all we can eat right now on integrating CDW UK. I almost said Kelway, but we've committed ourselves to say CDW UK. But look, in all seriousness now, we will continue to look at those areas, and I think we talked about this in the past, there may be some solution areas, where we feel like we need some either particular skills or there are some products, but I would say for the foreseeable future, we're going to be remained focused on getting CDW UK fully integrated and delivering kind of that one-company experience I talked about earlier. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Amit. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, guys. How are you doing? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I guess question and a follow-up from me as well. Tom, so I was surprised by the organic growth trends you talked about in storage and networking. I think you said up low-single digits. Most of the OEMs there haven't had such good numbers. I'm curious, what are you seeing that's different and are you actually seeing a shift from these vendors shifting more aggressively towards the channel that's perhaps helping you out? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think one of the reasons we continue to maybe perform a little differently is a) the breadth of the OEM partners that we support. Now, you've heard me talk about in the past that there's a lot of new players in that space, and we have benefited from the excitement around a lot of their products. But as I think I also mentioned on previous calls, I did not expect the traditional OEM partners to just sit there and say, okay, we're going to acquiesce. As we saw this quarter, we saw some of the traditional partners, especially in the flash area, be meaningful contributors. So I think it kind of comes back to the basis of the business model and the diversification we talk about is one of the reasons you see our growth sometimes be a little different than what you hear from people who are purely kind of in one particular product line or in one particular OEM. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And as a follow up, Tom, I guess, and given where the leverage today is well in that 2.5 to 3 times range for you guys, how do you think about the free cash flow that you see over the next 12 months, let's say? Given leverage where it is, should we think more about the free cash flow being used for buybacks and sustain the dividend, or would you like to actually delever below the low end of the target? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: I think that we'll be consistent with the capital allocation target that we've been following for over a year and that is to continue to increase our dividend until we get the 30% of free cash flow. We have done some significant increases the past two years, 59% each year. So, I would expect us to continue to do that until we get to the 30% target. And then, we will use excess cash for tuck-in acquisitions. Tom mentioned we've probably got our handful in the short run, and then to buy back stock. I think in this interest rate environment, 2.5 times to 3.0 times, we're very comfortable with that leverage ratio. If there were to be a material change in interest rates, we obviously would re-address. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter, guys. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, thanks Amit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions from me. Tom, you're looking across the technology supply chain, last quarter, you saw a bunch of your competitors, distributors, as well as OEMs talk about an acceleration to cloud adoption from customers, which is adversely affecting hardware sales. It sounds like you guys are adopting with your customer or adapting with your customers on the cloud, how would you characterize that environment and have you seen that acceleration? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well. I think, Matt, if you think about the success of our cloud practice, we too are experiencing what I would describe as the benefit of customers thinking about within their infrastructure, what parts of that infrastructure, what applications, what workloads make sense for me to put in the cloud. I think that has a lot to do with why you're seeing the growth I alluded to. But I also think what you're seeing, because we had a number of segments that had storage and server growth this quarter, you're also seeing people continue to look at what I believe is the ultimate model is going to be a hybrid infrastructure. And so, they'll look at those situations where it makes sense to have it either on prem \u2013 and, in fact, we just had a bunch of customers at one of our leadership off-sites and it was interesting to hear them talk and how they think about where an application goes. And I'd tell you it's partially driven by economics, it's partially driven by flexibility, it's partially driven by cost and I think that's one of the reasons that we've had the balanced growth of both our cloud practice and some of the more traditional hardware categories. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just as a follow up to that. As you see $100 spent five years ago on internal data center or cloud and now parsed into off-premise and on-premise, are you able to capture all or most of that revenue opportunity now with the cloud or is it less? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think it's interesting. Maybe I'll put a little different spin on it, Matt, is the dollar flows are different because of how cloud is billed. And as I've talked about it a couple of times, some people have adopted a subscription model, which if I'd draw an analogy, it'd be like the old days when there was a fair amount of leasing of hardware, where the revenue stream is more ratable, so to speak, and more predictable. So I think that makes it hard to make the perfect correlation. Do we have the capability to capture all of the spend? Yes, we have the broad product suite to do that. But ultimately, I guess if you're really honest, it comes down to your ability to continue to execute in the marketplace is going to determine whether or not you're going to capture the majority of the revenue stream. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yep. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks and good morning. Ann, just on the buyback. How should we read the $750 million authorization in terms of the timing given that it's 12% of the market cap. Should we be reading this as an expectation that buybacks might be a larger contributor to your double-digit EPS growth objective than you previously anticipated? Maybe just some help on the timing that you expect to execute it. Thanks. Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah. No, we would expect that authorization to last for several years, I would say. And part of it just depends \u2013 I mean, in the capital allocation strategy, we don't have a desire to forecast (43:39) so to speak \u2013 at interest rates near zero, having a lot of cash on our balance sheet isn't something that we want to do or that the business model needs. And so, as we see potential acquisition opportunities, we'll look at those. If we don't have the capacity or there isn't anything attractive out there, we'll deploy excess cash after dividends to buy back stock. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: But your organic EBITDA growth, if you will, the expectations for that hasn't changed? Ann Elizabeth Ziegler - CDW Corp.: No. I mean, we maintain you know to outgrow the U.S. IT market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points and essentially to maintain our adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-7% range, so that just flows through to EBITDA, so to speak. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right, okay. And then just on Kelway, which looked like it over achieved in Q1, it added over 8% to growth. You're expecting it to add I guess 7% to growth in the first half, so that implies in Q2 your UK revenue will decline roughly double-digits sequentially. Is that related to the integration or is that just the seasonality of the business? Maybe a little bit more on...yeah. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Brian, yes, this is Tom. It's just the seasonality. I mean, they have a different rhythm because of the first quarter end to their fiscal year. And so, interestingly enough, it's very similar to what you see here when we have the sequential behavior, the same is true over there. And then they had the added part that last year was an election year, so you had this kind of big second quarter. And we knew that. That's one of the reasons when we gave you the signal of $650 million to $700 million for the first half. We knew we had that kind of different rhythm, if I can say it that way, than the U.S. So it is performing exactly as we expected. Except, I will say, they performed better than we expected in the first quarter. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Osten Bernardez from Cross Research. Your line is open. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Hi. Yes, good morning. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning Osten. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : How's it going, Tom? So I just had a couple of questions. First, with respect to your revenues from client devices; they seem to be growing faster than the rest of the market even and some of those other channel players, and I wanted to know to what extent do you attribute your Dell relationship to the growth that you're seeing in your mobile computing devices? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I would say, look, it's kind of as expected, Osten. We thought there would be some additional contribution from adding Dell to the product suite. That was kind of the rationale and, in fact, we saw that. But I don't know that I would attribute all of that growth to Dell. I think some of it is kind of the cyclical nature of refresh, and we did have a little bit of a strange, as you heard me call out in the script, dichotomy of performance, if you will, in that transactional growth was very heavy in our corporate segment and just the opposite in our public segment. I think some of that has to do maybe with just project momentum. And some of the caution you may have heard me articulate in the script about corporate and MedLar may have given people incentive to do some projects on the transaction side versus the solution side. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yep, good question. Hey, let me offer one other thing, too. We did have some really strong success with some new form factors in the quarter, and I think that contributed a lot to that improved growth that you saw in the transaction space. And then back to E-Rate, E-Rate is \u2013 especially as you're starting to think about, you still have 2015 E-Rate funds and now they started to 2016 process. So let me see if I can give some clarity. If you think about the 2015 money, just comparing last year, first quarter of this year, the E-Rate funds we received, or flowed through in revenue, was 12% higher. So it is having a positive impact in the education segment. As you may or may not know, we've been able to see customers spend a little greater than 50% of the money that was allocated. So, let's say $120 million were allocated to CDW customers and we've seen them spend in the north of 50%, 60% range. So that means there's a still hunk of spend out there to be spent. Now, in reality, Osten, they don't ever really spend 100%, so we've got some incremental runway on last year's E-Rate revenue. Now, we start 2016 E-Rate process, which unfortunately was delayed a month because of a systems glitch, so it's a little bit behind where we were last year. But we would anticipate, and we are expecting ourselves, to perform at the same rate when it comes to capturing that new revenue. And then I think lesson learned, we'll expect that the spend is going to take over a year as we move through the process. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Osten. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Tom, it sounded from your commentary that the macro environment is generally still about what you saw at the beginning of the year. I just wanted to make sure that was the case, even though there's been a number of puts and takes, in general, it sounds like your outlook is relatively unchanged for the year. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I would say, it remains the same. I think there's still a dose of caution out there in the marketplace. Now, granted, we don't have what I'll call the panic that was driven by the financial markets in January and February, but I also believe there's enough indications. Look, if you think about it, Sherri, this way, what were they forecasting GDP in the first quarter? It was forecasted to be like 1.3% and it came in at 0.5%. So I think that caution is driven by the reality of kind of the fragile economy we're dealing with. Now, we are expecting it to improve as we go through the year, and that gives us some optimism when we think about some of our segments. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then maybe could you just touch on the earlier comments you made about some changes in form factor? I assume that's in the PC segment, are you seeing more momentum in things like two and ones, and... Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Exactly. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: ...tablets? And then maybe what's your outlook for the second half of the year for the PC market? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, we're not going to give you an outlook for the second half of the year, but I will tell you that you're 100% on target, it is those two-for-one new form factors that I think seem to be appealing to a market need and we have benefited from the introduction of those, especially as other OEMs have adopted that introduction. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Tom and Ann. Two questions if I could. Tom, can you just talk a little more about how investors should think about CDW's ability to really size up some of these macro and the IT blues that some of my peers have talked about during today's call in terms of just how much are you being able to offset this with increasing penetration of existing customers versus new logos in terms of new customers. I want to see if you can get any more market share in terms of new customers and then how we should think about that in terms of sustainability? And then the other question is really around the cloud. If you could talk about the cloud in terms of \u2013 and update you can provide us in terms of marquee kind of partnerships that could be announced, or are you working on with respect to some of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cloud providers that you could partner with over the next year or so? Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. I think, let me try to walk through the first question, Mark. I think part of it starts with our scale that gives us the ability to go to market in a segmented way. And that diversification of markets that we address I think has a lot to do with our ability to consistently deliver performance above the market. If you think about it, these markets operate so independently. I mean, you just think about the success we had in the government segment and in particular in state and local, you look at small business had a pretty good quarter. And then, you look at \u2013 like education and even that's a bifurcated market. What we saw in K-12, while it ended up down slightly for the quarter, was really an upswing and momentum as we went through the quarter. And then you look at higher-ed who just has the budget issues. So I think that diversification, and at least in my experience here at CDW, is one of the main reasons that we were able to kind of have this sustainable performance. The second thing is the breadth of the OEM partners that we have. We've talked about storage is just a great example. We've been able to maintain what I would describe as a solid storage track record here over the last five quarters or six quarters, in part, because we have a number of new entrants that are coming in. We bring on 60 to 70 new people every year. And that influences new opportunities in the marketplace. And I think, I've said this before \u2013 as you might have an OEM have a tough quarter, the breadth of the OEMs that we carry have a tendency to mitigate the negative swings we might have in the marketplace. And then linking that to your acquisition versus penetration, we \u2013 I think look at, for example, small business is an incredible acquisition engine for us. And it's ironic that one of the great drivers of that acquisition is cloud computing, because the cloud model, especially a public cloud model, is especially appealing to a small business that doesn't have a lot of capital, that's trying to get themselves started. And so it's been not only a driver of growth but a driver of small business when I'm speaking about cloud computing. So then I move to the second part of your question. We've got a pretty broad portfolio of cloud partners as it exists today. I'm going to say it's north of 50 cloud partners to 70 cloud partners that are out there, and each of them have different go to market strategies and how they think about CDW. I would say the staff part of the business has continued to grow and infrastructure as a service is an increasingly important and growing part of the business, but it doesn't yet have the penetration level of SaaS. I think in part because SaaS in many cases is a little lower risk. So people kind of stick their toe in the ocean on a SaaS application. But increasingly, as I referred to the customers we had in here a couple of weeks ago, are thinking about infrastructure as a service, or hybrid implementations where they're doing things like putting current converged infrastructure in the middle of a cloud-based data center and using converged infrastructure as kind of a traffic cop. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, Mark, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang, from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks, good morning. Just wanted to ask about CDW's services, up almost double digit. Should this be an above average grow rate this year you think? And obviously some implications for gross margin, so I'm just trying to understand that a little bit better. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yep. Well, we have high expectations of our services organization, as always. And we've made a meaningful investment in that business when it comes to service delivery engineers, and so we expect them to continue to grow. I think if you heard this quarter, the two people \u2013 two people, right Tom, the two parts of services that grew where warranties, which is kind of tied to some of the transactional growth success we had, and CDW best services (57:13), which is really kind of our professional services business. And that very much is a link to our solutions practice. So when you see us growing servers and Netcom and some of the wireless capabilities, having this service ability to not only procure it, but implement it and manage it is important. So I'm not going to give you an actual forecast, but suffice it to say, we expect them to continue to perform at a meaningful rate. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. Just on the Kelway. Just any update on synergies? I know it's doing well, and I caught the fiscal year end comment, but just the synergy part, capturing the U.S. spend in overseas with their locations, et cetera? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. We've had a really strong success. Inside of our referral business, it's a \u2013 I don't want to give you the exact number, but just suffice it to say that it's meaningful double-digits of deals that we've had as a result of having that capability. And it's not just one way. It's not just UK benefiting from U.S. customers; we are benefiting in the U.S. from UK customers. So it's executing the way we had hoped. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. I like the Orchestration campaign, by the way. I like the Orchestration campaign, by the way, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thank you. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I like the Barclay ones as well, but I figured I'd throw it out there. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, well, you just made one guy in this room really happy, so I'll have him send you a thank-you note. All right, good. Operator : Thank you. The last question that we have time for today will be from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, thank you. So two quick questions. First, you talked about accelerated product growth in the back half, is that just normal seasonality or do you have a pipeline of deals that suggest an acceleration in that business? And then secondly, you made a comment about lumpiness in server growth, can you just go through why it is again that you think that there'll be some volatility in that part of the business? Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. So on the first one, I'd say it's a combination of two things. It is looking at some of the larger deals that we have, that we feel like we're beginning to ship product as we move through the year. But it also is kind of the \u2013 if you think about the composite of our customer set, Katy, there's a fair amount of our customers that are small to mid-size businesses that tend to move with the economy. So some of that is driven by an expected improvement in GDP. and therefore expected spend. So it's a combination of both. And the lumpiness in server hardware versus server solutions, which has been pretty consistent growth, is in part driven by certain segments. For example, we had a couple of segments that had just incredible server hardware quarters, but we had other segments that were benefiting from virtualization and doing something to create capacity. So, what we're seeing is, depending on where customers are in their lifecycle, if they're in the middle of virtualization and creating additional capacity, they're not buying new hardware. We've a couple of segments, truthfully, that are waiting for the new chipset, and feel very much like when that gets delivered, we're going to see some incremental server hardware takeoff. So just trying to be transparent into kind of the different dynamics influencing that server \u2013 server solutions area. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, Katy. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That's all the time that we have for questions today, so I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks again, everybody. I appreciate you taking the time today and appreciate your questions, and your following CDW. As always, if there's anything we can help your businesses with, we'll be more than happy to share some of those investments we've been making in people and technology. And, as always, it's Mother's Day on Sunday. So do not forget, she's the reason you're here. All right. Thanks, everybody. See you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program. And you all may disconnect your telephone lines at this time. Everyone have a great day.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. We delivered solid top-line growth and excellent profitability in what continues to be a challenging market. Consolidated sales were $3.7 billion, up 10.6% above last year. Organic constant currency sales, which exclude the results from CDW UK, increased by 4.5%. Gross profit increased 14.2% to $610 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.2% to $301 million, and non-GAAP net income per share increased 15.8% to $0.93 per share. This quarter's results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of channels, as well as our breadth of product offerings, particularly our ability to bring innovative emerging technologies to our customers and the ongoing success of our three-part strategy. Let me walk through how each contributed to performance : first, our balanced portfolio of customer channels. This quarter was truly a tale of two cities with very different performance in the end markets we serve. We saw this divergence across segments, with Corporate down roughly 1% and Public up over 11%. We also saw this divergence within segments. In Corporate, Medium and Large was down was down 2% and Small Business increased 5%. MedLar results reflected the impact of the economic volatility over the past six months, which caused many customers to put longer tail projects on hold and those that are moving forward to move through longer decision cycles. Reflecting this, while transaction sales grew, solution sales declined. Small Business, which, in general, tends to have smaller, less complex projects, delivered solid growth across both solution sales and transaction sales. Public was up 11%, with excellent results across several end markets and double-digit growth across both transactions and solutions. Government increased 17%, excellent results given last year's 20%-plus growth. Once again, State & Local delivered strong double-digit results, driven by success in new contracts as well as ongoing success delivering public safety solutions. Federal was up low single digits, as we continue to benefit from strategic changes made to better align with government programs. As expected, Education results improved, increasing 17%. K-12 delivered high teens growth, driven by both E-Rate funding and digital testing client devices. HigherEd increased nearly double digits, as they identified refresh opportunities and network opportunities. Healthcare was flat, as we continue to see the impact of consolidation in the marketplace. Canada showed continued momentum in local currency, growing high single digits in Canadian dollars. Results in U.S. dollars were muted by currency, up low single digits. UK delivered $208 million for the quarter, above the high end of the 650 to 700 basis points contribution we talked about last quarter. The team did a great job, leveraging post-Brexit announcement opportunities, which helped partially overcome last year's excellent performance, driven by customers buying in advance of the 2015 UK election. The second driver of our performance was the breadth of our offerings, and our investment in faster growing emerging technologies. With over 100,000 products and services from over 1,000 vendor partners, we remain well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. Staying relevant to our customers is critical to our value proposition. And one way we do that is by bringing on between 50 and 60 new partners each year. This constant refresh of our portfolio is one of the key ways we have consistently outperformed the overall market. And you clearly see the impact of this in our second quarter product and solutions performance. The unique environments across the various end markets we serve also impacted that performance. Organic hardware sales increased 4%. Customer demand for client devices was strong across virtually all of our end markets, up high single digits. Customers added notebooks and mobile devices at a good clip, and sales increased by low double digit. As expected, desktop sales were flat. Chromebooks resumed strong growth. Enterprise Storage grew mid-single digits, driven by emerging technology partners and more traditional infrastructure partners. Storage was slightly down in Corporate, but up high teens in Public. Revenue from flash products grew more than 50%, with all end markets increasing nicely. Net comp sales were flat, as strong growth in Public, driven by K-12 and State & Local, was offset by the slowdown in Corporate. Service Solution performance, which includes both the box plus options tied to the server, was mixed across our channels, with net sales down overall. Servers were up double digits in Small Business and down double digits in MedLar. In Public, servers were also mixed, with excellent increases in Government and declines in Healthcare. Software sales increased 8%, reflecting strong security and application suite growth. This quarter, gross profit from software increased in line with sales, as both traditional software and netted down software, which includes software assurance, cloud and agency sales, grew in the quarter. We continue to expect the netting down impact on revenue and gross margin to be lumpy for some time. Services increased 15%, driven by success in delivering security implementations and data center support. The final driver of our second quarter performance was our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy, which is to : first, capture market share from existing and new customers; second, expand our solution suite; third, build out our service capability. Capturing market share is a top priority for CDW, and we take a very disciplined approach to achieving it through programs like category penetration and customer acquisition. And, as you can imagine, with our scale and customer base, our partners are focused on it as well. In fact, this quarter, roughly 50 partners invested in customer programs to drive joint share gains across all our end markets. Our second strategy is to continuously expand our solutions capabilities. Over the past three years, we've added nearly 400 North American solutions specialists and service delivery coworkers. This investment helps to build the capabilities required to capture strategic pockets of growth across the IT landscape and, importantly, helps ensure we remain relevant to customers. Security is a great example of this. It is not coincidental that security was one of our fastest growing practice areas this quarter. Sales from security partners added since 2014 increased over 100% this quarter. Six of our top 10 security brands grew in excess of 20%, with two growing triple digits. Cloud is another area where we've made substantial investments that are paying off. We identified cloud as a strategic imperative in 2010, formalized cloud as a solutions practice in 2011. Over that time, we've built a full suite of cloud offerings. Today, we provide planning, subscription, migration, integration, managed services, and aggregation services. This quarter, cloud represented 6% of our total gross profit, up 100 basis points since second quarter of 2015. And customer spend continues to grow at excellent rates, up just over 50% this quarter. Another way we invest to capture above market growth is through our third strategic priority, which is to continue to build our service capabilities. Service capabilities are an integral part of many high-end solution sales, and are critical to supporting our cloud and security strategy. It's been just over a year since we opened our national Enterprise Command Center. Our ECC is a state-of-the-art network operation center that provides 24x7 capabilities. This enables us to deliver advanced services like managed cloud, so our customers can take advantage of emerging technologies. While still early, we are gaining traction in managed cloud. A great example is the solution we provided for a financial service company with five offices across the country. A recent spin-off, this business, with less than 500 coworkers, needed to tackle the time-consuming and complex task of delivering total IT services to a new organization. They needed the full spectrum of technologies, encompassing networking, security, wireless, infrastructure, unified communications and end-user hardware and software. We leveraged the combined CDW teams from Software, Field Services, Networking, Security and Managed Services, to deliver a complete turnkey solution for the customer. This integrated solution will generate nearly $5 million of total contract revenue, including more than $50,000 per month in recurring revenue. Our investments in solutions and services help capture incremental customer spend, but they also drive customer loyalty. A great example of this is a national nonprofit customer, with regional and national offices, that we've been working with for a few years. To raise money and support awareness, they conduct hundreds of local fundraisers every year. The customer first turned to us in 2014, for help in designing an infrastructure that would scale up during their busy times with capacity to store data securely, while providing access to their local chapters. And they needed to manage multiple IT platforms across their chapters. We initially designed a cloud-based solution that started with security. From there, we added data warehousing using Infrastructure as a Service. Next, we delivered productivity applications and recently added Identity as a Service, and their cloud strategy is not complete. Next in line for implementation is storage, backup disaster recovery and cloud-based videoconferencing. Over the past three years, this customer's spend has increased to more than $170,000 per year in net revenues. So, as you can see, investments in solutions and services ensure we can meet the needs of our customers and drive customer loyalty. Our UK investment is another way we are accomplishing this. As you will recall, we acquired Kelway in August of 2015 to address the request from U.S.-based customers, who are increasingly asking for our help with their international IT needs. To do that, we needed the ability to deliver products and services locally, manage complex international tax requirements, and bill in multiple currencies. CDW UK helps us meet the challenges, providing a seat at the table for deals that we would have otherwise lost; deals that often have a small percentage of international revenues, but represent significant U.S. opportunity and help cement long-term relationships. Since we fully acquired CDW UK in August of last year, referrals have roughly resulted in $60 million of incremental revenues to total CDW. To further that success, our integration efforts are laser-focused on creating a seamless, one company experience. That work is continuing. So, for us, the outcome of the UK's decision to leave the European Union doesn't impact our strategy to gain share with U.S.-based multi-nationals and meet the international needs of customers based in the UK. The impact of Brexit is less clear on CDW UK locally. Obviously, it creates uncertainty in the UK marketplace. CDW UK derives roughly 80% of its sales from inside the United Kingdom. While it's really too early to tell how this will shake out, for now, we expect UK IT market growth to be in the 0% to 1% range and continue to hold the team accountable for out-growing that by 200 to 300 basis points. With low single-digit market share, there is plenty of UK-based opportunity. So, our UK focus will be about finding opportunities for share gains to offset macroeconomic pressures in the UK. And with roughly 20% of sales from outside the UK, we are well-positioned to help customers with those needs as well And that leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. We ended the quarter with 55 new customer-facing coworkers. There is no change to the plan we shared with you on our first quarter call. Of course, as we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust our plan, as appropriate. For MedLar, we continue to expect improving results in the back half of the year, as many of the more complex large projects have closed and will ship during the second half. We look for Small Business to continue to execute well. Given the volatility, we have seen over the last six months, we remain watchful for changes in customer buying behavior, stemming from real or perceived worsening economic conditions, but feel good about the back half of the year, given where we sit today. Education results should remain healthy, although not at the high teens rate of this quarter, with a final push to spend remaining 2015 E-Rate funds and new 2016 funds beginning to flow. We continue to look for Healthcare to be a low growth market in 2016, as the industry focus is on cost savings and budgets remain under pressure from lower reimbursements. Government should continue to perform, but at a lower clip as we lap last year's double-digit growth. Our Canadian expectations remain the same, grow at least 200 to 300 basis points above the local market, which we continue to see in the 1% to 2% range. The team in Canada will remain focused on finding growth opportunities in a market that is fragile, given ongoing pressures in the oil and gas arena, and overall macro issues. Finally, Dell continues to perform as expected. And we continue to look for Dell to deliver roughly 150 basis points of incremental full year growth. We continue to target organic top-line growth between 200 to 300 basis points above the market. There is no change to our expectation, that full year U.S. IT growth in 2016, will be in the 2% to 3% range. However, given the first half market performance, and what we're seeing today in the market, we believe it will come in closer to the lower end of that range. As is our practice, we will update our view on market growth as we move through the year. Now, let me turn it over to Ann. Ann? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our second quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, breadth of product offerings, and our strategic progress. They also reflect the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver double-digit earnings growth, and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to our P&L, if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on Slide 8. Consolidated top-line growth was excellent this quarter, with net sales of $3.7 billion, 10.6% higher than last year on a reported basis and on an average daily sales basis. Average daily sales were $57.3 million. While Canada represents a relatively small portion of our total net sales, at just over $130 million this quarter, Canadian dollar translation continues to impact organic net sales growth, shaving approximately 20 basis points off of organic growth, which excludes CDW UK. This is 30 basis points less than the second quarter last year and 20 basis points less than last quarter. On a constant currency basis, organic net sales were 4.5% higher than last year. Organic sequential sales increased 17.6% on an average daily sales basis versus Q1, 2016, which is slightly higher than our historical Q2 to Q1 sequential increase and slightly below last year's sequential growth. Gross profit for the quarter increased 14.2% to $610.5 million. Gross margin in the second quarter was 16.7%, 60 basis points above last year. This increase reflected the combination of our mix into revenue recorded at 100% gross margin, such as our net service contract revenue, which includes SaaS, higher vendor partner funding, and the inclusion of CDW UK, which has a higher mix of services. As you know, mixing into net service contract revenue favorably impacts gross margin and gross profit growth, but tempers our revenue growth. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9, as expected, consolidated reported SG&A, including advertising expense, grew faster than sales coming in at 17.8% higher than last year. This reflects the impact of 390 incremental North American coworkers added since the end of Q2 last year, incremental CDW UK SG&A and our continued investment in advertising, which increased 11%. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter, which excludes $9.7 million of non-cash equity compensation, $2.2 million of acquisition and integration expense, and $0.7 million of historical retention costs and other expenses, increased 16.7%. To make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our gross profit less adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased $2.2 million year-over-year to $9.7 million, primarily due to 2016 annual equity awards granted late in the first quarter of 2016 and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of CDW UK. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $300.6 million, up 12.2%, delivering a margin of 8.2%, an increase of 10 basis points over last year. Looking at the rest of the P&L on Slide 10, interest expense was $36.9 million, down slightly from Q1 and last year's Q2, due to a current period interest income benefit. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate was 37.3% compared to 37.1% in last year's Q2, which resulted in a tax expense of $70 million versus $63.9 million. On a GAAP basis, we earned $117.5 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance, was $155.6 million in the quarter, up 11.9% over last year. As you can see on Slide 11, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add-backs that fall into four general buckets : the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles; non-cash equity compensation; acquisition and integration expenses; and other non-recurring or infrequent income or expense. With Q2 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 167 million, we delivered $0.93 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 15.8% over the prior year. Turning to first half results on Slide 12, revenue was $6.8 billion, an increase of 11.7% on a reported basis and 10.9% on an average daily sales basis, given one extra selling day in Q1 of this year. On a constant currency basis, growth would have been roughly 30 basis points higher. Gross profit during the first half of 2016 was $1.1 billion, up 14.5%. Gross profit margin was 16.7%, up 40 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $533 million, 11.4% above the first half of 2015. Net income was $195 million for the first half of 2016, and non-GAAP net income was $268 million versus $237 million in 2015, up 13.4%. Turning to our balance sheet on Slide 13, on June 30, we had $129.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3.1 billion, $269 million more than a year ago, reflecting cash paid and debt consolidation as part of the acquisition of CDW UK in August of 2015. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1 billion. Net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 2.9 times, within our target range. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.4%. Given today's uncertain interest rate environment, I'd like to remind you that our $1.5 billion floating rate term loan facility has a 1% LIBOR floor, and we have $1.4 billion notional amount of 2% interest rate caps in place, which will expire in Q1 of 2017. Given the caps' approaching expiration, we are currently evaluating extending or replacing them. With roughly 95% of our outstanding debt effectively fixed or hedged, rates would have to move significantly before they had a material impact on our interest costs. As you can see on Slide 14, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q2. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down two days versus last year's second quarter and below our target range, which is an annual target. Year-over-year DPO increased five days and DSO increased three days. Note that when we have a higher mix of sales being netted down, we see increases in both DSO and DPO. This is because these sales are booked net on the P&L, but our receivables reflect the gross billings to the customer. At the same time, payables are matched against zero cost of goods sold. So both measures increase. That is why we focus on our cash conversion cycle, because that is the best measure of our working capital efficiency. Cash taxes paid for the quarter were $126 million and cash interest was $28.8 million. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement, less capital expenditures, was a positive $8.6 million compared to a negative $8.2 million in Q2 of 2015. For the first six months of the year, free cash flow was $358.8 million, up more than $200 million from last year's first six months. As you recall, free cash flow in 2015 was $100 million lower than normal, due to one-time items and timing, which pulled forward roughly $100 million of free cash to Q4 2014. This year's organic year-to-date performance is more consistent with our typical pattern, where we see strong cash flow in the first quarter due to our sequential sales decline from Q4 and payment of Q1 cash taxes in Q2. In addition, 2016 results include the incremental impact of UK cash flow. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and repurchased 2.5 million shares for $105 million at an average cost of $41.99 per share. Also during the quarter, our sponsors completed two fund distributions and no longer hold private equity positions in the company. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you see on slide 15 : first, increase dividends annually. We guide these increase in November 2014. We set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend $0.1075 per share on September 12, to shareholders of record as of August 25, up 59% from a year ago. Since the IPO, our dividends have more than doubled. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place; we have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to three times. We ended Q2 at 2.9 times. Third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisition. Our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. In the second quarter, UK contributed roughly $0.05 per share, in line with our expectation. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. At the end of June, we had $786 million remaining of our current authorization. These capital allocation priorities support our 2016 to 2018 medium-term target, which you see on Slide 16. Similar to our 2013 to 2015 targets, we continue to target growth of 200 to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market. We also continue to target an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-7% range. Reflecting the conclusion of our initial refinancing, and absence of earnings amplification from lower interest expense, our 2016 through 2018 medium-term annual target call for low double-digit EPS growth. We intend to use share repurchases and accretive acquisitions to amplify operating results, and help achieve this target. Keep in mind, that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our medium-term target on an annual, not on a quarterly, basis. Now, let me provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling the rest of the year 2016 financials. I am on Slide 17. Based on Q2 results and expectations for the rest of the year, we expect the balance of sales between first and second half to be generally consistent with our normal seasonality, roughly 48% to 52% weighted towards the back half of the year. We will have one fewer selling day in Q4 2016 than we had in Q4 2015, and two fewer days sequentially this year Q3 to Q4. On an average daily sales basis, we look for a sequential decline Q3 to Q4, in line with our historical average. CDW UK will add roughly 175 basis points of incremental growth to Q3. As you recall, we did not acquire CDW UK until August of 2015. Given the recent weakening in the pound, we now expect currency to have a greater impact for the balance of the year, roughly 100 basis points in the second half. Canadian currency impact should mitigate, while the British pound, U.S. dollar will drive this second half impact. This assumes average translation rates of C$1 equal to $0.77 and $1.25 to the pound. We continue to look for Dell to contribute roughly 150 basis points of incremental growth in 2016. We expect our gross margin percentage to be lighter for the balance of the year, as our margin mix reverts back closer to the rate we had in Q3 and Q4 of 2015. This reflects both a higher percentage of product versus NSCR and the impact of Federal Government year-end on our margin in Q3 and Q4. Turning to expenses, we look for reported and adjusted SG&A to increase low double digits in Q3, due to increased coworker count and related coworker expenses, investment in advertising and one-month incremental CDW UK expenses. For Q4, we expect SG&A to grow more in line with average daily sales growth, as we lap last year's increase in coworkers and UK is in our base. We expect our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to come in at the high-end, or a tick above, our medium-term annual target of the mid-7% range. We expect both depreciation and amortization and non-cash equity compensation to continue at similar rates to Q2 2016. Given the interest income benefit in Q2, we expect interest per quarter to run more in line with Q1 at roughly $38 million per quarter. We continue to look for our 2016 effective tax rate to be in the 37% to 38% range. We will continue to buy back shares in the market to both offset dilution and contribute to earnings growth, and currently expect repurchases for the balance of the year to be at levels somewhat below the first half. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling cash flows; we continue to look for capital expenditures to come in at roughly 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. For free cash flow, we expect to be at the high-end, or slightly above, 2.5% to 3% of net sales. We have made excellent progress in managing our working capital, and you should look for us to maintain our cash conversion within our target range of the low to mid-20%s for 2016. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 37% range to be applied to pre-tax booked income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $47.5 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually, related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. That concludes the financial summary. Before we open for Q&A, let me briefly address the SEC investigation we disclosed in 2015, relating to vendor partner program incentives. We have no further update since our last conference call. We continue to cooperate fully with the SEC. And although we cannot predict the outcome, based on what we know to-date, we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on the company. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up? Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : We'll be taking our first question from the line of Matt Cabral from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the weakness that you saw in MedLar in the quarter and, in particular, if there are any verticals or products that stood out to the downside. And then, if you could just help us understand. Tom, I think you were talking about a bit of an inflection going into the back half of the year. Just what gives you the confidence that this is more of a near-term slowdown within that vertical? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Matt, thanks for your question. Yeah, so, let me just kind of comment because I think, as we said, the tale of two cities, kind of gets to the very heart of the issue. In MedLar, we knew going into the beginning of the year, that we didn't have many of those large deals. It's why we carefully signaled that we thought it would be a slow start to the year in the Corporate business. And that's kind of one of the reasons we have a little more confidence in the second half. We've got a line of sight to a number of significant large projects that were closed and will be implemented, but all of that kind of that depends on kind of the underlying economy. We're all hopeful that it gets above whatever it was, 1.2%, because that does drives business behavior over the long-term when it comes to investment, if you think about it. So, we're all, I guess, would be hopeful. But the fact that we have line of sight to some of those larger deals that we've already closed, just will be shipping, is kind of the primary reason you have some confidence in improved performance. The other side is, if you look at the success of Small Business, right, it continues to perform. And that gives you some confidence that your overall Corporate business is going to return. And we've been through this. And even in the five years I've been at CDW, where you'll go through a couple of cycles. Some of it's tied to refresh projects. I'll give you a linkage example. When we had the Windows 2003 Server Refresh project, there was a great deal of concentration in server upgrades. A lot of that took place in our Corporate business. And you don't have that kind of exogenous driver right now going on, although you do have some other things coming down the line, which I think gives us, like I said, some of the confidence over the back half of the year. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, and switching gears over to the government side of things, that's been a pretty big revenue driver for you guys. Can you just help us understand what's changed over the last 12 or 18 months or so that's really allowed you to attack that segment more effectively and then how sustainable you think the growth trajectory is going forward? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think you heard me, Matt, on both cases, I think I used continue to be healthy and continue to perform to describe a couple of the Public segments. As I articulated, I think there's two things that drive it, and they're a little different. In the Federal business, a little over two years ago, we took a step back and changed our approach to align around strategic programs. And a lot of that was with the change of the acquisition strategy that existed in the Federal Government, which had been very geographic-driven and then became more programmatic in how it was driven, instead of concentrating just on bases, you're concentrating on programs. And I think that's proved to be really effective for us in the Federal market. In State & Local, it continues to be a function of our differentiation in a solutions area tied to public safety that drives growth as well as a pretty aggressive acquisition strategy when it comes to new contracts. So I'd say those are the primary drivers. And despite some pretty challenging comps for that gang, we expect them to continue to perform as they have. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Amit. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thank you. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Questions from me if I could, one on the Public side, just to follow-up, the strength you guys saw in the June quarter, could you just talk about your comfort that this wasn't any level of pull-in that perhaps happened from September into June? And if you just update us on the E-Rate funding, how much is left, because I think last quarter, you talked about CDW allocated $120 million, so just an update there would be great, too? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. So, the E-Rate has been an important driver, as you know, in the K-12 part of education. And now you kind of have to think about it in two funding cycles. We're still working through the 2015 funding cycle. And we've got 60% to 70% of the authorized funds have actually been deployed, which means we still have 30% of 2015. And we're now in the middle of the 2016 cycle, and I can tell you that we're very pleased with the number of times CDW has been named as the initial partner to deploy those funds. Although, I think the one thing we learned going through the last E-Rate rate cycle is the timeline between getting approved and getting the funds ready, then getting the funds deployed can stretch out. In fact, we have customers who got approval in 2015 and they can deploy it all the way through beginning of next year, if they get an exception. So, I guess on one hand, that would be a good news item, because that means there will be continued revenue to come from it, but we feel good about that. A lot of the E-Rate funding has driven the excellent network results that we saw in K-12. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. That's really helpful. And then, I guess, Tom, I want to follow-up on the Dell relationship. You've had it for a few quarters now. As you think about this longer term, do you think this $200 million or so incremental revenue you get in calendar 2016 is that the steady state run rate or based on what you see in the field right now, that could be inflection higher, over time, in 2017 potentially? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, look, I would expect it to approve (sic) [improve] (40:14) over time. I mean, part of the reason we've been thoughtful about guiding you guys on our performance is because we know what it's like when you bring on new partners. And it takes time. It takes time to establish relationships in the field. Those are based on trust. It takes time to make sure there is operational readiness, even for a company the size of Dell. The infusion of the volume of business that CDW can drive can, if you will, technically jam-up the system. So, we anticipated all that, but I would see no reason over time that it shouldn't be a pretty meaningful partner here at CDW, much like some of the other large strategic partners we have. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Question regarding your cloud business. You talked about the 6% of gross margin \u2013 gross profit now derived from cloud. Could you talk about the economics of that business in terms of operating costs, SG&A to support that, and working capital? And as that business continues to grow at a faster rate than the company, what does that do to the economics of working capital returns, et cetera? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, there was a lot in there, Matt. So, let me try to go through it and get you to the finish line. So, the first thing is it's a little different business. So let me just start with a working capital perspective, because we're obviously not buying products and putting them in warehouses. And so that's a kind of a whole different model. It is, as you might expect, an extremely profitable business for us, but it is like all of our solution areas. It's a different selling motion. It requires a different level of technical skills. And, as I said, we're kind of thrilled, but we started this thing back in 2011. So, it's not by surprise. It's kind of the result of CDW's ability to invest heavily in solution areas that ends up generating the kind of performance. In some cases, Matt, you get paid kind of an agency fee, which is a percentage of the value of the contract. In other cases, it's done a little differently, maybe more as a service billing. And if you think about it, we provide cloud across \u2013 there is kind of the SaaS-based part of the model. That can have a different, kind of more of an agency feel. There is the Infrastructure as a Service part of the model, which is kind of a cross between an agency and a monthly billing. There is the ag services part of the model. And so, all of those have a little different economics. But I think, at the end of the day, you can think about it as having a similar cost structure to our software business, a similar cost structure to our security business. And the biggest investment for us is making sure we have the technical skills that can sit down and help a customer think through their options from a cloud computing perspective. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. I'll leave it at that. Thanks a lot. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you, good morning. Tom, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your commentary. I think you said you're expecting more at the low end of the 200 to 300 basis point for this year for U.S. Can you talk about the puts and takes regarding that commentary, in terms of how we should think about where there can maybe be upside, if there is, and maybe where things could get worse if they do get worse? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well I think, Mark, we try to be pretty consistent on this. I think it starts with you've got an underlying economy that is, I think, growing slower than a lot of people had hoped, right? What is it, 0.8% in the first quarter; 1.2% in the second quarter. And you know, while business continues to invest, I think, much like my investment here at CDW, it is with a touch of caution, because you're trying to think about kind of what's going to happen in those next couple quarters. And as we just think about what IT has done in the first half of this year and you think about the underlying GDP, it does tend to make you believe while you started slower, and even if you have the acceleration we're hoping for, you're still going to probably come in at the low end of the 2% to 3% range. That's kind of the science behind it, Mark, truthfully. Now, the accelerants, if you will, could be, I think, if we get some stability and you begin to see GDP driven a little more by business investment than maybe just a strong consumer sentiment, all of that, I think, would suggest room for opportunity and accelerated performance. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, just a follow-up, if I could, you talked about some Brexit opportunities. Could you talk a little more about that? And if there is any sort of situation here where because there could be some uncertainty in that region, given CDs (sic) [CDWs] (45:35) position of strength, could you leverage any sort of maybe broader Eurozone weakness or malaise, if there is one that manifests over the next year or so, could that be an opportunity for CDW to be actually more acquisitive in the region beyond just the UK to build out your number? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. All right. Well, I'm glad you kept talking, because I thought I had the answer 'til you got to the very end. So, let me kind of go back and reconstruct, Mark, how we're thinking about it. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So the first thing is, the original thesis for the Kelway acquisition for us was serving those U.S. multi-national customers. And so, in many ways, the Brexit decision doesn't impact that. It will play that role and help us get to I think it's over 80-plus countries that they have the ability to get to. And so that's important to us. I think when you move to the, what I'll call, local aspect of it, clearly, the lack of clarity is causing all kind of theories and scenarios to be built out about the UK economy. A couple of things when it comes to our ability to \u2013 depending on how those negotiations turn out, our ability to kind of move in and about the EU. First of all, one of our locations from CDW UK is in Ireland, so that gives us an EU presence kind of right off the bat. But as we move forward, we have been, I think, pretty clear in thinking about expanding our hub-and-spoke model. And looking at other places in the footprint and, to some degree, we'll be both trying to optimize kind of our current position and looking for, what I'll call, additional or alternate distribution mechanisms going forward. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Osten Bernardez from Cross Research. Your line is open. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Osten. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Hey, there. So, just wanted to touch base on your commentary with respect to what you're seeing from the storage side of things. You noted seeing growth from traditional vendors. I'm assuming you're capturing channel share from those vendors as they're becoming more dependent on you. Can you highlight how sustainable that is or how do you see that playing out from a traditional standpoint for the rest of the year or over the next 12 months? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Osten, first of all, thanks for your question. I think the storage picture is an interesting one, because I think it represents a lot of what you're going to see in the data center technologies in it. It does emphasize what I would argue is one of the real strengths of the CDW model in the solutions business, which is our scale. Because what it does is, our scale attracts a lot of new entrants. And they're anxious to be a partner of CDW because of what we can do to help grow their business. That also gives us, what I would call, a diversity or breadth of solutions for customers and we've actually seen that play out. If you look at our storage business, it's kind of been a steady mid-single-digit growth as we've had a lot of these new entrants kind of driving growth as the traditional OEM partners transform their product line. And I think what you saw this quarter is the result of some of the traditional providers, that transformation beginning to take place. So as I think about going forward, I would expect us to continue to get growth from both of those two. And as you've heard me talk about last year, I think it feels like for the last five or six quarters, it just continues to be kind of a growth momentum. And I actually, sitting here, love the fact that we've got that kind of new infusion of anxious competitors and traditional people responding because it just drives competition. And that's good for us and it drives solutions for customers in the marketplace. So, I don't want to get into the business of predicting future quarters for different products, because you can get surprised. But I do feel good about the advantage that scale gives us in the solutions business and storage is a good example. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : And then, lastly real briefly, I appreciate the commentary on net comp. I believe you broke it out from an end market perspective, but I don't recall whether you provided net comp directionally on a consolidated basis. If you did, I apologize. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, no, that's okay. It was basically flat and it was the tale of two cities story. Just I think I went through that really pretty quickly in the script, where we saw really strong growth in a number of the Public segments, if you will. And we saw a little bit of contraction inside of MedLar. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele from Needham & Company. Your line is open. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. So, I just wanted to focus on one question. The vendor incentives, have you seen any changes in how the vendors themselves have been dealing with this kind of stutter-step investment, especially on the MedLar side? I mean, what are they doing to try and generate growth and are they trying to be more helpful than in previous years? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I don't think there has been a stutter step in their investment. If you got that, I don't want to suggest that. I think they've been pretty aggressive. And you know, a lot of the OEM partners tell us that, even when they've had depressed revenue and CDW has had depressed revenue, we still are taking share, although it's kind of a weird way to think about it, but and so their investment continues to be significant and meaningful. And a lot of time, as I alluded to, just if you think about it in the last quarter, we had over 50 partners funding programs and strategies and initiatives trying to drive share take, whether it comes in the form of new accounts and/or customer penetration. So they've been pretty consistent and, at least based on many of my one-on-one discussions with the CEOs of a lot of our partners, pretty pleased with CDW. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: That's helpful, and well done in the quarter. Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Tom, just want to follow-up, in terms of the Corporate sales being down 1%, I think this might be the first down quarter since the great recession. How much of this do you think was just market related and temporary versus anything competitive or more structural? And do you think customer migrations to the public cloud are playing a role here at all? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. Let me answer the latter part. I don't think that's playing a role, because not in the, what I would call, overall top-line performance I mean, clearly the incredible success we're having in our cloud business is one of the reasons you're seeing the impact on servers. But I think that's kind of multi-faceted, Brian. You have our cloud business growing. You've got our converged infrastructure kind of business on fire. And so I think those are kind of related. I think the Corporate business was just more a function of, as I said, as you go into a year, we didn't have the number of big deals. Some of that was driven by just the ongoing success and the underlying kind of economic longer selling cycle, lots more discussions when it comes to, gee, do I want to execute this project. So, look, I don't have any systemic worries. Now, having said that, I think the team would tell you, you know, Richards is always worried when it comes to future growth. So, I don't sense that there's any new thing there that would say they wouldn't kind of return to performance. And I think if you look at Small Business, Brian, they're both in the corporate world and the Small Business that continue to grow. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, Ann, gross margins have been really strong, up for six straight quarters, up quite nicely, actually. And I think you're talking about flat year-over-year gross margin trends in the second half. So, could you just talk about what is changing specifically from a mix perspective that would cause gross margin improvement to moderate in the second half? Is it the large deals in MedLar that are coming back or is there anything competitively that we should think about? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah. No, I think you need to remember that as we move through Q3 and Q4, we mix significantly into Federal Government business. And that, as we've said for years, has a lower margin. So, that's going to have the impact. And as you see product sales accelerate, right, then the NSCR, the positive mix impact we're getting for mixing into NSCR, will reverse or mitigate as we mix back into product. So, it's a combination of those two things. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thank you. Tom, I just was interested in exploring your comments about demand being more at the low-end of the 2% to 3% range. I guess, thinking about where the Street is modeling your revenue growth this year, it's somewhere around 9% growth, based on consensus. So, you've got maybe 2% underlying growth, 2% to 3% growth on top of that, based on your execution and then some benefit from Dell. I guess the question is are you signaling that that 9% maybe should be a little bit softer, given the demand environment's a bit softer and we've also got some currency headwinds? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think that last part, Sherri, is important. We probably have a little more currency headwind post-Brexit than we anticipated the last time we talked. And so that'll be an important part of some of the pressure that happens. I think the second thing is, is you got to look at UK, just as an entity and think about what happens post-Brexit when it comes to pressuring that part of the business. I think those are two factors that kind of sit on top of the total growth rate. I still expect us to outperform the market by 200 to 300 basis points. I still expect Dell to give us 150 basis points. All of those are true, but the two new wild cards is the currency issue and, what I would call, the UK local phenomenon, if I could say it that way. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah. And, Sherri, it's Ann. In the build you did, you need to remember to add the impact of UK from the wrap we had the first half of the year. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Okay, great. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Good quarter here. Just want to better understand the visibility in the second half outlook for the solution sales within MedLar. It sounds like there are some deals that you've signed. Is there pent-up demand, too, given longer sales and decision cycles? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Well, I would say it's more just \u2013 it's kind of that two factor is the way I think about it, Tien-Tsin, is, yeah, we have some visibility, more visibility in the deals that have already been sold. By definition, they tend to be more solutions-oriented. Now, you do have some client rollouts in there that are meaningful, but I think that the wild card for me is the underlying economy and what happens as we kind of move forward through the rest of this year, because I think that's going to influence business investment and that influence is the corporate side of the world. And we kind of think about it as we can only execute against what goes on in the macroeconomic environment, and we'll continue to do that. But it's kind of like similar to the question Brian asked. Do I think there is some systemic issue inside of that? I do not. This time last year, a couple of those segments were at an 18% growth rate. So kind of, it's just a function of the cycle. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood, got it, it's the cycle. And then, just maybe as a follow-up, maybe a stupid question here, but just the election year impact, I was thinking about \u2013 what might that have on government or maybe just budget flush in general? I mean, I don't know if you could look back in the past or if doesn't matter at all, but I'd figure I'd ask you, Tom, anyway? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, wow. Okay. No, truthfully, I would say, we're not sitting here anticipating some kind of spend it now or lose it before the new regime gets in. But, hey, stranger things have happened and if they decide they want to spend it, I guarantee you CDW will be there to help them. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. As always, thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions today. So, I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks again to everybody. I appreciate you taking the time this morning and thank you for your interest in CDW. I do think it was a strong quarter for us, proud of the team's focus and execution. And our ability to kind of reallocate resources and focus where we have meaningful opportunity continues to be an important part of this business model. And for those of you that need help figuring out how to use IT, we can help you. And since it's Olympics season, I guess my comment would be go USA, go UK, go Canada, all right? Okay. Thanks, everybody. See you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program, and you all may disconnect at this time. Everyone, have a great day.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. I'm pleased to report that, once again, CDW posted solid top line results and excellent profitability, delivering an increase of 5.9% in net sales to $3.7 billion, up 6.5% in constant currency; a 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $310 million; and a 16% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.97. We delivered this strong performance against the backdrop of today's challenging U.S. economy. Business investments did not accelerate, as many forecasted, instead remained tepid. Similar to our second quarter, strong public customer demand more than offset weaker corporate demand. And once again, performance for both channels and products was strongly influenced by different customer buying behavior in each of the unique end markets we serve. Our ability to continue to deliver meaningful profitable growth within this environment was the result of three key drivers : our balanced portfolio of customer end markets; the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio; and our ongoing execution against our three-part strategy, which is focused on taking share and investing in solutions and service capabilities our customers need and want. Let me walk through each one of these and share some detail about how they contributed to our performance. First, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels \u2013 medium and large business, small business, healthcare, government, and education \u2013 each generating annual sales of more than $1 billion. We also have our Canadian and UK operations, which together, represent more than US$ 1 billion. Given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each of these unique customer end markets, our channels often act in a countercyclical way. For example, in last year's third quarter, Public was flat while Corporate increased 6%. This year, the opposite occurred with Public up 10.6% and Corporate down just under 1%. For Corporate, small business was up 4% and MedLar was down just under 2%. While we had pockets of strength in MedLar, specifically with financial and not for profit customers where we saw double-digit growth in both transactions and solutions, we also had ongoing pockets of weakness. These were concentrated in markets experiencing macro pressure, notably geographies with heavy oil and gas and manufacturing exposure. Softer overall demand resulted in typical competitive behavior when revenue is scarce and we saw low ASPs in a number of key hardware categories, as well as deals in the market being done at or even below cost. Also, as we have seen in previous periods of economic cycles, MedLar customers remain focused on easier to execute transactional products, which increased to mid-single-digits in the quarter versus solutions, which declined high single-digits, with large deals continuing to be delayed. We saw similar buying behavior in small business. Transaction sales were strong, increasing double-digits with larger projects being put on hold and solutions declining. So, while we saw some highlights and glimmers of positive shoots in Corporate, the economy indeed was the wild card I mentioned it might be on last quarter's conference call and continued to impact buying behavior. This was not the case in Public where all three of its customer channels performed well. Government posted an 8.8% increase, driven by a strong performance in state and local, which continues to benefit from new contracts and success meeting public safety needs. Federal was up low-single-digits on top of last year's double-digit increase. As expected, we continue to benefit from our strategic program alignment. In addition, we saw excellent year end budget flush, but delivery of several large, transactional orders will occur in the fourth quarter. Healthcare increased 6%, as we experienced the positive side of expected lumpiness with activity picking up across a handful of larger customers who have moved through the merger process. Education had a great quarter, up 15%. Higher ed increased mid-single-digits, driven by ongoing refresh opportunities and new collaboration solutions. K-12 delivered another high teens growth quarter. The team continued to drive excellent client sales to help with digital testing and digital curriculums while also making excellent inroads into other classroom of the future technologies like video equipment. K-12 networking sales declined as eRate processing issues led to delays in funding letter approvals for the 2016 program year. Once again, CDW was named for the highest percentage of requested funds for the 2016 funding cycle. We feel good about the momentum for the remainder of 2016 and going into 2017. So, strong results across all channels in public with balanced sales growth across transactions and solutions, both increasing low-double digits. We also had balanced growth across our international operations. We saw a nice pickup in Canada, where they grew mid-single digits in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. UK also delivered mid-single digits growth in local currency while currency shaved 60 basis points off consolidated results. Clearly, the 4.4% organic growth we delivered in today's challenging market demonstrates the power of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. It also demonstrates the power of our second driver of our performance this quarter, the balance across our broad portfolio of products and solutions which you can see in our major category performance. Hardware grew 4% with all but two of our key hardware categories increasing in the quarter. Customer demand for client devices was strong across all customer end markets up mid-teens. Servers, video and collaboration equipment also increased across all segments. Storage and netcomm declined, reflecting both unique environment in customer end markets as well as product cycle changes and new technologies. New technologies are also impacting software spend as software becomes a larger component of IT solutions, whether it is being integrated into new advanced architectures, particularly in the data center or standalone, delivering important capabilities like security. You can see the impact of this on our strong software results, up 9%. We had meaningful increases in application suites and network management software as well as security. Security posted the eighth consecutive quarter of greater than 30% growth and includes many cloud-based solutions. Overall, customer spend on cloud continued its strong momentum, up more than 40%. We also had excellent success, providing software assurance, which along with cloud is booked net. This quarter boasts software reported gross and reported on a netted down basis increase and gross profit increased in line with sales. We continue to see software becoming an increasingly important component of total customer IT spend. This is also true of services. Once again, we had another double-digit quarter for service growth, up 12%, driven by continued success delivering security services as well as our focus on providing warranties. Warranties are becoming more important to both partners and customers, as product life cycles become extended in uncertain economic times. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making in our three-part strategy for growth to deliver solutions and service capabilities our customers want and need. Today, we are better positioned than ever to serve our customers' IT needs in this evolving market, whether in physical, digital or cloud-based environment in the U.S. or international. Let me walk through each of our strategies and how it is contributing. First, our strategy to take share. As you recall, our acquisition of CDW UK was about meeting our customers' needs for international IT solutions. By doing so, we can gain wallet share of U.S.-based customers with international locations as well as acquire new U.S.-based customers who have international needs. It has been a year since the acquisition, and we are very pleased with the results to-date. We are making excellent progress on our efforts to develop a seamless experience for customers on both sides of the pond. At the same time, the team continues to execute against the strategy to serve its U.K.-based customers' international needs. A great example of this is a recent solution the CDW UK team provided to a UK-based international service provider in the energy business that needed to consolidate a complex multi-vendor, multi-technology environment to make it easier to manage. We developed a single cloud environment that serves nearly 20,000 co-workers across Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A complete turnkey solution, including compute, netcomm and storage and we handled all pre-sales design, logistics and procurement and oversaw installation in each location. The solution generated more than USD 2 million in hardware sales as well as recurring warranty commission and relieved a big headache for the customer. Of course, we will keep a watchful eye on the progress of the UK's exit from the EU, but in the meantime continuing to invest in our international capabilities to ensure we can deliver what our U.S. and UK-based customers are looking for, a seamless experience regardless of where they do business with us. We recently added 16 co-workers to our international sales team and are finalizing plans for the launch of new international advertising. It is clear that this investment has and we believe will continue to contribute meaningfully to our ability to consistently generate profitable growth. Investments we have made to enhance our solutions capabilities, our second strategy, are also contributing to our profitable growth. Investments that include subscription services quoting and ordering capabilities that streamline the sales, online purchasing experience and overall customer service experience for cloud-based solutions. These investments contributed to our cloud and security practice success, which were once again our fastest growing solution practice areas. Our third strategy is to increase our service capabilities, like software. Services are becoming an increasingly larger component of total customer IT spend. Today, IT is under more and more pressure to maximize the return of their investment. IT leaders are accountable for both running the business and using technology to transform the business. To do both, they are looking for ways to direct resources where they can have the greatest impact. When prioritizing spend, it doesn't make economic sense to run a 24x7 operation to support their e-mail or applications nor does it make sense to invest in the resources necessary to effectively monitor a network or public cloud performance. This is where we come in. CDW Services provide access to our scale and expertise to deliver cost efficiencies and enhance quality. We have built a robust portfolio of professional services, including advisory, architecture and managed services across cloud, collaboration, data center, mobility and security solutions. These offerings are underpinned by our 24x7 network operating centers, as well as services that include cloud planning services and managed cloud. All of these investments help our customers maximize the return on their IT investment. Let me share a recent example of this. A mid-sized multi-location company in the insurance space had acquired the insurance operations from a diversified entity. Their IT team needed help operationalizing the combined entity. They needed to first separate the acquired IT assets including applications, websites, portals and several databases from the existing IT infrastructure and then integrate them into the newly combined infrastructure. From consulting through engineering, migration, hosting and managed services, we architected the entire solution from end to end. Once this goes live next month, we will manage the customer's entire environment. The solution generated more than $150,000 of one-time revenues for assessment, project management, staff aug and installation. It will also generate more than $30,000 per month in recurring revenues. This is a great example of our three-part strategy in action, solving key business problems for our customers in today's environment that requires great relationships and strong service and solution capabilities. These capabilities combined with our competitive advantage of scale, scope and disciplined execution help drive sustainable, profitable growth for us today and in the future. The tighter market conditions we saw in the quarter influenced our hiring and we remained cautious ending the quarter with 59 additional customer-facing coworkers since the beginning of the year. With similar conditions expected to continue, we currently look to end the year at coworker counts roughly in line with current levels. Of course, as we always do, we will continue to monitor the marketplace and adjust our plans if we feel necessary. And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. You will recall that on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectation for U.S. IT market growth in 2016 to come in at the low end between 2% and 3%. This was predicated on expected improved business investment as we moved through the year. Given third quarter corporate earnings reports in general, as well as the tech industry participants, we now expect U.S. IT growth to come in below that for the full year. Within this environment, we continue to target our annual medium-term target to outgrow the U.S. IT market by 200 to 300 basis points on an organic constant currency basis. This excludes incremental CDW UK contribution and 150 basis points we plan from Dell. Excellent results, especially considering our success selling solutions and services that are accounted for on a netted down basis. While driving our strong gross profit performance in the quarter, we estimate that our success providing warranties, software assurance, cloud and certain software costs roughly a couple hundred basis points of top line growth. We are well prepared to continue to address the needs of our partners and customers as they move through this IT transformation and manage in a challenging economic environment. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforce our confidence, that we have the right strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro or channel-specific challenges and positions us for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. A strategy designed to continue our evolution into the leading IT solution provider in North America and UK. And most importantly, a strategy that delivers profitable growth and strong cash flows. This confidence has led our board to approve a 49% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, consistent with our capital allocation priority of achieving a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow by year-end 2019. I know many of you may be wondering what we expect for 2017. We are in the middle of our planning process, and as we always do, we'll provide our 2017 outlook on our year-end conference call. With that, let me turn it over to Ann who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our third quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, best of product offerings and focus on profitable growth. It also reflects the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver double-digit earnings growth and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to our P&L, if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide eight. Consolidated top line growth was solid this quarter with net sales of $3.7 billion, 5.9% higher than last year on a reported basis and on an average daily sales basis. Average daily sales were $57.9 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were 6.5% higher than last year. Currency in Q3 was impacted by the British pound to U.S. dollar translation, shaving 60 basis points off of growth. Currency impact was 40 basis points more than last quarter and similar to Q3 2015 as the impact of Canadian to U.S. dollar translation diminished in Q3 and the British pound impact started up with two months UK sales in the base. North American sales, which are a good proxy for organic sales, increased 4.4% year-over-year. North American sequential sales increased 1.6% on an average daily sales basis versus Q2 2016, which is lower than our historical Q2 to Q3 sequential increase, but slightly greater than last year's rate. Gross profit for the quarter increased 8.3% to $614.3 million. Gross margin in the third quarter was 16.6%, 40 basis points above last year. Once again, gross margin expansion reflected our success providing solutions and services that are recorded at 100% gross margin, including SaaS, software assurance and other warranties. As you know, mixing into netted down revenue favorably impacts gross margin and gross profit growth but tempers revenue growth and can distort market share gain as we record this revenue net while our vendor partners record this revenue at gross. Gross margin expansion also reflected higher vendor-partner funding and the inclusion of CDW UK, which has a higher mix of services. Together, these increases more than offset a decline in product margin this quarter. Turning to SG&A on slide nine, consolidated reported SG&A including advertising expense, was 3.9% higher than last year and includes $10 million of non-cash equity compensation, $2.4 million of acquisition and integration expense, $2.1 million on loss of extinguishment of debt and $0.4 million of historical retention costs and other expenses. Non-case equity-based compensation expense increased $2.2 million year-over-year to $10 million, primarily due to 2016 annual equity awards granted late in the first quarter of this year and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of CDW UK. Reported SG&A also includes a gain of $3.5 million from a legal settlement. Excluding these expenses and the gain, our adjusted SG&A increased 6.4%. This reflects increased sales compensation consistent with higher gross profit, the impact of 225 incremental coworkers added since the end of Q3 last year, and incremental July CDW UK SG&A. To make it easier to calculate our adjusted EBITDA, which is essentially our gross profit less adjusted SG&A expenses, we also adjust for depreciation and amortization. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $310.4 million, up 10%, delivering a margin of 8.4%, an increase of 30 basis points over last year. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 10, interest expense was $37.6 million, similar to last year's Q3 amount. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate was 36.5% compared to 38.7% in last year's Q3, and included two discreet items recorded in the quarter : early adoption of ASC 718 related to equity compensation; and a change in UK statutory rates. This resulted in a tax expense of $72.3 million versus $95.3 million last year. On a GAAP basis, we earned $125.9 million of net income. Recall the third quarter of 2015 net income included a pre-tax gain of $98.1 million related to the re-measurement of the company's initial 35% equity investment in CDW UK to fair value. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance was $160.3 million in the quarter, up 11.9% over last year. As you can see on slide 11, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add-backs that fall into four general buckets : the ongoing amortization of purchase intangibles; non-cash equity compensation; acquisition and integration expenses; and other non-recurring or infrequent income or expenses. Since the two discreet tax items in the quarter relate to items that are added back to non-GAAP net income, the tax benefits were reversed, so they are not included in non-GAAP net income. With Q3 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 165 million, we delivered $0.97 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 16.1% over the prior year. Turning to year-to-date results on slide 12, revenue was $10.5 billion, an increase of 9.6% on a reported basis and 9% on an average daily sales basis, given one extra selling day in Q1 of this year. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales growth would have been roughly 40 basis points higher. Gross profit during the first nine months of 2016 was $1.7 billion, up 12.3%. Gross profit margin was 16.7%, up 40 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $844 million, 10.9% above the first nine months of 2015. Net income was $321 million for the first nine months of 2016, and non-GAAP net income was $429 million versus $380 million in 2015, up 12.8%. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 13. On September 30, we had $118 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3.1 billion as compared to $3.2 billion at September 30, 2015. Our cash plus revolver availability was just under $1 billion. Net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 was 2.9 times, within our target range of 2.5 times to 3 times. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.3%, 10 basis points below last year. During the quarter, we refinanced our $1.5 billion term loan, which lowered the LIBOR floor to 75 points, down 25 bps, and extended the term loan to December 2023. During the quarter, we also finalized the replacement of $1.2 billion of the current 2% caps for the term loan with new caps at 1.5%, which will become effective at the beginning of 2017. We intend to purchase interest rate caps on an additional $200 million notional amount by year-end. With roughly 95% of our outstanding debt at either fixed rates or hedged, rates would have to move significantly before they had a material impact on our interest costs. As you can see on slide 14, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q3. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 18 days, the same number of days as last year's third quarter and below our target range, which is an annual target. Year-over-year DPO and DSO increased four days. Note that when we have a higher mix of sales being netted down, we see increases in both DSO and DPO. This is because these sales are booked net on the P&L, but our receivables reflect the gross billings to the customer. At the same time, payables are matched to get zero cost of goods sold, so both these measures increase. That is why we focus on our cash conversion cycle because that is the best measure of our working capital efficiency. Cash taxes paid for the quarter were $102 million and cash interest was $43.1 million. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures, was a positive $138.4 million compared to $156.2 million in Q3 of 2015. Quarterly free cash flow was impacted by our mix into Public sales, particularly to government customers, which are typically slower payers. For the first nine months of the year, free cash flow was $497.1 million, $224 million more than last year's first nine months. As you recall, free cash flow in 2015 was $100 million lower than normal due to one-time items and timing, which pulled forward roughly $100 million of free cash flow into Q4 2014. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $131 million at an average cost of $44.76 per share. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you can see on slide 15. First, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases, in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.16 per share on December 12 to shareholders of record as of November 25, up 49% from a year ago. Since the IPO, our dividend has increased nearly fourfold the initial annual level of $0.17. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 times to 3 times. We ended Q3 at 2.9 times. Third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. At the end of September, we had $654 million remaining of our current authorization. These capital allocation priorities support our 2016 to 2018 medium-term targets, which you can see on slide 16. Similar to our 2013 to 2015 targets, we continue to target growth of 200 to 300 basis points, faster than the U.S. IT market. We also continue to target an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-7% range. Reflecting the conclusion of our initial refinancings and absence of earnings amplification from lower interest expense, our 2016 through 2018 medium-term annual target call for low double-digit EPS growth. We intend to use share repurchases and accretive acquisitions to amplify operating results and help achieve this target. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our medium-term targets on an annual, not a quarterly, basis. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling the balance of 2016. I am on slide 17. Given our current outlook for Q4, we continue to expect that balance of sales between first and second half to be generally consistent with our normal seasonality, roughly 48% to 52%, weighted towards the back half of the year. We have one fewer selling day in Q4 2016 than we had in Q4 2015, and two fewer days sequentially this year Q3 to Q4. So, average daily sales growth will be higher than reported sales growth on both a year-over-year basis and on an sequential basis. On an average daily sales basis, we now look for consolidated sales to sequentially decline Q3 to Q4 at a slightly greater level than last year, as fourth quarter 2015 incremental U.K. sales contribution is partially offset by higher sequential federal sales this year. Given the recent weakening in the pound, we now expect currency to have an impact of roughly 120 basis points in the fourth quarter, as the British pound to U.S. dollar will drive the Q4 impact. This is in average translation rates of CAD 1 equal to US$ 0.77 and US$ 1.20 to the British pound in Q4. We expect our gross margin percentage to be at, or very slightly above Q4 2015. This reflects expectations of continued success delivering solutions and services booked at net revenue, partially offset by the impact of Federal sales, which tend to have a lower margin. Turning to expenses. We expect reported SG&A to grow more in line with reported sales growth as we lap last year's Q4 hiring of roughly 200 coworkers and UK is in our base. Given year-to-date performance and outlook for Q4, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to exceed our medium-term annual target of the mid-7% range. However, given gross margin and adjusted SG&A outlook for Q4, we look for Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be within that range. Interest expense, depreciation, amortization, non-cash equity compensation and acquisition expenses are expected to remain at similar rates to Q3 2016. We continue to look for our 2016 effective tax rate to be in the 37% to 38% range with Q4 at the high end of that range. Given year-to-date performance, we expect full year non-GAAP EPS to exceed our medium-term annual target of low double-digit growth coming in at the mid-teens, reflecting both strong operating results and share repurchases. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling our cash flow. We continue to look for capital expenditures to come in at roughly 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. For free cash flow, we expect to be above, our rule of thumb, of 2.5% to 3% of net sales. As we have made excellent progress in managing our working capital, you should look for us to sustain our cash conversion cycle at the low end of our target range of a low to mid-20s for 2016. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 37% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which is now running at approximately $47 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually, related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. That concludes the financial summary. We will provide commentary on our expectations for 2017 on our year-end call. Before we open for Q&A, let me briefly address the SEC investigation we disclosed in 2015 relating to vendor-partner program incentive. We have no further updates since our last conference call. We continue to cooperate fully with the SEC and, although we cannot predict the outcome based on what we know to-date, we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on the company. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your question to one question and one brief follow-up. Operator, can you please provide the instructions for asking a question? Operator : Absolutely. And our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess two questions from me. One, maybe to start with the coworker count, I think it was down on a sequential basis, the first decrease we've seen in a while. Can you just talk about what drove that and how to think about the head count as you go forward? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Good morning, Amit. This is Tom. So, in your first question, as I said at the end, we've remained pretty conservative as we've kind of got into the latter part of the year as far as adding coworkers. And one of the nice things about the model is we have kind of a built-in purposeful attrition rate as we bring in a lot of young people and they start their careers in selling. So, that gives us the ability to kind of manage that number. And the other part of that is, I think, keep in mind, Amit, remember last year in the fourth quarter, as you heard Ann say, we added over 200 coworkers. So, that kind of distorts the perfect year calendar year number. And so, absorbing those coworkers and getting them productive has been our priority. But, look, as I think it sounds like a broken record, if we see some signs that the economy starts to pick up after the election, we're ready and willing and able to increase the coworker count. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess, Ann, great to see the dividend increase that you guys announced today. I guess just broadly, what prevents, inhibits you guys from having a more aggressive cap allocation policy, maybe returning all the free cash you generated to shareholders. Given the fact your leverage is optimized and I think you guys have done three deals in 20 years or something, what's the hesitation not having a more aggressive free cash return to shareholders? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Amit. Actually, we think our capital allocation strategy is relatively aggressive. As we lay out in that strategy, we want to return cash to shareholders via the dividend. As you mentioned, we're going to hold our leverage in the current range. From time to time, we'll do tuck-in acquisitions and then we'll return remaining cash to shareholders via share repurchases. I think we've done a bit over $350 million of repurchases this year on a year-to-date basis. And on top of the dividends that we've paid and the dividend that we've declared for this quarter, we have returned a significant amount of our free cash flow to shareholders this year. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, guys. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Amit. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. Just a question, Tom, just regarding your commentary on continued weakness and cautious stance from enterprise customers. Is there is any signs that some of these push-outs will get done either this quarter or any pipeline looking into next year? Or is that just going to be continued choppy demand environment? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. Good morning, Matt, and thanks for the question. Yeah, look, I'm always careful when I describe kind of the current state when it comes to, like within a quarter, especially because a lot of the solutions business has a longer selling cycle. But as I indicated, we did see some sub-segments, if you will, of our MedLar business pop this quarter, specifically the financial services and non-for-profit segments, had really strong quarters. And we did see some of the pipeline I referred to last quarter hit in the third quarter, but there's still a meaningful part of it left that we think are going to hopefully pop in the fourth quarter and into next year. I think the economic overhang, if I can say it that way, I think there's a lot of evidence that it's impacting decision making, whether it's the dramatic success we've had in selling warranties and assurances to kind of extend life cycles or some of the general economic data map. So, I would say I feel pretty bullish on the work that we're doing and the kind of the tracking of deals and the things we're doing to help customers in the Corporate group. But I think we're just going to have to wait and see kind of how the economy plays out in the next couple of quarters. But again, I feel good about the \u2013 I think the word I used was positive growth or positive shoots we've seen so far since last quarter. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And on the gross margin guidance were flattish year-over-year following three quarters of pretty strong growth on a year-over-year basis, and I understand that the mix of federal, some of the push-outs into the fourth quarter have something to do with that. But by in large, are you expecting gross margins to trend higher going forward due to the things that you talked about, the warranties, the netted down revenue, et cetera? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: And, Matt, I think that's a great question. I'll answer the first part and let Ann kind of clean it up, so to speak. I think those two questions you asked are actually linked. I think what you see is if you just think about our product performance, you had hardware growing at 4%. You had software growing at 9%. You had services growing at 12%. I think where we see kind of the impact when the economy is a little more choppy in the corporate space is in the hardware space. And if we get some of the expected growth I talked about in your first question, those margins tend to put pressure on our total gross profit or gross margin. And then, couple that with \u2013 I talked about we did have a good budget flush in federal. The issue was a lot of it didn't get shipped and that will ship over the next two quarters. So, that's why you kind of see that pressure comment that we talked about because we do expect some of those things to, in a weird way, offset some of the positive margin we're getting from software assurance, services and cloud. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah. The only thing I would add is I did say flat to very slightly up. You have to remember that our gross margin does move around significantly as we reported at \u2013 we talked about repeatedly in the Q driven by mix, right, which is hard to predict and then things as well as vendor funding. The other thing to keep in mind is we've been getting about a 10 basis points pickup from the mix into the UK business. That is now over with the lap of the acquisition. So, that's been a little part of the pickup you've seen on a year-to-date basis as well. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. I also have a question about the slowdown in number. I guess, Tom, taking your commentary on a little bit of a more competitive environment out there, can you just help us understand how much of the decline that we saw in the quarter was driven by maybe CDW participating in some of those ASP declines you mentioned versus walking away from deals that didn't hit your overall profitability thresholds? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I'd say it's more of the latter than the former, Matt. That doesn't say that when we think it's the right situation we aren't willing to compete hard for a piece of business from a strategic perspective. But I think it's more driven by \u2013 like your \u2013 the second part of your comment, just looking at some of those deals. Look, we've seen this movie before, quite honestly. Even in my time here at CDW, when there's a tough economic climate, people tend to get really competitive, trying to grab top line revenue growth and it tends to pressure ASPs. And I think our position and my personal position is you have to be really thoughtful that you can't try to just chase top line growth because it really, I think in the long-term, is not the right thing for the business. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then, it sounded like there was a little bit of a pickup in the performance out of servers in the quarter. I'm just curious what drove that acceleration off of what sounded like a little bit of a weaker first half of the year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Matt, that's a great question. It was \u2013 you heard me say that it grew \u2013 servers grew in every one of our segments. I'm going to use my favorite economic term, lumpy. I think we've seen that with the solution business where we \u2013 I think we went for, like, four or five quarters last year of server growth. Then, we went through two or three quarters of server decline. I think a lot of that has to do with the decisions that people are making in the data center, the options they now have and then \u2013 so, you see quarters where it just works out that a lot of projects hit where people want to refresh or add edge-based servers. And others, they don't. So, I wouldn't get \u2013 I don't let us get too carried away with one quarter of great performance or one quarter of bad performance. We'll see how it plays out. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Shannon. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Good morning. Nice to talk to you. The first question I have is, looking at the Dell deal, especially now that they've closed EMC, just if you can give any kind of update on what you're hearing from them, any changes, how the relationship is progressing, that would be great. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I think if they shared that with me, Shannon, I'd be pretty hesitant to share it with everyone else. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : No, no, not them specifically with you guys, like, how your relationship is. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: But I would say, look, I think they've done a nice job of managing through that. That's always a challenge every time you see a merger. It tends to create a little hesitancy in customers, right, because customers want to understand, like, who the leadership team is going to be and what is the \u2013 and so, I think the market clearly saw some of that. But as far as our relationship with them, it has continued to be strong and robust and everything we expected it to be. So, we feel pretty bullish about that combined company and their ability to help us meet customer needs going forward, just like we do with our other strategic partners. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. And then, a question on currency from a UK perspective. Do you think that you can have any kind of pricing power or ability? I mean, I know all the companies are trying to figure out how you offset some of the currency pressure with what's going on with the pound. But I'm curious, especially given the move in September in the pound, are you able to price up at all? Or are you basically just having to absorb everything at this point? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: So, what we see happen is some of our OEM partners will take pricing increases to offset. And then, from that, we now have this higher level of pricing, which obviously we try and pass through. It remains a competitive marketplace. But think about our pricing as more of a margin than that we're actually making the price in the market, if that makes sense. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Shannon. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Just looking at the corporate business, with MedLar declining, it seems like the small business segment, though, is holding up and staying within the U.S. IT spending type of range. Is that just because the small businesses are growing a bit more? Or do you think that you're doing better there? Or do you think that your solutions are better there? Just curious about that difference between the two corporate sides. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I would say it's probably all of the above in little pieces, Sherri, as you think about performance. I think one of the things that has really helped keep the small business performance is the affinity of small businesses for a cloud-based solution. And the small business team has done a great job of executing on our cloud strategy. Now, that is a little more of a complex decision, when you move up market, if you think about it. The previous investment of capital in on-prem or off-prem solutions is a little higher in the corporate \u2013 in the enterprise segment, so the decision is a little longer. So, I would say that I wouldn't try to read too much into it relative to the difference between the two. There's just different buying behaviors in each of the two different marketplaces, and they've kind of just maintained their performance. They're not quite as impacted by the concentration, if you will, that we have in our enterprise segment in some of the industries like oil and gas and manufacturing down in the small business marketplace because it's such a big base and there are so many customers. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just looking at the government piece, you guys have had strength in that segment for a number of quarters. How sustainable do you think that strength is? Is there a certain point where we'll start to see some slower growth in that segment? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, that conversation happens a lot inside of CDW, and I have high expectations in my leadership team for sustainability in government performance. But I'd say, all kidding aside, I think that group has done a really good job of capturing new contracts, which is an important part of that sustained growth, and we continue to think there's opportunities for that, especially in state and local. And then, on the federal side, this realignment we did around focusing on programs I think will pay dividends. So, look, it's tough for me to forecast out into the future. But I would expect them to continue to be an important part of our growth profile. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. This is Adam in for Brian. I just wanted to build off the earlier question on the co-worker count decline. I understand that the revenue growth targets through 2018 are unchanged. But maybe help us understand what this may imply about the more intermediate term organic revenue growth outlook, and I asked because I think the organic growth has been above 5% in maybe two of the last seven quarters. Yet, we're all expecting it to be above 5% each quarter next year. So, I want to make sure we're thinking about the correct variables. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I think you're thinking about it right, and we're going to continue to add co-workers. If you think, Adam, about my point about since the fourth quarter of last year, we added 200 co-workers because we did a big end of the year push and hired a lot of people. So, as \u2013 if I were doing it, I would worry less and focus less on the year-to-date number and more on the last 12 months. We'll continue to focus on adding co-workers based on the market and what we see out there. And I don't think you should, kind of, draw any negative correlations. I feel pretty good about our organic growth and especially considering what's going on in the marketplace. I think there's lots of opportunity for us. We still, despite our size, have a relatively large share. And I expect that the growth of the hardware business will come back, and that will stimulate some of the top line revenue growth that has been absent during the kind of the economic period we've been through especially in the corporate. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And maybe just building off that answer, why do you think the hardware weakness is more cyclical versus secular? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think part of it is driven by \u2013 some of it is technologies. And what are going on with technologies is people enhance and innovate, so to speak. I also think that, when you look at, hey, I've got some economic pressures. I may not upgrade certain hardware technologies. Remember, despite all of the success we've had in cloud and the industry, there's still a predominance of hardware-based, premise-based solutions out there and I think that you're going to \u2013 you will see that. Now, look, I don't have perfect vision on this Adam. But my sense is, when you look at the success of things like converged infrastructure and hyper-converged and some of the innovation that's going on in the client area, I would expect that to re-emerge at some point in time. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Adam. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. It's clear you don't want anyone to get carried away with the 40 basis points increase in gross margin in the quarter and year-to-date. And there are some cyclical factors that you outlined near term. But if you think about a longer-term view as the business mixes towards more warranties and software assurance and cloud, why isn't there upward pressure just structurally on gross margins? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm glad that that message came through loud and clear. The second is because I think, Katy \u2013 and again, none of us have this perfect vision. But I do think you're going to see a couple of things happen. Just because that part of the business is growing today and is margin rich doesn't mean that some time in that future you won't even have commoditization in that part of the business. That has been the history, as you know, of IT for a long period of time. The second thing is kind of alluding to the question that Adam just answered. I think you are going to see some increased hardware growth, and that's going to put pressure on it. But I think, generally, look, I don't deny that, as we continue to be successful in selling the things that customers are most interested in now, be it cloud, software assurance, warranties, that it's going to continue to give us the opportunity for margin expansion going forward. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then, just as a follow-up, any updated sign as to the impact of the Brexit vote on UK demand? I appreciate that the pound is a headwind, but what are you seeing from an organic demand perspective in that market? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, good questions. Thanks for asking it, Katy. It's been interesting. I think it's the way to start. It was a little strange right after Brexit. There was this kind of doom and gloom. And then, after a couple of weeks, we actually saw the UK customers kind of return to a sense of, okay, normalcy and we'll deal with it when we actually execute the withdrawal so to speak of the EU. And while I would say there is this notion that if the dates that Theresa May has announced, if she sticks to them, that that will certainly change some things. But I would say, kind of, on the ground, up until that time, it feels pretty normal, and people are just going about their business, making decisions on investing in IT. But I think all of us have our eye on next spring. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Katy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Good morning. I wanted to clarify the Dell comment. Tom, you're still on track for 150 basis points of incremental revenue in F 2016, it sounds like. And I guess, do you feel like you've been able to take on this relationship without serious channel conflict? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: We think \u2013 look, we're pleased with what they're doing. I mean, I would say, look, the general economy, Jayson, affects every part of CDW, all right? And you can't just say, well, it affects some people and not others. But I think we're on the whole and on the average really pleased with the performance. And I think what we said to our other partners has been true \u2013 is we have a history of dealing across multiple vendors. We have a thousand partners, and our reputation for integrity stands. And I think, our other partners, as evidenced by their investment in CDW and some of the things Ann talked about relative to our VIR (55:55) performance suggests we're doing the things they want us to do. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, a follow-up on your software results. Really strong. You mentioned security in the cloud, likely, a trend that continues. I understand this revenue is netted down, but wanted to follow up on the cash flow economics and how that impacts your business and comp plans, and I'm asking because we've heard it's been tough on some of your peers. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I'll give you a high level. I \u2013 comp plans, I think our guys would say it's been awesome because we paid people on margin and it's a pretty margin-rich business and we feel good about the impact that it's had. I don't know. I'll let Ann, see I haven't heard anything about cash flow from a negative perspective. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah. It's doesn't \u2013 I mean, you hear the commentary that I make about our cash conversion cycle. When we sell things that are netted down, it increases DSO and it also increases DPO as an offset. One of the benefits is things that are digital, if you will, we don't carry any inventory on and therefore don't have inventory rev (57:09). So, from a return on investment perspective, it can be a very attractive business. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Jayson, the only I can think of, I was thinking about your comment, is \u2013 but this is a little bit of old news, is when we first started to \u2013 when we formed our cloud practice, which was, I don't know, 2011 or 2012, we went through a pretty strong education processes and said, look, to the degree that people buy on a subscription-based contract and your compensation will be spread over multiple years, you have to think about that as an annuity stream to your compensation. And you need to start planning and planting seeds and building for that annuity stream because, once that annuity stream starts to roll, it's a pretty nice day. And I think people listened and took that to heart. And I think that's one of the reasons we haven't had a lot of pushback on those kind of services. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That makes sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Your line is now open. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, Tom, big picture. If I look at the macro and the uncertainty persists, do you believe that there's more willingness by many of your corporate customers to switch to the cloud? And another way of looking at it is, are you able to differentiate between demand softness and the cloud transition so to speak? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So, my answer to the first question is no. I don't think the economy, at its current state, necessarily drives people in the Corporate segment to cloud computing. I mean, in a weird way, cloud computing is an OpEx expense. And so, the driver there is the level of service, the flexibility, the ability to manage the asset on a consumption basis. Those are things that are kind of compelling independent of what I'll call the surrounding economy. So, I don't really make that connection. Now, what I do think corporate customers are doing is, if they're thinking about upgrading a certain part of their infrastructure, they may decide to, I'll use the term, sweat the asset for another year and go buy incremental warranty or insurance protection to give them more time to do it. I think the notion of building a hybrid private public cloud environment is one driven more by the drivers of flexibility cost in the business than it is kind of the general economy. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And the macro demand versus the cloud transition, are you able to clearly differentiate that when you look on a customer basis? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I can \u2013 I don't know that I can do it in the aggregate. It would be really hard to determine in the aggregate. I think that cloud growth is all about people looking at their business, looking at workloads and deciding which workload is most effectively and efficiently handled either on-prem or in the cloud. And that's the driver of the growth that you've seen there. Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Richards for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Look, as always, thank you for your interest in CDW. Thank you for your questions. Your questions help us, so I really do appreciate the thought that's put into them. It helps us make sure we're focused on the right thing. As I always do, if your company needs some help with information technology, I can't think of anybody better to help you. And as we head into the Thanksgiving season, there's two things I want to ask you to be thankful for. One is that the election is almost over and so are the commercials. And the second thing is that the Cubbies are in the World Series. Go, Cubbies. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

And with that, I'll turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. 2016 was a year of both strong financial performance and strategic progress. For the year, we delivered a net sales increase of 7.6% with excellent profitability. On a constant currency basis, net sales grew 8.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 16.9%. Organic constant currency net sales which exclude results from our August 2015 acquisition of CDW UK for the first seven months of the year increased 4.4%. We also delivered strong profitable growth in the fourth quarter. Net sales increased 3.8% on an average daily basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 18.2%. This was the first quarter that CDW UK was apples-to-apples. 2016 performance was driven by the combined power of our nimble business model, balanced portfolio of customer end markets and diverse product suite. Let me briefly walk through each of these and how they contributed. First, our nimble business model, which enables us to capitalize on current market trends. In 2016, we saw four market trends, optimization of infrastructure, designing securely, increasing use of more efficient architectures and ongoing integration of software into solutions. Each of these trends influenced our 2016 results. The first trend, optimization of existing infrastructure is being accomplished by extending asset lives or enhancing capacity. Extending asset lives led to the customer and partner focus on warranties while focusing on enhancing capacity led to increased use of virtualization software. Customer spending for both of these categories increased by significant double-digits in 2016. The second trend, customer focus on designing IT securely is where security is being viewed as a core object of the IT mission. Our security practice maintains excellent momentum throughout the year, also posting a significant double-digit increase. The third trend, adopting more cost-efficient and flexible architectures is all about handling growth. To do this, customers are adopting both hyper-converged and cloud-based solutions. Cloud adoption increased across the business particularly for certain workloads. Spend on cloud-based security increased more than 75%, while spend on mobility and backup and recovery increased more than 50%. Hyper-converged solutions which deliver more density and lower cost had excellent growth across the business and sales were roughly doubled what they were in 2015. Finally, we saw the ongoing trend, where a greater portion of solutions are being delivered via software. With software becoming more mission-critical, customers continue to turn to software assurance to protect their investment. Again, generating strong double-digit increases in 2016. Given our business model, which enables us to pivot where the growth is, we were very successful in capitalizing on these customer trends. 2016 sales of warranties, software assurance and Software-as-a-Service, each increased at multiples of our hardware sales. All three of these solutions are accounted for on a netted down basis, which is why we refer to them as 100% gross margin. As always, we own the customer relationship, help the customer evaluate options, design a solution, procure it and even implement it. The only difference here is that the accounting treatment cost for only our profits to be accounted for as revenue. Given our success helping our customers address these needs, we mixed into 100% gross margin items and the accounting for these contributed to our gross profit improvement. They also incrementally compressed our top line by more than 200 basis points compared to 2015. Netting down primarily impacts our U.S. solutions business, which represents roughly 50% of our U.S. sales. U.S. solutions grew low single-digits for the year, gross profits increased more than twice the rate of sales. The second driver of our performance this year was the power of our balanced portfolio of end markets. With five U.S. channels, each with over $1 billion in 2016 net sales, and an additional $1.4 billion from our Canadian and UK operations, our diverse end markets help us absorb macro and exogenous impacts on the business. This diversity was clearly evident in 2016 as Public grew 7.8%, while Corporate increased 1%. Diversity of end markets also impacted Corporate performance. MedLar was flat, while Small Business increased 5%. Public's excellent year was the result of strong Government and Education performance, both of which increased low double digits for the year. Healthcare also increased 3%. Both our Canadian and UK businesses grew high single digits in local currency in 2016. Our balanced portfolio contributed to fourth quarter results as well. Corporate increased 2.5%. Small Business increased 9% as customer confidence and sales picked up after the election. MedLar increased just over 1%, although MedLar customers seemed encouraged by the potential of an improved economy, and going into 2017, they adopted more of a wait-and-see approach. Given the slow economy and the ongoing impact on budgets, MedLar customers remained focused squarely on optimization solutions and the use of more efficient architectures, so they could spend what they did have on key priorities like security. That said, we did begin to see the signs of improvement we anticipated, but we did not experience a large year-end budget flush. Public continued its momentum, up 4.6%. Once again, performance was excellent in K-12, higher ed, and state and local with all three increasing high single-digits or better. These results were tempered by federal performance as several very large client purchase orders were pushed into 2017 for delivery. As expected, Healthcare continued to see lumpy results, up 3% in the fourth quarter. U.S. solutions, again, mostly impacted by our success in 100% gross margin, were up 1% approximately while transactions increased high single digits. Our international business had a very strong quarter with both Canada and the UK growing double digits in local currency. The final driver of our performance was our diverse product suite of more than 100,000 products from over 1,000 leading and emerging brands, which ensures we are well positioned to meet our customers' evolving needs and market trends. Our broad portfolio enables us to follow our customers and capitalize on market trends, and ultimately that is what determines the drivers of our growth. You can see the impact of these trends in both our full year and fourth quarter growth where hardware increased 3%, software increased 8% and services increased 12%. Let's take a quick look at some of the drivers in the quarter. We had strong results in notebooks, mobile devices and desktops. Together, they delivered double-digit growth. While we saw increases in netcomm, hardware and federal state and local and small business, they were not sufficient enough to offset the clients in K-12 resulting from continued delays in E-Rate funding and MedLar where customers were extending the lives of network assets via warranties. Both service and storage increased in Public. Meaningful increase in emerging technologies like flash storage and hyper-converged were not enough to make up for the delays I mentioned in Corporate purchases. Another key driver of hardware sales was strong growth in both video projection and collaboration. Everywhere you go today, either in the classroom or the corporation, you see AV or video conferencing equipment to enable collaboration and communication. And we are following our customers here as well. Growth in video projection hardware including digital signage and video screens was excellent throughout the year and the fourth quarter was no exception, posting increases across all of our customer end markets and growing high-single digits. Collaboration hardware increased low-double digits in 2016 and continued its strong performance in the quarter. Growth from these two categories combined more than offset the declines in storage and servers, a great example of the power of our diverse portfolio. Software continued to be powered by strong performance in security. Focus on optimization also drove excellent gains in virtualization and software assurance. We continued our double-digit growth in services in the fourth quarter. We had meaningful increase in warranties that cover network infrastructure, storage and servers. Combined warranty growth was in the high teens. 2016 was a year of both financial and strategic progress. During the year, we achieved three key strategic milestones. First, we surpassed $1.5 billion in customer spend on workloads delivered via cloud solutions. As you would expect, security was one of the top five workloads we delivered via cloud in 2016. Cloud-based solutions clearly contributed to the second 2016 milestone we achieved, surpassing $1 billion of customer spend on security. That is just one piece of the mosaic. Our security practice delivers solutions across multiple platforms : cloud, hardware, software and services, for more than 50 different partners, including new partners in emerging growth areas like next-gen endpoint protection and incident response. Let me share an example of how our broad portfolio of products and deep technical expertise is helping our customers. A long-term global consumer products customer needed to strengthen its defense strategy against sophisticated cyber attacks. Working with their IT team, we formulated the strategy, created the project charter, the scope, the goals and roles. We designed a full-scale global incident response plan that delivers enterprise-wide visibility, detection expertise and investigation workflows that leverages a cloud-based threat analytics platform. While developing the plan, we found breaches that led to new approaches for endpoint security, firewall segmentation and implementation, and improved user authentication tools. We also migrated the customer's contact center to a new platform and help deploy a production pilot for private cloud. This comprehensive approach reached across our entire security portfolio and included consulting, hardware, software and cloud. It generated nearly $1 million in 2016 net sales. In addition, it will generate roughly $200,000 in annual recurring revenue over the next three years. The third milestone we achieved in 2016 relates to CDW UK. In 2016, we generated over $75 million of customer spend in cross referrals from the U.S. to the UK and from the UK to the U.S., great results so far, and this is only the beginning. These milestones were possible because of our ongoing investment in our three-part strategy for growth. In 2016, we made progress against all three. Our first strategy is to capture market share and acquire new customers. In 2016, we continued to invest in our co-workers. Investments included seller productivity tools that add capacity including ongoing training and tools and enablement infrastructure like our new services recommendation engine. We launched our new IT Orchestration Campaign, highlighting the role we bring in bringing the right people and solutions and partners together to simplify IT for our customers and delivering exceptional customer outcomes. We extended it to the UK when we rebranded CDW UK. Our Dell partnership plan moved ahead as planned, and we easily delivered our target of 150 basis points of incremental growth. We made outstanding progress against our first strategy in 2016, though our final market numbers are not yet available, given U.S. GDP growth of 1.6%, we estimate our customer spend growth easily exceeded our annual target of outgrowing U.S. IT market by 200 to 300 basis points on an organic constant currency basis. Our second strategy is to continuously enhance our ability to deliver high-growth integrated solutions. This is vital to our ability to stay relevant to our customers, and we accomplish this by adding new partners and capabilities and leveraging our deep technical resources, so we meet our customer's priorities as they evolve. In 2016, we added more than 70 new partners in fast-growing categories like endpoint security and hyper-converged appliances. Our third strategic priority is to expand our service capabilities. In 2016, we opened another market and now have technical specialists, service delivery and sales co-workers in more than 25 major metro markets in the U.S. and UK. We also added managed services for Azure to our service portfolio, leveraging our 24x7 enterprise command center and launched a new network security services team. These excellent results would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated and talented team of 8,500 co-workers including more than 1,000 CDW UK co-workers who joined us in late 2015. Our customers and partners tell us that our co-workers are a true source of advantage in a highly competitive market, and are a key reason why we are successful delivering industry-leading profitable growth quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. Let me close with a few thoughts about what we expect in 2017. We are cautiously optimistic that U.S. GDP will accelerate in 2017 and currently look for the U.S. IT market to grow somewhere between a little above 2% and a little above 3%. With economic forecasts calling for acceleration throughout the year, we expect faster growth in the back end of the year. For CDW UK and Canada, we currently expect IT growth in local currency for both markets to come in below the U.S. in the 1% range. We expect performance of at least 200 to 300 basis points better than each market in local currency. With an improved economy, we expect hardware sales to accelerate. At the same time, we expect customers to remain focused on optimization, secure design, efficient architectures and embedded software. We continue to target outperforming the U.S. IT market by 200 to 300 basis points in constant currency. As we always do, we will refine our views of market growth as we move through the year. Given our outlook for improving market conditions, we currently looked at between 100 and 125 net new customer facing co-workers in 2017. You may recall we added nearly 200 new North American customer facing co-workers and just over 700 from the UK in the second half of 2015. We shared on our fourth quarter call last year that given the uncertainty in the economy, we liked the flexibility this gave us to either absorb the capacity and onboard these new co-workers or add additional co-workers depending on market conditions. As we move through the year, we opted to focus on on-boarding and productivity initiatives, ending up the year with 12 internal customer-facing co-workers supplemented by 77 full-time service equivalents. We're off to a good start on our 2017 hiring plan with 47 new starts in our January sales class. You should expect us to refine our hiring plan as we move through the year and adjust as necessary. In 2017, you should also expect us to continue execute on our three-part strategy to ensure we are well-positioned to continue to generate profitable growth. A great example is the January 1 launch of our new Small Business segment. By separating Small Business from our Corporate segment, we expect to drive increased focus and accountability for both segments. Our new Small Business unit is focused on going to market the way their customers do. To achieve our vision to be Small Business customers' first choice for technology, we are aligning co-workers and digital resources that point directly at this fast-growing market which is why we moved our e-commerce team to Small Business. As we execute on all three of our strategic priorities, we will enhance our value proposition to both customers and partners, ensure we evolve with the market, and continue to capitalize on current trends. By doing so, we intend to continue to profitably grow faster than the market while generating superior returns today and in the future. And with that, let me turn it over to Ann who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our full year and fourth quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our nimble business model, balanced portfolio of channels, and breadth of product offerings. They also reflect the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver double-digit earnings growth, and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to our P&L, if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $3.5 billion, 2.2% higher than last year on a reported basis, and 3.8% on an average daily sales basis as there was one less selling day this quarter than last year. Average daily sales were $56.3 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated average daily sales were 5% higher than last year. Currency in Q4 was driven by the British pound to U.S. dollar translation, shaving 120 basis points off of growth. Currency impact was 60 basis points higher than last quarter as we experienced a full quarter's impact from British pound translation. There was no currency impact from the Canadian to U.S. dollar translation. On an average daily sales basis, North American sequential sales were down 3.7% versus Q3 2016, which is a slightly greater decline than recent Q4 seasonality and higher than we expected due to the delay in federal shipments. Gross profit for the quarter increased 3.6% to $578 million. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 16.5%, 20 basis points above last year, and was once again favorably impacted by a higher mix of netted down revenues including SaaS, software assurance, and warranties. Gross margin expansion also reflected higher vendor partner funding. Together, these increases more than offset a decline in product margin. Turning to SG&A on slide 9, consolidated reported SG&A including advertising expense was roughly 1% higher than last year, and includes $11.1 million of non-cash equity compensation, $1.1 million of acquisition and integration expenses, and $1 million of historical retention costs and other expenses. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense remained flat year-over-year. Our adjusted SG&A which also increased 1% was primarily driven by advertising. Co-worker count was up roughly 50 to just over 8,500 as of December 31, 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $273.7 million, up 6.3%. This delivered a margin of 7.8% up 30 basis points over last year driven in large part by the impact netted down revenues had on gross margin. Turning to the rest of the P&L on slide 10. Interest expense was $33.9 million, $4.5 million lower than last year's Q4 level, reflecting the impact of a positive mark-to-market for our interest rate caps, and a 25-basis point lower LIBOR floor rate on our term loan, which we refinanced in the third quarter. Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate was 36.6% compared to 37% in last year's Q4. This resulted in a tax expense of $59.6 million versus $52.4 million. Fourth quarter tax expense included the positive impact of mixing into international earnings. On a GAAP basis, we earned $103.2 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance, was $140.4 million in the quarter, up 13.4% over last year. As you can see on slide 11, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add-backs that fall in four general buckets : the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, non-cash equity compensation, acquisition and integration expenses and other non-recurring or infrequent income or expenses. With Q4 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 163 million, we delivered $0.86 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 18.2% over the prior year. Turning to year-to-date results on slide 12. Revenue was $13.9 billion, an increase of 7.6% on a reported and average daily sales basis. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales growth would have been roughly 60 basis points higher. Gross profit for the year was $2.3 billion, up 10%. Gross profit margin was 16.6%, up 30 basis points, reflecting the impact of netting down end partner funding. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, 9.7% above 2015. Net income was $424 million in 2016, and non-GAAP net income was $569 million versus $504 million in 2015, up 13%. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 13. On December 31, we had $263.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3 billion as compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1 billion. Net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q4 was 2.7 times within our target range of 2.5 to 3 times. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.3%, 10 basis points below last year. During the quarter, we purchased interest rate caps on an additional $200 million notional amount and now have 1.5% caps on our term loan in the amount of $1.4 billion that will expire in December 2018. With these caps in place, roughly 95% of our outstanding debt is either fixed rate or hedged. As you can see on slide 14, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q4. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 2 days from last year's fourth quarter and below our annual target of the low-to-mid 20s. Year-over-year, DPO increased four days and DSO increased three days. DPO increased due to mixing into partners with longer payment terms as well as mixing into sales being netted down, which drives increases in both DSO and DPO. This is because these sales are booked net on the P&L, but our receivables reflect the gross billings to the customer. At the same time, payables are matched against zero cost of goods sold. So, both measures increased. That is why we focus on our cash convergence cycle, because it is the best measure of our working capital efficiency. Cash taxes paid for the quarter were $94.7 million and cash interest was $27.6 million. Free cash flow for the quarter which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures, was $186.2 million (sic) [$186.7 million] (27:59) compared to $9.6 million in Q4 of 2015. For the year, free cash flow was $684.2 million, $400.9 million more than last year. As you may recall, free cash flow in 2015 was impacted by one-time items and timing, which pulled forward roughly $100 million of cash flow to Q4 2014. So 2015 cash flow was $100 million lower than it should have been. In 2016, in addition to strong operating results, free cash flow was also driven by the addition of CDW UK, mixing into vendors with longer payment terms, new extended terms for a few key vendors that we negotiated in Q4, an year-end payment and invoice timing. The impact of timing which we expect to reverse was approximately $35 million. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and repurchased 276,000 shares for $12.2 million at an average cost of $44.27 per share. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you can see on slide 15. First, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases, in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.16 per share on March 10, to shareholders of record as of February 24, up 49% from a year ago. Since the IPO, our dividend has increased nearly fourfold the initial annual level of $0.17 per share. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended Q4 at 2.7 times. Third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. During the year, we repurchased 8.7 million shares for $367 million at an average cost of $42.06 per share. At the end of December, we had $642 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. In 2016, we returned nearly $450 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Our capital allocation priorities support our 2016 to 2018 medium-term target, which you can see on slide 16. These are to grow constant currency 200 to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market, with a targeted adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-7% range; maintain our net leverage at 2.5 to 3 times; and deliver low double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. You should expect us to use share repurchases and accretive acquisitions to amplify operating results and help achieve this target. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our medium-term target on an annual, not a quarterly, basis. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling our 2017 financials. I am on slide 17. We expect full-year constant currency growth within our annual medium-term target of 200 to 300 basis points above U.S. IT market growth. Currency headwinds are expected at an annual average rate of roughly 75 basis points in 2017, with greater impact earlier in the year at roughly 110 basis points in the first half. This assumes average annual translation rates of $0.75 to the Canadian dollar and $1.20 to the British pound. For seasonality, we expect to deliver sales roughly in line with our historical average split of 48% to 49% in the first half, and 51% to 52% in the second half. Keep in mind that based on the normal rhythm of our business, first quarter sales are typically sequentially below our fourth quarter. We will have one less selling day in the third quarter and one more selling day in the fourth quarter. Given we expect the incremental impact of netting down to stabilize this year as we mix into hardware sales, we look for our annual adjusted EBITDA margin to come in at roughly the same percentage as 2016, which would be above our medium-term target range. In 2017, we expect our effective GAAP tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. Note that we have not assumed any reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. The expected reduction is due to tax benefits related to equity and deferred compensation. Since we add back non-cash equity expenses to non-GAAP net income, these tax benefits will be excluded from our non-GAAP net income. You should expect us to use our capital allocation priorities, share repurchases and accretive tuck-in acquisitions to help us achieve our low double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth target in constant currency with similar currency headwinds as our top line as we move through the year. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling cash flows. First, we expect our annual cash flow to come in between 3% and 3.5% of net sales, above our 2.5% to 3% of net sales rule of thumb, as we continue to benefit from extended terms and netted down revenues. Second, our capital expenditures will be about 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. We also expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle at the low end of our target range coming in at the low 20s. As you know, with our typical cash flow pattern, we have strong cash flow in the first quarter due to our sequential sales decline from Q4 and the payment of Q1 cash taxes in Q2. While we expect this pattern to continue, the Q1 2017 amount should be lower as the positive impact we had in Q4 from payment and invoice timing reverses. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 32% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization which is approximately $45 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. Cash taxes will be lower in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to tax deductions from discrete items related to equity and deferred compensation payout. That concludes the financial summary. Before we open it up for Q&A, let me briefly address the SEC investigation we disclosed in 2015, relating to vendor partner program incentives. We have no further updates since the last conference call. We continue to cooperate fully with the SEC, and although we cannot predict the outcome based on what we know to date, we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on the company. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one brief follow-up. Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Cabral from Goldman Sachs. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thank you. So, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into your Corporate segment. There's been a pretty big pickup in SMB optimism following the election according to some of the third-party surveys that are out there. So I guess with that in mind, Tom, you touch on this a little bit in the prepared remarks, but just curious how you saw demand change as you went through the quarter, particularly thinking about the month of December versus maybe more October or early November. And then looking ahead to 2017, how do you think about the potential for some of this optimism to translate into some accelerating spending going forward? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Good morning, Matt. So, there was a lot there. Let me see if I can kind of go in sequence here. So the first thing is, you're right, as I alluded to, we did see and did feel the increased optimism more quickly in Small Business. And I think that's logical just because of the size of the dollars involved and the amount of investment. But we also did see increased optimism in the Corporate segment too. As we had hoped to, I think we alluded to this on a number of different calls, there clearly was increased activity. It hasn't quite played out yet. I think there's a little more caution in the larger enterprises and they had spent so much of the year focused on software assurance, virtualization to optimize that infrastructure. But I think everybody kind of has guarded optimism. And I think it's guarded because I do think people understand the complexity that it will take to implement some of the things that's driving the optimism. And I feel a little bit like Groundhog Day, because this time last year we were talking about there was optimism, we were going to have improving economic activity and was going to accelerate in the back half of the year, right? Exact same story. I think this time, there's probably a little more rationale for it. And so, we would expect there to be increased growth. And I think the other connection I want to make sure you heard in the script was, we'll see a lot of that we think in the hardware side of the business. We think we're going to continue to see that focus on the optimization, securely designing and kind of protecting your investment, but will be coupled with some increased focus on hard work. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then the international business was up pretty strong in Q4. Just wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into the drivers behind that performance? And then, just thinking a little bit more broadly about your international strategy, it's more than a year past the acquisition of Kelway. So, how are you thinking about the potential for further international expansion going forward into other geographies like maybe Western Europe or Asia Pacific over time? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay, Matt. So I'm not sure how many we're into, three or four. Let me try to take them one at a time. Look, CDW UK and Canada, both of our international organizations had great fourth quarters. And I don't know thing \u2013 it's anything more than just focus and execution. I think in the case of UK, kind of the further we got away from the reality of Brexit and people understanding kind of the longer-term play, it enabled people to get back focused on their companies, their businesses, and we clearly capitalized on that. I think there's benefit from the ongoing integration of CDW UK into CDW, benefiting from some of the things that this company has kind of used to continue to outperform the market, but you can't deny they had a great finish to the year, I'm just really proud of that team. If you think about international expansion, kind of go back to what our strategy was. This was about following our U.S. customers and making sure we had the capabilities to help them with some of their international needs and we have had already success, as I alluded to. We will continue to look opportunistically for expansion opportunities, but it's not driven by, hey, is there a part of the world we need to go and get, it's more of where are our customers taking us and where would they want us to go. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. Starting on the Federal segment, you mentioned there were certain large customer orders that were pushed out into 2017. Could you just talk about the size or the magnitude of these orders? And do you expect it to come in \u2013 the revenues we recognized, I guess, in the March quarter or some of the out quarters in 2017? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Amit. I think they're going to come in, based on what we know today, throughout the year. I'll just say, it was a meaningful dollar value; let us go with that. It was north of $50 million. And it was just a function of \u2013 they had an initiative to move to Windows 10 in certain parts of the federal government and had issued the purchase orders. We were kind of working aggressively to get those done. They wanted them shipped by the end of the year. And then we found out in December that based on some internal, I'll just call it, challenges, they asked us to delay shipping those into 2017. I think it's going to take \u2013 it's not going to happen all in one quarter, I think it's going to be spread out over the year. But it is a meaningful number. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess, just a follow up. You spent some time talking about the cyber security business and it's certainly I think a big investment theme for customers in the year. Could you just talk about the breadth of your presence over here that you have in terms of revenue size? What's the growth trends are you seeing? And broadly, how much of your cyber security business do you think is actually reoccurring in nature versus a one-off transaction? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. So, first of all, we use kind of the broader term of security. I know it's maybe a nuance, but it's much of cyber security, so to speak. And we don't share the size of that business. I think I have shared a number of cases kind of how fast it's been growing. And look, I don't know what term to use other than meaningful double digits it continues to grow. I think the example I gave, Amit, was kind of more of a normal, what happens for us in cyber security. We were asked to come in and assess the environment and that assessment includes everything from diagnostics to actually putting devices in to monitor opportunities as far as breaches, and then we kind of come in on the back end and build out a combination of both services and delivered solutions. I would say the business is still \u2013 it's not a recurring revenue business yet in a major way, although, I think what you're seeing and you picked up on this when I alluded to the fact that there's now a $200,000 annual monthly recurring revenue, that's kind of vision into the future for us. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you and best of luck in 2017, guys. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, thanks again, Amit. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Tom, and everyone. Just a couple questions from me. Regarding your EBITDA guidance of the high end or above your mid-7% target where you've been last year, how does that play against your expectation for accelerating growth in the back half which seems like it's more skewed toward hardware and you expect some acceleration of hardware. So, should we think about EBITDA margins trending downward somewhat in the back half because of that mix? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: We think about our EBITDA margin as being relatively flat as we move through the year to 2016. While we are looking for some hardware acceleration, we continue to expect to see good performance in the things that we referred to as netted down revenues. So we would expect that mix to hold, not necessarily shift toward hardware. What we're expecting as that the mix shift into the netted down, you won't see the impact that you saw in 2016. So, flattish adjusted EBITDA margin. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got you. So, still accelerating growth of those other areas. Got that. And then, regarding your commentary, Tom, on K-12 with that E-rate push out, it sounds like we're hearing that few quarters here. What's your expectations this year? Do you think that's finally going to start to accelerate? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, Matt, it is. It's a little bit like Groundhog Day on that subject too, it feels like. So, as we think about the nuance of E-rate, you look at \u2013 let's look at years 2015 and 2016. And in 2015, I think we captured like 7.1% of the projected opportunity. In 2016, we captured another one of \u2013 I think it was 8%. So we continue to increase our capture rate. What really slowed it down this year was, USAC went to a new system, if you will. I think it's ironically called, EPC. Just leave it. Got that. And let's just say, EPC didn't perform the way it was supposed to. So therefore, they got behind in sending out the funding letters which it seems like it keeps happening every year. And so, I don't want to forecast when it's going to get to a point where they stay within their targeted guidelines. My guidance to our team is, look, we can't control that. All we can do is focus on being named the highest percentage of times as the partner and then executing against that. But it did impact our netcomm business this year. And \u2013 but we do expect it to kind of flush out and to get that growth back next year. But I don't want to get in the business of predicting E-Rate. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. All right. Thanks a lot. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Shannon. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. The first one is with regard to the growth in hardware in the second half. I'm just curious, when you look at that, obviously when desentives (45:47) is playing in and I'm guessing this contract may be will help you that you're talking about in the federal side. But just in general, how much of this is more sort of PC-related versus data center? And what are you hearing from your customers in terms of their willingness to shift some dollars over to hardware? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, it's interesting. I think in some cases, it's a function of value. And where do they see the greatest value and the opportunity, and I think it's tied to economy, especially in the Corporate segment, right? If you just kind of think about the connective tissue there. When you have GDP for the year was 1.6%, right? You're going to be more cautious about where you spend your dollars, which I think was the insight when we look back at 2016, and we said, why are we doing so well in these warranties and software assurance, I think those two things, Shannon, are linked to what I'll call where am I going to spend my money? As we go into next year, I would expect some of the uplift in some of the solutions area of hardware like we've seen in netcomm. But as I also alluded to, we've had incredible growth, if you think about hyper-converged just as one example of a great growth area, flash, like everybody else is experiencing incredible growth. And we also would expect \u2013 we had a pretty good year in our client business, it had a meaningful of double-digit growth, we would expect that to continue going forward. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Okay. And then with regard to the SMB initiatives that you have, can you talk a bit more about sort of the drivers behind it, how you'll approach things differently than your traditional Corporate business, and what kind of metrics we should look out for success within that initiative? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, this was something that I've been personally thinking about and contemplating for some period of time, and that is if you really think about that marketplace and how they're consuming IT, and what I'll call the economic dynamics of being a Small Business and the value we bring relative to helping them procure IT to facilitate their growth. It struck me as it was kind of separating itself from how we serve and go-to-market with what we'll call the MedLar customer. There is a much greater utilization of online digital resources both on the consultative end and on the purchasing end. And so, what I wanted us to do is to have a group of people who got up every day and have the resources at their disposal, be it a marketing resources, the technical resources and an e-commerce to kind of maximize the opportunity. I think we're going to look at it and measure it pretty much the same way, what their net sales growth, what kind of profitability they're generating and continue to look at what kind of solutions are they delivering in the marketplace. But I firmly believe that having the ability and I gave them kind of the clean sheet of paper focus, when it comes to how do you serve this market? And I'll just give you one thought as we think about this. If you think about people today and how we consume information, it's not just talking to someone live, right? We're consuming it online. We're actually consuming it verbally through devices and artificial intelligence. I think all of that eventually is going to be part of how do you go to market with that segment. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Sherri. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Tom, thinking about the cloud business, it seems like based on the $1.5 billion, that cloud is now 10%-11% of your sales on an annual basis. Can you give us some detail on how that cloud business breaks out between your hardware solutions and software and how weighted it is to some of your different end markets, is it more Corporate? And then also, can you give us a sense of how recurring that business is? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Sherri, first thing is, we use the term customer spend. That's kind of the way our partners measure how we're doing, so that $1.5 billion is in customer spend. It has the impact of all the netted down aspects I talked about earlier. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So you got to be careful thinking about that. And then let me kind of go. The second part of the question is most \u2013 we don't even count in our cloud spend number private cloud, because to me, private cloud is delivered kind of on-prem primarily via hardware. Now, I know we have some nuances where people are using Azure and thinking about using Azure on top of on-prem equipment. We're not even going to try to be that cute. So, when we're talking about cloud, it's primarily, as you think about it, Public cloud in the form of SaaS or infrastructure-as-a-service. Now, growth is \u2013 what we look at is what workloads. That's the thing we pay attention to. And you heard me mention the kind of top \u2013 some of the top workloads being security, productivity, backup and disaster recovery, mobility, those are the workloads that we're finding are increasingly going to our cloud-based solutions. I don't know if that helps. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That helps. And how much is recurring of that? How often does it recur? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I would say it's still non-recurring, if that's the way to say it, the majority of it, although much like the example in security, the rate of growth of the recurring is increasing really aggressively. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kugele from Needham & Company. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Rich. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. So, first, great quarter and great year. I guess, what I wanted to understand a little bit better was the lack of the budget flush in the fourth quarter. Was that both MedLar as well as SMB, or where did you see that and was it strategic because of what they were trying to deploy in the sense that as you get into 2017, will they be able to overcome that and grow faster if it's consistent with your commentary there? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Rich, here's what I would say is, it was more of a comment on the MedLar part of Corporate than it was Small Business. And I think, intuitively that kind of make sense, we don't really ever notice the big budget flush in Small Business, I think, in part because of the size and complexity of those organizations and how they're trying to go-to-market. We did see a budget flush, we just didn't see a meaningful budget flush. But as an example, some of that is influenced by the unique submarkets that sit inside of MedLar. A good example is oil and gas, big submarket for MedLar, as you might guess, really struggled as far as having the kind of money available to invest in IT, you're starting to see those people now come back into the fold, have discussions with us about their spending and their expectations for 2017. And they did \u2013 we did see some green shoots later in the quarter, which is I think encouraging. But I think the MedLar business is going to be more watching what happens with taxes and immigration and some of those things that more impact their business, which is why I think there's this cautious optimism in MedLar. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. And then, Ann, should something meaningful happen here with domestic tax rates, you're a full tax payer today. Should we just assume that you would spill it over the same capital strategy or could it enhance one area over another? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: No. I think we would, one, obviously it depends on what the actual tax rate is, and how it gets delivered. But if our cash flow increases, right, we would look to continue to follow the capital allocation strategy that we have in place. The one thing I would say is, right now, we say leverage is 2.5 to 3 times. I've always said if interest rates skyrocket and tax rates go down significantly, we would look at the right leverage ratio for the company. So keep that in mind as well. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Rich. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Tom. Thanks. I just wanted to ask, I think you mentioned that Dell easily delivered the 150 basis points. I think that implies that the Corporate revenue would have perhaps been down for the year. And if I think about the trends that you talked about, server and storage remains tough. Do you think this is just replacement cycles extending or is Public cloud having an impact, and perhaps you can tie that to the comment that you expect hardware sales to accelerate? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: First, Adam, I don't think the connection between Dell and Corporate is appropriate, or is maybe accurate might be (55:19) a better way to say it. It can be appropriate, but I don't think it was accurate. The relative connection, I think, you said was that there was a tie between Dell's success and Corporate being down. I don't think you should connect that dot. I think you have to separate them into saying what happened in the segment relative to what's going on in the marketplace and we had positive Dell impact on all parts of our business. Some parts of our business more than other and some of that's just where the market opportunity was. So, don't connect those two. Could you give me the second part of the question again, because I want to make sure I answer it? Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. I was just asking if the \u2013 I was trying to tie how you talked about server and storage trends remained tough in the Corporate segment, and is it just replacement cycles or is it Public cloud having an impact, because you talked about expecting hardware sales to accelerate? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I think it's interesting, Adam. I think the answer is all the above, if I would think about your characteristics. One of the things that led us to really kind of dig in to what's happening is the kind of lumpiness, if you will, one of my favorite term, even in subparts of our business. Like, if you remember last quarter, servers were up 5% and this quarter they're down low-single digits and you start to peel the layer of the onion back and say what's driving that, and what you see is a number of different things. For example, even in a quarter when servers were slightly down in the aggregate, five of our seven segments had server growth. So, just think about that. So, what that tells you is, there is a part of the marketplace that's saying, hey, we still have opportunities for what I'll call traditional servers. Then you couple on top of that hyper-converged doubling year-over-year, right? And you're saying, okay, so some people are clearly sitting back, saying, how am I going to handle growth? Some of it is going to be, I'm going to add virtualization software, expand capacity [audio skip] (57:29) existing asset. When I do that, I'm probably going to invest in protecting the asset with a warranty. Some people were saying, you know what? I'm going to handle it by what I'll call traditional server growth. My sense is, that driven the specific units within their business where they can say we're going to serve that unit with a server. And then some of them are actually saying, hey, I'm actually going to go to a new architecture. So, it gets really hard, I think, unless you dig down into it to really kind of say, there's one thing influencing what's going on, I think it's multiple. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. I just wanted to see if I could give one follow-up on the SMB initiative, because you talked about... Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Sure. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: ...customer's changing buying patterns. And you've made a move to include the e-commerce, which I thought was interesting. Could you talk about the competitive set in SMB and are you perhaps competing more with the Amazon's of the world here? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, I don't think it's changed. It's kind of like \u2013 it's a free-for-all. There're so many people competing in the marketplace. And everybody tries to differentiate what I think is, is that CDW has the ability to have this incredibly unique value proposition that will have the digital capabilities, should customers consume to acquire knowledge, technical support, and even purchase. And supplemented with what I'll call the benefit of having the high touch model, where as those things get more complicated, and that is one of the reasons Adam, let me just use your question to reinforce them. When we say Small Business, we're talking about organizations that generally have more than 20 co-workers up to 250 co-workers. We don't really go below 20, which is where you see a lot of people like Amazon, and part of that's because our value is, as things get more complicated, then we have the ability because of the combination of delivering product and services and solutions from simplifying IT. So, we think we've been fairly thoughtful about where we focus and where we have the greatest value, and now we're just going to enhance the way we do it. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just speaking of Dell, now that you have a little more clarity around the EMC Dell roadmap, is the long-term opportunity from that partnership the same or does the shutting down of some of the product portfolios change the overall opportunity? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. I'd still remain really excited about the long-term growth prospects there. I think you kind of assumed, at least we did, Katy, going into this, that when you have a acquisition of that size that there's going to be rationalization of a lot of things relative to their go-to-market strategy and their product suite. So, it wasn't like it's been a surprise. I also think that as you would expect, that kind of merger is going to have an impact in the year that it happens. As we get further away from that year, I really expect the opportunity even increase going forward. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, it was helpful to hear upfront you talk about the four areas of strong double-digit growth. As you think about those into 2017, are any of them building or entering the year with more momentum, and are there any new trends that you think are emerging that will impact the business in 2017 in terms of driving growth? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I would say they were pretty consistent growth throughout the year, Katy. I mean it did feel like as we got later into the year, and I think people saw the economy wasn't going to be as robust as they thought that you might have had more people saying, you know what, we're going to go ahead and make sure we have this warranty on this or we have software assurance on this, or we're going to add capacity. I don't expect that to change. I think the number of options people have which plays to our benefit quite honestly is going to continue, and I would be surprised if you saw a major deceleration. But again, I'm giving you just my gut reaction. I don't know that I'm smart enough to come up with any additional emerging trends at this point. That's kind of the assessment. I'm really \u2013 I'm like the weatherman, I get to give you the assessment after the weather has gone through, so. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Katy. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, is that it? I think we're done. Okay. Hey, look everybody, two sights here; one is thank you again for your interest in CDW and your questions. They are helpful to us in making sure we are thinking about the right things. And I do want you to know that we scheduled this earnings call exactly one week in advance of Valentine's Day. There is no excuse for not to be remembered, and I want to share with you my new motto on Valentine's Day, we get forgiven if we remember and we get massacred if we don't. All right. Valentine's Day is not an optional sport. Okay. Good luck, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. We had a strong start to the year as we successfully addressed customer priorities across our diverse portfolio of end markets and leveraged the strength of our business model to deliver excellent top-line growth and strong profitability. Net sales were $3.3 billion, up 6.7% above last year, 7.6% when adjusted for the impact of currency translation. We delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.1% and non-GAAP net income per share growth of 12%, up 13% after currency adjustment. These results reflect the impact of three key drivers : our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, broad product and solutions suite, and the impact of mix on our profitability. The first driver of our results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, enabled us to address differing customer priorities. Corporate, which represents sales to business customers with roughly 250 coworkers and above, increased 4%. There was clearly more activity from customers and we saw projects move from the back burner to the front, but overall, corporate customers remained cautious and continue to focus on more shorter-tail projects. As you've heard me say before, medium to large business customers do not tend to spend on optimism. That said, we did see some ongoing customer conversations on larger projects start to move from discussion to sale. Small Business increased 8%, as customer confidence remained strong. Public had an excellent quarter, up 10%. Public customers with fixed budgets were focused on spending approved funds. Education results were outstanding, up 16%, reflecting excellent growth in both higher ed and K-12. Networking was strong in both markets as we benefited from E-Rate funds in K-12 and our Connected Campus strategy in higher ed. Government results were also outstanding, up 14%. Federal increased high teens. These excellent results did not include sales of the client devices we discussed last quarter that were delayed at the end of 2016 as shipping did not begin into April. Federal results were driven by ongoing success working with agencies as they moved ahead with projects funded under the current omnibus budget, as well as ongoing successful alignment with strategic programs. State and local also delivered excellent results, up high single digits once again, driven by new contracts and ongoing success in public safety. Our other segment, which consists of our Canadian and UK operations, increased 5% in U.S. dollars. Both operations continued to execute extremely well in market, each delivering double-digit growth in local currency. To-date, UK is not seeing significant changes in customer buying behavior even with the uncertainty related to timing and terms of Brexit. We also continue to see excellent referral progress. Canada is executing well in the face of uncertainty, as both businesses and governments assess the potential economic impact from any changes in U.S. trade policy, as well as potential changes in oil pricing. The second driver of our results was our broad product and solutions suite. Our ability to meet the total technology needs, both transactional and integrated solutions of our customers, is one of the fundamental reasons for our consistent performance. This is a key point of differentiation for us in the marketplace. It helps ensure we meet our customer priorities, as well as helps offset market-specific dynamics like product lifecycles or even partner challenges. Market trends remained similar to what we saw throughout 2016, with ongoing focus on optimization, efficiency, securitization and the integration of software into solutions. In addition, we also saw more client device upgrades. This quarter, our broad portfolio of solutions helped us meet these priorities. Let's take a closer look at overall product performance. As expected, hardware sales growth accelerated from 2016 levels, increasing 6% for the quarter. Client device demand was strong, up mid-teens, with double-digit increases across all customer markets. Video equipment, which includes projectors and display panels, also increased across all end markets, up nearly double digits in the quarter. NetComm increased high single digits with gains in all but one customer market. Continuing the last year's trend, customer focus remained on optimizing data center infrastructure with economical yet high-performing solutions. We saw rapid growth in emerging technology solutions, including hyper-converged and flash, but it was not enough to offset declines in more traditional storage and, overall, the category declined high single digits. Server performance varied across customer end markets. Increases in three of our customer end markets were not enough to offset declines in other customer end markets and we saw the quarter end down mid single digits. We used our over 1 million square feet of distribution capacity and deep partner relationships to make strategic volumes for both data center solutions and client devices. This helped us mitigate the memory price increase and supply issues felt across the industry. Software sales increased 5%. Customer spend for software increased in the high teens as, once again, much of the software was delivered as-a-service. Remember, as-a-service revenues are netted down for accounting purposes. Services increased 14%, once again driven by excellent performance in warranties and field services, which was led by cabling, networking and video implementations. Customer spend for cloud-delivered solution continued strong, once again up over 50%, with spend in infrastructure-as-a-service more than doubling albeit off of a low base. Fast-growing workloads addressed by the cloud included collaboration, backup and recovery and security. Cloud security was a major contributor to overall security spend, which increased just over 20%. Once again, much of the spend was netted down as this is delivered as as-a-service. And that leads me to the third driver of our performance, the impact of mix on profitability. As you've heard me say before, an essential element of our long-term success has been our ability to consistently deliver profitable growth. First quarter results provide an excellent example of how our variable cost structure helps us deliver this goal. In 2016, you will recall that accelerated growth in netted-down revenues, including warranties, cloud and software assurance, led to mix shift which improved our reported gross margin but dampened top-line growth. This quarter, with the expected acceleration in hardware spending, we did not mix as much into netted-down revenues. Here is where you see the benefit of our variable cost structure. Sales compensation is one of our largest expense components and it is based on gross profit. This quarter, we saw expense leverage since gross profits grew slower than sales. Because our sellers are compensated on gross profit, we maintained strong profitability in line with last year's first quarter, achieving first quarter records for adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income per share. Clearly, our variable cost structure has been a key contributor to our long history of profitable growth. Another key contributor has been our ability to deliver solutions that meet each customer's unique challenges. Because we have the scale to invest in vertically focused sales channels, we developed deep industry knowledge and customer intimacy that enables us to build meaningful solutions that solve key issues for our customers. This quarter's higher ed performance, where solutions sales increased over 30%, is a great example of this in action. Our higher ed channel has been helping universities and colleges address their challenges for over 10 years, challenges which have evolved over time. Today, with the average college student bringing multiple technology devices to campus, comes the expectation that they will be connected everywhere anytime, from dorm room to classroom, from dining hall to the quad. This is where CDW's Connected Campus solution comes in. Connected Campus connects students, instructors, devices and curriculum using cloud, networking and collaboration solutions across residence halls, classrooms, buildings, libraries, stadiums and even green space. A recent example of the power of this solution is one where we helped a major Midwestern university with five campuses enhance connectivity across its entire operations. Our Connected Campus solution helped the university avoid one of the most common pitfalls of network design, optimizing for coverage instead of capacity. We assessed the network use in all of their campuses and determined which lecture halls, residence halls and facilities were most in need of capacity. By doing so, we were able to increase access point density at those locations rather than distributing access points evenly across their entire footprint. This was a big investment for our customer. It took a full year from the RFP issuance to inking the deal. And as you would expect, competition was heavy. We won because of our experience and Connected Campus solution. That solution includes design and installation of a mesh fabric network. When completed, the customer will spend more than $25 million on this solution. This is a great example of how solving key business problems for our sweet spot of customers in today's environment requires deep customer knowledge. We combined our competitive advantage of scale, scope and disciplined execution. Our customer knowledge helps drive sustainable profitable growth for us today and in the future. To build this level of customer knowledge requires talented coworkers. This quarter, we added 62 customer-facing coworkers. On target with the plan we shared with you last quarter, the calls we're adding between 100 and 125 customer-facing coworkers during 2017. It is important to understand that all customer-facing coworkers are not the same. Our largest population of customer-facing coworkers are our account managers, but they are supported by other key customer-facing coworkers, coworkers who enable the design and delivery of large, complex and higher gross profit solutions. These coworkers include service delivery engineers, technical specialists, field sellers, and they represent roughly 30% of our North American workforce. Layer on our account managers and more than two-thirds of our coworkers are customer-facing. We will continue to invest prudently to ensure we deliver the solutions that our customers need and take advantage of the opportunity we see in the marketplace for an international provider with scale and highly technical resources. But just as we always do, we will monitor the marketplace and adjust our hiring plans up or down as needed. Let me leave you with a few comments on the remainder of the year. You will recall that on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for the 2017 U.S. IT market growth in the just a little above 2% to a little above 3% range and our target to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points above the market. At that time, we expected the year to start off slow and then ramp as economic activity ramps. While we certainly had a good first quarter, as I tell my staff, one quarter does not a trend make. And there remains a fair amount of uncertainty both in the U.S. and abroad. Given the mixed signals we are currently seeing, we're maintaining our market growth views for now. Of course, we will continue to refine our expectations as we move throughout the year. Now let me turn it over to Ann, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our first quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, breadth of product offerings and variable cost structure. They also reflect the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to our P&L, if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 7. Consolidated net sales were $3.3 billion, 6.7% higher than last year on a reported and on an average daily sales basis. Average daily sales were $51.9 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were 7.6% higher than last year. Currency impact was driven by the British pound to U.S. dollar translation, slightly offset by positive year-over-year impact from Canadian to U.S. dollar translation, shaving roughly 100 basis points off of growth. Currency impact was 20 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales were down 7.8% versus Q4 2016, which was less than last year and in line with our historical Q4 to Q1 decline. Gross profit for the quarter increased 5.4% to $553 million. Gross margin in the first quarter was 16.6%, 20 basis points lower than last year. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of a lower mix into netted revenue as declining product margin was only partially offset by the impact of increases in netted-down revenues, including SaaS, warranties and commission revenues. Turning to SG&A on slide 8. Consolidated reported SG&A, including advertising expense, was roughly 5% higher than last year. Reported SG&A also includes $12.1 million of equity-based compensation, $0.5 million of acquisition and integration expenses and $1.9 million of other expenses, including payroll taxes on equity-based compensation and historical retention costs. Our adjusted SG&A increased 4% primarily driven by sales payroll growth roughly in line with gross profit growth. Coworker count was up roughly 100 since year-end 2016 to just over 8,600. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $249.2 million, up 7.1%. This delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.5%, similar to last year. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 9. Interest expense was $40 million, $1.6 million higher than last year's Q1 level. An additional month of interest on the 6% notes that were redeemed was partially offset by interest savings from the recent refinancing. Turning to taxes, GAAP taxes were $16 million, which resulted in an effective rate of 21.7%. The reduction in effective tax rate primarily reflects excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity-based compensation. On a GAAP basis, we earned $57.6 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance, was $121.3 million in the quarter, up 7.7% over last year. As you can see on slide 10, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add-backs that fall in four general bucket : the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and other nonrecurring or infrequent income or expenses, such as net loss on the extinguishment of debt. Tax adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP net income, including tax affecting add-backs at 36% and reversing the $11.6 million excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation. With Q1 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 163 million, we delivered $0.75 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 11.7% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter, currency impact on EPS was similar to the impact on sales. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP income per share increased 12.7%. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 11. On March 31, we had $251.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3 billion, as compared to $3 billion at March 2016. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion. Net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 2.7 times, within our target range of 2.5 to 3 times. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.2%, 20 basis points below last year due to the term loan re-pricing and note refinancing we completed in Q1. Roughly 95% of our outstanding debt remains either fixed rate or hedged. As you can see on slide 12, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q1. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down 2 days from last year's first quarter and below our annual target range of low to mid 20s. Year-over-year DSO increased one day and DPO increased two days. The one-day DPO increase in excess of the DSO increase was primarily due to mixing into partners with longer payment terms. Cash taxes paid for the quarter were $6.3 million and cash interest was $48.4 million. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures, was a positive $215 million compared to $315 million in Q1 of 2016. Free cash flow reflected the impact of our lower sequential sales decline, end period and timing. During the quarter, we continue to execute against our capital allocation strategy and repurchased 3 million shares for $175 million at an average cost of $59.26 per share. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you can see on slide 13. First, to increase dividends annually. To guide these increases, in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. With this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.16 per share on June 12 to shareholders of record as of May 25, up 49% from a year ago. Since the IPO, our dividend has increased nearly four-fold from the initial annual level of $0.17 per share. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended Q1 at 2.7 times. Third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, to return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. At the end of March, we had $467 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation priorities support our 2016-2018 medium-term targets which you can see on slide 14. They are to grow in constant currency 200 to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market with a targeted adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-7% range, maintain our net leverage ratio between 2.5 times and 3 times, and deliver low-double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. As we indicated on our Q4 call, we expect our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin to be above our target range at roughly the same level as 2016. You should expect us to continue to use share repurchases and accretive acquisitions to amplify operating results and help achieve this target. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our medium-term targets on an annual, not a quarterly basis. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling the rest of our 2017 financials. I am on slide 15. We expect full-year constant currency growth within our annual medium-term target of 200 to 300 basis points above the U.S. IT market growth. Based on Q1 results and expectations for the rest of the year, we look for the balance of sales between first and second half to be generally consistent with our normal seasonality, roughly 48% to 52% weighted towards the back half of the year. We have the same number of selling days in Q2 2017 as Q2 2016. In the second half of the year, we will have one less day in Q3 2017 as compared to 2016, but that reverses in Q4 2017, so we end the year with the same number of selling days. We currently look for currency headwinds at an annual average rate of roughly 70 basis points in 2017. We expect greater impact earlier in the year with total first half impact at roughly 105 basis points. This assumes average annual translation rates of $0.75 to the Canadian dollar and $1.20 to the British pound. Given current expectations that the incremental impact of netting down will continue to stabilize for the remainder of the year, we look for our annual adjusted EBITDA margin to come in at roughly the same level as 2016. We expect depreciation and amortization to continue at a similar rate as Q1 at roughly $64 million per quarter, $46 million of which is for purchased intangibles. With the impact of our refinancings in March of 2017, we expect total annual book interest expense at roughly $150 million. We now expect our full-year effective GAAP tax rate to be between 33% and 34%, ramping up as we move through the year. Excess tax benefits will continue to materially impact our GAAP tax rate in Q2. Note that we have not assumed any reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. The reduction is primarily due to tax benefits related to equity-based compensation. Q2 equity-based compensation is expected slightly above Q1, primarily due to a new grant in 2017 and performance attainment. The balance of the year is expected to be at or slightly below 2016 levels. Remember, since we add back equity compensation expenses for non-GAAP net income, the tax benefits related to equity compensation will also be excluded from our non-GAAP net income. Our all-in non-GAAP income tax rate is expected to run between 37% and 38% for the full year. You should expect us to use our capital allocation priorities, share repurchases and acquisitions to achieve our low double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth target in constant currency with similar currency headwinds throughout the year as on our top line. Given UK and Canadian operations now represent roughly 10% of our business, it is important to consider currency translation when modeling both top and bottom line in this volatile currency environment. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling cash flows. First, we continue to expect our annual cash flow to come in between 3% to 3.5% of net sales, above our 2.5% to 3% of net sales rule of thumb, as we continue to benefit from strong working capital performance and netted-down revenues. As you recall in 2016, we delivered free cash flow as a percentage of net sales significantly above this target. This reflected the onetime benefit of extending a few partners to longer payment terms, as well as timing that will reverse in 2017. Second, our capital expenditures will be about 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. We also expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle at the low end of our target range coming in at the low 20s. As you know, with our typical cash flow pattern, our second quarter tends to be the lightest cash flow quarter of the year. This reflects both our payment of estimated cash taxes for the first and second quarter and increased working capital needs to support what is typically our highest quarterly sequential sales increase. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 32% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $46 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. Cash taxes will be lower in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to tax deductions from discrete items related to equity and deferred compensation payout. That concludes the financial summary. Before we open it up for Q&A, let me briefly address the SEC investigation we disclosed in 2015 relating to vendor partner program incentives. We have no further updates since the last conference call. We continue to cooperate fully with the SEC. And although we cannot predict the outcome based on what we know to-date, we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on the company. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one brief follow-up? Operator, can you please provide the instructions for asking a question? Operator : Our first question is from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Irvin Liu - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, guys. This is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit. First off, congrats on the great quarter. I guess my first question is I want to address the Corporate channel. It looks like that channel reverted to growth on a year-over-year basis. Is there anything specific to call out here, or better yet, can you talk about some of the factors that growth improving in the year-over-year trajectory? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: First of all, thank you and good morning. Yeah, we were obviously pleased regarding Corporate's return to growth. Although we did, I think on previous calls, indicate that we were starting to see that kind of momentum in the Corporate segment, there were a number of, I think, key drivers for this. Some of it was \u2013 you saw a pretty strong performance in the transaction side of our business. So I think many customers considered some of the what I'll call industry shortages when it comes to components and looked at this might be a good time to execute the refresh, and we certainly saw that in both our notebook and our desktop. I think that was one area of key drivers. I think the second was just the really excellent quarter of execution by the leadership team and focus. And there is a general sense \u2013 there has been a general sense of, as I said, optimism. Although I'm not sure people run out and spend optimism on big projects, you can't deny the fact that on shorter-tail projects, it did instill some confidence in the market. Irvin Liu - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it, Tom. Thanks, that was helpful. All right, I guess you guys talked about adding 100 to 125 net new coworkers and you guys are roughly halfway there relative to this target. My question relates to coworker productivity. Based on your outlook for outpacing your IT (30:57) spend by 200 to 300 basis points and your total for increased target of about 1%, this assumes sort of a mid-single-digit year-over-year improvement in coworker productivity. Just curious on what sort of factors will drive this productivity improvement. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, that is a great question. It's interesting, I tried to allude to some of this. In the description of the type of coworkers we add, one of the things to think about, and this is a little bit of the model evolution, quite honestly, at CDW, as we've built off that technical organization and technical and services team is over 2,000 strong, in many ways, you should consider this as almost adding arrows to the quiver for the seller because it is technical assets and resources that our customers can use, and that drives larger, more complex deals, which tends to drive increased productivity. So, that's just one way that the model has evolved and it's helping us drive productivity in the organization. The other is we have had, for the last four, five years, a pretty strong approach on sales force management and prescriptive selling, so to speak, and productivity, and it's something we track and measure and make investments in helping the sellers. And another good example is the investment we're making in e-commerce. If you think about our enhancing our e-commerce platform, what you're doing is helping drive interested customers to the sales force. So, those are just two examples of the ways in which we've been able to sustain that improved productivity over a number of years. Irvin Liu - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thanks. That's all I had. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Matt. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, morning, Tom. Also had a question on the Corporate business. I guess it sounds as though the environment was a little bit better, but there's still some hesitancy from your customers on just bigger ticket solutions purchases. So, I'm just curious, what do you think it will take to actually get those new expansion projects going again? I'm just curious about the visibility you have around that ramp going throughout the year. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, Matt, we did see an increase in what I would call more of the strategic projects. I just don't know that it's at full force yet. Look, I think anybody who watches what's going on in Washington, whether it's tax reform or a regulatory rollback, is optimistic that they will happen, but also a realist in that it's going to take time and there's a lot of work to get there. And I think \u2013 I know it sounds trite to say guys like me don't spend on optimism. I think you actually have to see some things happening, which will give you maybe that increased confidence. Even the consistency in the economy, if you think about GDP in the first quarter was, what, 0.7% or something, and even underneath that, there were some inconsistency, where you had consumer kind of pull back and you had an increase in business investment. And, Matt, my sense is when you start to see a number of the factors kind of play out in actuality is when you're going to see people get even more aggressive on what I'll call bigger, more complex projects. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then just as a follow-up, it's coming up on two years since your last acquisition. I'm just curious about how you're thinking about the opportunity for M&A at this point and how you compare and contrast the opportunity for inorganic growth versus repurchases with your capital allocation strategy. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, you're right. It is coming up on two years and we are \u2013 if I can take this as an opportunity to say how just incredibly pleased we are with the UK and their performance and what they've meant to our customers. Matt, we tend to look at it, I think, from a pretty straightforward perspective. We focus on organic growth as the key driver here, and I think we've demonstrated a long history of, despite our size and success, the ability to continue to outperform the market from an organic perspective and we'll continue to invest in that. Having said that, the strategy has also been consistent. There are parts of the marketplace where we may be motivated to acquire something because of speed to market or because of the capability. And I will tell you we are aggressively looking and considering and entertaining things that may enhance that. And when we find something that feels like it fits the right strategy and matches our capital allocation priorities, then we'll be ready to go. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah, hey, Matt. Your question on relative priority, I mean, the capital allocations are listed in the priority that we think of them and, obviously, acquisitions comes ahead of share repurchases, and share repurchases are what we do with cash that's left. So, think about it that way as well. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to see if we can learn a little more about what's happening with your Services business. And also just you're attached to the cloud, I know you always like to talk about all of your partners. But I think the big question we get from a lot of investors is what's next in terms of the incremental driver of your business, you guys have done a great job the last two years since the IPO, but Services and the cloud just keeps coming up. So if could you talk a little more about that, it would be really appreciated. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Let me clarify, Mark, was it services in general or services tied to the cloud? Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Exactly, tied to the cloud. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Yeah. Well, I think as you alluded to, we've had pretty consistent outstanding growth. I think some of that is driven by just the market in general and customers looking at workload-specific situations. And you heard me allude to which workloads, at least for us, seem to be very appealing from a cloud perspective, backup and recovery, security, collaboration, just to name a few, as well as our platform, infrastructure-as-a-service, which is just like raw compute. I think the thing that's happening is customers are looking at on a pretty regular basis now, each time they make a decision, where do I want the workload? Where does it make sense for me? And we actually believe that the world will continue to be kind of a hybrid solution for people for various reasons, whether it's the economics, their capital allocation strategy inside of their business. I would say that our growth has been a function of the breadth of the offering and the number of places where we can help people migrate to the cloud. It's also the services that we've kind of wrapped around our cloud offering product, probably one of the most visible ones is kind of this cloud consulting role where we can go in and help a customer assess those workloads. If you think about our value proposition, Mark, and it is to kind of take the complexity out of it and you think about the market we focus on, those technical resources that I referred to in I think the first question, are part of the big differentiator and why we're able to help grow the cloud the way we have been. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you for that. And just following up on the allocation, and if M&A doesn't become a primary consideration down the road, could we see accelerated debt paydown just given the cash profile? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: I would say that isn't our current thinking. I believe we would continue to buy back stock. The reason I'm a little bit hesitant on that is because there is this idea of tax reform out there, which may or may not make our interest deductions less attractive. So, keep that in mind as an overlay. But in today's interest and tax environment, I would say it would be unlikely that we would accelerate any paydown of debt. If those two things change materially, we would obviously revisit the appropriate capital allocation. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you both. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is open. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thanks and good morning, everyone. Just a question regarding your commentary, Tom, on the memory situation, obviously, extended lead times and some price increases, and you talked about customers may be getting ahead of that. Were you able to \u2013 number one, are you seeing prices on the hardware increase and are you able to pass that along? And is there a concern at all that will change any of the demand trends as we go through the year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Good morning, Matt. Yes, and I'll make sure I'll answer all these in line here. Yes, we felt like we were able to get ahead of it, at least right now. Part of that is the capacity and the ability to have our own distribution capability enables us to, if you will, buy in advance where we can. So, I think that certainly helps with the allocation to customers. Yes, I think the second one was yes, we did see and we'll see increased pricing. I think whether or not that gets passed on to customers, Matt, is a function of what goes on in the marketplace truthfully. You can't really dictate how people are going to behave and what they're going to do and what kind of pressure they're feeling to grow top line. So I don't know that I could predict anything with clarity on how that will play out. I think a function of it might be, Matt, how long people think those shortages may last. If they believe those shortages, and you've probably read this like I have, might end by the end of the year, they might not have the dramatic impact. But if they think they're going to last for a long time and you see a scarcity of a resource, I mean, you know how that one will play out. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just on that, so you're not actually unable to ship product to consumer, right? There's no product shortages yet from your vendors? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, I think the way you said it is yes. And yes, because we were able to buy in advance, we were able to deliver. Now, I think again, it kind of tails \u2013 it kind of links right back to my point. If the shortage plays itself up by the end of the year, then I think we shouldn't have major shortages for customers, so to speak, on end products. But if it extends, then I think you're eventually going to have that work through the supply chain. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's quite helpful. And just on the education market where you're seeing accelerated growth, I know that's been a little bit choppy, you've had your commentary in the past about E-Rate funding, how that's playing out. It sounds like the higher ed is really working in your favor now. But do you think that sort of return to the double-digit growth rate is sustainable here through the year given your visibility? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, you kind of have to break it down into two buckets. Do I expect the education market in general to continue to be a strong growth driver for CDW? Absolutely. I think we did see the E-Rate funds begin to flow this quarter, which helped drive the K-12 growth. I would expect for the back half of the year, Matt, that to kind of return to normal growth, and normal growth we expect that to be a meaningful contributor to our performance. And I think the success in the college, university or higher ed marketplace, we would expect to continue. Now, do I realistically expect it to be a strong as it was the first quarter? I'd love that. I'm not sure the team would love me to say that, but I think we can expect it to continue to perform throughout the year. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, fair enough, and look forward to seeing you next week. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Shannon. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Good morning. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the Small Business unit, the changes you made starting at the beginning of the year in terms of the organization. Sort of anything you can give us in terms of focus because, obviously, it's a nice contributor to growth. And then I have another question, thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Shannon, let me kind of reiterate what the driver was behind the decision. I have felt for some time that of all of our markets, the consumption model in that market is changing as quickly and as fast as any we have, faster obviously. And I felt like if we could create a little more focus by having a group and a sector, if you were, a segment that reported to me that woke up every day and all they thought about from top to bottom was the Small Business market, including not only selling to it, but how we might service it differently, how we might provide technical support differently that we would be able to gain more than our fair share of the market opportunity that sits there. And so that was the driver behind the unit. If you think about that group and the resources they have available then to make technology decisions, they're not as significant as those in the Corporate segment. Yet, they still want to avail themselves of the same kind of capability. And so it was more about making sure that we customize how we thought about Small Business from selling to solutions to services, and that's the real mission that that group has. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, I'm curious, the Dell EMC Partner Program which was put in place a little bit earlier in the year, how should we think about the opportunity that you have in terms of \u2013 is there increased profitability opportunity, increased access to products just with the merger, any incremental benefit that you see? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Well, first of all, Shannon, we had a strong relationship with Dell prior to the introduction of that program, so I don't know that \u2013 we're sitting here with all these dramatically new benefits because they treated CDW pretty well from the onset of our relationship last year, and they've continued to execute really well. And so I would say they're \u2013 I don't look for any incremental upside for us just because of the existing relationship. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Okay. And then, finally, just in terms of the notebook improvement, you talked about in terms of Win 10 and that. I mean, we're hearing good things obviously from the TC vendors, the top three who continue to gain share in terms of corporate adoption in that. But I'm curious as to what your customers are saying, what inning do you think we're in, how long we can kind of expect to see the benefit and the support within your business and obviously theirs from what's going on there? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. I haven't had the inning question for a while. So, look, I think the word I've been using when it comes to Win 10 is a general breeze here when it comes to this impact on CDW. I do think we've been moving around a little bit on the Win 7 versus Win 10 and how long can you ship Win 7 and compatibility issues. And I think, look, I don't know that we're in any particular inning. I will tell you if you think about just the experience of CDW, the last major refresh like we had was in, I think, 2014. So we're on year three, year four, feels about right relative from a timing perspective relative to customers kind of upgrading their client devices. And I think that is much a driver as Win 10 relative to what's going on with the notebook world at CDW. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Look forward to seeing you next week. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Thank you, Shannon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Sherri. Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. It's actually Adrienne Colby for Sherri. Thanks for taking the question. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hi, Adrienne. Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: In the past, you've commented that the first calendar quarter is typically a strong one in the UK. I guess they benefit from some of the March fiscal year-end spending. But it doesn't look like you saw a significant bump in sales this quarter. And so, I was just wondering if you're seeing a little bit more tempered demand on the international side of the business. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Adrienne, if you think about it, if you look in local currency, they had an incredibly strong quarter. I mean, the number that I report in U.S. dollars is the effect of currency translation, but they had a meaningful outperformance in the pound currency in local markets. So they did, true to form, execute really well. Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, then as a quick follow-up. Could you just update us in terms of the mix, how much is UK based at this point versus the other international? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: I don't know that we provided specific numbers around there. We've indicated that the two together are roughly 10% of the business today and, obviously, the UK is a much larger piece of that. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: And the second one being Canada. Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Adam. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Tom, thanks. Good morning. First question, just wanted to ask on operating leverage. Gross profit dollars in the quarter declined sequentially, which I know is typical, but operating expenses were up sequentially. I know you mentioned adjusted EBITDA margins, expecting them flattish year-over-year in 2017, but it seems like we'd see more significant acceleration this year, given OpEx appears more frontend-loaded and the bullish comments you made on productivity improvement. So, just hoping you can address the adjusted EBITDA margin guidance. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah, I think you have to keep in mind that our adjusted SG&A generally grows in line with our gross profit growth. You saw that last year when our gross profit grew in excess of our rate of sales, our adjusted SG&A. It grew in line with gross profit. So I think you just have to keep that in mind as you move through the year. Q1 may not be the \u2013 I mean, you saw that we were able to maintain our adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1. Given that sequential decline in sales in Q1, you actually begin to hit some of the fixed cost aspects of our sales compensation. As we move through the year, our compensation will move around very clearly with our gross profit because it is, on sales compensation, driven by gross profit. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And just wanted to clarify on revenue growth for 2017, you're obviously starting well above the target. And trying to dig in to what is implied for the rest of the year. I think the 48%-52% first half-second half guide would imply year-over-year growth above the 5% or so you've talked about, but I do see that inventory days were down year-over-year. So I'm just trying to get a sense for how much conservatism is built in or whether you're truly anticipating a slower pace of year-over-year growth as we progress throughout the year. Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, we don't provide guidance specifically as you're asking for, Adam. We feel confident about the range that I've given you. And I think it's really early in the year to start trying to get too cute relative to what's going to happen over the latter part. There's too many variables out there, and I'll say I've learned the hard way, being in this job for a while now. I would just say, look, great start to the year on the top line. I think it remains to be seen what happens with kind of the economy, what happens with some of the policies that will determine whether the start contains, in addition to the constraints that you talked about. And just those number of variables, I don't know that it's prudent for me at this point to go much beyond to say we know and we're confident we're going to deliver our 200 to 300 basis points above the U.S. IT market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Keith. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey, good morning. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. If I could just drill down a little bit more on your Government and Education segment, which has been on a tear the past two years or three years, you've taken share there or is it really a growth in the underlying market and what's the opportunity here for this to continue because I always thought that was a huge driver in the overall growth rate? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'll give you my \u2013 an opinion. Qualitatively, I think we feel like we really have taken share. I think the ability \u2013 and it is an advantage of CDW's. Our scale enables us to have meaningful vertical go-to-market sales organizations. That enables us to have people who do nothing but think about those segments and, therefore, develop solutions for those segments. If you remember back, on the early days of the Common Core curriculum and CDW being kind of first to market with a prepackaged solution to help the K-12 market was, I think, one example of taking share and the benefit of our scale. That has also played out in the Connected Campus. And it's not just in Education, Keith. We've kind of seen this play out. And so, I would venture to say we have taken meaningful share in those markets. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. And when you think about the solutions like the Connected Campus you mentioned, are we still in the early stages of those solutions or do you think that's been rolled out across the lot of the market already? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, if you're just talking about Connected Campus, I'd say there's still lots of opportunities out there to expand the Connected Campus opportunity. But those solutions aren't static, too, Keith. I mean, if you think about \u2013 as an example, I'll go back to K-12. The original solution was very student education-focused, right? The package we put together for the Common Core. And then that drove a next level of solution, which became this version of, okay, we've got all of these students digital testing, using client devices, that drives then another need for K-12, which was network and network administration and network management. So, they tend to evolve, and CDW has done a nice job of evolving with its customers. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. I actually want to follow up on the Government conversation because your results are particularly impressive, given that we're hearing from other resellers, other technology companies that the government spending, federal in particular, is incredibly weak right now, given change in leadership. So, just curious whether you think the strength can continue or if there was any spillover of the market trends in your business as you move through the year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I think, first of all, let's separate it into two buckets, Katy. Because I think there's different drivers, if you will, in each. In state and local, you heard me say that we've continued to be successful in capturing new contracts, new business, so to speak, and so that is all additive to CDW. When we get those contracts, in particular, we developed a core competency, if you will, in public safety, and so I don't see those waning, if you will, going forward. And in the federal space, it was an exceptionally strong quarter. I think it would be unfair, although it's not beyond me to ask the team to continue to repeat an unfair performance. But I think it would be probably unlikely that they would continue to have that kind of growth rate through the year. But I think our alignment with these strategic programs hasn't really yielded anything yet that says that it would continue to be a growth. Now, having said that, I was just in Washington last week meeting with both customers and some of our sellers, and I think there is this little bit of, okay, is defense spending going to get more money? Is it going to come at the expense of the civilian? The nice thing about CDW, I'll go back to one of my favorite words about this place is balance, is that we have relationships with customers on both sides of the federal government marketplace and I think that will \u2013 based on what I know today, will enable us to continue growth. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. And then just quick follow-up. On the data center business, you talked about some areas of growth, some areas of decline in terms of your end markets. Can you just clarify where you continue to see strength versus where the slowdown has occurred in the server storage businesses? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: It's fascinating, Katy. One of the things I do every quarter is look at not just the aggregate number, but then I spend a fair amount of time peeling the layers of the onion back, looking at segments. And I think it's \u2013 and this is probably no surprise to you, it's bounced all around. For example, this quarter, one of our strong selling server markets was Small Business. And Small Business has also been one of our fastest-growing cloud computing markets. And you start to wonder what is it that drives that. I think some of it is driven by incentives that OEMs may put in the marketplace. Some of it could be driven by, hey, I don't really want to change architecture. In other situations, you have people who are clearly saying, hey, I'm going to either go with hyperconverged or cloud computing or virtualization, and all of those I think have tended to make the server market kind of bounce around. So I'd like to give you some crisp, perfect answer, but the truth be known, each quarter feels different, each segment feels different, and fortunately for us, we've been able to optimize those that are growing. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good. Congratulations on the quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Katy. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Tom Richards for any further remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. First of all, thank you again for taking the time this morning. I do appreciate your questions and interest in CDW. And as I always say, if your company needs help, I can't think of anybody better that can help them with their IT needs than CDW. I'd also like to remind you that on May 11, we have our Analyst Day, so I'm hoping we'll see everybody at the Analyst Day session. We're excited to host you here at CDW. And the last, as you know, Mother's Day is around the corner, and I don't think you want to forget Mother's Day because if it weren't for her, you would not have the sheer joy of attending these earnings calls. All right? Thanks, everybody. See you. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. Following our strong first quarter, we delivered another quarter of excellent top line growth and solid profitability. Consolidated sales were $4 billion, up 9% versus last year. On a constant currency basis, sales increased by 10%. Gross profit increased 5% to $641 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $315 million and non-GAAP net income per share increased to 10% to $1.03 per share. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP EPS increased 11%. Results like this require rigor, discipline and process. We have been very deliberate about putting the systems, structure and resources in place to ensure we can continue to execute our strategy effectively. Two recent organizational changes are designed to ensure we maintain this discipline as we drive further growth. You may have noticed that I introduced Chris Leahy as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Creating a new executing role of Chief Revenue Officer accountable for all of our customer-facing channels is the first half these two actions. Chris, who most recently was our Senior Vice President, International and General Counsel, is taking on this new role reporting to me. As you may know, Chris helped lead the launch of our international strategy, including the acquisition of CDW UK. As evidenced again this quarter, our international business has continued to deliver strong results under Chris' leadership. As CRO, Chris will ensure we maintain a strong line of sight to customers, align resources and reinforce connection points between our sales and technical organization. So customers benefit from the deep technical capabilities we have built. I am delighted that Chris is taking on this new role. You will be hearing from Chris in future earnings calls. I'm also delighted that Chris Corley will be taking on an expanded role as we add responsibility for our international business to her current role leading the corporate business segment. Remember that one of the strategic drivers of our international acquisition and expansion is to better serve our U. S.-based multinationals from our corporate segment. Chris will build on the work already underway to create a one company experience to meet customer needs and drive profitable growth. She will also look to leverage our international capabilities to capture profitable growth opportunities outside the U.S. This quarter's results demonstrate the power of rigor and discipline. There were three key drivers of our performance. Our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of product offering and our variable cost structure. Let me walk through how each contributed to performance. This quarter's top line performance once again demonstrated the power of our balanced portfolio of end markets. We saw excellent top line performance across eight of our nine end markets, all up high single-digits or better. This strong performance more than offset a 7% decline in our healthcare business. Corporate, which represents sales to business customers with roughly 250 coworkers and above, increased 9%. Momentum that began in the first quarter continued to build with more projects moving from the back-burner to the front. Small business posted an 11% increase as customer confidence remained strong. Public increased 8% with double-digit increases across all customer end markets except healthcare. Government increased 19%, powered by new contracts in state and local, and ongoing success in meeting public safety needs as well as mid-teens growth in federal. Federal results include a little more than half of the client devices that had been delayed at the year end of 2016. We expect the remainder to ship in the third and fourth quarter. Education increased 11%, reflecting high teens growth in Higher Ed and high single-digit growth in K-12. Healthcare declined 7% as uncertainty regarding the fate of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid funding and overall reimbursements weighed heavily on decision makers. Our other results, which reflect Canada and the UK combined, increased 9%. Both operations continue to show strong performance with Canada up high single-digits in Canadian dollars and UK up double-digits in local currency. Currency impacted both operations, reducing U.S. denominated growth by 50%. The second driver of results was our broad product and solutions suite. Our ability to meet the total technology needs, both transactional and integrated solutions of our customers, is one of the fundamental reasons for our consistent performance. This is a key point of differentiation for us in the marketplace. With over 100,000 products, services and solutions, from over 1,000 vendor partners, we remain well-positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. IT market trends were similar to those that we saw in the first quarter. We continue to see accelerated hardware growth with ongoing focus (08:07) and efficiency, securitization and integration of software into solutions. We also continue to see strong growth in client devices. We had a good mix of business between solutions and transactions with total U.S. solutions growing roughly 6% and transactions growing roughly 10%. Let's take a closer look at overall product performance. As expected, U.S. hardware sales accelerated, increasing 8%, growing 200 basis points faster than the first quarter. Healthcare performance pressured growth rates across most product categories. Two categories, notebooks and mobile devices and networking were very strong. Notebooks and mobile devices increased high teens with excellent growth across all customer end markets. This is a noteworthy result given last year's strong low double-digit increase. Chromebooks increased faster than the category, delivering all-time records for both units and revenues, reflecting continued success in K-12. NetComm sales increased high single-digits with several end markets growing double-digits. Servers increased to mid single-digits in the quarter. Enterprise storage was down low single-digits as strong growth in federal could not offset declines in other markets. We continue to take stocking positions, and while memory constraints and shortages persisted in the quarter, we did not see any interruption in supply. While aspects of traditional data center infrastructure continue to be challenged, hybrid infrastructure, which includes converged infrastructure, Infrastructure as a Service, software-defined data center continued to see excellent growth. Overall, converged infrastructure grew more than 50% in the quarter with hyperconverged driving most of the performance. Services increased 11%, primarily driven by networking solutions. Software sales increased 12%, reflecting strong security and networking growth. Gross profit from software grew faster than net sales as we continue to see meaningful double-digit increases and netted out (10:17) Software as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. And that leads us to the third element of our business model that drove performance this quarter, our variable cost structure. For those of you unfamiliar with our cost structure, after our cost of goods sold, our largest cost element is sales compensation, which represents roughly half of our adjusted SG&A. Sales compensation is highly variable for two reasons. First, it varies with gross profit growth. Second, it varies with sales mix as solution sales involve technical resources and transactional sales typically do not. This quarter, the strong sales momentum we had in hardware and the ongoing competitive marketplace, especially in notebooks and NetComm, pressured gross market. Pressure on product margins isn't new, especially during strong client device refresh cycles. With the acceleration in hardware sales growth, we did not get the same benefit from mixing into 100% gross margin revenues as we did all last year. When top line grows faster than gross profits due to margin compression, as it did this quarter, the variable nature of our sales compensation mitigates this impact. Clearly, our variable cost structure is a key driver of our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth. Another key of our sustainable growth is our three-part strategy. During the quarter, we continue to make excellent progress executing this strategy, which is to first capture market share from existing and new customers; second, expand our solutions suite; third, enhance our services capabilities. Capturing market share (11:56) will continue to be a core competency of CDW. And we take a very disciplined approach towards driving productivity with focused efforts like category penetration and customer acquisition programs. Many of these programs are benefiting from the extensive data we have on our customers. When we combine these data, the data that we have from our relationships with more than 250,000 customers with the advanced analytic capabilities we have in our data sciences team, we can uncover unique customer knowledge that helps us understand how best to serve them. A great example of how we are harnessing this information is a new marketing program that went live in the second quarter. This program uses real-time customer intense signals along with propensity models and analytics to target and deliver personalized marketing communication across multiple channels, including e-mail, search, social and digital. The program also leverages analytics based on behavior to drive up-sell opportunities. You should expect to see us continue to leverage data analytics to drive enhanced customer experience and sales. Our second strategy is to continuously expand our solutions capabilities. By doing so, we capture important pockets of growth across the IT landscape and ensure we remain relevant to customers. One way we do this is by adding partners, which provides both innovation and a source of growth for us. In the second quarter, sales from security partners, added since 2014, increased over 40%. New partners are driving growth in security and cloud with spend for both solutions increasing well into the double-digits. Solutions capabilities will continue to drive growth. One great example is the recent award you may have heard we received to provide a Device as a Service solution for the 2020 U.S. Census. As you know, it's typical for large federal procurements to be protested. Because of this, I can't provide any details right now. We will provide you with more information as appropriate. Another way we remain relevant and capture above market growth is through our third strategic priority, which is to continue to enhance our services capabilities. Services capabilities are an integral part of many high-end solutions sales and are critical to supporting our cloud and security practice. This quarter, networking services increased double-digits, supporting our NetComm increase. As you can see, our investments in solutions and services ensure we can meet the needs of our customers today and in the future and further differentiate CDW as a valuable business partner. Our UK investment is another way we are accomplishing this. As you'll recall, we acquired Kelway in August of 2015 to address requests from U.S.-based customers who were increasingly asking for our help with their international IT needs. U.S. referrals continue to drive meaningful growth for CDW UK, contributing roughly 20% of CDW UK's double-digit growth in the quarter. And it's not just U.S. referrals. CDW UK is also driving growth from its own UK-based customers, delivering solutions around the world. We are prudently investing to help fuel this growth. This quarter CDW UK marketing spend was nearly twice last year's level. Building up our very successful U.S.-based orchestration campaign, CDW is working with key partners across several categories and investing, along with our partners, to drive greater awareness of CDW's capabilities to deliver integrated solutions both in and outside of the UK. Efforts like these, along with our dedicated international sales team and CDW international-branded website are driving excellent results. When we first entered into our 35% equity agreement with Kelway in late 2014, roughly 10% of their customer spend was outside the UK. In the second quarter, that figure was more than 20%. In fact, approximately 25% of the double-digit growth in local currency this quarter was derived from solutions delivered outside the UK. Our international platform is being leveraged to help both existing and new UK-based customers address their needs around the world. We have also continued to invest in customer-facing coworkers to drive our growth. These coworkers include account managers, field sellers, solution architects and service delivery engineers. We ended the quarter up roughly 130 customer-facing coworkers since the beginning of 2017, adding over 70 this quarter. Based on what we know today, that feels like the right number to finish the year, plus or minus 10%. As we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust our plans as appropriate. And that leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. Given first half market performance, our current view of the 2017 U.S. IT market growth is full year growth in the 3.5% to 4% range, driven by continued hardware growth and strength in client devices. That's an increase of roughly 100 basis points from our prior view. In addition to increasing our view of market growth, given our strong performance to-date, we also expect to exceed our annual medium-term target of growing between 200 basis points and 300 basis points above the market. We currently look for outperformance between 350 basis points and 400 basis points. Of course, all of this is dependent on how the U.S. economy performs. If the economy stalls, then we would expect to see U.S. IT market growth come back down. We'll keep a watchful eye on things. And is our practice, we will update our view on market growth as we move through the year. Now, let me turn it over to Ann. Ann? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our second quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, breadth of product offerings and variable cost structure. They also reflect the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to our P&L. If you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 7. Consolidated net sales were $4 billion, 9% higher than last year on a reported and average daily sales basis. Average daily sales were $62.4 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were 9.8% higher than last year. Currency impact was driven by both the British pound and Canadian to U.S. dollar translation, shaving roughly 80 basis points off of growth. Currency impact was 20 basis points lower than the first quarter. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales were up 20.1% versus Q1 2017, which was higher than both last year and also our historical Q1 to Q2 increase. Gross profit for the quarter increased 5% to $641 million. Gross margin in the second quarter was 16.1%, 60 basis points lower than last year. The decline was driven by the impact of increased hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace, which pressured our product margin. Low teens increases and 100% gross margin revenues, which include commissions, warranties and Software as a Service were not enough to offset our product margin decline. Turning to SG&A on slide 8, consolidated reported SG&A including advertising expense was roughly 6% higher than last year. Reported SG&A includes $11.5 million of equity-based compensation, $2 million of integration expenses and $4.5 million of other expenses, including payroll taxes on equity-based compensation. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising increased 5%, primarily driven by sales payroll growth and advertising. Coworker count was up roughly 75 year-over-year to just under 8,800. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $314.7 million, up 4.7%. This delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.9%, down 30 basis points from last year. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 9. Interest expense was $35.9 million, $1 million lower than last year's Q2 level. GAAP taxes were $55 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 27.9%. The reduction in effective tax rate primarily reflects excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity-based compensation. Tax benefits amplified operating income and GAAP net income was $141 million. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance, was $163.2 million in the quarter, up 4.9% over last year. As you can see on Slide 10, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add backs that fall in four general buckets. The ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, equity-based compensation and the related payroll taxes and excess tax benefits, acquisition and integration expenses and other non-recurring or infrequent income or expenses such as net loss on the extinguishment of debt. This quarter, our performance alignment grant or PAG vested. The PAG was a one-time equity grant made at the time of our IPO to coworkers up to senior manager. This vest created (21:27) $18.6 million of excess tax benefits. Since we add back equity compensation as a non-GAAP adjustments, we also reversed out this $18.6 million of excess tax benefits. This adjustment is detailed in the GAAP reconciliation provided with our press release. With Q2 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $159 million, we delivered $1.03 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 10% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter, currency impact on EPS was similar to the impact on net sales. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP net income per share increased 10.8%. Turning to first half results on slide 11. Revenue was $7.3 billion, an increase of 7.9% on a reported and average daily sales basis. On a constant currency basis, growth would have been roughly 90 basis points higher. Gross profit during the first half of the year was $1.2 billion, up 5.2%. Gross profit margin was 6.3%, down 40 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $564 million, 5.7% above first half 2016. Net income was $199 million for the first half of 2017 and non-GAAP net income was $284 million versus $268 million in 2016, up 6.8%. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP net income per share was $1.77, up 11.4%. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 14. On June 30, we had $79 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3.2 billion as compared to $3.1 billion at June 30, 2016. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.1 billion. Net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q2 was 2.8 times within our target range of 2.5 to 3 times. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.2%, 20 basis points below last year due to the term loan repricing and note refinancing (23:30) completed in Q1. Roughly 95% of our outstanding debt remained either fixed rate or hedged. As you can see on slide 15, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q2. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down 1 day from last year second quarter (23:50) below our new annual target range of high teens to low 20s. Year-over-year DSO and DPO each increased 4 days. Cash taxes paid for the quarter were $90.3 million and cash interest was $28.5 million. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures, was a positive $40 million compared to $9 million in Q2 of 2016. Year-to-date free cash flow was $254 million, compared to $359 million in the first six months of 2016. As you'll recall, our first quarter free cash flow was more than $100 million less than last year's due to the year-over-year period and timing differences and a lower-than-expected sequential sales decline. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and repurchased 3.1 million shares for $184 million at an average cost of $58.89 per share. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you can see on slide 16. First, increased dividends annually. To guide these increase in November of 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.16 per share on September 11 to shareholders of record as of August 25, up 49% from a year ago. Since the IPO, our dividends had increased nearly fourfold from its initial annual level. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended Q2 at 2.8 times. Third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. To support this priority, our board has approved an incremental $750 million share repurchase authorization. This approval augments the balance remaining in the prior $750 million authorization, on which, on June 30, there was $283 million remaining. Our capital allocation priority support our refresh 2016 to 2018 medium-term target which you see on slide 17. These are to grow in constant currency, 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market with a targeted adjusted EBITDA margin in the high 7% to 8% range. Maintain our net leverage ratio between 2.5 and 3 times and deliver low double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth in constant currency. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our medium-term target on an annual not on a quarterly basis. Let me now provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling the rest of our 2017 financials. I'm on slide 18. We currently expect to exceed our annual medium-term target of delivering full year constant currency growth of 200 basis points to 300 basis points above the U.S. IT market growth. At this time, we expect to exceed market growth by 350 basis points to 400 basis points. Based on our first half results and the expectations for the rest of the year, we look for the balance of sales in the second half to be slightly lighter than our normal seasonality, which is roughly 48% to 52% weighted towards the back half of the year in the neighborhood of 50 basis points less than the second half. This primarily reflects the impact of our second quarter higher than typical sequential sales and its impact on Q3 growth, primarily in CDW UK and our government business. We have one less selling day in Q3 2017, which will result in average daily sales growth higher than our reported sales growth. This reverses in Q4, where we have one extra day of sales and Q4 reported sales growth will be higher than average daily sales. We currently look for currency headwinds to come in at an annual average rate of roughly 50 basis points. This assumes average annual translation rates of $0.75 to the Canadian dollar and $1.25 to the British pound. While the pound translation rate is slightly higher than our initial $1.20 to the pound rate, we remain conservative given the volatility around Brexit talks and timing. Given current expectations for hardware growth to remain strong and the mix impact into 100% gross margin items to remain muted, we expect our full year adjusted EBITDA margin to come in at the low end of our high 7% to 8% annual target range. With roughly half our adjusted SG&A before depreciation and amortization fixed with the other half variable with gross profit, one fewer selling day in Q3 will drive expense growth higher than gross profit growth, compressing Q3 year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin. Keep in mind, Q3 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.4%. This difference in days will shift roughly 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA growth from Q3 into Q4. We expect depreciation and amortization to continue at a similar quarterly rate to Q2 at roughly $65 million per quarter, $46 million of which is for purchased intangibles. We continue to expect total annual book interest expense of roughly $150 million. With the PAG fully vested, we expect second half equity-based compensation to run slightly below first half levels at a couple million dollars below 2016. We will book excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in the fourth quarter. They're expected to be much lower than Q1 or Q2 in the range of $2 million or so depending on our stock price at the time and performance attainment. Our effective GAAP tax rate in the third quarter will be higher than in the first half, coming in 100 basis points or so above the 2016 level with our second half rate of approximately 37%. Non-GAAP add-backs for the remainder of the year will be taxed at a 36% rate with any excess tax benefits then reserved out. You should expect us to continue to use share repurchases to achieve our low double-digit non-GAAP EPS annual growth target in constant currency. Given UK and Canadian operations now represent roughly 10% of our business, it is important to consider currency translation when modeling both top and bottom line in this volatile currency environment. We continue to expect currency to drive similar headwinds as on our top line. And that leads us to a few notes for those of you modeling cash flow on slide 19. We continue to expect our capital expenditures will be about 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. We also continue to expect to deliver our cash conversion cycle within our new target range of high teens to low 20s. For the full year, there was no change to our expected cash tax rate in the 32% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition-related intangibles and amortization, which is approximately $46 million per quarter. In addition, we continue to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. Cash taxes will be lower in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to tax deductions from equity compensation. We continue to expect to deliver annual cash flow within our recently enhanced range of 3% to 3.5% of net sales. As you'll recall, in 2016, we delivered free cash flow as a percentage of net sales significantly above this target. This reflected the onetime benefit of extending key partners to longer payment terms as well as period end timing. We exited 2016 with more than $250 million of cash and cash equivalent on our balance sheet. Reinforcing our commitment to return cash to shareholders, we intend to return more than 100% of 2017 free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases and currently expect the bulk of our repurchases to occur in the first three quarters of the year. That concludes the financial summary. Before we open it up for Q&A, let me briefly address the SEC investigation we disclosed in 2015 relating to vendor partner program incentive. As you may have seen during the second quarter, we were notified by the SEC that they had concluded their review with no action recommended. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one question and one brief follow-up? Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Our first question is from Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Matt. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, Tom. Thank you. You touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks. But given the acceleration you've seen, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sentiment you're hearing from your commercial customers and if you're starting to see some of those expansionary projects that you've talked about in the past come online yet? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: The short answer is yes. As I alluded to, we started to see kind of the continuation of the momentum, Matt, we saw in the first quarter relative to, not only client devices but solutions growth and you saw that reflected in our performance. Those are the more longer tail projects that take a little more time. So we are continuing to see momentum in corporate. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, on the step down in gross margins, was there a conscious change in strategy that you guys made this quarter or was that just more of a function of what the market gave you across the hardware and the competition that you called out previously? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, Matt, it wasn't. It's amazingly consistent with the last time we had a strong client refresh, if you look back I think it was in 2014, it's the same phenomenon when you have customers going through strong refresh. Those products typically have lower margins. And so when you get that kind of exponential growth, it tends to just put the pressure on. So it was just a function of what customers want to be doing at this particular time. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot. I guess just to continue on that hardware discussion. Notebook and mobile devices, I think Tom you said, were up high teens from what I recall. You had it very difficult compared to the June quarter on a year-over-year basis at least. So what's really driving this and comfort that (34:23) this kind of sustains into the back half versus perhaps it was a pull in or something? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Amit. Yeah, it was. It's funny we just talked about that this morning. It's amazing that we had that kind of growth rate on top of, not that strong but pretty strong in quarter last year. I would say a couple of different things. One is, it's about the refresh cycle time. If you think about it, 2014 was Windows XP expiration timeframe that drove a lot of refresh. We are now three or four years into it. So it's about the cycle. The second behavior we're seeing is \u2013 a little bit of an interesting perspective is that some customers are moving ahead with Win 10, As we've talked about, I think the word I've used is a general breeze that continued. But we also have some customers who are kind of loading up on 7, so to speak. And so I think those two things. I think the third thing is \u2013 and this is amazing performance by the K-12 team. If you look at their comp last year and specially client devices, the fact that they were able to continue to grow and Chromebooks continue to be a strong driver, those things kind of drove that part of the client refresh. And at this point, Amit, it looks like it's going to continue through the better part of the year. One more thing, the other thing driving it was those big federal client orders that didn't get booked or shipped at the end of last year are kind of coming to the system now. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. That's really helpful. And if I can just really follow-up. You guys have had this renewed focus or new found focus I'd say on the small business, the 90 to 250 employees or so, and you spend a lot of time and the analysts have been talking about this. Double-digit growth this quarter, how should we think about the potential for you to, I guess, sustain the growth here today? I imagine you actually have much lower market share in this market versus the broader TAM that you guys go after. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Look, I would say it's not much lower market share. I think the opportunity is great though. I agree with you that's why we made the move. I don't know that I'm going to get into giving guidance on small business. But I will tell you, we're excited about the \u2013 like anything else, when you focus on something and it gives you ability to get up every day and think about nothing else other than what small business customers want, and the first half of this year, we saw a lot of client refresh. And we're starting to see momentum in the solutions business. I mean, we feel really good about the decision and the return on that investment as they start to customize the solutions that they deliver to small business, we would expect to continue strong performance. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. That's it for me and congrats on the quarter, guys. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, thanks, Amit. Operator : Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Baird. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Jayson. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Hey, Tom. I wanted to start with UK at double-digits in local. That's surprising. Some others have called out softness there. It sounds like a marketing campaign helped you guys. But maybe if you could talk about your success there a little bit. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, look, I think it's a combination of factors. One, clearly, the investment we've made in leveraging the orchestration campaign and telling the story about the capabilities of CDW certainly paid dividends. I think the second thing is, you have now UK being part of the CDW family for better part of a year-and-a-half or two years. So some of the programmatic approaches we take to focusing, sell our productivity, some of the programs you heard me allude to on category penetration and account acquisition, a lot of those things contributed to the performance. And the last thing is, as I tried to call out, the combination of both referrals increasing from US nationals and the success of the international sales team inside of UK selling capabilities outside of UK, all of those kind of came to a confluence, if you will, and produced that kind of performance in the quarter. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And that makes sense. And then a follow-up on the hardware side, storage down with strength in converged and then server up seems surprising, anything to call out there specifically on server and can that continue? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'm sorry, Jayson, I didn't hear the very last part. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Can the strength in server continue going forward? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, look, we have some things that give some optimism. You've got the new processor that's coming online at the end of the year. I think there is some anticipation for that, especially in a couple of segments like our financial vertical. So that gives you some excitement there. And hyperconverged and converged in general to me just makes so much sense for customers relative to giving them the density, and yet at the same time, giving them the on-prem control that some of them want for certain workload. So I think I would be shocked if we don't continue to see the hyperconverged and converged infrastructure grow. I would be surprised if Infrastructure as a Service doesn't continue to grow. And I think, what I'll call the traditional server business, it'd be hard because it's been somewhat, I'll use my favorite economic term, lumpy, where we have some strong quarters, where we make some meaningful sales. I think you should expect to kind of continue with that kind of performance in light of what's going on with hyperconverged. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks, Tom. Congrats on the quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Jay. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning, Tom, and everyone. Just a couple of follow-ups from the previous questions. Just one on the seasonality for the rest of the year and sort of call that out where that typical first half, second half is a little bit different given the strength that you've seen in the first couple of quarters. But specifically, on government, and you talked, Tom, about the strength that you saw, some push out from last year into this year. What's the expectations for seasonality in the federal government for the next quarter? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I would say it feels normal at this point. We won't have the overhang, that'd be the wrong word, the supported growth from the client devices as strong as we've had as we move through the year. But our federal guys are not saying anything unusual about the normal buying cycles of the federal government, which typically for us ends up being a pretty strong third quarter. But we have seen some things happen lately in the last couple of years, where as you sell more solutions, they tend to spill over into later quarters. Now, Ann, if there's anything else you want to add?. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Matt, my commentary was government had a very strong second quarter. So we won't necessarily see the normal sequential growth. Not that Q3 won't be a normal-ish Q3, but if you're looking at sequential growth, that's what my comments were really pointing out. So very strong growth in our international U.K. business as well as government. So that's what I was say, would likely impact that said 48/52 balance that we typically see and I said roughly 50 basis points. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And just on the UK strength there. At your Analyst Day, you called out the fact that you're expanding your fiscal footprint into mainland Europe in several countries now, I believe. How much of that growth is being driven by that and what's the opportunity to grow beyond the UK? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, well, as you heard, we've had significant growth outside of the UK. And Matt, we haven't really opened any new offices. It was really a function of the existing facilities we have in place, the kind of hub-and-spoke strategy that they have. And it really has just been leveraging, if you will, the international strategy that I alluded to, the orchestration campaign that drove the increased results and the dedicated international sales team, I think, has a lot to do with, like anything else, with us. When we focus on something, we tend to get a return on our investment from a performance standpoint. I would say it was more that than we didn't open up any new offices. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Shannon. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Good morning. I'm curious, with dollars shifting to client and the conversations you're having with your customers, where are they shifting away from? I know there are sort of puts and takes and ebbs-and-flows in this business, but I'm curious as to sort of where clients are maybe deemphasizing or if it's just, at this point, they realize they have to spend on everything? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. I don't know that there's a generalization I can make, Shannon, because it does seem to depend on the customer. And if we hadn't had such strong solutions growth, we had a nice solutions quarter at 6%, you could say there was a substitution effect. I don't believe that's the case. I believe it's more of coming to grips with the fact that there's a refresh required on the client devices. We also saw, maybe not as evident in my comments, kind of a strong refresh in the NetComm business. And I think both of those are driven primarily by cycle wishes. It's refresh time. And I don't know, if you look across the board, we really didn't have any product category other than printing, which continues to be an ongoing challenge. Everyone else had really nice growth. So I don't think I saw a substitutionary effect. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Okay. No, that's great. And then can you talk a bit about what customers are saying on security these days and how that's playing into your solutions business and some of the growth you're seeing? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, can't (45:18) enough would be the \u2013 or the easiest way to describe it feels like to me. It is interesting though. I think one of the new things we're seeing is, more discussion at the front end in the planning process, how do we design security into the solution. And we started to see that trend last year as compared to maybe two years ago, where it was, how do I rectify or how do I enhance the current infrastructure. And that discussion is probably playing out a lot more today than it has. Just because people are saying, look, if we're going to do a refresh cycle, we're going to think about security upfront, therefore, we're going to design it in the solution. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Is there any difference between enterprise and small business within the security discussions or are the small business customers really starting to understand the threats at this point? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I would say, the only difference is probably the complexity of the solution if you think about just the general nature of the business. But I would say, we have the same kind of interest level \u2013 the question even comes up, for example, when somebody's doing a refresh cycle on client devices, right. Where they're now saying, hey, I want to make sure I'm cognizant of the security capability built into the device. I'm not sure we heard that three or four years ago. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Shannon. Operator : Our next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Tom, I was hoping you could provide a little more color on the strength in the server market. I know we talked about it in an earlier question, but you guys significantly outperformed the rest of the server market. And I think most people have been talking about some issues in server demand related to higher bill of material costs. Can you maybe comment on what's helping you outperform the traditional market? And then related to that, talking about component costs, you mentioned it a little bit, but are you guys being impacted at all by higher commodity costs, at least in terms of being able to get product or have you had any issues with that? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Let me go back to the first one on server. I think one of the reasons, Sherri, is, and we've watched this now, I would say it feels like for the last two or three years, the cyclical nature of the server market with all of the other things that are kind of going on around it, whether it's looking at virtualization. We had a strong virtualization quarter. Looking at Infrastructure as a Service, we had a strong Infrastructure as a Service quarter. Looking at hyperconverged, we had it strong... So I think what you see is people looking at their landscape and saying, look, there are going to be times when I'm going to decide to extend my on-prem server capability because it doesn't make sense to make a change at this point. And what I see, and this is more something that's true in our corporate space, is that doesn't happen every quarter. It's not like every quarter somebody's thinking about doing that, which is why I think you see \u2013 if you look at us, even over the last two years, it's been up mid single-digits, down low single-digits, up single-digits. So I wouldn't kind of over-index on the performance this quarter. We're thrilled. Having said that, we have put a lot of resources on focusing on the data center. And I think one of the benefits when you focus on that is you get some improved performance like we saw this quarter. Now, I think that's first part. Second part, obviously, we did see some cost of goods changes in the quarter. And ironically, in some places, we saw cost of goods increases. We also saw cost of goods decreases. Some of that is a function of our scale, some of it is a function of supply shortages, but I think the point I was trying to reinforce is on the whole and on the average, didn't have a meaningful impact on us in the quarter. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I was calling to see if you can talk a little more about the executive appointments in terms of Chris and Chris. What those mean longer-term in terms of \u2013 is this more about the need to grow beyond the existing customer base from a land-and-grab expansion perspective in terms of having to really carve out new customer generation from here? Does that mean it's getting harder? And the follow-up will be, does that mean there could be more acquisitions down the road? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Okay. So let me take the first one. It isn't about like new challenges in the marketplace, like it's harder to acquire customers. It was really something that I've been thinking about for almost 18 months. And then, part of it is, I have this kind of personal philosophy that, as a business gets bigger, the way you make sure you execute is you manage smaller. And that means you constantly look at making sure you have more people with eyes and ears to listen to what's going on with sellers, listen to what's going on with customers and then leverage that across the organization. So it really is more just about that approach and philosophy. Look, these results aren't the kind of results that say, oh my gosh, we're trying to solve some kind of problem as much as I just want to make sure we're staying a couple steps ahead. And we're constantly listening and focusing on the front line. That was really what drove the first Chris appointment. And the second Chris appointment was driven by the driver of doing international in the first place was our corporate marketplace. And we've made great progress now in kind of working on the one message platform and you heard the results. So that appointed was, it feels like the right time now to put those two together and expect them to take off. What was the second part? Oh, do we expect increase or do we expect to do M&A? I think, Mark, I'll answer the same way I did at the Investor Day. That is, we think M&A will continue to be part of our future. It'll be looking for specific strategic opportunities versus some kind of general rollup. We think there are some technologies out there where it may be to our advantage to acquire rather than try to build based on speed to market. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Adam. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. Tom, you mention an ongoing competitive marketplace in the press release. I don't recall seeing that much in the past. Could you give maybe give us more clarity on this comment? And does this tie into some of the management changes that you've been making? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Has nothing do with the management changes. And we've felt like \u2013 I think I talked about this, Adam, in the past is that, when you're still \u2013 look, GDP as much as it feels a little better now, I don't know what the latest forecast is, like 2.7% or 2.9%, it's still, on the whole and on the average, it's still a relatively slow growth environment. I think when that happens, people compete hard. And so that doesn't feel like it's changed at all. I think the only difference this quarter is, you had this kind of rapid growth of client devices coupled with what has become kind of the normal course so to speak. And this marketplace, which is hyper competitive and you got to grind. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And I know margin compression was a bit of a sticking point in the quarter. But it looks like both revenue and gross profit dollars per employee improved on a year-over-year basis again in this quarter. Can you maybe talk about what's driving that, and if possible, how this is tracking CDW UK since I know that was suppressing metrics a bit last year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, I would say two things. I don't really know that margin was a sticking point in the quarter. It was just a function of us mixing into client devices. I mean, like I said, if you look back at 2014, Ann and I were doing this the other day, it looks remarkably similar when we have this big client refresh cycle. The second point though I think is a point that we've made, I think, consistently since the IPO, in our business model, the thing we really concentrated on is adjusted EBITDA, and that is a percent of sales. Because it is really that part of the business that is the variable compensation structure. So, when you think about what happens, like in this quarter and you have transactional business growing at 10% (54:14), you have solutions growing at 6% (54:15), you're going to tend to see some leverage come out of your sales compensation because those transaction sales don't include a technical resource from a compensation perspective. And we really focus in on that. It's kind of under the theory, you can't totally control GP, but you can control what goes on in SG&A and that's kind of where we focus. And that yielded some of the benefits you're talking about. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Just maybe to clarify on, I just mean, in the sense that we were kind of all as the Street expecting higher gross margins or maybe some of that's on us, so just to clarify, I know 3Q typically declines sequentially due to federal mix? Might this be different this year given the starting point is bit lower than we thought? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, I don't know that I could get \u2013 I mean, the thought of it's going to depend on how much the client refresh continues. At the end of the day, what I would say is don't over think this one. There is just a strong client refresh and we're going to help customers with that. We're not going to walk away from that maybe because clients may not have a strong a margin as solutions. Because over the long run, when we help clients with these kind of problems, they don't forget that. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Keith. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. Just wanted to (55:43) the challenges in healthcare. Obviously, your guess is as good as mine, what's going to happen with that in the federal level. But as you guys you talk to your customers and if it were these trends throughout the quarter where the healthcare challenges were getting worse and what happens if nothing happens over the next six months through congress? Is the headwind going to get worse there? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Keith, if I could answer that question, I don't know what I'd do next in life. But I would say this, and this was confirmed, we actually have a board member who's in the healthcare industry. Ironically, his description of what people are experiencing was very similar to what we have been telling you, which is the lack of clarity, especially for the major hospitals. Makes it hard because they're not sure about how they're going to reimbursed. We're not sure on how you're going to be reimbursed. You're going to be cautious on spending. And that whole scenario just continues to play out. And I don't know that I have the skills to forecast what's going to happen in Washington and how it's going to impact healthcare. I just know that it's amazingly consistent across our healthcare customers. And the story we hear relative to what it means to how they run their business. I would take that's the one thing that I think keeps coming home. The IT spend or the IT issues are a direct derivative of the overall management of the healthcare institution and facility. And so it gets impacted just like everything else. And I think that's what we're hearing time and time and time again. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Changing gears, when you slightly hear the product shortages, it sounds like two quarters in a row where the shortages have been out there but you guys made it with a, not get impacted by that. As you guys exited the quarter, was there any increase or decrease, concerns regarding shortages for the rest of the year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, yeah. Look, we're always concerned whether there are shortages. I'm hopeful we can continue to take advantage of our scale and buying behavior to mitigate those. But I don't know that I would guarantee that to anybody. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hello. Thank you. Good morning. Have you changed your outlook for back half market growth after the strong second quarter? And when you think about the 350 basis point to 400 basis points outperformance, is that mostly flowing through your performance in 2Q or do you think you'll outperform by that much in the back half? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So I'll let Ann. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah, so Katy, earlier in the year, we thought market growth was going to be a bit above 2% (58:44) to bit above 3% (58:46). So we have taken up our view of market growth for the year as well as how much we think we're going to outperform the market. We've now saying 3.5% (58:56) to 400 basis points. Those are annual numbers, right. So keep that in mind. We don't further segment it by quarter or by half. We did think that our sequential \u2013 the split, if you will, of first half to second half this year might be a little front end loaded, roughly 50 basis points because of the strong performance, particularly in our UK business and our government business in Q2. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Richards for any further remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, everybody, as always for your time and your attentiveness and your questions. You've heard me say this before. I find your questions very helpful in making sure we're thinking about the right things. So thank you. And I just want to squelch a rumor. It's not true that you have to be named Chris to advance here at CDW. So I want to make sure my team hears that. Okay. Thanks, everybody. Have a great summer. See you offline. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. I'm pleased to report that CDW posted another quarter of profitable growth, and for the first quarter in our history, delivered $4 billion of net sales. Results for the quarter included a 10.5% increase in average daily net sales with net sales of $4 billion; a 4.5% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $324.3 million and a 10.8% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.08. Once again, our ability to deliver this excellent performance was the result of three key drivers; our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio and our variable cost structure. You've heard me talk about these drivers since our IPO, but the way they have contributed to our profitable growth has been very different depending on market conditions. Last year, third quarter results were impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty, which led business customers to focus on sweating assets and optimize every dollar of investment. The breadth of our product offering enabled us to meet customer demand and drove meaningful growth in many solutions that are netted down, like warranties and software assurance. This year, we have a very different dynamic playing out in the market. The business market has been more vibrant and as expected, hardware growth has accelerated throughout the year, driven by both sustained excellent growth in transactions hardware and acceleration in solutions-based hardware sales. Let's take a look at how performance drivers helped drive profitable growth again this quarter. First, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels; Corporate, which serves customers with coworkers from roughly 250 and up; Small Business, which serves customers with up to 250 coworkers; Healthcare; Government; and Education, each generating annual sales of more than $1 billion. We also have our Canadian and UK operations, which together represent more than $1 billion. Given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each of these unique customer end markets, our channels often act in a countercyclical way. For example, in last year's third quarter, results were mixed across the business with Public sales increasing 11%, Small Business increasing 7% and Corporate decreasing roughly 2%. This year, performance was more balanced across our segments, with Corporate up 11%, Small Business up 12%, and Public up 7%. Chris is going to take you through the performance in each of our sales channels. Chris? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Our Corporate team delivered an 11% increase in the quarter. We continue to see ongoing focus on refresh, driving excellent growth in client devices. In addition, continuing the momentum we saw building in the second quarter, solutions growth accelerated as larger projects continued to get the green light. In fact, solutions growth outpaced transactions, but both increased double digits. Small Business increased 12%. We saw a slight acceleration in solutions activity, but for the most part, customer focus was on client devices. Transactions increased mid-teens, solutions increased low-single digits. Public grew 7% in the quarter. Government performance drove much of the increase, with the team delivering 15% growth, driven by balanced performance across both end markets. State and local delivered low double-digit growth, as we continue to drive results from new contracts and success meeting public safety needs. Federal increased mid-teens as we continued to benefit from our strategic program alignment, as well as the shipment of a majority of remaining client devices that had pushed into 2017. Beyond those shipments, we saw excellent growth in client devices as we helped various Department of Defense agencies meet the mandate to move to Windows 10. Healthcare purchasing behavior was once again impacted by the ongoing uncertainty around reimbursements and the fate of the Affordable Care Act, and sales were flat. We did see some transactional activity pickup as some customers determined they needed to move ahead to refresh client devices, but overall demand remained muted. Education sales increased 6%. Higher Ed delivered a high-teens increase, which was driven by client refresh, collaboration and video solutions. K-12 delivered low single-digit growth on top of last year's high-teens growth. The team had success delivering networking solutions, utilizing both E-Rate and non-funded dollars, but that was partially offset by flat client device sales, as schools digest what they have purchased over the past few years and focus on maintaining existing equipment. The K-12 team continues to make progress helping schools create the classroom of the future, and saw excellent growth in related technologies, like video equipment and collaboration. Our International team has delivered excellent growth with combined sales up 25% in U.S. dollars. Canada and UK grew at similar rates in U.S. dollars with Canada benefiting roughly 500 basis points from translation, and UK being negatively impacted by roughly 40 basis points from currency. Both teams are out executing their competitors. In Canada, while concerns regarding trade and the economy remain, the market feels a bit more stable and we saw excellent results in both the public and corporate markets. In the UK, Brexit does not appear to be impacting demand yet. In addition to strong local growth, results continue to reflect excellent success addressing U.S. referrals. With that, let me turn it back to Tom. Tom? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Chris. Clearly, the double-digit growth we delivered demonstrates the power of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. These top-line results also demonstrate the power of the second driver of our performance this quarter, the more than 100,000 products and solutions in our portfolio and more than 1,000 leading and emerging partners. Our ability to meet the total technology needs both solutions and transactional of our customers is one of the fundamental reasons for our consistent performance. Our broad portfolio contributed to this quarter's performance, and we saw balanced growth with transactions increasing low-double digits and solutions increasing high-single digits. As expected, hardware growth continued strong and accelerated in the quarter to 10%, 2.5 times faster than last year's 4% growth rate and more than 200 basis points faster than the second quarter. We continue to see excellent growth in client devices, which once again increased mid-teens. We also saw continued strength in NetComm hardware, which for the third quarter in a row increased high-single digits. Video equipment and collaboration hardware growth also accelerated in the quarter. Server solutions increased low-single digits, but the server hardware component decrease low-double digits, as customers focused on memory additions, virtualization, warranties, and other accessories. Enterprising storage growth accelerated in the quarter, up high-teens. Customers continue to focus on modernizing and optimizing data center infrastructure. Growth across hybrid infrastructure, which includes converged infrastructure, infrastructure-as-a-service, and software-defined data center, was excellent. Converged infrastructure and Flash represented more than 1/3 of our total storage revenues this quarter. A meaningful part of those revenues come from hyper-converged solutions, which doubled in the quarter. In fact, hyper-converged contributed more than 75% of enterprise storage growth. New technologies are clearly impacting hardware growth at CDW. New technologies are also impacting software spend as software becomes a larger component of IT solutions, whether it is being integrated into new advanced architectures, particularly in the data center, or is standalone delivering important capabilities like security. You can see that in our third quarter software results, which were up 7%. In addition to continued double-digit growth in security, we also saw double digit increases in storage software. Both software booked in the traditional manner and netted down software, which includes software assurance and cloud, increased in the quarter, and gross profit increased in line with sales. Services increased 7%. Warranties increased high-single digits on top of last year's mid-teens increase. Recall that warranties like software assurance and software-as-a-service are netted down for accounting purposes. This quarter the acceleration in hardware and associated product margin compression offset the impact from netted down revenues. Product margin compression isn't new. We've seen this before when we've had significant growth in hardware. There was no change to the impact that vendor incentive rebates have on our gross margin, no change to the ongoing competitive marketplace. What was different this quarter was the meaningful acceleration in hardware growth. And that leads us to the third element of our business model that drove performances this quarter, our variable cost structure. For those of you unfamiliar with our cost structure, after our cost of goods sold, our largest cost element is sales compensation. Sales compensation is highly variable for two reasons. First, it varies with gross profit growth. Second, it varies with sales mix, as solution sales involve technical resources and transactional sales do not. When top line grows faster than gross profits, as it did in the quarter, the variable nature of our cost structure mitigates the impact of gross margin compression. This quarter, as it has in the past, our business model worked exactly as it is intended to, and our adjusted EBITDA grew in line with our gross profits. Clearly, this is a key driver of our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth. Another key driver of our sustainable growth is our focus on staying relevant to our customers as technology and customers' needs change. A key way we ensure we are focusing resources in the right areas is our in-depth strategic planning review, which we perform every three years. One of the outcomes of our strategic review in 2014 was our decision to invest in international capabilities. It has been two years since we brought on CDW UK and you can certainly see the impact of that investment on our results. As you recall, this strategic acquisition was made to address requests from US-based customers who were increasingly asking for our help with their international IT needs. U.S. referrals continue to drive meaningful growth. For CDW UK, US-generated referrals to the UK were 50% higher than the third quarter of 2016. That increase in referrals generated 1/5 of their 20%-plus growth in the quarter. These results are terrific and a great validation of our investment thesis for the acquisition. Let me share an example of how this is working. A U.S.-based customer in the data analytics field was about to embark on a global network upgrade. They wanted a single solution across 39 countries. It was a daunting project for the customer, since they had very small teams in country and didn't want to fly IT staff around the world for multiple phases of the rollout. Now, we don't have coworkers in all 39 countries either, but our model is built on having referral relationships in key markets. We designed a solution that uses established partnerships with third-party providers to handle the local aspects of the four-phase rollout. The solution we designed is comprised of both hardware and services, and is delivering revenues to both the U.S. and the UK. The U.S. and the UK portions of the hardware sales are roughly in the same $3 million range. In addition, the customer spent more than $1 million for services, which included a warranty renewal. We also provided a proprietary tool the U.S. team had created that helps customers manage their networks, while monitoring warranty performance. Clearly, this solution delivered value for our U.S.-based customer, value we could not have delivered without the strategic investment we made in international capabilities in CDW UK. We address the need for international capabilities that we identified in our last strategic review via acquisition. Another way we invest in building strategic capabilities identified in our review process is by adding customer-facing coworkers. These include field sellers, solution architects, and service delivery engineers required to ensure our sellers have the support structure they need to stay relevant to customers. Field sellers who work face-to-face with customers in advanced integrated solutions have grown nearly 40% since 2013. You can see the impact of our investment in customer-facing coworkers in the results of our security and cloud practices this quarter. Both areas delivered excellent double-digit increases in customer spend. We continue to prudently invest in coworkers to ensure we drive profitable growth. We ended the quarter with new customer-facing coworkers, in line with last quarter, up roughly 130 since the beginning of the year. There is no change to our expectations for the full year, which is to remain at this level, plus or minus 10%. As we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust our plan as appropriate. And that leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date market performance, we have increased our view of 2017 U.S. IT market growth, and now look for market growth around the 4.5% range, driven by continued strength in hardware, both solutions and transactional. Reflecting our performance to-date, we've also increased our expectations for exceeding market growth, and now look to outperform the market between 425 basis points and 450 basis points. Balancing profitable growth with investing in our future has been a key to our ability to deliver on our annual medium-term targets. We are in the process of completing our strategic planning process for the 2018-2020 cycle. As we have done in the past, you should expect us to invest to drive future growth while, at the same time deliver on our medium-term annual targets. For 2017, we expect to deliver constant-currency earnings per share growth at the midpoint of our medium-term annual target of low-double digits. I hope you can tell from these comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well under different market scenarios and positions us for profitable growth in the future. This confidence has led our board to approve a 31% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, consistent with our capital allocation priority of achieving a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow by year-end 2019. I know many of you may be wondering what to expect for 2018. We are in the middle of our planning process, and as we always do, we will provide our 2018 outlook on our year-end conference call. As you know, Ann will be retiring from CDW at year-end. Before I turn the call over to her to review financial results for one last time as CFO, I want to take a moment to thank her for her incredible service and contributions to CDW. I'd also like to introduce Collin Kebo to you, who will be assuming the mantle of CFO on January 1. Ann and Collin have partnered together closely for many years. This transition is a great example of our succession planning process in action. Collin is a seasoned, thoughtful executive. He's been with CDW for nine years with increasing accountability and was deeply involved in our IPO, as well as our investment in CDW UK. In fact, he spent 18 months in London when he assumed the role of CFO International. Prior to joining CDW, Collin held a number of senior finance roles at PepsiCo. Ann, you've been a great partner, and on a personal note, great friend. Thank you. You will be missed, but you've left us in good hands with Collin. You'll be hearing from Collin on our next earnings call in early 2018. With that, let me turn it over to Ann who will share more detail on our financial performance. Ann? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our third quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of product offerings, and variable cost structure. They also reflect the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver low-double digit constant-currency earnings per share growth, and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to our P&L if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 7. Consolidated net sales were $4 billion, 8.8% higher than last year on a reported basis and 10.5% higher than last year on an average daily sales basis. Average daily sales were $64 million. On a constant-currency basis, consolidated net sales were 10.4% higher than last year. Currency impact was slightly positive this quarter, adding roughly 10 basis points to growth as improvement in translation of the Canadian to U.S. dollar more than offset likely unfavorable translation of the British pound to U.S. dollar. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales were up 2.6% versus Q2 2017, which was higher than last year. Gross profit for the quarter increased 4.5% to $642 million. Gross margin in the third quarter was 15.9%, 70 basis points lower than last year. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of both hardware rate and mix on product margin, which more than offset the impact we saw from netted down revenues. Turning to SG&A on slide 8; consolidated reported SG&A including advertising expense was roughly 6% higher than last year. Reported SG&A also includes $10 million of equity-based compensation and a one-time $4.1 million expense related to the reinstatement of prior year's unclaimed property balances due to a retroactive Illinois state law change. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising increased 5%. It's reflected both the benefit of sales compensation bearing in line with gross profits and the expected impact of one fewer selling day on expenses. Coworker count was up roughly 200 since year end 2016 to more than 8,700. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $324.3 million, up 4.5%. This delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8%, down 40 basis points from last year. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 9, interest expense was $37.8 million, essentially flat compared to last year's Q3 level. Turning to taxes, GAAP taxes were $77 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.5% compared to 36.5% tax rate in the third quarter of 2016. The increase in effective tax rate is the result of a change in Illinois state tax rates and lower tax benefits related to equity-based compensation. On a GAAP basis, we earned $129 million of net income. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance, was $168 million in the quarter, up 4.9% over last year. As you can see on slide 10, non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add backs that fall into four general buckets; the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and other non-recurring or infrequent income or expenses. Tax adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP net income include tax-affecting add-backs at 36% and the reversal of the excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation, as well as other minor adjustments detailed in the reconciliation provided in our press release. With Q3 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 156 million, we delivered $1.08 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 10.8% over the prior year. There was a de minimis currency impact on EPS. Turning to first nine months' results on slide 11; revenue was $11.4 billion, an increase of 8.2% on a reported basis. There were 191 and 192 selling days in the first nine months of 2017 and 2016 respectively. On an average daily sales basis, net sales growth versus the first nine months of 2016 was 8.8%. On a year-to-date basis, currency shaved roughly 50 basis points of growth. Gross profit during the first nine months of 2017 was $1.8 billion, up 4.9%. Gross profit margin was 16.2%, down 50 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $888 million, 5.3% above the first nine months of 2016. Net income was $328 million for the first nine months of 2017, and non-GAAP net income was $453 million versus $429 million in 2016, up 5.6%. Non-GAAP EPS growth was 10.7%. On a constant-currency basis, non-GAAP net income growth would have been roughly 50 basis points higher or 11.2%. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 14; on September 30, we had $98 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3.3 billion as compared to $3.1 billion at September 2016. Given the combination of accelerating hardware sales growth and strategic stocking positions, we drew down our revolver in the quarter. Our cash plus revolver availability was just over $940 million. Reflecting this, our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ticked up 1/10 versus the second quarter and was flat versus Q3 last year at 2.9 times, within our target range of 2.5 to 3 times. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.2%, 10 basis points below last year due to the term loan re-pricing and note refinancing we completed in Q1. Roughly 95% of our outstanding U.S. debt remains either fixed rate or hedged. As you can see on slide 15, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q3. For the quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 19 days, up one day from last year's third quarter and within our annual target of high teens to low 20%s. Year-over-year, DSO increased four days, while DPO increased three days. Cash taxes paid for the quarter was $73.1 million and cash interest was $42.5 million. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement less capital expenditures was a positive $85 million compared to $138 million in Q3 2016. Quarterly free cash flow was impacted by acceleration in our sales growth, strategic stocking positions and mixing into sales to government customers, which are typically slower payers. For the first nine months of the year, free cash flow was $339 million, $158 million than last year's first nine months. Recall that one-time items possibly influenced free cash flow in 2016. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and repurchased 2.8 million shares for $175 million at an average cost of $62.13 per share. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you can see on slide 16; first, to increase our dividends annually. To guide these increases, in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For the quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.21 per share on December 31 to shareholders of record as of November 24, up 31% from a year ago. Our dividend is nearly five times our initial annual level of $0.17 per share at our IPO in June of 2013. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended Q3 at 2.9 times. Third, supplement organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. At the end of September, we had $858 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation priority supports our 2016 to 2018 medium-term targets, which you can see on slide 17. These are to grow in constant currency 200 to 300 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market with a target adjusted EBITDA margin in the high 7% to 8% range, maintain our net leverage ratio between 2.5 and 3 times, and deliver low double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. As Tom indicated, we expect to deliver full-year non-GAAP net income per share growth in constant currency at the midpoint of our medium-term target of low double-digit growth, which we define as 10% to 12%. Keep in mind that we hold ourselves accountable for achieving our medium-term targets on an annual, not on a quarterly basis. Let me provide you with a few additionally comments for those modeling the rest of our 2016 financials. I'm on slide 18. Given performance in the first nine months of the year, we now expect to outgrow the market by more than 400 basis points, likely between 425 basis points and 450 basis points. We have one more selling day in Q4 2017 versus Q4 last year, so reported sales growth will be higher than average daily sales growth in the fourth quarter. We have the same number of selling days for the year. We currently look for currency headwinds to come in lower than our previous estimate at an annual average rate of roughly 20 basis points for 2017. This assumes translation rates of $0.80 to the Canadian dollar and $1.30 to the British pound in the fourth quarter. In Q4, we expect positive currency translation impact of about 70 basis points. Given current expectations that hardware growth will continue to outpace the impact of netting down for the remainder of the year, we continue to look for our annual adjusted EBITDA margin to come in at the low end of our target range. We expect depreciation and amortization to continue at a similar rate as Q3 at roughly $66 million per quarter, $46 million of which is for purchased intangibles. With the acceleration of sales throughout 2017, we now expect total annual book interest expense to be roughly $151 million, $1 million higher than our previous estimate. We continue to expect our GAAP tax rate to ramp up as we move through the year. Due to higher-than-anticipated benefits relating to the vesting of equity compensation, we now expect our full-year effective GAAP tax rate to be between 32% and 33%. Note that we have not assumed any reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. Our lower effective tax rate primarily relates to the favorable impact of recording excess tax benefits related to equity compensation. Q4 equity-based compensation is expected to be slightly below 2016 levels. Remember, since we add back these expenses for non-GAAP net income, the tax benefits will be excluded from our non-GAAP net income. Our all-in non-GAAP income tax rate is expected be roughly 37% for the full year. As we have achieved our annual target level for share repurchases in the first nine months of the year, average shares outstanding in the fourth quarter will be roughly the same level as in the third quarter. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling our cash flows. First, we continue to expect our annual cash flow to come in within our enhanced rule of thumb of 3% to 3.5% of net sales. As you will recall, in 2016 we delivered free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, well above this target, primarily due to the one-time benefit of extending a key partner to longer payment term. Second, our capital expenditures will be about 0.5% of net revenues on an annual basis. We also expect to deliver cash conversion cycle within our enhanced target range of high teens to low 20%s. For the full year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 30% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which approximately $46 million per quarter. In addition, we continued to pay approximately $20 million in tax annually related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. Cash taxes will be lower in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to tax deductions from discrete items related to equity and deferred compensation payout. That concludes the financial summary. Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to take a moment for a few thank-yous myself. First, thank you, Tom. It's been a pleasure working alongside you for the past 10 years. I'd also like to thank my team. My time at CDW has been some of the most rewarding of my career, due in large part to the talented team I have worked with, including, of course, Collin. Finally, let me thank many of you on this call. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time interfacing with the financial community. With that, let's open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions one question and one brief follow up? Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Operator : Thank you. Once again, we ask that you have one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, Tom. Obviously, there's been renewed talk around corporate tax reform coming out of Washington. Just curious if that started to have any impact on your customer spending plans? And if at all, that anticipation is set into some of the accelerating revenue growth you've seen so far this year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Matt, I would say, I don't think it's been a major factor. I think, like me, many of my peers look at it as something we would like to happen, but we're not spending that buck yet. So, I think more so what's happening, Matt, is a general overall increase in confidence about the economy and where it stands going forward. Now I guess you could indirectly relate that to the potential for tax reform, but I think that's more of what we're feeling is just, as I said, a more vibrant economy and people are moving forward with projects, as you heard Chris alluded to. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then as a follow-up, you spent some time on this in the prepared remarks, but international continues to significantly outpace the wider business. So, can you just talk a little bit more about what's driving the continued strength there? And just how you're thinking about the opportunity to expand beyond the UK and Canada over time? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'm going to let Chris take a run at that since she had a lot to do with the success of the international team. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. I'd say there's a lot of things contributing to the performance of international. As you've heard Tom mention on past calls, some of the programmatic approaches that we've brought to the UK and the prescriptive approaches we've taken have done some good things. Some marketing investments we made to bring the orchestration campaign over there, the success in the referral model. We've done a lot of work around that go-to-market and referral model, and we're seeing great strength there. And then we also have an international team sitting there in the UK working on not just UK work, but also opportunities outside of the UK. So it's really what I call a confluence of events. It's focus on that team, it's the collaboration between the U.S. and the UK team, and just a real focus on what we need to do for our global customers. And I would also say that our partners that we're working with have been very collaborative and cooperative in helping us achieve a seamless experience for our customers as well. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Amit. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. I guess a couple of questions for me, too. Maybe start off with on the gross margin line. I think it was down like 70 basis points year-over-year, and you just talked about competitive dynamics and hardware mix. I'm wondering could you just talk about maybe help us understand which was the bigger driver in the quarter year-over-year at least for the competition or the hardware mix? And is the competition really all on the hardware side or is it more broad-based across the portfolio? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well let me talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, and then I'll have Ann give you a little more clarity, Amit. I would say if you look at it, as I said, one of the things to keep in mind, it is amazing how consistent this year looks compared to what we experienced in 2014. In fact, even from a gross margin tracking through the year and that was the time and we had the big hardware refresh of client devices because of the Windows XP expiration. So we are experiencing almost exactly the same thing, and that had one impact. The second thing is, as you heard, we've had this constant increase of what I'll call solution performance as we've marched through the year, and a lot of that has been hardware refreshing of the data center. So just in general, those two things create what I would call the margin pressure. The competitive landscape hasn't changed dramatically through the year. It feels intensely competitive, and in our case, I know we've walked away from deals that just look like they're not worth making the investment of resources because of what the customer feels like they can get in the marketplace. And I love that discipline about us. I'll let Ann add any additional commentary. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah. The only additional point I'd make is that last year we saw significant benefit from the \"mix\" into netted down items. We did not add \u2013 if you look at last year's Q, we quantified that at roughly 30 basis points. We did not have that impact this year. So it's the absence of that mix, if you will, which you see when you see our hardware sales accelerate across both the transactional and the solutions business. So that would be the single largest driver, and then you have mixing rate as well. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Just a really interesting fact. If you look at the netted down revenue growth, it was as strong, almost literally as strong, this year as last year, and you just heard Ann talk about the fact that the growth was pretty strong in netted down revenues. It just couldn't offset this tidal wave of hardware growth we've had going on in the business. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's really helpful. By the way, I guess maybe, Tom, just to follow that up, how sustainable do you think this hardware growth is as you go forward? I know it sounds like December quarter will be another good quarter for hardware. But broadly, do you think this sustains into early to mid-2018? Especially as you get the server refresh cycle going, which is a one part I think you mentioned that hasn't grown very well the server hardware side. So maybe just talk about the sustainability of this as we go forward. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So I think, let's break into pieces. So the client refresh, we're into the third or fourth quarter. If you look back, just history repeats itself, in 2014 it kind of was a four-quarter refresh. So I don't have clairvoyance on this, but I would say we probably are in the seventh phase inning, as you guys like to ask about that part of it. I think in hardware side, if you look at the hardware side of solutions, and the one thing I'll say, Amit, is the server solutions business, which includes the software and the warranties, has continued to have a pretty good steady-eddy kind of growth trajectory. I would say if the marketplace and the economic perspective stays as vibrant as it has been, then I think we can expect that hardware refresh to continue. Although again, if I look at 2014, it was amazing that the flip happened sometime into the next year where then the solutions and some of the things Ann talked about, which was the netted down software, seems to then surpass hardware from a growth perspective. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. That's it for me. And best of luck, Ann. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Baird. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Jayson. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Hello. And, Ann, my congratulations too. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I wanted to ask on economics. Tom, I think you mentioned this in the prepared remarks, that we hear \u2013 generally hear smaller partners saying things have gotten tougher. But a lot of times larger partners say that services side of the business has created opportunity, investment and opportunity. But I'd like to hear you talk about economics to CDW and if there's been a change there. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Let me make sure I understand, Jayson. Are you talking about just the services business generally in the marketplace? Because if you are, I would say that the change of the IT consumption model and how people are preferring to consume IT is continue to provide, if you will, increased services opportunity. You can see that in our cloud business, the success of our cloud business and our, what I'll call, more professional services business. I'm not sure I know if that's the connection though you're making to the economics. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Have your vendor partners put incremental pressure on the hardware side of the business and is services offsetting that? Or ... Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. I would tell you, we talk about this a lot. They're doing what we would do if we were in that place, which is as you move through the cycle of products, you continue to shift where you motivate people to spend their time to those products that are new and strategic to your business. And it's incumbent among people like CDW to anticipate where they're headed and then, if you will, go find the cheese. And so we've been pretty good at staying ahead of where they're asking us to go relative to their new capabilities. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks for that. And a follow-up on fed. Mid-teens growth is strong where some others have struggled. I think client devices played a role there. Any other color you would add for fed? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I'll take a shot at it and then let Chris give you any extra color. I'd say your instincts are right that the client device driven by a combination of the large orders we've been talking about all year and even though you didn't ask, somebody will. So I'll \u2013 about 80% of those are now out the door. So we have 20% left. And then I think the federal government Windows 10 mandate really has driven a lot of the activity. But it wasn't just that group that did well. I would say collaboration, services or other areas that did well in the federal government. So it's been really nice balance. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just question again on the gross margin. In your commentary you talked about vendor rebate programs not really impacting the margins. But some of your competitors and distributors have talked about a lot of program changes with some of the big hardware vendors, which are putting pressure on margin. And it sounds like you're managing that pretty well. What's the difference between what you folks are seeing and how you manage it versus perhaps others? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Matt, I'll tell you, I don't really know what others do. So it makes it hard for me to comment on that aspect of it. I think the one thing that I would tell you is we have a mindset that, look, they're going to change every quarter. They're going to change every period. And that doesn't mean that all these changes are lay-ups. It does mean that you've got to try to stay ahead of them when it comes to where they want you to spend their time. So I don't want to suggest that we aren't experiencing the same changes. I think the word that I tried to use was we've been able to kind of not have a meaningful impact of those changes relative to where we spend our time. And that's part of, I think, the art, if you will, of this is assessing the changes and in assessing where you need to make sure your resources are focused so that you take as much advantage of the changes as you possibly can. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And just on the head count, which I know was up 200 or so, what's left in terms of the expansion plans for coworkers? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'm sorry, Matt. We're going to \u2013 let's make sure I'll answer it the way I think you asked the question is, the \u2013 on the customer facing, it's about 130, right? And I think Ann alluded to in the aggregate, it's in the 200 range, so. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I think Tom's number is year-over-year and mine was year-to-date. Mine includes total coworkers, right? Remember, roughly two-thirds of our coworker count is customer facing with the remainder being as we refer to it as backbone. So my number was total. But on the customer facing, as Tom said, roughly where we sit today plus or minus 10%. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So \u2013 okay, that's fine. Okay. That's it for me. Thanks very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for the questions. A lot of your vendor partners are talking about a shift back from public cloud to hybrid strategies. Just curious if that's something that you're seeing in your customer base. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: The reason I'm laughing is because this pendulum just kind of swings back and forth and back and forth. Here's what I would say, Katy. I think from \u2013 if you have the lens on of a customer that they have been pretty consistent as they kind of march down the evolution of the data center. The workloads that lend themselves, as you well know, to public cloud are going there. But I think the success of what I'll call the on-prem response, be it converged infrastructure or hyper-converged, has made the decision even more \u2013 needing to be more thoughtful because now you have some on-prem solutions that provide the economics, the flexibility. And in the end, I think the customer wins because they sit there and say, I have the ability to go workload by workload and decide what makes best for us. And I think you saw some of that. If you just look at our overall success in converged and hyper-converged, clearly, you have customers that are excited about that technology. But on the other hand, you heard me talk about how great our cloud growth is going, so I think it's just the pendulum swinging back and forth. I don't know that I'd call it dramatic, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful color. And congrats on the retirement. Quick question for you. You talked about the revolver is higher on the back of hardware growth and also some stocking of inventory. Can you just talk about where that inventory stocking is happening? And is that just an outlook into the fourth quarter? Or is that a longer-term bet? Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Actually on the inventory, we took some strategic stocking positions in the third quarter in anticipation of price increases across those product categories. So I don't want to be specific on the product categories, but we saw the opportunity and potentially there could be opportunities in Q4 as well. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Katy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hi, Sherri. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. How are you, Tom? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good, thanks. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. So the revenue growth continues to be very strong, and you guided the revenue growth higher yet again this quarter. But it seems like the EPS growth is dissimilar (49:16) guidance, so maybe I'm sort of nitpicking and maybe there's another percent of growth in the EPS and we're at the higher end of the 10% to 12% versus the lower end last quarter. But could you maybe talk about some puts and takes that are giving you as much leverage to deliver that revenue growth down to the bottom line? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Wow. There's a lot in that one. So, I would say if you kind of go back to what's driving the growth. Again, I think it's always important to look at, at least at a company like CDW, the source of the growth. And I'll contrast it with last year where you had a lot of growth in netted-down revenues, software assurance, warranty, where you just have less of a cost of goods sold because you're not buying. And so it creates what I'll call a richer flow through, if I can say it that way. But it does, as we all spent last year talking about why the top line was pressured, it was because of that netted down. This year, you just have kind of, I'll use Chris' word, the confluence of the client refresh, which in general has a lower margin than some of the richer solutions and netted-down services has been driving a lot of the top line. And so that gives you less that kind of drops down through. Now what helps us is then one of the things I love is the beauty of this model where the sales compensation literally follows where the gross profit is, and enables us to make sure we can deliver on our adjusted EBITDA targets going forward, is kind of part of the way this model moves forward as we go through the year. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the Education piece, it seems like the growth slowed, you guys have seen some very strong growth over the past couple of quarters. Is that just sort of anniversarying some better growth and some better sales trends there? What are you thinking about going forward? Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'm going to let Chris kind of walk you through because it is in some ways the tale of two cities. When you think about Education, it's kind of the opposite of what Education was growing like in previous years. So go ahead, Chris. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Yes. Hi, Katy (sic) [Sherri] (51:29). When you look at Education overall, at 6% growth, we had some solid growth led really by Higher Ed in the high teens. But if we look at K through 12, some of the tailwind from the digital testing mandate and the eRate funds, we didn't experience. And we expected that. And so I'd say about K through 12 is we're in a bit of a transition, moving away from digitizing devices. And that's really moving into more of a maintain-and-refresh cycle. And we're moving towards the classroom of the future which, as you know, is a combination of technology and reconfiguring classroom layouts. So we've already seen some nice uplift in collaboration and video, and we'll look to continue to help our K-12 customers on this, I'll call it, a transformational journey to the classroom of the future. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, Chris. And good luck, Ann. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Keith. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning, guys. And, Ann, congratulations on the retirement as well. Great news. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thanks. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : If we could just explore a little bit more on the government side of the business. I understand that it's going through the Windows 10 migration here. And I guess first question there is how long, perhaps, would we expect that to last? But with the exception of the fourth quarter last year, the Government segment really has grown tremendously for you guys over the past three years. So if you guys could provide a little bit of color there. Is it a matter of taking share? Because I mean, certainly we haven't seen the federal budgets increased by the amount that you guys have been able to grow that business. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes, Keith. First, I want to make sure that we don't miss the pretty sustained excellent performance by the state and local part of the Government team. They had another double-digit quarter, and that's kind of become a long history of performance there. And a lot of that was tied to the solutions we've built around public safety and what it's \u2013 the value it's adding to state and local, as well as some of the larger contracts that we've been able to capture over the last couple years because of those solutions. So when you're thinking about Government, make sure you're always, at least in CDW's case, thinking about both state and local and federal. And then I'll let Chris give some color on federal. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Yes, on the federal side, we grew mid-teens. We did see some nice growth there. And while we did have some uplift from the DoD Win 10 mandate and also the remaining client devices from last year, we also saw some good strength around the strategic program alignment activities that we had, so I don't want to miss that kind of base activity on the programs that we implemented several years ago. So net-net, I would say, yes, it does feel like we are taking share. We felt the normal budget flush and on the DoD, in terms of timing, I think you asked that, that mandate is for January 31, 2018 right now. That could change, but that's what we know right now. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. Thanks. And if I could just turn my focus over to the SMB. At the beginning of the year, you guys kind of carved out SMB to be a new focus, and I guess any progress in terms of how you think that's progressing? Obviously it's been growing well, but it's in line (54:50) with the rest of the business. Are you satisfied with how it's growing in the trajectory (54:54) time now? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, I am. I mean, if Doug wants to grow 12% every quarter, I'll be satisfied till the cows come home. So that part of it, mission accomplished. I think they're just now kind of evolving their technical support, so we are looking for increased solution performance as we kind of go forward. But like anything for us, our breadth and scale enables us to focus on either products and/or segments and when we get that kind of focus, we generally get good performance. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review : Good morning. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, David. David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review : Looking at Healthcare, you said that it was around flat for the quarter and that some transactional activity was pushed through. What are you seeing deeper now that there has been two unsuccessful attempts to repeal Obamacare and if this cycle continues to push out? Or do you think this is an inflection point where customers are going to start reinvesting? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Look, this is Chris, and I would say really hard to say. What's happened is it's even more uncertainty, and the uncertainty is continuing regarding insurance coverage and reimbursement. And that's particularly impactful on the larger hospital systems where we have a larger share of the market. So while we have had some success delivering what they are buying, which is client devices, it feels like we just need to hang with these customers until they get better visibility to the income streams, and then we will be preparing to help them with their deeper technology solutions. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: But it remains lumpy, my favorite economic description. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: (56:48). Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. And I think it's going to stay that way until we get some clarity. David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review : All right, thank you. And then you mentioned Brexit not impacting your European results yet. Is there any quantification that you've made as far as how much you think it will impact, and when you expect to see that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: We have done multiple scenarios, everything from a soft Brexit to a hard Brexit, each of them has different implications, but at this point I don't know that it's \u2013 that there is really anything other than scenario planning, because we've got to wait until get to the details. I will tell you, and I think Chris would share this. We have been not only pleasantly but incredibly surprised by the UK's ability to kind of continue to focus on their customers and meet their needs in light of the Brexit overhang. David M. Stratton - Great Lakes Review : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you, good morning. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hi, Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to ask about international in terms of what do you see looking ahead, Tom, in terms of the customers that inspired you to make the move a few years ago. Are they asking you for two, for that expansion to continue beyond Europe or within Europe deeper, but also beyond Europe? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: You know, Mark, that's a good question. Let me go back to a little bit of the history of what they did tell us. Part of the discussion was we need you to help us in other parts of the world. And recognizing that it would be hard with a diverse set of customers to match everywhere they wanted us to be, so they said look, over time, you need to be able to get to, I forget the number, north of 70% or something in that range, of the locations. And so then we looked at, well, where is the majority of their spend today and a majority of their spend today is in Western Europe. So that really is what drove looking and finding fortunately what we call CDW UK today. The one thing that was appealing to us about their approach to the market was that while their base business was headquartered in London, they have this hub and spoke approach where they had field sales offices in other parts of the world. And they had these existing third-party relationships, which in essence gives them a distribution channel themselves to extend where customers need us to go. So, Mark, in a long-winded way, I think we have the platform, would be the way I would say it, to meet customer needs today and tomorrow as they increase. Having said that, we're always going to look for are there places across the world that can enhance our performance of that platform. But the platform today is set up to be successful, and we're going to continue to focus on that. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And then speaking of that platform, I was just kind of curious if CDW is benefiting from consolidation in terms of your larger customers out there. Are they consolidating the number of bars and services and solutions providers they work with just to make things more efficient and agile going forward? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Thanks. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Before you answer that, I do want to also extend my congratulations to both you and Ann for having a sterling run here pre and post-IPO. It's really nice to see from the sidelines the consistent focus on operational and strategic excellence. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thank you, Mark. Ann E. Ziegler - CDW Corp.: Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thank you. So thank you for asking the second part of the question, because I should've said that in the first part of the answer, which is one of the things that they said to us. And I say this partially tongue-in-cheek was, we love you CDW, but we don't want to love six or seven of you all over the world. So to the degree you can't help us with our international needs as we try to slim down the number of people we deal with, you're going to put your business at risk. So your instinct was right on relative to what they at least shared with us and was one of the motivating factors for us to look aggressively from an international perspective. Operator : Thank you. I show no further questions, so I'd like to turn the conference back over. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Look, as always, thank you for your questions and your time this morning. Let me once again thank Ann for her partnership. And I'll leave you with this. For those of you that have been investing in your children's health by eating their Halloween candy, I would say shame on you. And you better get back in the gym because Thanksgiving's coming soon. All right, thanks, everybody. See you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. So with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. 2017 was a year of both strong financial performance and strategic progress. For the year, reported net sales increased 8.7%. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 8.9%. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 6.1%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11.7%. We also delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter. Reported net sales increased 9.9%. We had one extra selling day in the quarter versus last year, so average daily sales increased 8.2%. Average daily sales on a constant currency basis increased 7.5% as translation tailwinds added roughly 70 basis points to growth. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.7%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 14.7%. Our strong 2017 performance was driven by the combined power of our nimble business model, diverse product suite, and balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Let me briefly walk through each of these and how they contributed. First, our nimble business model. This enables us to pivot to capture growth opportunities. In 2017, we were very successful in addressing four customer trends. Renewed confidence in the economy drove the first trend, customer focus on hardware. This was in contrast to 2016 where economic uncertainty led customers to focus on extending the lives of their existing assets and incrementally adding capacity, resulting in depressed hardware sales. In 2017, as expected, this trend reversed. Hardware growth meaningfully accelerated, coming in at 8%, more than double last year's 3% growth. 2017 was clearly a client refresh year with Client Devices increasing mid-teens. This reflected success meeting overall refresh needs as well as addressing the Department of Defense mandate to upgrade to Win 10 to strengthen its security posture. The second trend, focused on security, has been ongoing, driven by customers' goals to have the most secure IT possible in the marketplace. Our security practice maintained excellent momentum throughout the year, posting another year of significant double-digit increases. We have one of the broadest portfolios in the industry with solutions across multiple platforms, cloud, hardware, software and services, from more than 60 partners. The third ongoing trend, adopting more flexible architectures, is all about handling growth efficiently. Here we continue to see two key areas of customer focus : first, hyperconverged, which delivers more density at lower cost; and second, solutions delivered via the cloud. In 2017, sales of solutions delivered via the cloud once again increased significant double digits and hyperconverged sales were roughly double 2016's levels. Finally, we saw the ongoing trend where a greater portion of a solution is delivered via software, particularly as more and more of our partners adopt a software-defined strategy. A great example of this is our 2017 double-digit growth in Network Management Software. The second driver of our performance was our diverse product suite of more than 100,000 products from over 1,000 leading and emerging brands which ensures we are well-positioned to meet our customers' evolving needs and market trends. We had balance of growth across our portfolio in 2017 with hardware increasing 8%, software 7% and services 8%. While customer focus was clearly on Client Devices, we also saw double digit growth in video equipment and mid-single digit growth in hardware-based NetComm. Meaningful increases in emerging technologies like flash storage and hyperconverged partially offset declines in more traditional storage and servers. Hyperconverged and flash together represented roughly half of the 2017 Storage revenues. Software growth was driven by double digit growth in both security and network management. Services growth reflected both advanced services and configurations expansion. Turning to the fourth quarter, hardware increased 8% while software and services increased 3%. Client Devices ended the year strong, posting an increase of more than 20%. While written activity was solid in the quarter for solutions, we experienced shortages and logistics issues at the end of the year. These issues impacted the results in three key solution hardware categories : NetComm, storage and servers, with all three posting declines. We expect these issues to be reversed in the first half of 2018. While difficult to control or predict, we believe there were additional actions we could have taken as a leadership team to minimize this impact. Fourth quarter software performance continued to be fueled by security and network management. Meaningful gains and netted down categories compressed top line growth. You see the impact of that in our gross profit from software which grew high-single digits, roughly three times as fast as net sales. Services' modest growth reflected the absence of strong warranty growth we saw in last year's fourth quarter. The final driver of our performance was the power of our balanced portfolio of end markets. With five U.S. channels each over $1 billion in 2017 net sales and an additional $1 billion-plus from our UK and Canadian operations, our diverse end markets helped us absorbed macro and exogenous impacts on the business. Chris will review the full year and fourth quarter performance. Chris? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Performance was balanced across our segments in 2017, with Corporate up 8%, Public up 8% and Small Business up 9%. Our combined UK and Canadian operations had an exceptional year, posting 15% growth in U.S. dollars. Each grew mid to high-teens in local currency. Corporate's growth reflected increased confidence in the economy, which drove mid-teens growth in Client Devices as well as mid-single digit growth in NetComm and software. Our focus on Small Business and the creation of a standalone segment paid off in 2017. Small Business growth was driven by double-digit increases in client and high-single digit increases in video. Public had double-digit growth across both our government and education channels, while healthcare struggled throughout the year and ended slightly down. Government growth was balanced across both federal and state and local. State and local continued to benefit from new contracts as well as success delivering public safety solutions. Federal growth was fueled by Client Devices, reflecting our success helping agencies meet the Department of Defense mandate to move to Win 10 by January 2018. Higher Ed grew mid-teens, reflecting their excellent success delivering networking solutions to meet the ever-growing demands of multiple end user devices across campuses, delivering more than 20% growth in networking. K-12 increased mid-single digits driven by success in implementing collaborative learning environments and delivering networking solutions. Our segment performance was balanced in the fourth quarter as well. Corporate and Small Business both increased 6%, while Public increased 7%. Strong growth in government, which increased 7%, and education, which increased 8%, was partially offset by health care, which declined 5%. Our international business had another excellent quarter with both the UK and Canada growing high-teens or better in U.S. dollars. And both operations grew double-digits as well in their local market as they gained share and out-executed their competitors. In addition to out-executing in their local market, CDW UK is growing its international business. You'll recall that we acquired CDW UK in August 2015. The objective was to acquire the ability to serve our U.S.-based customers' international needs. In 2017, we doubled the size of our dedicated international selling team and generated more than $100 million of customer spend in cross-referrals from the U.S. to the UK and the UK to the U.S., up from $75 million in 2016. In 2015, roughly 10% of CDW UK's customer spend came from outside the UK. Today, it is more than 20%. In addition, 14 out of the UKs top 20 customers were both U.S. and UK customers. The programs we have put in place to drive international success are clearly paying off. That wraps up the quick summary of customer end market performance. Tom? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Chris. 2017 was a year of both financial and strategic progress driven by our competitive advantages. One of our competitive advantages is our deep customer knowledge, with more than 250,000 customers across a variety of end markets. A key area of focus for us in 2017 was leveraging this knowledge using our data analytics team. This focus drove excellent results in all three of our strategies. Let's take a quick look at a few examples of this at work. For our first strategy, to capture share and acquire new customers, our data sciences team married our rich customer data with artificial intelligence to drive productivity and created AMANDA, our automated assistant for account managers. AMANDA takes administrative tasks like fulfilling requests for quotes and providing order status information off of an account manager's plate. In 2017, we also leveraged our deep customer data and data sciences capabilities to drive our second strategy, which is to enhance our solutions capabilities. A great example of this is the sales enablement tool we developed to drive growth in hyperconverged infrastructure. Here, our data and analytics team created a proprietary model based on 800 customer attributes to identify targets with the highest propensity for hyperconverged infrastructure to be a good fit. We've seen excellent traction with the model as evidenced by our nearly-100% growth in 2017. Finally, for our third strategic priority to expand our service capabilities, we built our services recommendation engine, which uses data analytics to identify and recommend to our sellers the services, both professional and managed, that are best for a variety of solutions across hardware, software and cloud. For example, if the seller is preparing a proposal for a networking solution, the services recommendation engine sees this and recommends the appropriate warranty and maintenance services to the seller. The engine also provides a price quote, so the seller can immediately make the recommendation to the customer. Leveraging our competitive advantage is a key way we win in the market. Of course, we also invest in coworkers, as well as add new partners to win in the market. In 2017, we added more than 80 new partners, many in high growth areas like endpoint security, video and cloud. We also added 125 customer-facing coworkers in 2017, with half in technical roles, solutions architects and service delivery engineers that support our sellers. Coworker productivity was also strong for the year. Let me close with a few thoughts about how we will continue to win in the market and what we expect for 2018 and 2019. We are cautiously optimistic that U.S. GDP will grow in line with current forecasts in the mid to high-2% range for 2018 and currently look for the U.S. IT market to grow in the 3% range. Right now, 2018 feels like a more normal spending environment, much like 2015 after the 2014 client refresh. For CDW UK and Canada, we currently expect IT growth in local currency for both markets to come in below the U.S. in the 1% to 2% range. We continue to expect top line performance between 200 to 300 basis points better than the U.S. IT market in constant currency. Given our outlook for market conditions, we currently look to add around 100 to 125 new customer-facing coworkers in 2018. As we always do, we will refine our views of market growth and hiring as we move through the year. These expectations will drive our top line performance. Of course, as you know, tax reform will drive a onetime step-up in our net income. Keeping with the spirit of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we're going to invest a portion of the step-up in two areas : our coworkers and our strategy. For our coworkers, we are making a one-time coworker equity grant valued at $12 million to all nonexecutive coworkers. Similar to the grant we made at the time of the IPO, the goal is to drive alignment with shareholders further into the organization. In addition to the equity grant, to recognize the critical role they play in delivering exceptional customer service, we're making a $1,000 cash bonus to our hourly and frontline coworkers in all three of our markets : the U.S., the UK and Canada. The remainder of our investments will be directed at strategic initiatives. As you may know, we perform a rigorous detailed strategic plan on a three-year cycle. We are nearing completion of our most recent review, which we call Bold Forward. Of course, for competitive reasons, I won't share the specifics, but expect us to invest in fast-growing areas of business identified in Bold Forward. Investments will occur both in 2018 and in 2019. These 2018 investments will be more than offset by reduced taxes and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to increase in the low to mid-20% range. For 2019, as we overlap the onetime tax reform step-up, we currently look for earnings per share growth of 10% or slightly above with capital allocation fueling the amplification of operating earnings. Of course, tax reform also means drives a meaningful increase in our annual free cash flows. We intend to return incremental cash flows consistent with our capital allocation priorities. Before I turn the call over to Collin, I'd like to thank our coworkers publicly. Our financial and strategic success in 2017 would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated and talented team of more than 8,700 coworkers. Our coworkers are a true source of advantage in a highly competitive market and are a key reason why we are successful delivering industry-leading, profitable growth year after year. And with that, let me turn it over to Collin who will share more detail on our financial performance and implications of both tax reform and some exciting new accounting rules. Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our full year and fourth quarter financial results reflect our nimble business model, breadth of product offerings and balanced portfolio of channels. They also reflect the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow and return cash to our shareholders. Turning to our P&L, if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 7. Fourth quarter net sales were $3.8 billion, 9.9% higher than last year on a reported basis and 8.2% higher on an average daily sales basis. Net sales increased 7.5% in constant currency, primarily reflecting British pound to U.S. dollar translation. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales were down 4.8% versus the third quarter of 2017, more than recent fourth quarter seasonality. Given the sequential strength we saw in Q2 that continued into Q3, this was incorporated into our full year expectations, shared with you on last quarter's call. Q4 gross profit increased 6.3% to $614 million, delivering a gross margin of 16.0%, 50 basis points lower than last year. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of accelerated hardware growth on product margin. Similar to the second and third quarters, hardware mix and rate more than offset the benefit from 100% gross margin items. Turning to SG&A on slide 8, reported SG&A, including advertising expense, was roughly 3% higher than last year and includes $10 million of noncash equity compensation. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising increased 4%. The increase primarily reflected increased sales compensation consistent with gross profit growth, which was partially offset by lower senior management incentive compensation. This reflected a lower payout based on the year-end supply chain challenges which the leadership team felt could have been better managed. Coworker count on December 31 was up roughly 200 year-over-year to just over 8,700. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $297 million, up 8.7%. This delivered a margin of 7.7%, down 10 basis points year-over-year. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 9, interest expense was $37 million, $3 million higher than last year's Q4 level and consistent with our quarterly run rate. The increase primarily reflects the overlap of mark-to-market gains in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our GAAP effective tax rate was a negative 5.7% compared to 36.6% in last year's fourth quarter. This resulted in a Q4 tax benefit of $11 million versus $60 million of expense last year. As you can see on slide 10, the benefit reflected the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, given the adoption date of December 22. This resulted in a positive one-time impact of reducing our deferred tax liability, partially offset by one-time expense related to the foreign income transition tax. With both of these adjustments nonrecurring, the $76 million net benefit was excluded from non-GAAP net income. On a GAAP basis, net income was $195 million. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects operating performance, was $153 million in the quarter, 9% higher than last year. As you can see on slide 11, our after-tax add-backs fall in four general buckets : the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, noncash equity compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and other nonrecurring or infrequent income or expenses, such as this quarter's one-time benefit related to tax reform. Having reached our goal in the third quarter, we did not repurchase any stock in the fourth quarter. With fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 155 million, we delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 14.7% over the prior year. Currency impact on non-GAAP EPS growth was slightly higher than revenue. Fourth quarter free cash flow, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement, less capital expenditures, was $273 million compared to $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year free cash flow was $613 million, $72 million lower than last year. Recall, free cash flow in 2016 was favorably impacted by extending terms with a major partner as well as year-end payment and invoice timing. 2017 free cash flow was 4% of sales, 50 basis points above the high end of our 3% to 3.5% rule of thumb. The over-delivery primarily reflects timing as fourth quarter working capital benefited from mixing into partners with extended terms and lean inventory levels due to December's high sales of Client Devices. Turning to year-to-date results on slide 12, revenue was $15.2 billion, an increase of 8.7% for both reported and average daily sales. On a constant currency basis, growth was roughly 20 basis points higher. Gross profit for the year was $2.5 billion, up 5.3%. Gross profit margin was 16.1%, down 50 basis points primarily due to the impact of hardware rate and mix on product margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion, 6.1% above 2016. Net income was $523 million in 2017, and non-GAAP net income was $606 million versus $569 million in 2016, up 6.5%. Non-GAAP EPS increased 11.7% to $3.83, with similar currency impact as revenue. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 13, on December 31 we had $144 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3.1 billion, compared to $3 billion at year-end 2016. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. Net debt to trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA was 2.6 times, near the low end of our target range of 2.5 times to 3 times. Our current weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.3%, 10 basis points below last year due to the term loan repricing and note refinancing we completed in Q1. Roughly 95% of our outstanding debt is either fixed rate or hedged through 2018. As you can see on slide 14, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during the quarter with our cash conversion cycle at 19 days, flat to last year, and at the low end of our annual target of high-teens to low-20s. Cash taxes paid for the quarter were $106 million, and cash interest was $30 million. Let's turn now to 2018. Before I review our expectations, let me first walk through two key changes impacting our financials : tax reform and the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition. As you know, the impact of the corporate rate reduction on CDW is significant given our mix of U.S. and international operations. However, our rate doesn't decline by 14 percentage points. As you can see on slide 15, the delta between the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate and our expected GAAP tax rate primarily reflects four drivers : state taxes, expanded base, international, and excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation. To get to our expected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26% to 27%, we adjust for taxes consistent with non-GAAP add-backs including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation. We then apply this rate to our non-GAAP pre-tax income. Given tax reform, I thought it would be helpful to walk through how to calculate our non-GAAP pre-tax income. As you can see on slide 16, you can get to this measure starting with either adjusted EBITDA or GAAP pre-tax income. For 2017, our non-GAAP pre-tax income was $958 million, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 36.8%. We provided a more detailed reconciliation in our earnings release. The other key change to our financials is the adoption of ASC 606. As Sari indicated, 2017 results discussed on this call reflect 2017 accounting standards. As of January 1, 2018, we have adopted the new standard ASC 606 under the full retrospective method. Adoption of the new standard results in lower net sales than reported under the prior standard primarily due to the netting down of certain Software categories, mainly Security. Accordingly, 2017 net sales under the new standard were $14.8 billion, $359 million less than previously reported. We provide a comparison of these two standards for 2016 and 2017 on slide 17. Note there is a de minimis change to gross profit in adjusted EBITDA dollars, but the main change is in the margin calculation as the net sales basis lower. It's important to understand that the incremental netting down impact dissipates on margin as you move down the P&L. Please use the new standard as the baseline when you model the business going forward. We posted a deck on our website that provides a more detailed review of the impact of the new standard on our results along with recast numbers by segment. Both the new standard and the change in our effective tax rate influence our 2018 financial targets, which you see on slide 18. Our previous targets were set in place for 2016 through 2018. We are extending our view into 2019 to give you a sense of what to expect when we anniversary the implementation of tax reform and the new standard. There is no change to our target to grow net sales 200 300 basis points above U.S. IT market growth in constant-currency. Given the incremental netting down impact of the new standard on one of our fastest-growing offerings, security software, and moderation in client device growth to the year-over-year comparisons, we expect to be near the middle of the 200 basis point to 300 basis point range. While the new standard increases reported margin from more netted down revenue, it has little impact on the year-over-year margin change. We expect any modest positive mix impact to be mostly offset by continued, albeit slower, growth in client devices in the ongoing competitive marketplace. Prior to the impact of the tax reform investments Tom spoke about, our adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in at the high end of our annual target range of high 7s to 8%. With tax reform investments which are expected to shave off roughly 5 to 10 basis points, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year within our target range. Non-GAAP EPS growth on a constant-currency basis is expected to be in the low to mid-20% range, which we define as 23% to 25%. This assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 26% and 27%. Turning to 2019, we continue to expect to deliver net sales growth of 200 to 300 basis points above the U.S. IT market in constant-currency, with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the high 7s to 8% range. For those of you who have followed us since the IPO, you've seen the evolution of our financial targets. From 2013 to 2015, deleveraging and refinancings amplified operating growth to deliver robust EPS growth. In 2016 and 2017, share buybacks amplified operating growth. In 2018, operating growth will be amplified by tax reform and continuing contribution from share repurchases. In 2019, with the onetime lift from tax reform behind us and approximately 30% of free cash flow going to dividends, we expect 10% or slightly better non-GAAP EPS growth, with capital allocation amplifying operating results. As you can see on slide 19, our expectations for free cash flow have evolved with our targets. Given new lower tax rates, we expect to generate higher free cash flow as a percentage of net sales going forward. In 2018 and 2019, we expect this increase to be approximately 75 basis points, resulting in a new free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of annual net sales. We expect to be at the low-end of this range in 2018, given the 50 basis points of over-delivery in 2017. Timing can impact annual flows, but it tends to even out over multiyear periods. Capital allocation continues to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through returns of capital and strategic investments. As you can see on slide 20, our capital priorities are essentially the same since we instituted them in November of 2014. First, increase dividends annually. We increased our dividend 31% this past November. Recall that in November of 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow within five years. Post tax reform, that represents 30% of a larger number. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. Our target is to generally maintain net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the fourth quarter at 2.6 times. Third, supplement organic growth with acquisitions that add to strategic capabilities. Our CDW UK investment was an excellent example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. At the end of December, we had $858 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. In 2017, we repurchased a total of 8.9 million shares for $534 million at an average cost of approximately $60 per share. Between share repurchases and dividend payments, we returned nearly $650 million to our shareholders in 2017, slightly above our free cash flow for the year because of the excess cash on the balance sheet at the end of 2016. Given 2017's over-delivery of free cash flow as a percentage of sales, we expect to once again deploy more cash than generated. You should expect us to return this cash in order of our capital allocation priorities. Finally, let me provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling the rest of our 2018 financials. I am on slide 21. I will start with the full year and then share some thoughts on inter-year phasing. You have our perspective on adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS from the 2018 annual medium-term targets. Using the bridge on slide 16, to get from adjusted EBITDA to non-GAAP net income, first deduct depreciation and amortization, which excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles. In 2018, we expect total depreciation and amortization to be approximately $8 million higher than 2017 and the amortization of purchased intangibles to be flat year-over-year at roughly $185 million. So depreciation and amortization less the amortization of purchased intangibles is expected to grow approximately $8 million versus 2017. Second, deduct interest expense, which we expect in the range of $156 million to $158 million. For those of you starting with GAAP pre-tax income, noncash equity-based compensation is expected in the mid- to high-$30 millions, down approximately $7 million, year-over-year. We look for a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 26% and 27% in 2018, which you then apply to our non-GAAP pre-tax income to arrive at our non-GAAP net income. Finally, we expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP EPS growth 250 to 300 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Moving to inter-year phasing, we expect to deliver sales roughly in line with our first half/second half historical average split of 48% to 49% and 51% to 52%. Keep in mind that based on the normal rhythm of our business, first quarter sales are typically our lowest dollar amount and sequentially below our fourth quarter. Over the past three years, on an average daily sales basis, the sequential decline has averaged down 9% to 10%. We expect a sequential decline consistent with this range, but it could vary as we work through the supply chain dislocation Tom spoke about. Remember to use average daily sales and the new revenue standard for both periods when calculating sequential growth. Currency tailwinds are expected at an annual average rate of roughly 20 basis points with greater impact earlier in the year. This assumes a translation rate of $0.80 for the Canadian dollar and $1.30 for the British pound. Given the strong Q1 gross margin overlap, 16.6% under the prior standard and 17.0% under the new standard and tax reform investments, we expect this year's Q1 adjusted EBITDA growth to be less than the full year growth. We expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS growth to be within our full year growth range given the benefit of lower Q1 interest expense as lower rates from last year's refinancing did not kick in until Q2 of 2017. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow and phasing can be found on slide 22. That concludes the financial summary. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. We covered a lot today. So in order to make sure we can take questions from as many of you as possible, please limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Operator, please provide the instructions. Thank you. Operator? Operator : . And our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Irvin Liu - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. It's nice to see the continued momentum in the other segment, which has been a pretty good contributor to your overall year-over-year growth profile for the past two quarters. Just longer term, should we view international as a strategic growth driver for your business going forward? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the question. I think that is a fair expectation. That's how we look at it. Ironically, the decision to expand internationally more aggressively was the result of our last three-year cycle of strategy. And after a meaningful forethought about what customers are asking us to do, it continues to be an excellent decision and there's excellent execution. So I think it's fair that that will continue to be a meaningful part of our growth going forward. Irvin Liu - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, you guys talked about reinvestments in strategic initiatives. I wanted to get a sense of where you expect some of the returns on these investments will be reflected. I guess, my question is, longer term, could these reinvestments accelerate your revenue growth beyond your typical 200 to 300 basis point market outperformance expectations? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I was going to say yes until you said, will it go beyond the 200 to 300 basis points? Because I don't know that we have that kind of long-term predictability. But I think it's fair that we would only invest the money in those areas where we see the highest amount of customer demand and, therefore, opportunity for the ultimate purpose of driving both top line and bottom line growth. And as you've seen in the past, there are periods of time when we exceed our own 200 to 300 basis points of share growth and would like to have more of that going forward, for sure. Irvin Liu - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thanks, Tom. That's all I had. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, Tom. So the revenue outlook seems like a bit of a down-tick relative to just how 2017 shook out, both in terms of how you're looking at the market and your expected share gains. Could you just help us understand a little bit more what's driving that and just the biggest moving pieces we should think about year to year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes, Matt. I don't know that I would call it a down take from this perspective. I think we've talked a lot about 2017 was very much like 2014 where you had this kind of exponential tailwind of client growth and it drove hardware. And when you have that kind of client growth, it's highly unlikely you're going to repeat it. I think you heard me even talk about this quarter we had, in some categories of client growth, high teens and over 20% in notebooks, just as one example. So I think in my prepared comments, Matt, I said that I think next year we'll return to a more normal balance in the business, which tends to be more of a balance between solutions and transaction, more of a balance between those products that you heard Collin talk about will be impacted by 606. So you're going to have that amplification of a netting down impact, which is true for a company like CDW, but it doesn't necessarily get reflected that way in the general U.S. IT market growth. So we remain pretty optimistic about this year, based on the momentum we're taking into the first quarter and based on some of the investments we made last year, I think it's just sheerly overlapping that big client impact on top line growth. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then just as a follow-up, you called out in your prepared remarks some shortages in a few key solutions areas. Could you talk a little more about what happened and just help us quantify the impact if at all possible? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, look, I'll give you \u2013 let me answer the last part of the question first and then I'll tell you a little bit about what happened. Our estimate, and again, it's an estimate, you always have at the end of the quarter a flush that goes through. And in most quarters, the majority of that gets shipped and delivered to customers. So in this quarter, we've kind of estimated the impact to be somewhere around $40 million to $50 million of solutions business that we would have expected would have been shipped and delivered to customers and it didn't. And it was a number of factors, Matt. It was some product issues with a couple of our major partners. It was some supply chain issues with a couple of our partners. And while all of those things we don't control, as you heard me say, we're being very transparent. We think we could have done an even better job of managing around those, but the fact of the matter is it had that kind of impact. And I also said, to keep it in perspective, we do think we're pretty confident that stuff's going to flush through during the first half of the year. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Baird. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Jayson. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Good morning. Just to follow up on that last thought. Tom, you mentioned NetComm storage and server. That is a broad range. So we're to assume there were lots of partners here and kind of multiple supply chain issues? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I would say there was more than one and less than five. How's that? Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. You called out client, security, and hyperconverged as three areas of strength. I wanted to jump into one of those, security, an important investment area for CDW and somewhat complicated. I think you mentioned 60 partners. What more can you do there? And how are you investing going forward? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jayson. Look, there is, as you can imagine, kind of an evolving and expanding opportunity with the customers. As they look at everything from building out, what I would describe as holistic security strategy for their business, all the way through the multiple points that you're attempting to protect inside the business, whether it's what I'll call network protection or data management. And the business is expanding to consulting. It's expanding into managed. It's expanding into multiple endpoint kind of capabilities. And so we have continued \u2013 if you followed our growth in that category, it's been meaningful and consistent for a long period of time. And we're going to continue to invest in that area and kind of follow our customers. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks for the color, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Jayson. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, hi. Good morning. Good morning, Tom. Looking at some of your end markets and, as you talked about, the comps are certainly going to be tough this year, particularly in the government area on federal where you talked about that refresh and the DoD with the Win 10 upgrade, is that already flushed out or do you still have some of that in the January quarter? And what are you thinking in terms of government spend this year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, the majority of it, I think, would, to use your term, would be flushed out. I think the Win 10 date was extended to the end of January. But from our perspective, the majority is flushed out. And look \u2013 what do we have? Do we have a budget tomorrow? Right? So maybe I'll have a different answer after tomorrow, Matt. But the other thing that we have seen, at least in my time at CDW, is after you have a refresh year, then customers begin to shift their focus to other parts of their IT infrastructure, whether it's data center, solutions, cloud, security. And what we'll tend to do, then, is follow our customers. And we would expect to see growth in those areas now that they've kind of taken the Win 10 refresh off the table. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just on the lower tax rate, which obviously you're benefiting from, but so are most of your U.S. customers. And have you had or your account managers conversations with customers where they're looking at maybe stepping up IT or CapEx spend because of that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'll tell you what we've seen, Matt. And it may be a little early in the cycle. I think, when I talk to my peers, when I've talked to some of our customers, everybody's in the mode of digesting what I'll call the impact of tax reform and then thinking about where they're going to take the money, either returning it to shareholders, investing in coworkers, or investing in their business. And so I still think we're in the process of the money flowing down to budgets. That's why we're kind of cautiously optimistic that that's going to end up \u2013 and I've seen a couple of surveys where people say they're going to have budgets at least equal to last year. I think we're all hopeful that it will be more than that. But I haven't quite seen that translate from benefit of tax reform to a literal actual budget expansion and people start to spend it yet. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, and good morning. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I just wanted to just start with Tom on the growth premiums specifically. In 2017, CDW obviously outperformed that 200 to 300 basis points growth premium target and I know it's clear you're guiding for this to attenuate into 2018. I'm sure I'm reading too much into this, but just trying to understand why would changing mix away from transactional products and towards solutions in 2018 lower the growth premium or is there an aspect of maybe just being conservative with your outlook? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No, I think the first is it's kind of simple economics, Adam. The client is a hardware play more so and when you sift into solutions, you're shifting into much more of the netted down businesses. And we saw that happen, if you go all the way back to 2016 I think is a good indicator where you had kind of mid-single digits of client growth, kind of a normal business year for us. And then you had pretty good solutions growth, but a fair amount of that got netted down. If you remember, we've had questions about that netting down that impact during that timeframe. It's quite simply that math. Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: And remember, there's some incremental netting down in 2018 that wasn't there in 2017, because of the adoption of 606 and that we're now taking security software in that. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Maybe just a follow up for Collin then. Well, sales growth was I think 10% or so in fourth quarter, gross profit dollar growth was 6%, and for the year gross profit dollar growth lagged sales growth. I know mix was a factor here. You mentioned Bold Forward being focused on investing in fast-growing areas. Is that initiative more focused on revenue growth or gross profit dollar growth? And if it's the latter, when should gross profit dollar growth outpace sales growth? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So the answer, Adam, is it's focused on customers' fast-growing areas which, if you follow the logic, if it's fast-growing and important to customers, it's going to have both revenue and profit growth, because if it's important to them, then it generally has greater value. So that many of the investments you'll see if you looked at our history, if you think about visualizing victory, it was in areas like cloud computing, services expansion, security, collaboration, and Bold Forward will continue to try to identify over the next three to four years those areas like managed services that might continue to be important to our customers. And if those products and services happen to be 606-ified and therefore netted down, we're still going to pursue them, because it's going to be important to customers and then, therefore, generates meaningful profitable growth for CDW. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to some of the reinvestment that you talked about. And I understand you have some onetimers, which are the grants, as well as the cash payment. But when you're talking about investing in the strategic initiatives, just trying to understand how much this is sort of increasing the ongoing level of investment, because you now have savings from tax rate, or are some of those more sort of onetime in nature for 2018? Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Shannon, it's Collin. We quantified the investments in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 basis points of margin or another way to dimensionalize is it is approximately 100 basis points of EBITDA growth. You've pointed out that some of those will be onetime occurring in 2018 and some of the others that I guess what I would call more run rate will get feathered in as we go throughout the year. Now, as we move into 2019, obviously, we'll get a full year's worth of those. So I would think about that 5 basis points to 10 basis points carrying into next year as well. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, I had a question. Tom, you talked a bit about the client business reverting back to sort of normal levels following a pretty strong refresh year. Some of the partners out there have talked about the fact that we're going to be sort of four years past ex the end of life and that there may be some opportunity for upgrade there. I'm curious if you think that most of that has sort of been captured through the Win 10 upgrade or if there is potentially, at least, some tailwinds that could support client when you look at it. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Shannon, I would tell you, look, I just have, quite honestly, a hard time when you talk about high-teens growth in the client business for us for most of the year and it really has been all year. I remember on this call last year collectively you guys saying to me what gave me the confidence we were going to have hardware growth, and it was the kind of knowledge that we were at about a four-year refresh cycle. Look, in some ways, I hope I'm wrong. I'd love to have more client tailwind. I have a tough time seeing it being really a meaningful tailwind in 2018, quite honestly. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : And then if I could just fit one more in. In terms of gross margin for 2018, obviously, you've got some benefit from netted down, but then you're talking that there'll be a little pressure, so I'm curious. Is this more pricing or mix related? Because if client is going to slow, then theoretically margins should see some uptick. So, is there pricing in there? How should we think about it? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. There is some of that. I mean, I think one of the wild cards that I think has been fairly well-discussed is how will participants use the benefits of tax reform. And I think there's a school of thought that some people are going to just use it to have more competitive pricing in the marketplace. And so I think you have to be cognizant that that could happen out there. We're hopeful that as you get a more balanced approach that you'll have some shift into higher-margin products and services, but you have to offset it with some of the competitive actions in the marketplace. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Can you provide a bit of an outlook similar to what you did around the client business in 2018 relative to 2017 as it relates to the potential for some data center refresh, sort of that NetComm, storage, server categories? Are you thinking that you can see some acceleration given the push-out of demand from fourth quarter and as companies shift from client refresh to refreshing other areas of their infrastructure? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I think that's a fair summation, Katy, that we would expect, much like I think I described in the federal government that you're always kind of dealing with, even with tax benefits, a limited budget and people prioritizing what they're going to do based on what's important. And it was clearly a year of a lot of client refresh for a lot of our segments, and we would anticipate that that attention would shift. We're certainly seeing it. If you heard me talk about the momentum we have in hyperconverged and flash and cloud computing and services \u2013 or excuse me, security and services, those areas we would expect to continue to be growth areas as we move into 2018. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just back to some of the exogenous factors that impacted fourth quarter, it doesn't feel like 1Q guidance assumes that all that revenue comes back. Can you just give a little bit more detail around why it's first half and not necessarily first quarter that you capture the revenue from the orders that you didn't ship to in December? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: That's fair. That's fair. I think some of it's because the information we're getting is things might not clear out until the end of the first quarter, which could kind of slip into the beginning of the second quarter. So we were just trying to be transparent with what we're being told relative to kind of clearing out the stuff that didn't get shipped as expected. And some of it was product based, Katy, which has a little different cycle to it when it comes to getting products tested and released the way they were expected. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Katy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Sherri. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Tom. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to ask about the Intel processor issues, and some people have commented that potentially there will be a bit of a \u2013 not really a refresh, but in servers, there might be a bit more demand as some of the fixes slow down the processing. Can you maybe comment on what your customers have said about their concerns about the Spectre and the Meltdown issues, and if there might be a little bit of a boost to server demand this year from that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes, I don't know that there's anything, Sherri, really more revealing than I think everybody's kind of talked about. We did see some pauses and discussions during the fourth quarter about that. Whether or not that plays out into increased capacity beyond what I alluded to in answering Katy's question, I don't know that I could predict that at this point. I think in general, we feel that the solutions part of our business, in particular, some of the data center stuff, is going to have some incremental growth over 2017, in part because people will be reallocating some of the money they spend on client. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Mark. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on what appears to be somewhat conservative guidance for revenue for 2018. How much of that is due to CDW-specific activities in terms of some of the reinvestment to coworkers and new hires? Is there any concern there could be some disruption, or is it more just because of what you said earlier around client, and that's really what it is? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Mark. You broke up a little bit. Let me restate what I think you asked just to make sure I answer the question. I would say our look at the year from a kind of trying to estimate growth driven by GDP, looking at IT growth on top of it, that really didn't have anything to do with where we're investing the money, so to speak, in coworkers. It had more to do with taking a look at that data, coupling it with the baseline of a really exponentially strong year in client growth, added on top of that the 606 impact. When you kind of put all those together trying to give some clarity about what we think is going to happen for this year, that's how we got to the number. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Richards, the Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, everybody, as always, for your questions and the attention to CDW. We appreciate it. We feel good about where we finished 2017 from a full year perspective. I think we could have done some things a little better to make what was a pretty good fourth quarter better and look forward to 2018. And as always, I'll leave you with one inspirational comment as you think about Valentine's Day, dilly dilly. All right. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. And with that let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. We had an excellent start to the year delivering strong top line growth and profitability. Net sales were $3.6 billion up 10.8% above last year, up 9.6% on a constant currency basis. We delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.9%, 10.9% on a currency adjusted basis, and non-GAAP net income per share growth of 41% up 39% after currency. These results include all the delayed shipments related to product shortages and partner process changes that we shared with you on our last call. Excluding these shipments, currency adjusted revenue growth was strong increasing high-single digits. This quarter's excellent performance reflects three key drivers : our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio, and our variable cost structure. Let's look at how these performance drivers help to deliver profitable growth once again this quarter. First, our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets. As you know we have five U.S. sales channels, Corporate, which serves customers with coworkers from generally 250 and up; Small Business, which serves customers with roughly 20 to 250 coworkers; Healthcare, Government and Education each generating annual sales of more than $1 billion. We also have our Canadian and UK operations, which together generated more than $1 billion and $1.5 billion in 2017. Our scale enables us to further segment these channels into customer end-markets and dedicate sellers and technical resources to deeply understand the needs of each market and address their unique customer priorities, because markets often act in a countercyclical way, this segmentation also enables us to mitigate the impact of different macroeconomic and external factors that can impact each of these unique end-markets. Chris will take you through a high-level overview of performance this quarter by each of our channels. Chris? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. The sales team delivered a very strong quarter with increases across all of our U.S. channels and our international operations. In Corporate, sales increased 9%. We continue to see outstanding results from both our category penetration initiatives, which are focused on deepening relationships by expanding the number of products and solutions each customer purchases from us, and also from our ongoing prescriptive book management. A more solid footing in the economy, coupled with rigorous execution of our programs, drove a continuation of the momentum we had in the fourth quarter with customers moving forward with more integrated longer tail projects. We are also seeing nice traction from new customer acquisition programs. Altogether these efforts resulted in strong performance in both solutions and transactions. Small Business increased 12%. Customer confidence remained strong and changes made to our go-to-market strategy continued to gain momentum, driving both transactional and solution sales. We continue to make progress fine tuning our approach to cost-effectively deliver value to Small Business customers including resource allocation and investments in our e-commerce platform, while early our sellers indicated that customers were not yet making decisions based on tax reform in either of our Corporate or Small Business segment. On the Public side of the U.S. business, sales increased 7%. Government was up 12%. Federal's high-single-digit increase reflected ongoing success working with targeted agencies as they move ahead with funded projects as well as the impact of January client device sales to the Department of Defense to meet the security mandate deadline. State and local delivered another quarter of excellent results, up mid-teens, once again driven by new contracts and ongoing success in public safety. Education results were mixed, up 1% overall. K-12 sales were flat on top of last year's mid-teens growth. Client device sales remain under pressure, as schools digest what they have purchased over the past few years and focus on maintaining existing equipment and extend early Chromebooks' lives. The K-12 team continues to make progress helping schools create new learning environment and saw excellent growth in related technologies like collaboration. Higher Ed's mid-single growth reflected ongoing success meeting networking needs as well as the impact of new contracts. These are especially good results given Higher Ed's Q1 2017 performance where they delivered more than 20% growth. Healthcare growth was primarily driven by pent up demand as customers decided to move ahead on purchases that had been put on hold largely in the transactional space. Our international operations had another outstanding quarter, up 31% in U.S. dollars. Both Canada and the UK continue to execute extremely well in markets with each delivering high-teens growth in local currencies. Both teams did a great job capturing share of March fiscal year end buying. Share capture of commercial fiscal year end buying was particularly strong in the UK while capture of public entity spending was strong in both geographies. The Canadian team continues to leverage investments made in solutions. For the fifth consecutive year CDW Canada was named the number one IT solutions provider in Canada. To date, UK is not seeing significant changes in customer buying behavior even with the uncertainty related to timing and terms of Brexit. We saw robust referral business again in the quarter with referrals in constant currencies in the U.S. to the UK increasing more than 50% in the quarter. International capabilities continue to grow in relevance and sales outside of the UK represented a quarter of our CDW UK net sales. Clearly, our efforts to build one company are driving results. Being One CDW is about making it as seamless as possible to work with us wherever you are for our customers, partners, and our sellers. A great example of how being One CDW translated into value for us and our customer is a global client refresh we are providing to a large healthcare company that we won in 2017. Following the merger, the customer wanted to upgrade client devices and peripherals, monitors and accessories in 11 countries including the U.S. Sure we can do that but the sale wasn't only about the hardware, the customer wasn't just buying client devices from us. They were also buying our logistics and service capabilities. Their focus was on using IT to drive their business. They didn't want to be in the logistics business but they needed to procure all the same model custom built-to-order notebooks to image them and then stage and deliver them to more than 25 locations. One CDW could do that for them. The total deal represented nearly 5,000 laptops and peripherals combined and will generate more than $7 million between 2017 and 2018 split roughly 50-50 across the U.S. and the Rest of the World. Importantly, this deal with the services rep generated nice overall margin, that's a great demonstration of the power of One CDW. With that let me turn it back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Chris. Clearly, our sales team success depends on their ability to meet customer needs and that is where you see the impact of the next driver of our results, our broad product and solutions suite. Our ability to meet the total technology needs both integrated solutions and transactional of our customers is one of the fundamental reasons for our consistent performance. This is a key point of differentiation for us in the marketplace. Our products and solution breadth ensures that we always have something we can do to help a customer. First quarter, customer priorities remained similar to what we saw throughout 2017. We saw ongoing focus on datacenter optimization and efficiency, security and the integration of software into solutions as well as the continuation of client device hardware refresh. We saw a strong growth across solutions and transactions with both increasing high-single digits. U.S. hardware increased 8% led by client devices, which increased low-double digits and was above our expectations. Growth was strong across all customer end-markets except K-12. Even excluding the DoD shipments in January, client devices grew high-single digits. In addition to market factors, client device growth benefited from new customer acquisition programs. These programs leverage our unique service offerings, which combine capabilities like buy and hold, staging, and imaging with our broad product portfolio. Video equipment, which includes digital signage and display panels, also increased double digits in the quarter. Data center hardware, which includes server storage and power and cooling increased high-single digits. Customer focus remained on optimizing data center infrastructure with economical yet high-performing solutions. This drove growth in emerging technologies like hyperconverged, which grew more than 70% in the quarter. NetComm hardware also increased mid-single digits. Software increased 10%, growth was driven by three ongoing trends. Software as a Service, which increased more than 50%. Integration of software into solutions, which drove strong network management growth and focus on protecting customer and company data, which led to more than 25% security software growth. Software gross profits grew nearly twice as fast as once again much of the software was delivered as a service. Remember, as a service revenues are netted down for accounting purposes. Services increased 8% driven by warranties and field services, which primarily reflect networking and storage engagements. The final driver of our performance this quarter was our variable cost structure with sales compensation varies in line with gross profits we were once again able to offset the impact hardware sales can have on product margin and delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin above last year's level. Clearly, the ability of SG&A to vary with gross profit is a key contributor to our sustainable profitable growth. Another key contributor to our ability to deliver profitable growth is the ongoing investment we make into our three-part strategy, which is designed to deliver the solutions and services our customers want and need. Today, we are better-positioned more than ever to serve our customers' total IT needs whether in a physical, virtual, or cloud-based environment in the U.S. or internationally. Let me briefly walk through each of these strategies and share a couple of examples of recent investments and how they are contributing to our performance. Our first strategy is to capture market share and acquire new customers. Continuous productivity improvement is key to profitably gaining share. The investment we made in the new residency program we introduced at last year's Analyst Day is a great example of how we do this. In the past, the new seller would spend five months in our sales academy then move directly to their territory sales team. Now after a seller graduates from sales academy, they join our sales residency program where they will work until they graduate on their 24th month with the company. Key to the success of this program is the investment we have made in dedicated sales residency program leaders. Leaders who are accountable for driving incremental prescriptive rigor and leading structured sales and learning activities including one-on-one coaching and developmental reviews. Their measure of success includes acceleration in the rate of growth per seller band, reduced turnover, and increased job satisfaction. In this program's first year, we saw double-digit increases in sales per seller with two years of tenure with the company. Sales continued increases in this quarter coming in at 16%. We have also seen meaningful decreases in attrition in the sub-24 month length of service band, of course, increased sales productivity and lower attrition drive profitable growth. Investments we have made to enhance our solution capabilities, our second strategy, are also driving profitable growth. Over the last two years, net new security and cloud customer-facing coworkers represented more than 10% of the total customer-facing coworkers added. You can see these results of these investments in our security and cloud performance. Once again, security and cloud were our fastest growing solution areas each growing customer spend more than 25%. Our third strategy is to increase our service capability. Today, IT leaders are accountable for both running the business and using technology to drive results. To do both, customers are looking for ways to reallocate resources to areas with a greater strategic value. Having a partner like CDW is a great way for them to achieve this. One of the reasons is the meaningful portfolio of services we've built to complement our menu of products and solutions. Our service offerings include logistics and configuration services for client devices and peripherals as well as solution configurations including racking and storage customization. Services also include advisory, architecture, and managed services which are underpinned by our 24/7 network operating centers. These capabilities are increasingly giving customers the ability to turn over the run it aspect of their IT spend to CDW. One element of our service value proposition to our customers is our ability to be the trusted adviser to help them navigate and then maximize all of the different consumption options that are available to them today in our hybrid IT world. To further drive that value last year we added a new service that we call micro cloud consulting to our portfolio of cloud advisory services. Micro consulting engagements enable customers to get the professional consulting help they can afford in byte size eight-hour increments. While still small our micro consulting practice is growing rapidly. It's a great example of how we are delivering on a key objective of our Small Business go-to-market strategy finding cost effective ways that we can be our customers' outsourced IT expert. Investments large and small continue to drive sustainable profitable growth. Targeted investments in customer-facing coworkers is key to our ability to continue to evolve and maintain this position as the trusted adviser for our customers. During the first quarter, we added 35 customer-facing coworkers on target with the plan we shared with you last quarter that calls for us adding 100 to 125 customer-facing coworkers during 2018. Also during the quarter, we executed on the strategy we shared with you to invest a portion of the one-time step up in net income from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in our coworkers around the world. This included the payment of $1000 bonuses to hourly and frontline coworkers and the $12 million one-time restricted stock grants to non-executive coworkers. The remaining tax reform funded investments we discussed regarding our bold forward strategy are planed over the balance of 2018. Let me leave you with a few comments on the remainder of the year. Clearly, we're off to a great start, given what we are seeing in the market we are cautiously optimistic that demand will remain firm for the balance of the year. And we have increased our view of the U.S. IT market growth. We now expect full year U.S. IT market growth of a little above 3%. We're also increasing our target for outperforming the market to a little above 300 basis points. So, you can see we're in the little above more these days. More than 50 basis points higher than our expectation we shared last call. These expectations recognize our strong 2017 performance and the year-over-year comparisons we faced for both client devices and international. We expect ongoing but moderating strength in client devices driven by both the market and our customer acquisition and service rep strategies that Chris mentioned as well as solid growth in solutions. That said, while we are pleased that the year end supply chain delays will result in the quarter, the potential for additional vendor specific shortages remains a wildcard. Of course, we will continue to refine our expectations as we move throughout the year. Now, let me turn it over to Collin who will share more details on our financial performance. Collin? Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated our first quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, breadth of product offerings and variable cost structure. They also reflect successful investments in our three-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders. Before I get started, I'd like to remind you that all of the financial information I will review reflects the adoption of ASC 606. So, it's apples-to-apples comparisons for 2017 and 2018. Turning to our P&L. If you have access to the slides posted online it will be helpful to follow along. I'm on slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $3.6 billion, 10.8% higher than last year on a reported and average daily sales basis. Average daily sales were $56.4 million. On a constant currency basis consolidated net sales were 9.6% higher than last year. Currency impact was driven by favorable translation of the British pound and Canadian dollar adding roughly 120 basis points of growth. Currency tailwinds were 50 basis points higher than the fourth quarter. On an average daily sales basis sequential sales were down 5.4% versus Q4 2017 a lesser decline than anticipated. This reflected four factors \u2013 first a more positive than anticipated currency tailwind; second, stronger than expected client device sales; third, international success capturing fiscal year end buying; and fourth, the shipment of sales impacted by Q4 supply chain delays, which delivered more than 100 basis points of sequential growth and added nearly 150 basis points of year-over-year growth. Excluding these shipments and the impact of currency, net sales increased just over 8% year-over-year. Gross profit for the quarter increased 9.1% to $604 million. Gross margin in the first quarter was 16.7% up 40 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter and down 30 basis points over the last year. The year-over-year delta reflected the impact of three main drivers. The positive impact of increases in net service contract revenue and other 100% gross margin revenues, which include Software as a Service and warranties, was more than offset by ongoing hardware strength, which comprised product margin and mid-single-digit increases in partner funding compared to double digit increases in sales. Turning to SG&A, on slide 9, reported SG&A including advertising expense was roughly 4% higher than last year. Reported SG&A includes $8 million of non-cash equity compensation and $2 million of other costs including costs related to payroll taxes on equity-based compensation. Our adjusted SG&A increased 6%. Lower growth in adjusted SG&A compared to sales primarily reflects the variable nature of our sales compensation, which moves in line with gross profits. Coworker count was up roughly 20 since yearend 2017 to 8,750. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.9% to $280 million. Adjusted SG&A growth slower than sales resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.8%, 10 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2017. Once again, our results demonstrate the power of our variable cost structure. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 10. Interest expense was $38 million, $2 million lower than last year's Q1 level. The reduction primarily reflected the benefit of last year's Q1 refinancing in the absence of the double payment of one month of interest on the notes that were redeemed. GAAP taxes were $39 million which resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.4% compared to an effective tax rate of 21.9% in the first quarter of 2017. As you can see on slide 11 the increase in effective tax rate primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of lower excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation in Q1 2018 versus Q1 2017, which was partially offset by a lower federal tax rate. Moving to slide 12. On a GAAP basis, we earned $127 million of net income more than twice last year's first quarter net income of $58 million which included $57 million of debt extinguishment costs. Our non-GAAP net income which better reflects our operating performance was $163 million in the quarter up 33.6% over last year. Non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add backs that fall in four general buckets; the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles, equity compensation and related payroll taxes, integration expenses and other nonrecurring or infrequent income or expenses. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP add backs including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation. For Q1, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.3% down slightly more than 10 percentage points compared to last year's 36.5% rate primarily due to the lower federal tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26.3% applied to our non-GAAP pre-tax income of $221 million resulted in non-GAAP net income of $163 million. We've provided a more detailed reconciliation in our earnings release. As you can see on slide 13, to calculate our non-GAAP pre-tax income, you can get to this measure starting with either adjusted EBITDA or GAAP pre-tax income. With Q1 weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 155 million, we delivered $1.05 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 40.5% over the prior year as you can see on slide 14. Currency impact on EPS was higher than the impact on net sales adding about 160 basis points to first quarter growth. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 15. On March 31, we had $221 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3 billion, which was flat to Q1 2017. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q1 was 2.5 times at the low-end of our target range of 2.5 times to 3 times. Our current weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.3%, 10 basis points above last year. While LIBOR increased in the first quarter the impact on interest expense was minimal given the 1.5% caps we have in place on our term loan in the amount of $1.4 billion. These caps expire in December 2018. During the quarter we purchased an additional $1.4 billion of caps at 2.375 percentage to hedge 2019 and 2020. With caps in place roughly 96% of our outstanding debt is either fixed rate or hedged. As you can see on slide 16, we maintained strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during Q1. For the quarter our three month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down roughly two days from last year's first quarter and below our annual target range of high-teens to low-20s. Year-over-year DSO and DPO increases offset each other largely reflecting the impact mixing into netted down revenues has on both metrics. The remainder of the change reflects lower inventory days as lower average inventory balances were applied against the quarter's higher cost of goods sold. Free cash flow for the quarter, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring agreement, less capital expenditures was a positive $231 million compared to $215 million in Q1 of 2017. Remember Q1 is a seasonally strong cash flow quarter because sales decline sequentially and cash tax payments are minimal. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. During the quarter we continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and repurchased 1.5 million shares for $109 million at an average cost of $72.63 per share. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components which you can see on slide 17. First, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.21 per share on June 11 to shareholders of record as of May 25, up 31% from year ago. Since the IPO, our dividend has increased nearly fivefold from the initial annual level of $0.17 per share. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 times to 3 times. We ended Q1 at 2.5 times. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. At the end of March, we had $749 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation priorities support our updated 2018 targets, which you see on slide 18. As Tom mentioned, we now expect the U.S. IT market to grow a little more than 3% and CDW to outperform the market by a little more than 300 basis points on a constant currency basis. We now look for currency to contribute roughly 50 basis points to annual sales growth assuming year ago exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.76 to the Canadian dollar. Given Q1 performance and year ago expectations, we expect to exceed our initial 2018 non-GAAP EPS growth target in constant currency and now look for non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the mid-to-high 20s, which we define as 25% to 27%. We expect currency to have a similar impact on EPS growth and sales growth. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to come in roughly 5 basis points to 10 basis points or so below the high end of our high 7's to 8% annual target range of tax reform, investments and tax expenses. Keep in mind that these are annual targets not quarterly. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling the rest of our 2018 financials. I'm on slide 19. Our historical sales seasonality has been roughly 48% first half, 52% second half. Based on Q1 results and expectations for the rest of the year we look for roughly 50 basis points of sales to shift from the second half to the first half of the year. Given Q1's better than historical sequential growth we look for Q2 seasonality to run below historical seasonality. We have the same number of selling days as the prior year in each of the remaining quarters and we end the year with the same number of selling days. We now expect annual depreciation and amortization to run a little less than $10 million above 2017 at roughly $68 million per quarter, $47 million of which is for purchased intangibles. With the impact of our term loan re-pricing in April annual book interest expense is expected to come in at roughly $155 million. We continue to look for annual equity compensation to be roughly $7 million lower than 2017. We expect equity compensation to be at its highest level in the second quarter up a couple million dollars compared to Q1. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. We expect excess tax benefits to impact our GAAP tax rate in Q3 and Q4. Annual non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow approximately 300 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income as share repurchases contribute to our annual target of mid-to-high 20% non-GAAP EPS growth. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling cash flows. I'm on slide 20. First, we expect our capital expenditures to be slightly above 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. We also expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within our target range of high-teens to low-20s. As you know, with our typical cash flow pattern our second quarter tends to be the lightest cash flow quarter of the year. This reflects both our payment of estimated cash taxes for the first and second quarters and increased working capital needs to support what is typically our highest quarterly sequentially sales increase. For the full year, we expect the cash tax rate in the 26% to 27% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $47 million per quarter. In addition, with the reduction in our tax rate we expect to pay approximately $13 million in 2018 for tax related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. 2018 is the final year of payments. We continue to expect annual free cash flow to come in at the low end of our tax reform enhanced rule of thumb run rate between 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. This reflects 2017's over delivery of 50 basis points above our pre-tax reform rule of thumb due to timing. That concludes the financial summary. With that let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Operator, please provide the instructions for asking the question. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. The phrase tuck-in accretive deals was recently removed I think, last quarter, and replaced with expand CDW strategic capabilities on the slides. And I think you could have somewhere near $1 billion of liquidity based on your share repurchase guide and debt position. So, would CDW consider something larger like this and how would you evaluate those options and I have just one follow-up? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, let me first say that we \u2013 now that we sit in the current financial position that we didn't have early on in our public life. I think we've been pretty transparent, Adam, about our interest and consideration of inorganic growth and looking at deals whether they be strategic truly in nature or to help drive growth. And so, I don't know that there is anything different other than we continue to look at the parts of the marketplace where we might add a particular capability that it would take us too long to build internally or other parts of geographic expansion that would help us serve customers on an international basis. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Tom. And just as a follow-up, CDW often talks about being selective in taking the right kind of revenue. But I think Collin mentioned in the prepared remarks that partner funding grew at half the rate of sales, gross margin is still declining and were lapping those hardware mix comparisons last year. So, could you just talk about the results and whether maybe the environment is forcing somewhat of a pivot here from being selective? And what's causing the change in partner funding as it \u2013 because I would have thought partners would reward a retailer more handsomely for strong performance like this. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So, I would say, there was \u2013 I don't know, I think there were two or three in there, Adam. So, let me just try to knock them out one at a time. The first is, no we haven't changed our selectivity. In fact, I would describe us as probably even being more selective when it comes to where we go, what products and services we decide to focus on and part because of our strategy that we just finished for the next three years. So, no change in selectivity. In fact, number of opportunities this quarter much like other quarters, we just said you know what, no, thank you. Now, sometimes when you make that decision that can impact where you end up on a particular scale from a funding perspective. I think the one thing to keep in perspective is, the funder, funding growth from partners, was very \u2013 was positive this quarter and meaningfully positive. It just didn't keep pace with the unexpected growth in top line sales. And sometimes that unexpected growth comes in areas that are areas \u2013 that are prime areas for the vendors and sometimes it come in areas that are prime for customers, but aren't necessarily prime for vendors. And so, we think we do a really effective job of balancing those two things, meeting customers' growing needs, and at the same time, serving our partners well in the marketplace. So, I don't really think about it as a marketplace dynamic. The other thing that I was pleased to see is, I tend to look at the margin two different ways. Sequentially, it's kind of the current condition in the marketplace, because what happened last quarter is the closest reportable period to what we're experiencing now and you heard that there was nice positive growth. A lot of that was driven by our strong solutions performance in the quarter. And then, I look at it year-over-year and just to say, okay, what's \u2013 what have we done differently. And while there was a slight decline in the margin year-over-year, I think Collin walked you through some of the things that are happening and part of it was just the strong hardware growth, which I'm not going to turn away from. The last thing I would say though, and we have been I think, rock solid consistent on this, is the area we put many calories on, even some degree more calories on is, our adjusted EBITDA performance, because that is what we can control, that is making sure that our cost structure is aligned with what's going on in the marketplace. We don't control everything that happens with gross profit. Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Adam, it's Collin. The only thing I'd add to what Tom said is, that there are several components to partner funding. I think the most commonly thought of is vendor incentive rebates, but there are other things where partners will help fund some of our advertising programs and so a driver there would necessarily be sales, but the driver would be more the timing of our marketing campaigns. Purchase discounts are also a component of partner funding and that can vary based on which partners you're mixing into and out of. So, just consider that there are many different drivers of what contributes to partner funding year-over-year and that's why we've consistently said, you can see that contribution bounce around from quarter-to-quarter depending on those drivers. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks. I'm not used to heading lead off, so thanks for it. Let me take a couple extra pitches there. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Clich\u00e9 (00:39:41). Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks and good morning, guys. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Amit. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, guys. I guess two questions for me as well. Maybe to start with, Tom, Q1 your extremely strong organic growth performance even if I take out FX and some of the push-out contributions, I get growth that's something north of 8% for the March quarter. Could you maybe just help me understand we're doing 8% plus growth in Q1, we're talking about 3% plus IT spend, 300 basis points of share gain for the full year, what ended up being better that you don't think will sustain for the rest of the year. Is that the IT spend was better or you think share gain is somewhat higher? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, good question. I think there were a couple different reasons that made the first quarter look a little stronger. The first one was the better than expected client growth. And you heard me allude to some of that was driven by the DoD mandate, which ended in January so that's one. Two was the go-forward or delay or whatever the right term is of the supply chain activity, which we alluded to in the last quarter. The third thing was the opportunistic performance by our international team and what I would describe as both the public and the year-end opportunity. And then the fourth was currency. So, if you kind of look at all those and fast forward them you're going to see, a few of them were if you will onetime events. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Understood. And I guess, if I may just follow-up on NetComm, which I think you mentioned was up mid-single-digits. Can you just talk a little bit more about what's going on in that segment because if I recall that's where a lot of push-outs had happened last quarter. So, I would have thought... Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That would do somewhat better. So... Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Yeah, it is. It was. Although it wasn't a lot of it was part of. I would say it was \u2013 NetComm and the data center, Amit were the two areas where we had some push-out. I think part of it is to some degree as Cisco transitions, as a big network partner to a software-driven architecture you get more of the netted down impact on top line. But I would tell you outside of Cisco a lot of the other network vendors had a pretty strong quarter. So, I think some of that shift and you've heard me talk about this, the shift to software-driven architecture is increasing. As that increases, I think you're going to continue to see some of those product lines bounce around top line wise but also see margin enhancement. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you, and congrats on a good quarter, guys. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Amit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Cabral from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, morning, Tom. Just to build on Amit's question. I guess, given the strong start to the year, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about just what you're hearing from customers on the health of the broader demand environment at this point. And I know Chris had no impact from corporate tax reform so far. But just curious if you think that's an incremental tailwind that builds as we get through the year. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I would tell you, I hope, Matt that does obviously. I think we haven't heard people directly connect would be the way I would say it, the tax reform benefit and IT investment. We have heard people initially take care of coworkers or employees, although, but like we did and then start to think about how do I take the remaining benefit and start to pile through the business. So, I'm hopeful, I think the word we used was cautiously optimistic that one of the things that's going to drive demand for the rest of the year would be as that flows through the decision process inside the companies. And I think it's \u2013 I mean, I think everybody feels fairly cautiously optimistic about the economy and we hear that from customers. We just don't hear them say, hey, because of this we're now going to push this project forward and give you that opportunity. But we anticipate that that will happen as we move through the year. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then on the international just given the success of your UK push so far, just curious if you think there are any lessons learned from the integration of Kelway so far that almost created a blueprint in some sense for you to just apply to future M&A outside the U.S. going forward? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'll give you my answer and then I'll let Chris give you her spin on it. As I've told my team, if I could replicate the Kelway experience, every time we do an acquisition I'm all in, because it's met an expanding customer need, it was accretive to the business, they've benefited from being part of CDW. We have benefited from some of their experience, like managed services. So, not that I'm greedy, Matt, but I'd love to have that every time we go forward. Having said that, I think it's given us increased confidence and awareness of expanding our international footprint because of what we learned and the success we've had and Chris, who had a lot to do with that successful integration, I will let her comment. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Matt, I think Tom really said most of it. You can be assured that we've developed plans and blueprints off of that acquisition all the way from frankly lead generation to the evaluating opportunities, but planning well in advance for the integration because we've come to realize how important that is to the immediate and then long term success of an acquisition. Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Baird. Your line is open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Morning, Jase (45:42). Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. And just to clarify Tom, the lead times are back to normal in NetComm and data center? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, the answer is, all of the supply chain issues that we had in the fourth quarter were cleaned up. Having said that, we continue to hear rumblings of potential delays, which is why I described it as a wildcard going forward. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Understood. The follow-up is on cloud and security strength. Are you able to find the right talent to invest in those two markets or at least train new hires and enter these areas that you expect to see continued success through the year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So, Jase (46:34) the answer is yes. And part of it is because of our ability to find people inside of CDW who have both experience and/or interest in focusing on security or cloud performance that helps us if you will fund the resource additions that we want to make. And I think the last part of it was, absolutely yes, that these will continue to be meaningful growth areas for CDW from both a skill, capabilities and footprint standpoint. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Jase (47:13). Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Tom and everyone. Just a couple of questions. One regarding the commentary on the strength in Corporate and Chris talked about the fact that one of the reasons for that success is the increased penetration of product sales within existing customers, both solutions and the client devices. Could you maybe elaborate more on that? Give us any metrics that have shown average sales accounts today versus a year ago or any other metrics? And then within that, are you finding within big enterprises that the decision makers on data center type of products versus client devices are different? And is that a challenge for your account managers? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I'll take the first part of that question. We don't give out specific metrics on those types of programs. What I can tell you is, we're seeing increase across the board when it comes to the various initiatives we've put in place, whether its category penetration acquisition et cetera. Those continue to be positive but we don't provide those metrics generally. On the decision maker, I think the answer is it depends. And we have great penetration in both the decision making area for the client as well as data center. Given the, I'll say, the complexion of the sellers that we have been growing and training, their ability to get to the appropriate place, has increased dramatically over the past five years to six years. And so the ability from an accelerated perspective to get to the decision maker in the data center even if you start in the client base where that might have been, as an example, the purchasing folks awhile back, allow us to move over to the other area. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Matt, I'll give you a one other little connective tissue. One of the things that \u2013 I think, excuse me, has been an important part of our success has been the rigor and attention to detail around book management. And part of that has been we've transitioned pretty effectively over the last four years or five years to make sure that the size of a book that a seller gives them an opportunity to make a great living, but also motivates them to penetrate existing accounts instead of just planting new flags. Those incremental customer facing coworkers that we've been adding for the last four years or five years then get the benefit because we now are creating new books at a fairly good rate that have a scale and scope that allows them to go and attack. So, if you're managing a book with let's say, 200 customers, your ability to get to key decision makers is going to be limited based on time. But if you're managing a book that is meaningfully less than that then you're going to be incented and have the time to penetrate other areas of the business and one of the benefactors is our success in the data center. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up on the education market, you talked about K-12 being flattish after many years of double-digit growth. And you talked about the drivers there. And any catalyst that you see within the next year that would sort of bring some signs of life and reacceleration of growth there? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Matt. I would say, yes to that. The new kind of learning environment, as we refer to the Classroom of the Future, or the modern learning environment, is really where our customers are focusing. And that's really about optimizing the teaching and learning experience through technology and learning space investments. And while I'll tell we'd expect this year to be pretty modest growth across the board due to the clients' muted demand environment, we do feel that we are very well positioned to assist our customers in this new area and believe it's essential rule, frankly, in the classroom of the future K-12 and we'll see growth rebound in the coming years. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Matt, I think the word I've used is kind of a transition year for K-12. And that as Chris used the term creative learning that's just not a description, it's actually a concept that we're finding as a lot of IT tentacles for that. And is exciting for us. And so you can think about us transitioning to the thing that customers are now asking for is to help us create an actual environment that is more conducive to creative learning. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Thank you very much. I just had a couple of quick questions. One just on client. I'm curious as to what you're hearing and thinking about sustainability of the growth that we've seen in client. How much of this has been Win 10 or new products and at what point are all of those computers out there that we all talk about that were five to six years old either replaced or no longer needed? Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay, Shannon. Good morning. First of all I think this has been obviously, we were surprised by the success even in the first quarter. So, the refresh has extended a little bit longer. I don't want to get into crystal balling how long refresh is going to continue because I'm probably going to fall short on that one. Here's what we do, no, that even before we go through periods like the last 12 months to 18 months because, we exclusively focus on the B2B marketplace, client growth has been a constant for us, client device growth. And so, we would expect that to continue. I don't think we have the benefit of the huge tailwind of the DoD. And I don't know that there's a single driver and answer to your question that's driving the client refresh. I think it's a combination of, for example if you have a lot of customers in the technology sector. They're growing like crazy. They're adding employees. Well that in and of itself can drive client growth and it's not tied to Win 10. It's not tied to security. It's just tried to the growth of the business. So, to some degree I think the interesting wildcard on this will be a constant growth of the economy; what does that mean for employee expansion and what does that mean for client growth going forward. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, with regard to \u2013 we've been talking to a lot of your partners on that and there is all of this discussion about flexible consumption models and Device as a Service and it's just basically taking everything to ratable, which obviously is a good thing from our current revenue perspective. I'm curious as to what you're hearing from customers though. Is it still sort of a push versus a pull? Are they increasing their discussions on that? And then how does it all get billed for and accounted for over time? Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. There's a lot in there. I think I don't know that we're \u2013 may be this is an opinion. We are at equilibrium on push and pull. I think people are increasingly looking for ways to outsource IT. If you let me use that term liberally. And whether it's cloud computing or Device as a Service in theory they're saying, we want to take, we want you CDW to take over run it aspect of this business. If you look at our cloud results and you think about some of the Device as a Service examples we've given, it's clearly got some momentum. It actually plays to one of our strengths. And this was something that I was trying to allude to in my formal comments is the logistics capability of CDW and the size and breadth of our warehouses and our logistics infrastructure is, we're finding to be incredibly helpful as we look at Device as a Service opportunities, which we are seeing increase in a meaningful way. Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: And on the accounting. I am sorry. Just to follow-up on the accounting, the answer is it depends, the transactions can all be structured differently. CDW could make a sale to a leasing company then the leasing company could turnaround and lease to the customer. In that case we recognize it up front. If CDW were the lessor then that would be spread over the life of the lease. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : And are you trying more \u2013 I'm just curious is there going to be a shift more to a ratable revenue from your standpoint or is it sort of too early to tell? Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: I think it's too early to tell. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I think in the beginning it was funny, we joked about this. There was nothing being done ratably. It was, yeah, it's as a service but we want you to buy it the way that you always did. We have seen, I'd say over the last 18 months more and more comfort by both the partners and the customers and doing it ratably. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you so much for answering my questions. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks Shannon. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I'll ask both upfront I know we're towards the end of the call. So, first, just broadly speaking does it feel like the uptick in demand is cyclical in that your business customers are going back and addressing pent up demand and doing typical refresh or are you picking up a mindset shift among businesses where there's thinking about IT penetrating more parts and processes across the business within the use cases? And then secondly, what are the competitive dynamics or your exposure relative to the market that you think allow you to outpace that 200 basis point to 300 basis points growth premium this year? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. So, I think the answer to the first question Katy would be it's both. That \u2013 in it \u2013 if you think about some of my formal comments, it was attempting to get at that is that we are seeing increasingly customers talking to us about kind of becoming their run it partner if you will run IT, which I think is a little bit of them thinking about, how do I reallocate resources? And what parts do I think somebody like CDW can actually do better and then I can take those resources maybe and work on strategic development? So, I think that is \u2013 and I \u2013 look, I also think tied to that is a little bit of one of the questions earlier about the economy and confidence and spending just more on IT. If you said, why have we been able to continue to take share on a constant basis? I think it's the number of different factors, it is the breadth of the portfolio quite honestly, which as I like to tell our sellers, we always have something that we can do for a customer. The second thing is, as we've gotten more prescriptive on our book management, we have found ways to have greater motivation to penetrate better inside of accounts. If you think about the additional coworkers, we've been on a pretty steady drumbeat now for I think at least the last four years, five years of adding 100 to 125 customer-facing coworkers. So, we're extending our reach. And then, I think the last thing just as an example as part of our strategy, the addition of our expansion of our international capabilities has enabled us to help more of our larger corporate customers with IT solutions around the world. And that clearly has been a major factor in our success rate. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Congrats on the quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, thanks Katy. Operator : Thank you. And that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Richards for any closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thank you once again everybody for your time this morning and your questions. They help us a great deal and make sure we're focused on the things that are important to you guys and investors. And I'd be remiss, we moved this earnings call up earlier. So you have plenty of time to get ready for Mother's Day. No excuses on anybody's part. Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

And with that, let me turn the call back to Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Sari. We had another quarter of strong and profitable top line growth. For the quarter, consolidated sales were $4.2 billion, up 7.6% versus last year. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7%. Gross profit increased 8.6% to $696 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.6% to $345 million and non-GAAP net income per share increased 35% to $1.38. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP EPS increased 34.5%. Our consistent performance since the IPO has been driven by three factors : first, our balance across customer end-markets; second, the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio; and third, our ongoing investments in our three-part strategy for growth. Let's take a look at how each contributed to this quarter's performance. First, the balance across our customer end-markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels; Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government and Education. Each of these channels are meaningful businesses, generating annual sales of more than $1 billion. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end-markets, including K-12, higher education, state and local government, and federal government. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered 2017 sales of more than $1.5 billion. These unique sales organization serve us well, when end-markets behave differently from each other. Sometimes that occurs because markets are disrupted by macro or external changes, sometimes it occurs when customer behavior differs due to different priorities. Our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets is one of the hallmarks of our ability to generate consistent profitable growth. Chris will walk you through more on this quarter's results by end-market. Chris? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. The power of the diversity of our customer end-markets is clearly evident this quarter. Five of our seven U.S. based customer facing end-markets as well as both of our international operations posted top line gains. This more than offset declines in two of our end-markets enabling us to deliver our consolidated 7.6% top line increase. Corporate had an excellent quarter with sales up 10%. Client refresh remained healthy, driven by strong employment and customers' continued use of client devices to drive productivity. This contributed to strong transactions growth for the quarter up mid-teens, very impressive results, given last year's second quarter low double-digit transaction growth. At the same time, the team was generating double-digit transactions growth. They also delivered a mid single-digit increase in solutions as they continued to help customers drive digital transformation into their businesses. While customers are not explicitly pointing to tax reform as the driver of incremental spend, it does feel as though it has spurned corporate customer confidence in the economy to move forward with their existing spending plans. In the Small Business market, confidence remained strong and the team posted a 5% increase in net sales. Client refresh drove a mid single-digit increase in transaction and the team's focus on driving profitable sales drove meaningful product margin improvement. As a segment, public was flat for the quarter. Performance varied across channels and within customer end-markets. Government was down just under 6%. Results were mixed across our two customer end-markets with state and local up and federal down. State and local performance was solid, even as they jumped from tough compares when sales were up nearly 20%, in part from on-boarding and new large state contract last year. Two factors impacted federal performance in the quarter. First, the impact of difficult client device compares given our second quarter 2017's success meeting the Department of Defense mandate to move to Win 10. Second, the impact of timing. Here, we had a double hit with shift into the second quarter of 2017, which you may recall included the shipment of 2016 orders that had been delayed to the Department of Defense and then we had shifts out of the second quarter in 2018 with order delays. Also, given our success helping customers adopt cloud in both government end-markets, solutions delivered to government customers via the cloud more than doubled in each end-markets, which muted top line growth. Education increased 1%. Again, we saw different results from each end-market with Higher Ed up and K-12 down. Higher Ed continued its success maximizing contract capture and client refresh remained strong. As we shared last quarter, K-12 is moving through a transition as school systems digested digital devices and networking investments they have made over the past five years and focus on collaborative learning environment. Although, lapping last year's record breaking Chromebook sales, K-12 delivered growth in transactions. This was offset by declines in networking as schools continues to digest last year's strong networking investment. In addition, as you may recall, in 2016 E-Rate funding was delayed, which pushed spending that typically occurs in the back half of the year into the first half of 2017. Healthcare had another good quarter increasing 6%. Similar to the first quarter, the team helped customers address pent-up demand, primarily in client devices. While the fate of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid funding and overall reimbursements remained a concern, customers did move forward with projects that they determined needed to be addressed and transactions increased double-digits. Our other results, which reflects Canada and UK combined, increased 34% in U.S. dollars. Both operations continued to deliver exceptional local performance (9:25) increasing more than 25%. Investments made in further refining our go-to-market and growing our Canadian solutions capabilities continue to pay off. We had balanced growth in Canada across both transactions and solutions, both up high-teens in local currency. Once again, UK results came in above expectations. UK had excellent results across both transactions and solutions. Despite looming Brexit decisions, the team continues to execute well in market. They are also doing a great job leveraging our international capabilities to grow outside of the UK, both with UK-based customers and U.S.-based customers. U.S. referral to the UK increased over 30% in the quarter compared to the prior-year. So as you can see our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets delivered a very good top line growth quarter on a consolidated basis. That wraps up the summary, Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Chris. Clearly the diversity of our end-markets was a key driver of this quarter's performance, but our sellers' success regardless of the end-market they serve is a direct outcome of their ability to provide what customers want and need. And that is where the second driver of our performance this quarter comes in, our broad products and solutions suite including our on-prem and off-prem offerings. U.S. hardware sales increased 6%. Total U.S. client devices increased low double-digits. This is particularly noteworthy, giving last year's mid-teen increase, which included record Chromebook sales and this quarter's decline in federal client device sales. Video delivered another double-digit growth quarter, powered by digital signage and large monitor formats. Interactive flat panel growth was particularly robust as price points in this category are becoming more competitive to static displays. After a lumpy 2017, servers delivered its second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, up nearly 20%. These strong results were partially offset by our NetComm and storage performance. After the first quarter recovery from year-end supply chain issues, shipments did not keep pace with our writings and U.S. NetComm sales declined low double-digits. We remain encouraged about the category as backorders remained strong over the past 30 days and we expect the majority of these orders to ship in the third quarter. Strong flash results, which increased 20%, were not enough to offset overall storage performance and the category declined mid single-digits. Overall, U.S. services increased 3%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in warranties, which was partially offset by services tied to networking like cabling and storage. For the first time in more than a year, our gross margin improved year-over-year, despite our strong client growth, which would typically pressure margin. One of the contributing factors was our software performance. U.S. gross profit from software grew low double-digits, meaningfully faster than net sales, which were flat year-over-year. One driver of this success, we had in the quarter, helping our customers move forward with solutions delivered via cloud, particularly in government and education as you heard from Chris, which are netted down for accounting purposes. Overall, customer spend on cloud-based solutions was up nearly 40%. Productivity, our largest workload had another great quarter, up nearly 40%. Security delivered via cloud was one of our top three fastest growing workloads, the other two were business analytics and backup. All three grew at least high double-digits. In total, we had strong U.S. transactions growth, up high single-digits, solid solutions performance in Corporate was muted by cloud success, delays in federal orders and customer transition in K-12. While U.S. solutions were flat, gross profit increased mid single-digits. For the UK and Canada, we saw excellent increases in solutions together up high-teens. Clearly, the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio enables us to evolve with our customers and deliver profitable growth. And that leads us to the third driver of our performance of this quarter. The ongoing investments we are making in our three-part strategy. During the quarter, we continue to make excellent progress executing the strategy, which is to first, capture market share from existing and new customers; second, expand our solutions suite; and third, enhance our services capabilities. One way to capture market share is by understanding your customers' business as well as you understand technology. A great example of this in action, is the success we have seen in our financial vertical within the Corporate end-market. We launched this vertical back in 2014 with the mandate to grow their market faster than the overall Corporate business. And they certainly have been doing that. Dedicated sales teams are aligned around three financial markets; banks and credit unions, capital markets and insurance. Each of these teams understands their market's unique needs. We have highly knowledgeable co-workers who have deep expertise in the areas these customers prioritize. For example, in capital markets, we can deliver high-performance compute and artificial intelligence capabilities, customers need to drive their competitive advantage. We have nearly 100 sellers dedicated to this vertical and through the second quarter they are on pace to deliver four years of double-digit growth. Our second strategy is to continuously expand our solutions capabilities. By doing so, we capture important pockets of growth across the IT landscape and ensure we remain relevant to customers. We accomplish this in two ways. First, we invest in co-workers to ensure we can support customer adoption of new technologies. The creation of our cloud practice in 2011 and our ensuing investments is a great example of that. The second way, we expand our solutions capabilities is by adding partners, which provides both innovation and a source of growth for us. In the second quarter, we added AWS to our portfolio to supplement our already very strong Microsoft Azure offering. Our AWS offering includes CDW delivered professional and managed services. Our managed service offerings include 24/7 remote incident cost and service level monitoring. It also includes technical account reviews and assessments. These professional services are designed to help our customers through the entire life cycle, including migration and integration services. This is a controlled rollout to two of our customer end-markets. By doing so, we will be able to evaluate our offering and refine it as we learn what's best for our customers. As such, we don't expect the impact on 2018 performance to be meaningful. We are taking a measured approach to rolling this out with a keen eye on ensuring the best possible customer experience. In this hybrid world, our broad portfolio enables us to capture profitable growth in both on-prem and off-prem solutions. Over the past 12 months, CDW customers have spent roughly $3 billion on solutions delivered via the cloud. As Chris mentioned earlier, one area that is contributing to this growth is the success we are having helping our government customers both state and local and federal adopt cloud solutions. We're seeing more and more government cloud adoption as IT organizations set out to drive greater focus on accountability as well as enhance cybersecurity and shared services outcomes. Agencies aren't just integrating cloud into their IT strategies. They are integrating cloud into their overall strategies as a way of driving change. A great example of this is the solution we provided to a civilian government agency to help them with their mandate to improve operations. Not an easy task for a complex organization. Before they formulate any action plan, they need to deeply understand their operation and to do that they need to find a way to call through volumes of data. Our solution provided a cloud-based analytics and business intelligence capability, which identifies patterns and trends to help the agency make fact-based decisions. Since the solution is available as an enhanced feature to an existing package, it can be integrated into their current operations. The total cost of the solution to the agency was over $2 million. Of course, cloud sales like this, do pressure the top line since we only book our profit as net sales; but at the same time, they contribute to enhance profitability and just as important, customer value. Our third strategic priority, which is to continue to enhance our services capability, is also contributing to our profitable growth. Our services capabilities were one of the main reasons we won the award to provide Device as a Service as a solution for the 2020 U.S. Census. We combined our service and logistics capabilities with our broad product portfolio and deep partner relationships to create a mobile technology solution that supports field data collection. Our solution includes the provision of mobile devices and accessories, custom design configuration, wireless services, deployment and secure asset management, along with helpdesk and field support. Similar to AWS, this is not expected to impact our 2018 performance, but it is another great example of how our investments and solutions and services are driving profitable growth in 2019 and beyond. That leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. Given first half market performance, our current view of 2018 U.S. IT market growth is for full-year growth in the 3 range and 3.25 range up 50 basis points from our prior view. In addition to increasing our view of market growth, given our strong performance to-date, we also expect to exceed our prior target of growing a little more than 300 basis points above markets and we currently look for outperformance of roughly 375 basis points. With these expectations along with the strong growth, we have seen in our UK and Canadian operations, we are upping our plans to add customer-facing co-workers from our initial view of adding between 100 and 125. For the full-year 2018, we now expect to add between 125 and 150 net customer facing co-workers. These co-workers include account mangers, field sellers, solution architects and service delivery engineers. We ended the quarter up roughly 75 customer facing co-workers, since the beginning of the year. As you can see, we feel good about the balance of the year. That said, this could change based on a number of factors, how the U.S. economy performs? What happens with trade? What happens with tariffs? What happens with Brexit? And are there any potential supply dislocations? We'll keep a watchful eye on all of this as normal and update our view as we move throughout the year. Now, let me turn it over to Collin. Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom indicated, our second quarter financial results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, breadth of product offerings and ongoing investments in our three-part strategy for growth. They also demonstrate the progress we are making against our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders. Before I get started, I'd like to remind you that all of the financial information I will review reflects the adoption of ASC 606, so it is an apples-to-apples comparisons for 2017 and 2018. Turning to our P&L, if you have access to the slides posted online, it will be helpful to follow along. I am on slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.2 billion, or 7.6% higher than last year on a reported and average daily sales basis. Average daily sales were $65.4 million for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales in the second quarter of 2018 were 7% higher than prior-year. Currency impact was driven by favorable translation of the British pound and Canadian dollar, adding roughly 60 basis points of growth. Currency tailwinds were approximately 60 basis points lower than the first quarter. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales were up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As expected, this is slightly lower than our historical Q1 to Q2 average daily sales increase, due to the 2017 year-end delayed orders that shipped in the first quarter. Gross profit for the quarter increased 8.6% to $696 million. Gross margin in the second quarter was 16.6%, up 10 basis points over last year and down 10 basis points sequentially from the first quarter. The year-over-year margin expansion reflected improved product margin from customer mix and positive contribution from U.S. cloud growth, partially offset by other netted down streams not going as fast as sales. Turning to SG&A on slide 9. Reported SG&A, including advertising expense was roughly 5% higher than last year. Reported SG&A includes $11 million of non-cash equity compensation and $0.5 million of other costs, including cost related to payroll taxes on equity-based compensation. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising increased 7.9% compared to last year. The increase in adjusted SG&A, primarily reflected increased co-worker costs, including sales compensation consistent with higher gross profit and higher attainment against goals. Co-worker count was up roughly 130, since the second quarter of 2017 to 8,917. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $345 million, an increase of 9.6% compared to the prior quarter. This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.2%, 10 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2017. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 10. Interest expense was $37 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $36 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily a result of the amortization of hedging costs associated with interest rate caps. GAAP taxes in the quarter were $57 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 25% compared to an effective tax rate of 28% in the second quarter of 2017. As you can see on slide 11, the reduction in effective tax rate primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of lower federal tax rates, which more than offset the impact of lower excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation. Moving to slide 12. On a GAAP basis, we earned $173 million of net income, an increase of $32 million or 23% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects our operating performance was $213 million in the quarter, up 31% over the last year. Non-GAAP net income reflects after-tax add backs that fall in four general buckets : the ongoing amortization of purchased intangibles; equity compensations and related payroll taxes; integration expenses; and other non-recurring or infrequent income or expenses. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP add backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation. For the second quarter of 2018, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26%, down 11 percentage points compared to last year's 37% rate primarily due to the lower federal tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26% applied to our non-GAAP pre-tax income of $288 million resulted in non-GAAP net income of $213 million in the second quarter of 2018. We've provided a more detailed reconciliation in our earnings release, as you can see on slide 13. To calculate our non-GAAP pre-tax income, you can get to this measure starting with either adjusted EBITDA or GAAP pre-tax income. With second quarter, weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 154 million, we delivered $1.12 of net income per share and $1.38 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 35% over the prior-year as you can see on slide 14. Currency impact on EPS added about 50 basis points to second quarter growth. Turning to first half results on slides 15 through 18. Revenue was $7.8 billion, an increase of 9% on a reported and average daily sales basis. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales in the first half of 2018 were 8.2% higher than the prior-year. Gross profit in the first six months of 2018 was $1.3 billion, up 8.8%. Gross profit margin was 16.7%, which was flat to the first six months of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $625 million, 10.6% above the first six months of 2017. Net income was $300 million for the first half of 2018. Non-GAAP net income was $376 million, 32% above the first six months of 2017. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.44, up 38% from the first half of 2017. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 19. On June 30, we had $101 million cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3.1 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. Net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 2.5 times at the low end of our target range of 2.5 times to 3 times. Our current weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.1%, 10 basis points below last year, primarily due to re-pricing the term loan, which lowered the margin to 175 basis points. While LIBOR increased year-over-year in the second quarter, the impact on interest expense was minimal, given the 1.5% caps we have in place on our term-loan in the amount of $1.4 billion. These 1.5% caps expire in December 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we purchased an additional $1.4 billion of caps at 2.375% to hedge 2019 and 2020. With the caps in place, roughly 96% of our outstanding debt is either fixed rate or hedged. As you can see on slide 20, we maintained strong rolling three month working capital metrics during the second quarter. For the quarter, our three month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, up approximately one day from last year's second quarter and below our annual target range of high-teens to low-20s. Year-over-year, DSO and DPO increases primarily offset each other, largely reflecting the impact mixing into netted down revenues has on both metrics. The remainder of the change is driven by inventory, which reflects higher stocking positions and timing of shipments. Year-to-date, free cash flow, which we calculate as operating cash flow plus the net change in our flooring (28:52) agreement less capital expenditures was a positive $188 million compared to $254 million in the first half of 2017. The year-over-year change in free cash flow, primarily reflects rebuilding inventory and vendor mix. Last year, we mixed into vendors with extended terms and this year we mixed out of vendors with extended terms. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our capital allocation strategy and repurchased roughly 864,000 shares for $67 million at an average cost of $77.95 per share. Our capital allocation strategy is comprised of the following four components, which you see on slide 21. First, increased dividends annually. To guide these increases in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.21 per share on September 10 to shareholders of record as of August 24, up 31% from year-ago. Since the IPO, our dividend has increased nearly five-fold from the initial annual level of $0.17 per share. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 times to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 2.5 times. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions, our CDW UK investment is an excellent example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. At the end of June, we had $682 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation priorities support our 2018 targets, which you see on slide 22. As Tom mentioned, we now expect full-year U.S. IT market growth to be in the 3% and 3.25% range and CDW to outperform the market by roughly 375 basis points on a constant currency basis. We now look for currency to contribute roughly 30 basis points to annual sales growth assuming year-to-go exchange rates of $1.30 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. Given year-to-date exchange rates, this implies currency headwinds of roughly 30 basis points in the second half of 2018. Given our first-half performance and year-to-go expectations, we expect to exceed our previous 2018 non-GAAP EPS growth target in constant currency and now look for non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the high-20s. We expect currency to have a similar impact on EPS growth as sales growth. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to come in roughly 5 basis points to 10 basis points or so below the high end of our high-7s to 8% annual target range as tax reform investments impact expenses. Keep in mind that these are annual targets not quarterly. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling the rest of our 2018 financials, I am on slide 23. Based on first half results and the expectations for the rest of the year, we look for sales in the second half to now be roughly 75 basis points lower than our historical seasonality split of approximately 52% in the second half. We expect a low single-digit increase in sequential average daily sales from Q2 to Q3 in line with the average of the past three years. We expect quarterly depreciation and amortization to continue at roughly $67 million per quarter, $47 million of which is for purchased intangibles. Annual book interest expense is now expected to be slightly below $155 million. We now look for annual equity compensation to be roughly $5 million lower than 2017. We also now expect to be at the lower half of our full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate range of 26% to 27%. Excess tax benefits will impact our GAAP tax rate in Q3 and Q4, but are excluded from the non-GAAP effective tax rate. Our annual non-GAAP EPS growth target is now high-20s in constant currency and is expected to grow approximately 350 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling cash flows, I am on slide 24. First, we expect our capital expenditures to be slightly above 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. We also expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within our target range of high-teens to low-20s. For the full-year, we expect a cash tax rate in the 26% to 27% range to be applied to pre-tax book income, before acquisition-related intangibles amortization, which is approximately $47 million per quarter. In addition, with the reduction in our tax rate, we expect to pay approximately $13 million in 2018 for tax-related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. 2018 is the final year of payments. We continue to expect annual free cash flow to come in at the low end of our tax reform enhanced rule of thumb run rate between 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. This reflects 2017's over-delivery of 50 basis points above our pre-tax reform rule of thumb due to timing and assumes we manage inventory in the ordinary course during the second half of 2018. Given 2017's over-delivery of free cash flow, we continue to expect to deploy cash in excess of 2018 free cash flow and you should expect us to return this cash in order of our capital priorities. That concludes the financial summary. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Amit. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, Tom. Congrats on a nice quarter by the way, guys. I have a question and a follow-up. I guess, let me start with. If I think about the growth rate you saw in Q2 around 7.5% and the first half is now, I think, average at 9%. And you said, you raised the 2018 guide, but it still implies growth is decelerating in the back half to around 5% versus the 9% you saw in H1. Could you just maybe walk through what are the drivers that are driving this deceleration in the back half or is it just a healthy dose of conservatism baked into the numbers here? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Look, that's a good question. Some of it is just looking at what's in front of us. We've got some pretty challenging comps sitting in front of us. If you think about last year's third quarter, some if it is, you've heard some supply chain things knocking around that could impact client devices or another kind of thing that's kind of out there, staring us in the face, so as we have been thinking about this and we felt this way since the beginning of the year truthfully. We knew that the third quarter would be an interesting challenge, then have some opportunity to make up some ground on the fourth quarter. So, it's really just trying to look at those things, in light of the success we've had on the first half of the year. I think, general consensus, if you look at whether it's adding additional customer facing co-workers or some of the other comments we've made. We feel pretty good about our rhythm of the business. It's just some of those other factors. Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Amit, I'd just add a couple of thoughts to Tom's comments. One is, I think when you think about the first half of the year, we did 9% reported, but obviously currency was a tailwind, so think of it is 8.2% on a constant currency basis and remember we also got the benefit of the supply chain backlog that went in the first half of the year. And so, think of it on a more of a normalized constant currency basis, probably something more like in the high-7s is what we ran in the first half of the year. I know you were doing the math on the fly there, but if I think you take my thoughts on the full-year, it will give you something in the back half for the year in the mid-6s, high-6s, constant currency around there. So, I don't think the step down is as great as you thought; and again, Tom has explained some of the drivers around it, but think about the step up and the overlap we have as we move into the back half of the year, particularly in the international part of the business. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No, perfect. That's really helpful, guys. And if I can just quickly follow-up. I think I heard the NetComm revenues were down in the quarter. Could you just maybe talk about what drove that down, take it somewhat surprising, given the trends some of the OEMs are seeing. So, could you maybe just flesh that piece out a bit? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. For us, it was shipping. Our ridings, our bookings, whatever term you want to use felt good. We just had some challenges getting stuffs shipped. It was not to the same degree we saw in the fourth quarter, but had kind of similar characteristics, which is why I commented Amit on the confidence we have of the back orders getting out the system. I'd say that was the biggest driver and then a little bit is, for us, a lot of our NetComm growth in the last year or so was in K-12 and they've kind of digested a lot under the E-Rate program. So, I would say, it was really those two factors, which I feel more comfortable when we can articulate what impacted something when I talked in with confidence about our business going forward. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Amit. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Matt. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thank you and good morning, folks. Just a question regarding the guidance, particularly on the government area where you talked about some issues. You're guiding generally seasonally for Q3. Does that imply that you'll see the normal federal budget flush or given the issues and given some of the tough comps from last year, is that not going to play out? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'll give you a headline and I'll let Chris give you some color, Matt. I don't know that I would sense that it's a normal year for us, in part, because of the slippage that you heard Chris talk about. That does give us some confidence as far as shipping; but I think when you think about some of the other factors that are somewhat new, Matt for example, the success of our cloud selling into the federal government, which kind of has, it's like a double-edged sword on one hand, it pressures your top line; but on the other hand, it creates a significant profit. I think that's part of the logic behind talking about what we think out of the federal government. We do expect state and local to continue its pretty amazing track record of growth. Chris? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Tom, I would just emphasize that as we think about the third quarter, I would think more about the back half of the year, given the shipping delays we've experienced, we're being a little cautious there. And the positive is the cloud acceleration we're seeing in the federal space is really interesting, so I would look at the back of the year and say we're going to have \u2013 we expect to have pretty solid business performance, and I say solid business performance because we're overlapping some tremendous comps, so maybe not ecstatic growth rates, but very solid performance. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's quite helpful. And then, just shifting gears, well tying in the cloud acceleration you're seeing in federal, talk about what you're seeing on the enterprise and SMB side. I know there is a big client device upgrade refresh going on, but as clients shift their budgets towards solutions, do you think we'll see an acceleration there or whether it continue to be that hybrid model where they're upgrading their hardware and moving certain workloads off-premise? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Matt, I continue to be, I guess a fan of the hybrid answer, because I think customers continue to, want to move workloads around. I think one of the things that we're seeing even more so now is the requirement for flexibility realizing that in any given period you may move workloads around. We do expect continued client growth as you pointed out in our Corporate business, but I also want to make sure that we draw attention to the good performance in solutions. So, it's not just fueled by one particular product category and it's ironic as far as cloud adoption in our business, while federal and state and local recently have become fast growers and adopters. Corporate is the organization that's got the highest volume of cloud solutions for our customers. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right, Matt. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. I just want to stick on the cloud topic. Tom, could you maybe remind us of some of the cloud metrics. I think you've given cloud as a percent of gross profit dollars and I would have to imagine a good portion of that is Azure, because what I'm trying to get at is, I know AWS is not going to be as meaningful as those gross profit dollars in 2018, but just trying to get a sense for what it could be in 2019 and beyond. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Well, if you think about it Adam, it is a combination of SaaS and Infrastructure as a Service that make up the bulk of the cloud business we do today. If you think about it in terms of workloads, its productivity, its backup, its business analytics, and security are the ones driving the cloud adoption. It continues to be \u2013 it had a meaningful high double-digit growth rate in net sales in the quarter. And as you do point out, since so much of that is netted down, you can assume that the gross profit growth is consistent with the sales growth, because they are virtually equal. So, we've been working on this since 2011, Adam, and I think the idea of creating kind of a cloud business unit within CDW, which gives you the ability to concentrate expertise is paying huge dividends for us. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And maybe shifting gears to capital allocation. I know that slide used to say tuck-in accretive acquisitions and was changed to expand strategic capabilities over the past couple of quarters. Can you maybe just touch on the reasoning for that change and with over $1 billion, I think, availability in terms of credit lines. Would you consider an acquisition larger like that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So, I'll take the first part, Adam. The answer to your last question is, yes. And look, I think we've tried to be really transparent about this. I think demonstrating the UK acquisition and the size of that and obviously our ability to successfully execute post the acquisition, it's a meaningful part of our growth strategy at this point. And there is an interesting reason for the slight change in verbiage. It had to do with I think the verbiage, of course had something accretive and people tended to think that meant immediately accretive versus accretive over the life of the deal, so we tried to get more clarity; but it's interesting when we try to get more clarity, we seem to get more questions along the way. But inorganic growth will continue to be part of our strategy and I think I've been pretty clear about that going forward. It will depend on right situation and we continue to look in the marketplace, but are thrilled with our organic growth along the way. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Shannon. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Good morning. I just had, I'm curious, you're hiring a number of people obviously, your model is to hire. Given the tight employment market right now, are you seeing any challenges? Are you having to pay more? What's it like out there? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I don't know that we have to pay more, because our model is our model, but that doesn't mean we don't have to be more creative and more thoughtful and more focused on bringing people in. While we continue to increase the numbers I don't think the numbers are so big that it overly stresses the system, but I think your instincts are right with the labor market. It is a little harder and requires us to be a little more focused today than maybe four years or five years ago absolutely. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I would tell you one thing, Shannon. The one area where you do see is when you're not so much hiring the salespeople; but on the technical side, is probably where you see a little more of the cost pressure than on the direct selling organization. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : And that's why everybody's kids should go be a coder. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Who said? Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : No. Business people are important too. I guess, my other question is just from a client perspective and talking to the OEMs, certainly the leading OEMs, they seem to believe that this is going to be, maybe more sustainable at least on the Corporate side than sort of historical levels, just in terms of, in relatively mid-innings with the Win 10 refresh overall and people still looking to try to get more feature functionality out of the devices that are out there, so they need newer ones? I'm curious what your customers are saying. I mean do you see, I mean we hear some stuff, but do you see any kind of idea that this slows dramatically or do you think this is maybe something that lasts for a couple of years, maybe not at these levels though? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. Okay. So, I do think it's obviously lasting longer than we thought, which has been great. One of the things, I think Chris and her team has pointed out though is an interesting fact is some of what we think is driving, especially in the Corporate space, the client's continued growth is the full employment and that people are going to need more and more client devices to support full employment and so that makes some sense especially for that part of our Corporate world that's in the technology sector, so that would be number one. Then you have some kind of the counter would be, if there is some supply chain shortages. What does that mean? Now, we've been very proactive in that area as far as, this is where we get the leverage, our warehouse and distribution capability, because we can aggressively kind of buy more stock and make sure that we have availability for our customers. So do I think it continues? I think it's proven. It's gone longer than normal. What I'd say, I think you said multiple years. I'm probably not willing to go out on a limb yet and say it's multiple years. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Hey, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, how are you? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Everything that you've said about hiring, the environment is certainly constructive, but I just wanted to ask about the Small Business segment, because there was a slowdown and that was the segment that led you into the acceleration on the better macro environment last year, so just curious whether you would read anything into that slowdown in terms of those businesses starting to react a little bit to whatever it is, the trade-rhetoric or the stock market starting to flatten out? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Hi, Katy. It's Chris. I'll start and then Tom can add additional color. We continue to see confidence in that market, so I wouldn't read too much into it. One of the key goals as we created the new business unit was to focus on profitable growth and the team did a terrific job this quarter doing just that, including frankly, improving client margins. So, when you think about cloud growth in that area that would mute the top line and how we sell and what we sell and the discipline around that. I think that may have contributed to a slower growth rate, but we were very much focused on profitability, particularly as we grow our eCommerce investments. And we continue to align resources to best deliver cost effective value to our customers. So, I really wouldn't read too much into that from a confidence perspective. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I don't have anything that I can add. Go ahead. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's a great segue to my second question, which is, I was surprised to see or hear that the product margins expanded, given the weakness in NetComm and storage, where margins are typically higher. Can you just talk about what drove the customer mix shift that allowed you to expand margins? It sounds like some of that came on the client side. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: It did. I think one of the things is when you mix in and out of some segments. Katy, you remember that, those have different margins, had an impact. When you have the really strong software quarter we had on gross profits, that clearly lifted margins in the quarter. I would probably look at those two things as the biggest contributor and then we had as you heard, a really strong servers quarter, which again contributed, so I'd probably put it in those three buckets. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Katy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Sherri. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning, how are you? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Doing great. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. I guess, I thought I would ask about the cloud business and the rollout of the AWS platform this quarter. How do you think about rolling that out over the next year and now you've got Azure and AWS. Are there other platforms that you have that you think customers are interested in? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Well, look as you heard, we're doing a pretty controlled introduction. I think one of the things that was really important to us, when you bring on a platform like AWS, and a new partner like AWS, is to ensure that the delivery meets everybody's expectations, not just the customers' but AWS's and CDW's. And so, our experience in doing this now, we tend to say look, let's make sure we get it right and then we'll roll it out to the broader group. Believe me, I've got lots of salespeople in other parts of the organization who are saying why not us, but our goal would be over the next, probably quarter to two is just to ensure we get the right kind of rollout and then probably more broadly in 2019. Regarding the second part of your question, we've continued to add partners to our cloud platform and we'll do so. I think at this point though, digesting AWS and then having the Microsoft Azure product, which has been a great source of growth for us and the AWS product is enough for right now as far as our focus, because one of the things we're careful of is we don't dilute our focus in the marketplace. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then thinking about your international business, Chris, I think you said referrals to the UK from the U.S. were up 30%. Are there additional businesses that you think it would make sense to add on at this point, additional acquisitions, or do you feel comfortable with your ability to grow your international business with what you have currently? Thanks. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Sherri, I would echo what Tom said earlier and answer those questions with yes. We feel confident in our ability to grow internationally. We have a lot of good things happening, but particularly with Brexit looming, we continue to think about where it would make sense to expand internationally through acquisition, absolutely. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Thanks so much for taking the questions. It sounded like, the solutions business in the UK and Canada is doing very well and it sort of compares to a slower rate of adoption in your North American segments. Is that correct? And if it is correct, what do you think accounts for the rapid place of adoption there on a relative basis. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I don't know that I'd say it's a slower rate of adoption, the way I would describe it. I think there is a lot into a growth rate in a given quarter and some of it is the comp from the year before. And so, I don't think it was anything uniquely different. I think the referral business has been a good source of stimulus, if you will, for our UK business. In the case of Canada, they have just started within the last 18 months to really focus on solutions and so you still have a relatively small base, but they've now developed a good track record. So, I think the characteristics Paul are a little different in each. The supply chain issues become a little different in each and the actual composition of solutions are still a little different in each. So, I think that probably is a better way to think about some of the differences you get inside of solutions and as you know more so than the client business the solutions business can be more lumpy because of the size of the projects and I think that's another consideration. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That makes sense. You don't seem to be impeded in any way by the slight labor market, but I'm wondering if any of your customers or your customer segments are experiencing bottlenecks that might be slowing down sales a little bit for you as well. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I don't know. I'd let Chris. I don't think I've heard that and usually I hear just about every reason that exist on the earth if sales aren't as good as they should be, but I haven't heard that one, but now I may after your question. Chris, anything I don't think so. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: No, we haven't heard, no. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning, guys. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Keith. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Tom, can you provide a little color \u2013 I guess because (57:12) we're hearing from some investors these days in terms of the potential trade war in tariffs. How it may impact the demand from your customers? Are you hearing any concern from your customers about what their spending patterns are? And that's the first part of the question. And second, in terms of the tariffs, are you seeing any pressure or do you anticipate any pressure on pricing of the products as it relates to tariffs? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: So, let me make sure I get this. I think the first answer would be, do we hear about it? Yes. Do I think it's impacted their decision making at this point? No. So, I mean, if you look at our results, it would suggest that while there clearly is a lot of rhetoric out there and everyday it seems like a new bit of news. People seem to continue to focus on their business. So, from that part. And on the second part, we haven't seen what I would call meaningful impact on \u2013 as a result of the tariffs at this point, whether it's in increased costs or cost that we can pass along to customers. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. And then just next question for you. In terms of the UK business and Canadian business, obviously you guys have shown some incredible growth rates in that area. Is all of that business sustainable in terms of the relationship being formed, (58:36) the sales guys are in place? Or is someone's being driven by one-off business that concerns you from a sustainability standpoint? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I think I'll let Chris answer that, because I'm interested in her answer. Go ahead. Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: I wouldn't think of it as a one-off business. There is great momentum in both businesses and I credit the teams there for being very strategically focused on how to grow their businesses and also what I'll call non-glamorous stuff of prescriptively managing the business. As we think about second half of the year, two things, first of all, they're both, they're incredibly high comps over last year, so while we expect them to continue to perform well and drive growth and execute end-market, we do have two incredibly high comps. The other thing is, just the uncertainty in both markets that we're often cautious of, but I would not think about it as one-off. I would think about it as strong momentum on the business based on implementing strategic initiatives quite well and executing end-market prescriptively. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Chris, is it possible to provide any data in terms of the amount of employees you guys have added over the UK over the past year? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I don't think \u2013 we don't provide that data. I can give you a little color and tell you that we are hiring in market in a way that is relative to how the growth is. So, we've been positively growing the co-workers \u2013 customer facing co-workers in both of those markets. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have today for questions. So with that said, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chairman and CEO, Mr. Tom Richards for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thank you. Thank you again, everybody for your time this morning and your questions. And I'll leave you with a final thought. For those of you that are parents out there and I'm sure you started your summer with blissful dreams about summer vacations, that now has morphed into to watching the calendar. So hang in there, school starts soon. See you. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

I'm delighted to hand this responsibility off to Chris and I'm confident she will do an excellent job on future calls just as I'm confident she'll do an excellent job as she takes the reigns as CDW's new CEO on January 1. But for today, unfortunately for you, I'm at the helm and I'm very pleased to report that once again CDW posted an excellent quarter with strong sales and profitability. Results included an 11.2% increase in average daily net sales with net sales of $4.4 billion, up 11.4% in constant currency; a 9.3% in adjusted EBITDA to $355 million; and a 31% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.42. Year-to-date, we've delivered 10% net sales growth, 10% adjusted EBITDA growth and 35% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Once again our ability to deliver this excellent performance was a result of three key drivers : Our balanced portfolio of customer end markets; the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio; and our ongoing execution against our three-part strategy. Let's take a look at how each of these drivers help deliver profitable growth this quarter. First our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. As you know, we have five U. S. sales channels : Corporate which serves customers with coworkers from roughly 250 and up; small business which asserts customers with roughly 20 to 250 coworkers, healthcare government and education. Inside each channel we have teams focused on specific customer end markets. For example in government we have federal and state and local teams. Each one of our U.S. channels generated more than $1 billion in 2017. We also have our Canadian and UK operations which together delivered more than $1 billion in 2017 also. The beauty of our unique customer end markets is that they often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each. This quarter each of our five U.S. sales channels as well as our UK and Canadian local markets results increased high-single digits or better. Within a couple of these channels customer end market performance was mix but overall growth was very strong, a testament to our balance. Chris is going to take you through how each of the customer end markets performed. Chris? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Our corporate team delivered a 10% increase in the quarter. Strong economic growth and full employment kept client devices front and center for Corporate customers. So while lapping last year's double-digit growth in client devices, this quarter client devices increased more than 20%. This contributed to excellent high-teens transactional growth. Solutions increases in the mid-teens in two of our end markets were offset by softness in other end markets as they faced tough compares and overall Corporate solution sales were flat. Small Business delivered an 11% increase. Customers in this space were very optimistic in the quarter about the economy and their business prospect and that certainly came through in their buying. In addition to customer enthusiasm, we also benefited from ongoing success aligning solutions resources and enhancing our focus in go-to-market approach. So while we saw high-single digit growth in transactions, we were very pleased to see solutions grow nearly twice as fast, driven by meaningful increases in security, storage and servers. Public performance was strong across all three of our large customer channels. In total, up 11%. Transactions posted solid results with mid-single digit growth. Solutions delivered excellent results, increasing high teens more than twice the rate of transactions. Our Government channel increased 8%. The state and local team delivered mid-teens growth driven by ongoing success executing against new and existing contracts as well as continuing to meet public safety needs. Federal delivered a low-single digit increase. These are excellent results given the tough comparisons the team has faced throughout the year as a result of their success in 2017 meeting DoD demand for Win 10 devices and those comparisons are even larger in the fourth quarter. The federal team drove excellent solutions performance this quarter delivering a mid-teens increase. In particular, we saw continued success from programs in place to drive integrated solutions like CANES, the Navy's floating cloud program and you solutions aligned with DoD goals to enhance cybersecurity and enhance combat readiness. Education increased 15%. K-12 had an excellent quarter, up nearly 20%. A portion of this growth reflected catch up from the second quarter. Recall K-12 performance was muted in the second quarter. This was in part due to delays in Chromebook shipments, which we expected to flush in both the third and fourth quarters. Instead they all shipped in the third quarter resulting in nearly 30% growth in Chromebooks. A second driver of K-12 growth was networking, which increased high-single digits. You will recall that challenges with newly implemented systems delayed the issuance of E-rate funding letters in 2017. This year funding was in line with typical seasonality coming through during the summer implementation season. The team also had continued success delivering innovative learning environment. Higher Education was flat, as sales cycles extended with customers evaluating multiple options including cloud-based solutions. Healthcare increased 8% as customers continued to move past reimbursement uncertainty and executed plan. Solutions posted a high-teens increase driven by merger-related infrastructure consolidation and ongoing mobility needs. Our international teams continued to deliver excellent growth with combined sales up nearly 20% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, UK was up double-digits and Canada was up high-single digits. These results demonstrate the team's continued excellent focus and execution. They also demonstrate the success of recent strategic investments made in both markets. In Canada, investments made in adding technical coworkers helped drive solutions growth that was twice as fast as transactions. In the UK, investments made in building out a team focused on meeting UK central government needs delivered excellent growth with sales to the UK government more than doubling. In addition to strong local growth, U.S. to UK referrals had another excellent quarter. Brexit does not appear to be impacting demand yet. While the outcome is uncertain, we are in the process of implementing contingency plans in the event that an agreement or an extension to negotiations is not in place by the mandated March 29, 2019 date. All in all, the teams had an excellent quarter delivering profitable growth. Tom? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Clearly, this quarter's results demonstrate the power of the first driver of our performance; our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. It also demonstrates the power of the second driver of performance, our broad portfolio of more than 100,000 products and solutions from more than 1,000 leading and emerging partners. This quarter, we had excellent balance across transactions and solutions with both increasing in line with total company growth. We also had balanced performance across hardware, software and services, all posting double-digit increases. Hardware growth of 10% was fueled by both transactions and solutions. In transactions, we delivered another double-digit quarter of growth in client devices as well as high-single digit growth in video. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in client devices, the longest refresh streak in recent history. On the hardware solutions side, NetComm increased mid-single digits. While much of the growth was driven by E-rate, we also saw high-single digit or better growth in federal, state and local, Small Business and Healthcare. Data center results were excellent with double-digit growth in servers, driven by execution against programs, focused on modernization and enterprise storage, driven by new architectures. New architectures are also driving software performance as it becomes a larger component of IT solutions. You clearly see that in our software performance this quarter with network management, virtualization and security coming in as our top three software growth categories. In total, software increased 11%. Services increased 12%, led by field implementations, which was driven by several large projects as well as warranties attached to our client devices. The third driver of our performance this quarter is our ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. Our first strategy is to acquire new customers and capture share. This is all about driving productivity and making it easier for our sellers to help customers. During the quarter we saw excellent results from a customer acquisition program we piloted in Corporate. Using data analytics and propensity modeling, we identified 1,400 targets in a specific geography with high opportunity to spend. We then executed a focused marketing campaign anchored with targeted e-mails and engagement triggers, along with local media coverage. More than a quarter of the prospects targeted made at least one purchase. Together they spent more than $6 million in the third quarter. Given its success, we are scaling the program to all of our Corporate end markets in 2018. We also executed campaigns to help our sellers drive increased share of wallet with existing customers. During the quarter, we had great results from a data center focused campaign. Using our proprietary customer information coupled with data from a partner we identified more than 10,000 current customers that were ready for an upgrade and who were exposed to last day of service on their existing infrastructure. We delivered the leads to our sellers and provided them with tools and support so that they could help their customers not only upgrade to the latest platforms but also refresh and modernize the underlying and supporting infrastructure. Our marketing campaign included digital media, targeted e-mails and a landing page on cdw.com. We also provided sales enablement tools, including on-demand training and sales guides along with a playbook that outlined the campaign focus and objectives. More than $100 million of data center revenue was directly tied to the campaign in the quarter. We can deliver results like this because of investments we have made in our second strategy which is to expand our capabilities to ensure we can meet our customer's evolving needs. Many of these investments are technical resources who are experts in their field and deeply understand technologies and partner-specific functionality and product features. The campaign I just referenced was supported by experts, we have across all of our areas in the data center traditional storage, server, power and cooling, new architectures like hyper-converged Infrastructure, software defined data center, cloud and Flash. These experts are clearly driving results. Emerging architectures represented nearly 30% of total storage revenues this quarter. A meaningful part of those revenues came from Flash storage solutions where we saw double-digit growth in customer spend. Flash was an integral part in a large data center refresh and modernization solution we implemented in the third quarter for a privately-owned food processing company, a long-standing customer with very small IT staff. Their infrastructure was aging and needed more performance and capacity. Production workloads were already offsite in one of our data centers but the backup copies still resided on site and their virtualization environment was about to go off support. We developed a full-scale upgrade and modernization plan including all Flash, which replaced their hybrid solution and added a second array, so they have operational recovery of their Tier 0 and Tier 1 systems. We refreshed their backup with a secondary off-site copy and provided a new compute environment and we updated their virtualization environment. In the third quarter, work on this project totaled just over $1 million. This included $800,000 in hardware $175,000 in software and $75,000 in services. That leads to our third strategy which is to enhance our services capabilities. Capabilities that enabled us to help a global athletic apparel company transform their customer experience. To do that they first needed to upgrade their old and unstable wireless in-store environment. The customer was looking for a comprehensive end-to-end solution to ensure they had reliable availability and 24/7 monitoring. We provided a complete solution encompassing network and security wrapped with our own professional and managed services. The total contract value of this solution is roughly $10 million with $4 million in services. The services are being delivered over a 36-month contract term with more than $300,000 of services provided in the quarter. One of the most important ways we enhance our ability to provide services and solutions is by adding customer-facing coworkers. You saw the impact of our investment in our customer-facing coworkers and our solutions performance this quarter which increased nearly 10%. What isn't totally captured in the numbers are performance of solutions that are netted down like cloud, which once again delivered excellent double-digit increases in customer spend. Our top three fastest-growing cloud workloads for the quarter included data analytics, productivity and security. We continue to thoughtfully invest in customer-facing coworkers and ended the quarter up roughly with 125 since the beginning of the year. This is in line with our plans for the full year which is to come in between 125 and 150 plus or minus 10%. As we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust as appropriate. And that leads me to our expectations for growth for the year. Given year-to-date market performance, we have increased our view of the 2018 U.S. IT market growth and now look for market growth a tick above 4.25%, which is 50 basis points above our previous view. To-date, we aren't seeing any significant impacts from tariffs, shortages or Brexit, but are mindful that we have two months left in the quarter. Balancing those factors with our strong performance to-date, we've also increased our expectations for exceeding market growth and now look for outperformance to be a tick above 425 basis points, also 50 basis points above our prior view. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have a winning strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro, partner or channel specific challenges, a strategy that positions us for strong growth in the future. And most importantly, a strategy that leverages our competitive advantages and flexible business model to deliver both excellent profitability and strong cash flows. This confidence has led our board to approve a 40% increase in our annual cash dividend and we are on track to achieve our capital allocation priority of delivering a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow by year-end 2019. I know many of you may be wondering what we expect for 2019. We are in the middle of our planning process. Chris and Collin will provide the 2019 outlook on our year-end conference call. With that let me turn it over to Collin, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Collin? Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of strong results consistent with our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders. Before I get started, I'd like to remind you that all financial information I will review reflects the adoption of ASC 606. So it is an apples-to-apples comparison for 2017 and 2018. Turning to our P&L on slide eight. Consolidated net sales were $4.4 billion or 11.2% higher than last year on a reported and average daily sales basis. In constant currency, consolidated net sales grew 11.4%. During the quarter we saw currency impact reverse moving from a tailwind of 60 basis points in Q2 to a headwind of 20 basis points. The impact was primarily driven by unfavorable translation of the Canadian to U.S. dollar. Sequential average daily sales growth was 6%, roughly three times our historical Q2 to Q3 average. Gross profit for the quarter increased 11.1% to $714 million. Gross margin in the third quarter was 16.3%, flat over last year. Gross margin was positively impacted by product margin improvement. This was offset by year-over-year net sales growth outpacing the year-over-year growth in partner funding. Turning to SG&A on slide nine. Our adjusted SG&A including advertising increased 12.5% compared to last year. Adjusted SG&A grew faster than sales as a result of performance-based compensation consisted of higher attainment against goals and strategic investments funded by tax reform. Coworker count was up roughly 215 since the third quarter of 2017 to 8,937. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $355 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to the prior year quarter. This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.1%. Looking at the rest of the P&L on slide 10. Interest expense in the quarter was $37 million compared to $38 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower inter-quarter borrowings on the revolver. As you can see on slide nine (sic) [slide 11] (21:46), our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to an effective tax rate of 38% last year. The reduction in effective tax rate primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of lower federal tax rate and higher excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation. Moving to slide 12. On a GAAP basis, we earned $184 million of net income, an increase of $54 million or 42% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Applying our non-GAAP effective tax rate to our non-GAAP pre-tax income resulted in non-GAAP net income of $218 million in the quarter, up 29% over the prior year quarter. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP add-backs including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27%, down 10 percentage points compared to last year's 37% rate, primarily due to the lower federal tax rate. Slide 13 shows how you can derive our non-GAAP net income. As you can see on slide 14 with third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 154 million, we delivered $1.20 of net income per share and $1.42 of non-GAAP net income per share, up 31% over the prior year quarter. Currency headwinds were a 20 basis point drag on third quarter EPS growth. Turning to year-to-date results on slides 15 through 18. Revenue was $12.2 billion, an increase of 9.8% on a reported and average daily sales basis. On a constant-currency basis, consolidated net sales in the first nine months of 2018 were 9.3% higher than the prior year. Year-to-date gross profit was $2 billion, up 9.6%. Gross profit margin was 16.5% which was down three basis points for the first nine months of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $979 million or 10% above last year. Year-to-date net income was $484 million while non-GAAP net income was $594 million, 31% above the first nine months of 2017. Non-GAAP net income per share was $3.85, up 35% from last year. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 19. As of September 30, we had $255 million of cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.4 billion. Net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 2.3 times, slightly below the low end of our target range of 2.5 to 3.0 times. Our current weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding debt is 4.2%, flat compared to last year. We are well positioned to mitigate the rising interest rate environment given our interest rate caps in place on our term loan, which includes 1.5% caps to hedge 2018 and 2.375% caps to hedge 2019 and 2020. With the caps in place, roughly 96% of our outstanding debt is either fixed rate or hedged. As you can see on slide 20, we maintained strong rolling three month working capital metrics during the quarter. For the quarter, our three-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down approximately one day from last year's third quarter and at the low end of our annual target range of high-teens to low 20s. Year-over-year, our cash conversion improved as days in inventory decreased as a result of leveraging our supplier relationships and days payable increased due to mixing into vendors with extended terms. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $459 million compared to $339 million in the first nine months of 2017. The year-over-year change in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profits and favorable timing. On slide 21, you see our four capital allocation priorities in order of precedence. First, increase dividends annually. To guide these increases, in November 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.295 per share on December 10 to shareholders of record as of November 26. This represents a 40% increase and is underpinned by our financial strategy of generating strong free cash flow and delivering shareholder value. This year's 40% increase was larger than last year because our 30% target is now applied against a higher free cash flow rule of thumb, which we increased to reflect tax performance (26:10). Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We have set a target to generally maintain net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage in the range of 2.5 to 3.0 times. We are comfortable being temporarily above or below this range, but continue to believe this target is appropriate to manage our business over the long term. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly 648,000 shares for $56 million at an average cost of $86.61 per share. For the full year, we continue to expect to return more than 3.75% of sales to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. You may recall, 3.75% to 4.25% of sales is our post-tax reform free cash flow rule of thumb, and we expect to be near the low end of the range this year because of 2017's over-delivery. Year-to-date, through October 30, we have repurchased roughly 4.1 million shares for $326 million, at an average cost of $78.89. And distributed \u2013 or committed to distribute, including today's dividend announcement, approximately $140 million in dividends. Our capital allocation priority support our 2018 targets, which you see on slide 22. As Tom mentioned, we now expect full-year U.S. IT market growth and CDW's premium to be a tick above 4.25% on a constant-currency basis. We continue to look for currency to contribute roughly 30 basis points to annual sales growth, assuming year-to-go exchange rates of $1.30 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. Given year-to-date exchange rates, this implies currency headwinds of roughly 40 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018. In light of our performance in the first nine months and year-to-go expectations, we expect to exceed our previous 2018 non-GAAP EPS growth target in constant currency, and now look for non-GAAP EPS growth to be just over 30%, which we define as 31% to 32%. We expect currency to have a similar impact on EPS growth as sales growth. While there has not been a change to our tax reform funded investment plans, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to come in roughly 5 basis points or so below the high end of our high 7%s to 8% annual target range. This reflects our year-to-date net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance. Let me provide you with a few additional comments for those modeling the rest of our 2018 financials. I'm on slide 23. For the full year, we look for top line over performance of a tick above 425 basis points above the market. We continue to expect a currency tailwind of 30 basis points, which implies a meaningful swing year-over-year from a tailwind to a headwind in the fourth quarter. We expect quarterly depreciation and amortization to continue at roughly $67 million per quarter, $47 million of which is for purchased intangibles. Annual book interest expense is now expected to be just above $150 million. We also continue to look for annual equity compensation to be roughly $5 million lower than 2017. We continue to expect to be near the low end of our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate range of 26% to 27%. Excess tax benefits will impact our GAAP tax rate in Q4, but are excluded from the non-GAAP effective tax rate. As I mentioned, our annual non-GAAP EPS growth target is now just above 30% in constant currency in the 31% to 32% range, and is now expected to grow between 350 basis points and 400 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Finally, a few notes for those of you modeling cash flows. I'm on slide 24. First, we expect our capital expenditures to be roughly 0.5% of net sales on an annual basis. We also expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within our target range of high-teens to low 20s. For the full year, we now expect a cash tax rate in the 25% to 26% range to be applied to pre-tax book income before acquisition-related intangibles amortization which is approximately $47 million per quarter. In addition, with the reduction in our tax rate, we expect to pay approximately $13 million in 2018 for tax related to the cancellation of debt income we incurred in 2009. 2018 is the final year of payments. As previously discussed, we continue to expect annual free cash flow to come in at the low end of our tax reform enhanced rule of thumb run rate between 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. This reflects 2017's over delivery of 50 basis points above our pre-tax reform rule of thumb due to timing and assumes we manage inventory in the ordinary course during the fourth quarter of 2018. That concludes the financial summary. With that let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Operator, please provide the instructions for asking a question. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Amit. Operator : Amit your line is open. Please check your mute button. Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. This is Amitesh for Amit Daryanani. Thanks for taking our question. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning. Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So based on the 2018 target of like roughly 9%, December quarter, as per our math, is probably like sequential decline in 8% to 9% which is above the seasonality, which is like 4% to 5%. So what is the challenge here? Is it the comps or are there any other headwinds there? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think if you think about \u2013 there's a couple of things. One is, I think I'll start by saying, we feel good about the fourth quarter. I think part of the challenge for us is how good the third quarter was. And if you talk about what happened we had a number of events that kind of simultaneously improved the performance in the third quarter. So first was, think about that K-12 Chromebooks that didn't get out in the second quarter. We expected them to get out in the third and fourth quarter and they all got out in the third quarter. Then there was, what I'll call, the return to norm of the E-rate process, which last year had a tendency to drag out because it took a while for the funding letters to get done. This year it was efficient and on time, and all of that got done in the third quarter. And then I think to your point, the last thing that we think about is just the federal sales organization and you heard Chris alluded to the comps they've been fighting. I mean, those three things kind of explain why they might appear to be bigger than normal deceleration but I'll take it if it comes on the heels of such a strong third quarter. Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. I guess, if you could just have a follow-up on that Tom or Collin. If I look at your overall leverage today, it's below this 2.5 to 3.0 times target that you guys have talked about. And given the strong free cash flow generation you guys would expect for the next several quarters, do you think that leverage is going to keep going below the target ranges? Or do we just have to think that buybacks perhaps could be ahead of what the total free cash flow generation is? Just walk through the free cash flow generation, how you use it, given the fact you're below your leverage targets right now. And then best of luck in your future Tom. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I'll say thank you and then I'll let Collin answer the question. Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Yeah. as I said in my prepared comments, we continue to believe 2.5 to 3.0 times is the right leverage ratio. When we thought about the plan for 2018, we built it assuming the first quarter and the fourth quarter would be our strong free cash flow quarters. And when you look at history, third quarter, fourth quarter timing can be a little volatile and what we saw was more of that free cash flow show up in the third quarter than we had originally planned. So I think of that as just timing versus the fourth quarter. I would expect us to \u2013 as we cycle through the fourth quarter and follow our capital allocation plans and free cash flow timing normalizes that we would be closer to that lower end of the range over time. Amitesh Bajad - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning Matt. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus and Company : Thank you. Good morning, Tom and everyone. Just a question regarding your comments on the PC refresh cycle which, as you pointed out, has been strong for a few quarters now. And there's also talk about that (35:23) because with Microsoft dropping support for Windows 7 in early 2020 and this conversion to Windows 10, what are your thoughts on that? Are you having conversations with customers about that? Do you think there's more legs to this cycle here? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah, Matt. There's a lot I think that we need to think about when it comes to the continuation of the PC refresh. I mean there are all kinds of discussions going on with customers. And as you can imagine, they run the gamut of gee, I'd like to stay on Windows 7. How do I do that? Can I accomplish that? Is there a possibility of buying ahead? Is there a possibility of buying Win 10 devices and then doing the downgrade? Then you have the notion of just, what's going on with the chips and should I be acquiring more inventory? I'm speaking as a customer. So I think it gets hard. We continue to feel very good. If you think about what's going on. You have full employment in the economy. That type of environment has driven what we believe is the continuation of a really strong refresh cycle in our Corporate segment, as customers need to have the technology to support the full employment environment. So I think, we would expect the refresh to continue. Maybe not at these incredible growth rates that we've experienced, but I would also say Matt, you got to step back and say, there's a lot going on over the next couple of quarters that could kind of move that one way or the other. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus and Company : Fair enough. And then on tariffs. It doesn't sound like you're seeing much impact there. There does seem to be concern, particularly with networking products which could be subject to 25% tariffs in January. Again, there are you seeing any desire or conversations with customers about pulling in some inventory or product in advance of that? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, there are discussions as you point out. Everybody is talking about it. I think in some cases, people have already increased their purchasing. I believe we saw some of that in the third quarter. I can't prove that. But I don't believe we're having what I would call a mass trend of people \u2013 I wish we were kind of \u2013 mass trend of people saying, can we acquire NetComm equipment in the fourth quarter? I don't believe we've seen that in mass yet. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus and Company : Okay. All right, thanks a lot. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: All right. Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Thank you very much. My first question is just can we dig a bit more into your expectations of increased market growth and then obviously, CDW outperforming that in terms of what specific areas you're looking at whether its geographic or within some of the products in terms of what's really sort of outperforming and what you think is going to do well in the next few quarters? Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yes. Good morning. Shannon, it's Tom. I'd say a couple of things. One, it's almost, all of the above would be probably the way to start. If you think about the quarter we just experienced and the balance of execution, not only across the segments but also across the products and solutions suite. In some ways, this is the quarter you dream about because you've got all of your segments having meaningful growth for the most part and you've got balance across all the different products and solutions; hardware, software and services. Now predicting that into the future is always a little bit of a challenge. But when we looked back over what we had accomplished to this point and assessed CDW's overall performance compared to where the market had grown, we thought it was appropriate to take up not only the market growth from what we had shared with you before, but also our outperformance. And like I said, while we're only one month into the fourth quarter and there's a number of wildcards that are sitting out there that could impact the quarter we've been thrilled with the momentum in the business. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : It reminds me a lot of Microsoft's quarter in that there's very few things to pick at. So I just wonder how long it continues. I guess, my second question is just then looking again, sort of, going back to your leverage ratio and how you're below it, thoughts on acquisitions \u2013 expansion from that standpoint in terms of use of cash? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Yeah. I think we've \u2013 I don't think, as you heard Collin talk about why the leverage ratio was a little below our range. We don't think of it as that's a reason for us to go out and be aggressively looking for acquisitions. We think about acquisitions in a strategic perspective and I think I've mentioned on a number of calls, we continue to look for those opportunities that are out in the marketplace that seem to meet our strategy and have the right kind of financial picture. So I wouldn't connect the dot there that the cash flow that you saw would motivate that at this point in time. Collin, you want to add anything? Collin B. Kebo - CDW Corp.: The only thing I would add on to that is we have said that if we were to do something on the M&A front we would use that as an opportunity to add some leverage and move more within the target range. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you. And Tom, good luck on the golf course and enjoy your era sleeping in. I'm sure that probably doesn't happen very much right now. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Those are two things that are high on the list Shannon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Adam. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start just kind of building off the strategic question, and if I could ask this to Chris. On one hand you've had success with obviously the UK expansion, and one could say you could copy and paste that model elsewhere. On the other hand, it looks like you might have an opportunity to pursue more solutions-oriented business and further expand outside of hardware. Can you just talk about the decision process and very best opportunity for inorganic expansion would be in your mind? Christine A. Leahy - CDW Corp.: I think, Adam I'd start with where we serve, which is across the entire portfolio and what the customers need in each end market. So for example, if you take Canada, Canada was more highly transaction-oriented market and customers were talking with us more about their needs in the solutions space and we've made some significant investments in our resources out there, our technical resources, our go-to-market approach, et cetera. And have expanded the mix in that market quite heavily over the past couple of years. In the U.S., I would say it's the same thing. So, if you look across Corporate as an example and the solutions that we're selling within different end markets and the performance within those end markets, it can be while there are similarities in terms of what customers are looking for advice about, what we're actually selling can be different. And so we tend to focus at the micro-level first with the customers and their needs and then build-out very specific plans around those. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe if I could just ask one demand related question, I don't know if Tom wants to answer this one. But upstream in the supply chain, obviously, we're hearing the chip companies citing slowness, downstream trends are more mixed, but obviously very strong revenue growth from CDW here today. I'm sure we'll get the question if this is the peak, especially with the sequential growth implied in Q4. So I'm hoping that you can maybe break apart some of the moving parts to Q3 and would we be seeing seasonal trends in Q4 ex the Chromebook outperformance and other things like that? Or are you implying that Q4 is actually going to be below seasonal ex those things? Thanks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, I think the other thing that I mentioned in there Adam was the comps that we have in federal, which were pretty meaningful in the third quarter and will continue to be so in the fourth quarter. Because if you remember, last year we had the, what I'll call, the tail end of the Win 10 DoD flush, which was just amazing when you look back at the amount of product that moved through the system. So I think that sits on top of the growth that we talked to about what was going on in the third quarter. And the other thing is in fairness to the guys in the UK, we continue to say that the percentage of increase on their comps is incredible. And look up to this point they've done a pretty meaningful job. But you have to kind of be realistic about looking at those two scenarios and their implication. The demand in the marketplace feels good. And yes, I think you're right. You've got, well, what's the impact of the chip short is going to be. And one of the things that CDW has been able to do, it's part of our competitive advantage is because of our scale and our warehousing capability is to be very aggressive in acquiring inventory for our customers. That doesn't necessarily mean you can eliminate the total effect of a chip shortage, but it does mean you can mitigate a fair size of it. So we feel pretty good about that going into the fourth quarter. Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Adam. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Good morning, Katy. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I'm intrigued by the analytics campaign that you trialed in the Corporate segment this quarter. So just wondering if you can talk about whether that's something you think can extend to other segments over time and if you've been able to quantify what that could do for the business in terms of productivity or overall revenue upside over the long-term. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: The answer to \u2013 I think the first answer is yes. We are excited about extending it to other parts of the business. And as you heard me saying in the formal part of it, we're going to extend it to all of Corporate next year. I think it's a natural to think about Small Business as another place where you'd have that kind of benefit but we were obviously very pleased. I'm probably not going to tell you what I think the potential would be for CDW. Although it's going to be fun to tell it and then have Chris have to deliver it, but I think I'll just pass on that and say we're very, very pleased that we think we've got a winning formula there. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then as memory prices come down, particularly in NAND, are you seeing that flow through to storage prices and any impact on demand? Or are vendors and yourselves sort of keeping that margin and is that part of why the product margins came up in the quarter? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. Okay, let me start with the last one. I don't think that was the reason you saw increased product margins for us. I think more of that was the balance you saw in the business and our success of selling just solutions in mass which, as you know, tend to have higher margins and tends to bring up the product margin. I wouldn't say there is kind of a uniform response as far as the memory pricing driving demand in storage. I just think quite honestly, Katy, it's just the digitization of everything is driving storage demand and customers are in search of expanding capacity and we're just in the right place at the right time with the right number of solutions to take advantage of that. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for that. Tom, good luck in retirement. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Thanks, Katie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the opportunity to ask question. You guys \u2013 obviously tariffs are top of mind for everybody here. Can you guys help us understand like what part of the portfolio or the product portfolio that you guys sell both solutions as well as products are going to be subject to the 25% tariffs assuming they stay in existence here the first of the year. And then the ability for you guys, I guess, to pass on increased costs, what's your thought process there as well? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Well, so even in the first part of the tariff trilogy so to speak, we have been able to pass along those costs not literally but for the most part to customers because we operate in a cost plus environment. Again here, although you're always gated by competitive response but so far we've been able to do that. I think in the back half, you're going to see products if in fact it goes in like desktops and I think NetComm are a couple that people who have talked about pretty frequently that that could be impacted if the next shoe drops so to speak on the tariff. But again we'll approach it the same way as far as passing along costs to customers, again pending market conditions. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Would you say that the majority of your business though is going to be subject to the tariffs? Or is it less than half? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: I wouldn't say it's the majority that's for sure. And like I said, for those products that started to get touched in whenever it was, September or October, that's already kind of in the system so to speak. So I don't think you're going to see the majority of our business get impacted at this point based on what we know today. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay, great. Maybe just changing gears then slightly here. In terms of your sales offices (49:56) across the U.S., can you just remind us if there is any major metropolitan areas you guys are not in yet or I guess underpenetrated in your eyes? Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: No. I think we're pretty much everywhere we would like to be. That doesn't mean that we don't continue. When you hear me talking about adding customer-facing coworkers that is an indication of our recognition that there's increased opportunity in the marketplace, increased demand that we think we can take advantage of and that's \u2013 those gets spread across the U.S. geographically. They're actually more allocated by those vertical market segments that you hear us talk about. Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Tom Richards for closing remarks. Thomas E. Richards - CDW Corp.: Okay. Look before we \u2013 before I close, just a few comments, I think, of appreciation for those who are on the call. For the CDW customers that are on the call, thank you for the opportunity to serve you. For the CDW coworkers that I know listen to these calls, thank you for taking such great care of our customers. For our shareholders, thank you for trusting us with your investment, and to the analysts who covered us, thank you for your coverage, your questions. They've helped us tell a pretty amazing story, and you have made us better. And finally, for you parents on the call as tonight is Halloween, I'm inspired by your willingness to protect your children's health by eating their candy, each Halloween night. I hope you are also as inspired to be in the gym tomorrow morning. Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Beth. It's a pleasure to discuss CDW's results and strategic progress with you today. I'm please to report that CDW posted another excellent quarter, with strong sales and profitability. Fourth quarter results include an 8.6% increase in average daily sales, with net sales of $4.1 billion, up 9% in constant currency, an 8.8% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $323 million, and a 34.4% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.32. The strong performance contributed to an excellent 2018. For the year, we delivered 9.5% net sales growth with $16.2 billion of net sales, 9.8% adjusted EBITDA growth, and 35.1% to non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Our ability to deliver the strong fourth quarter and full-year performance was the result of three key drivers, our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio, and our ongoing execution against our three-part strategy. Let's take a look at how each of these drivers helped deliver profitable growth. First, our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, as you know, we have five U.S. channels, Corporate, which serves customers with coworkers from roughly 250 and up; Small Business, which serves customers with roughly 20 to 250 coworkers; and Healthcare, Government, and Education. Within each channel we have teams further focused on customer end-markets and verticals. For example, in Government we have Federal with teams focused on serving the Department of Defense, and across civilian agencies, as well as state and local teams. Each of our U.S. channels generated more than $1.3 billion of net sales in 2018. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations which together delivered nearly $1.9 billion of net sales in 2018. Our customer end-markets often act counter-cyclically given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each one. You see the benefit of our diverse customer end-markets in our fourth quarter results with four of our five channels as well as the U.K. and Canadian local markets increased high single digits or better. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter performance, our corporate team delivered a 15% increase in net sales. Strength in the economy with healthy employment continued to create a significant customer demand for client devices. Our unique ability to meet these needs drove client device growth of over 25% in the quarter. This was on top of last year's high-teens growth. Client devices and video contributed to excellent double-digit transactional growth. At the same time, we continue to leverage our technical capabilities and strong solutions portfolio to help customers modernize their IT infrastructure and adapt more flexible architectures. This drove double-digit solutions growth. Server, storage, and NetComm were the leading growth categories in Corporate. Small Business delivered an 18% increase. Customers remained optimistic about the economy and their businesses. This clearly impacted their buying this quarter. At the same time, we continue to benefit from the focus we created with the standalone segment and investments made in our go-to-market approach. The team delivered double-digit growth in both transactions and solutions. Within solutions, NetComm was strong as we helped customers realize the benefits of more flexible architectures. Public high single-digit increases in healthcare and education were offset by government, which was down 12%. Solid growth in solutions across public drove a mid-teens increase in gross profit. Our government channel results reflect a high-teens decrease in federal. As we've discussed, the team faced strong comparisons throughout the year as a result of their success in 2017 meeting Department of Defense demand for Win 10 devices, which had a significant ramp in the fourth quarter of 2017. The federal team once again delivered excellent solutions performance this quarter with growth of over 20%, as they helped customers with continuing priorities around modernizing infrastructure and cybersecurity. The government shutdown did not have a meaningful impact on our fourth quarter results. State and local is down low single digits. The team drove strong growth in software as a service and services supporting infrastructure projects, both of these moderate top line growth as software as a service and certain services are accounted for on a netted down basis. Education increased 8%; K-12 was up mid single digits, posting a solid quarter on the heels of strong growth in Chromebooks in the third quarter of last year. Our ability to convert demand for client devices drove mid-teens growth. This growth was partially offset by declines in networking, which we expected given timing of E-Rate funding letters in Q4 of 2017 versus Q3 of 2018. Higher education has strong growth in the quarter, up low double digits. Creating connected campuses and a secure IT environment remain top priorities for our higher education customers. Success addressing these priorities drove solutions to grow nearly twice as fast as transactions, which were up high single digits. Solutions growth was driven by meaningful increases in NetComm and security. Healthcare was up nearly 8% as we helped customers modernize their infrastructure to streamline operations and enhance patient experience. This drove solutions growth of over 20% in the quarter. Our international teams continue to deliver strong growth, with combined sales up over 10% in U.S. dollars. In local currency, the U.K. was up high teens, and Canada was up high single digits. In Canada, solutions growth continues to outpace transactions, benefiting from investments we've made in technical capabilities. Our recently announced acquisition of Scalar Decisions Inc., which I'll speak to in a moment, supports our strategic focus and efforts to expand our solutions capabilities. In the U.K., we captured strong customer demand for both datacenter and client devices which drove excellent growth in the quarter. As in the U.S., customers are evaluating hybrid solutions with interest in both on-premise and cloud-based offerings. US-to-UK referrals were again up significantly. To date, we have not seen an impact on demand from Brexit. We have implemented the contingency plans I mentioned last quarter to address the event an agreement or transition plan is not in place by the end of March. We've established a presence on the continent so that we can continue to support customers with similar service levels and minimal disruption. This is an action we would have taken anyway given CDW UK's success to date and future growth opportunities, supporting our customers with IT needs in the EU. Our results also demonstrate the power of the second driver of performance, our broad portfolio of more than 100,000 products and solutions and more than 1,000 leading and emerging partners. Fourth quarter performance was strong across hardware, software, and services. Hardware and software both increased nearly 8%, and services grew in excess of 20%. Solutions grew faster than transactions. We've talked before about the longer sales cycles and the lumpiness of solutions. And this quarter, we saw the positive impact of solutions projects coming to fruition across many of our end markets. In transactions, we continue to capture share with client device sales up high single digits, on top of last year's growth of more than 20%. Our teams were able to manage through supply constraints in the quarter by leveraging our competitive advantage of scale and use of our distribution centers. In certain products we did see extended lead times and pockets of dislocation, but we were generally able to meet the customer demand. Hardware solutions growth reflected customers executing on datacenter and networking projects driven by the strength and confidence in the economy, a need to replace aged infrastructure, and the desire to take advantage of more efficient and flexible architectures, both on-premise and cloud-based. Results also reflect investments we have made in technical resources. Services, enterprise storage, and NetComm all increased double-digit. New architectures are also driving software performance as it becomes a larger component of IT solutions. You clearly see that in our performance this quarter. Software net sales increased nearly 8%, while gross profit increased high teens. Our top three software growth categories were network management, storage management, and security software. Services increased more than 20%, led by professional services, warranties, and other services provided to help customers implement integrated solutions. Our ability to provide cloud solutions to customers also contributed to this quarter's strong results. We drove robust double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit, led by productivity, platform collaboration, and security workloads. Fourth quarter gross margin expanded 60 basis points year-over-year driven by mix. This reflected strong growth in netted down including cloud, software, and services, as well as solutions hardware. As you can see, 2018 was a year of excellent financial performance. It was also a year of continued strategic progress, which is the third driver of our performance. For CDW, our strategy starts with our customers, what do they need, how are they evolving, and how can we evolve with them to meet their needs. Our customers know that taking advantage of all productivity and growth benefits that integrated technology solutions can provide is critical for them to achieve their strategic objectives. But given limited IT resources and the ever-increasing pace of technology change, customers must evaluate their allocation of resources, and they need help making technology decisions, implementing solutions, and then managing their technology investments. Our three-part strategy is designed to make sure that customers turn to us for the help they need to make the right decisions for their businesses. Our three-part strategy for growth is to first acquire new customers and capture share. Second, enhance our solutions capabilities, and third, expand our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars intersect with each other. Each enhances our ability to profitably deliver the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. The first pillar focuses on productivity improvement. We do this through enhanced systems and data, sales force productivity initiatives, and investments in our brand and marketing. This underpins our ability to achieve our overall strategy. Productivity gains fuel our ability to invest, while delivering profitable growth. The second pillar ensures, we stay relevant to our customers and to our partners by investing in solutions capabilities that enable us to be that trusted partner for our customers. And our third pillar ensures, we have the value added services capabilities to deliver many of today's integrated end-to-end solution. The combination of these 3 interconnected pillars with our scale and scope creates a powerful differentiation in the market. Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action. The first example is the solution we are bringing to the US Census Bureau. Our services capabilities were one of the key reasons, we won the award to provide a Device as a Service as a solution for the 2020 US Census. But it was the combination of our service and logistics capabilities with our broad product portfolio and deep partner relationship that enabled to win. We were uniquely positioned to handle the provision of mobile devices and accessories, custom device configuration, wireless services deployment and secure asset management along with help desk and field support for an end-to-end solution to the field technology required to support as once every 10 year event. We're working closely with the Census Bureau on timing and expect to begin deploying devices into the field later this year. The second example is our acquisition of the Canadian solutions provider Scalar, which closed on February 1st. Scalar brings strong capabilities in areas such as security, cloud infrastructure and digital transformation. Scalar also expand our in market presence with locations across Canada. Scalar had strong local relationships in nearly 350 co-workers that at deep technical expertise, with little overlap between our customers and there's, we intend to grow our combined customer relationships and add new dimensions to the work we're already doing for them. And similar to CDW UK, we see a strong cultural fit and customer approach. And like CDW UK, we expect to drive a smart and successful integration. The final example, I wanted to share demonstrate how our ability to deliver integrated solutions help customers to achieve their strategic objectives, leveraging technology to provide an outstanding customer experience both in-store and online is a competitive imperative for retailers today. While straight forward to articulate it is extremely complex cost effectively and seamlessly deliver an end-to-end solution. We're helping a large retailers, do just that thorough our design and implementation of the hyper converged solution. That will deliver increased performance, capacity and availability of the IT infrastructure supporting their 200 stores. This modernized infrastructure will enable them to better serve their customers throughout the shopping experience from checking the availability of a product to picking up online orders to checking out at the store. Clearly, the execution of a three-part strategy contributed to 2018 excellent performance. In addition, our earnings growth benefited from a strong economy, healthy employment and a lower tax rate. We currently -- and that lead me to our expectations for growth for 2019. We currently expect the US IT market to grow approximately 3%. We expect top line performance to be between 200 basis points to 300 basis points better than the US IT market in constant currency on an organic basis. This excludes the incremental sales growth from the Scalar acquisition. Given our outlook in the market, we currently plan to add between 125 to 175 customer facing co-workers. On top off approximately 165 added in 2018. For 2019, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on a constant currency basis, with capital allocation contributing to the amplification of operating earnings. To close, I feel good about where we stand today for several reasons. First, we have confidence in our strategy. A strategy that positions us a strong growth, serves us well then confronted with macro channel or partner challenges and leverages our competitive advantages to deliver strong profitability and cash flow. This confidence our strategy has let our Board to increase our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion and to declare a $0.40 increase over last year's dividend. Second, the team is executed well against our strategy and we are committed to remaining focused on execution to drive our performance versus the market and strong financial results. Finally activity in the business field healthy, of course, we are mindful of the uncertainty regarding another government shutdown, product availability, Brexit and tariffs. We can't control these things, so we will do what we always do. Regardless of the potential outcomes impact on IT demand, we will focus on what we can control and hold ourselves accountable to outgrow in the market. As we always do we will update our views of market growth and hiring as we move through the year. With that, let me turn it over to Collin. Collin Kebo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter and full-year of results consistent with our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustain profitable growth and return capital to shareholders. Before I begin, I'd like to remind you our results reflect the adoption of ASC 606 providing an apples-to-apples comparison for 2017 and 2018. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 10, consolidated net sales were $4.1 billion an increase of 8.6% on a reported and average daily sales basis compared to last year. In constant currency, consolidated net sales grew 9%. Currency had a 110 basis points swing moving to a headwind of 40 basis points in Q4 2018 from a tailwind of 70 basis points in Q4 2017. As expected our sequential average daily sales decline of 6.8% was greater than historical seasonality given the strength in the third quarter. Gross profit for the quarter increased 13.1% to $694 million. Gross margin expanded 60 basis points driven by mixing into net revenues including software-as-a-service, warranties, commission revenue and other services and product margin which benefited from the strength in solutions categories as well as the overlap of client devices shipped to the Department of Defense last year. Turning to SG&A on slide 11, our adjusted SG&A including advertising increased more than sales the 17.1% increase was driven by three factors. Increased sales compensation which is directly tied to gross profit growth, performance based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals and the balance of the strategic investments we announced at the beginning of 2018 which were funded by Tax Reform. Our co-worker count of 9019 was up nearly 300 from the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $323 million an increase of 8.8% compared to last year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.9%. Reflected on Slide 12, interest expense was $37 million flat compared to the prior year quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate included on Slide 13 for the quarter was 22.9% compared to an effective tax rate of negative 5.8% last year. This resulted in Q4 expense of $47 million versus $11 million benefit last year which reflected the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of 2017. If you recall, the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a positive one time impact of reducing our deferred tax liability partially offset by one-time expense related to the foreign income transition tax. With both adjustments nonrecurring, the net benefit was excluded from non-GAAP net income. You see the impact of the changes effective tax rate on slide 14, were our fourth quarter GAAP net income was $159 million, a decrease of 18% compared to last year. When you apply our non-GAAP effective tax rate to our non-GAAP pre-tax income, we delivered non-GAAP net income of $201 million in the quarter up 31.5% from last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP add backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.7% down 12.8 percentage points compared to last year's 36.5% rate primarily due to the lower federal tax rate. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter includes the impact of chewing up the full year rate to 25.7%. Our full year tax rate was favorably impacted by recently issued guidance from the IRS on foreign taxes creditable against Global Intangible Low Taxed Income. As you can see on slide 15, that fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding about $152 million. GAAP net income per share was $1.05, down 16.4%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.32 up 34.4% from last year. Currency headwinds had a 40 basis point impact on fourth quarter earnings per share growth. Turning to full year results on slide 16 through 19, we exceeded our financial targets for the year. Revenue was $16.2 billion, an increase of 9.5% on a reported and average daily sales basis. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 9.2% compared to the prior year. Full-year gross profit was $2.7 billion up 10.5%. The gross profit margin was 16.7% up 20 basis points compared to 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion an increase of 9.8% compared to last year. Full year GAAP net income was $643 million while non-GAAP net income was $794 million up 31.1% from 2017. Non-GAAP net income per share was $5.17, an increase of 35.1%. Full-year currency tailwinds added 30 basis points of growth to non-GAAP net income per share. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20 as of December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $206 million, and net debt was $3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion and the total net leverage ratio was 2.3x. The weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding debt at year end was 4.5%, 20 basis points higher than last year. In 2018, interest expense benefited from the 1.5% caps in place. These caps expired at year end were replaced by an interest rate caps with the strike price of 2 and 3/8s that hedged the term loan in 2019 and 2020. With the caps in place, we are well-positioned to continue to manage the uncertain rate environment. Roughly, 96% of our outstanding debt at year-end 2018 was either fixed rate or hedged. As shown on Slide 21, we maintain strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our three-month average cash conversion cycle was 19 days flat from last year's fourth quarter and within our annual target range of high teens to low 20s. Full-year free cash flow was $752 million or 4.6% of sales, 35 basis points above the high-end of our free cash flow rule of thumb of 3 3/4% to 4 1/4% of sales. The over-delivery primarily reflects higher cash profits, and favorable changes in other assets and liabilities. For the year we returned over $660 million of cash to shareholders, which included $139 million of dividends and $522 million of share repurchases at an average price of $82.49 per share. Before I discuss our 2019 financial targets and capital priorities, I would like to introduce a new pretax profit metric non-GAAP operating income shown on Slide 22. This will replace adjusted EBITDA as our internal and external metric for operating profitability. Our success helping customers adopt flexible consumption models, more solutions delivered as a service such as device as a service is the main driver of this change. Some of these solutions may be underpinned by CDW-owned equipment, and it is the associated capital expenditures and depreciation that make this new profit metric more meaningful. That is because it captures all costs associated with delivering new solutions including the depreciation and amortization associated with the revenue, which would be excluded from an EBITDA based metric. We define non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income adjusted for the amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets, equity-based compensation, and other nonrecurring or unusual income and expenses. These adjustments are consistent with the corresponding adjustments in non-GAAP net income. We will report non-GAAP operating income in our disclosures beginning in the first quarter. Moving to our thoughts on 2019, starting on Slide 23, we continue to target net sales growth of 200 to 300 basis points above U.S. IT market growth in constant currency on an organic basis. As Chris mentioned, we currently expect U.S. IT market growth of approximately 3%. We closed the acquisition of Scalar on February 1, and expect Scalar to contribute an additional approximately 100 basis points of growth on top of the 200 to 300 basis points. Currency is expected to represent a 60 basis point headwind for the full-year, assuming exchange rates of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. Non-GAAP operating income margin is expected to be in the mid 7% range for 2019. Our capital spending has historically trended around half a point of sales so our non-GAAP operating income margin is expected to run approximately 50 basis points below our adjusted EBITDA margin. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis is expected to be roughly 10%. Currency headwinds are projected to shave 60 basis points from the constant currency rate. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering these financial targets on an annual basis. Moving to slide 24, our capital priorities remain the same and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through the returns of capital and strategic investments. In order of priority, first increased dividends annually to guide these increases in November of 2014, we set a target to achieve a dividend payout ratio of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter we will pay a dividend of $0.295 per share on March 12 to shareholders of record as of February 25, up 40% from a year ago. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5x to 3x. We ended 2018 slightly below the low end of this range subsequent to year-end, we financed the Scalar acquisition with that. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Scalar is a great example of this, and fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through repurchases. To support this priority, our board has approved an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization. This approval augments the balance remaining on the prior $750 million authorization on which there was $336 million as of December 31. Given 2018's over-delivery of free cash flow relative to our 3.75% to 4.25% of sales rule of thumb, we expect to deploy cash above our rule of thumb in 2019. Slide 25 provides additional modeling thoughts. We expect sales in the first half of the year to be slightly below our historical norm of 48% to 49% of full-year sales as we have one selling day shifting from Q1 to Q3. Keep in mind that the normal rhythm of our business is for first quarter sales to typically be the lowest dollar amount in sequentially below our fourth quarter. Over the past three years on an average daily sales basis, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline has averaged down approximately 8%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be generally in line with historical seasonality. As I mentioned earlier, annual currency headwinds are expected at a rate of roughly 60 basis points on net sales. The expected headwinds are greater in the first quarter at 120 basis points as we lapse stronger pound and Canadian dollar exchange rates. Moving down to P&L, non-GAAP operating income margin is expected in the mid 7% range. Total annual depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $270 million to $275 million. This includes approximately $180 million of amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets including a preliminary estimate for Scalar that could change slightly once the purchased accounting is final. Depreciation and amortization expense and SG&A excluding the amortization of acquisition related intangibles is expected to be around $85 million. Equity-based compensation is expected to be in line with 2018. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $165 million to $167 million with the year-over-year growth driven by the caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to 2 3/8% in the financing of Scalar. Our 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5%. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 350 to 400 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth is expected to have currency headwinds of 60 basis points similar to our top line. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be lower than our full-year 10% constant currency target as we have one fewer selling day. This is timing as we will recoup the extra day in the third quarter. One fewer selling day adversely impacts first quarter profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. In addition, we expect first quarter currency headwinds of approximately 120 basis points. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 26. Our post tax reform free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3 3/4% to 4 1/4% of sales. Expectations for capital expenditures excluding the census remain unchanged at slightly more than half a point of sales. We expect the cash tax rate in the 25.5% to 26.5% range of pretax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition related intangibles, and we no longer have tax related to the cancellation of debt income. We expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the target range of high teens to low 20s. Finally, the new leasing standard, ASU 2016-02 topic 842 is effective in 2019. There is no impact to the income statement, but the balance sheet will be grossed up for right of use assets and lease liabilities where we are the lessee. Additionally, CDW will be a lessor for the census device as a service offering with most of the revenue being recognized as lease revenue. Our team is working closely with the United States Census Bureau on timing. We currently expect the census to account for approximately 40 basis points of 2019 net sales growth, but could see revenue recognition and capital expenditures shift between 2019 and 2020 depending on the final rollout schedule. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thank you, and good morning. Just a question regarding your outlook for this year, specifically relative to the transactional business and client device, looks like we're going into year-three of a fairly positive refresh cycle, both on the notebook-PC side and servers. I know we're up against some deadlines with some Microsoft operating system support changes early next year. So, what's your thought on the cycle? Are we in the last innings here? And as you see potentially lower transactional business, and it sounds like there's momentum on the solutions side, will we continue to see positive mix helping your gross margin? Christine Leahy : Morning, Matt. Thank you for that question. I think there's a lot in there, so let me just take it piece by piece if I could. So, if we take a step back and think about client, you're right. We're seen really healthy demand there, and obviously watching that closely. A challenge to predict what inning we're in and I would say that the data points seem to be indicating that there are more factors impacting client refresh than have traditionally been the case. So, for example, we certainly do have the normal lifecycle refresh, older client devices out there, and some time-sensitive operating system upgrades coming up Win 10, Win 7, et cetera. But we're also seeing customers seeking competitive advantages through new technologies in this area to elevate productivity obviously, and to drive efficiency with their coworkers. So, in terms of taking advantage of that, the cycle seems like it's a little different frankly than it has been. So those time-compelling events are important and will continue to drive demand, but we're also seeing what I say is a little bit of a smoother level of demand across the years. Now that's obviously tied to budget and the ability to have that budget to spend, and we're seeing healthy budgets out there. So, on the client I would say we're going to continue to see strong demand, but we are overlapping some healthy growth last year and the year before, so we might see that moderating a little bit, but again, continuing on a more consistent basis than really time sensitive. On the solutions side, there's a lot going on there as well. We obviously have some Microsoft end of service coming around in the next year or so. And that will drive upgrades in the datacenter infrastructure, but equally, the advances in the technology and innovation is very interesting to customers, and we continue to have conversations with them about investing across the full spectrum, whether it's on-cloud, on-prem, et cetera. So, I think you're going to see a healthy environment. That said, when we look at 2019, there seem to be more external uncertainties than we had going into 2018. And so our perspective, sitting where we are today, is that the IT rate of market growth might be a little lower than what we saw in 2018. Matt Sheerin : Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up regarding the federal business, you talked about tough comps in Q4, and you'll still have some tough comps this quarter. You didn't talk about any disruptions or delays relative to the federal shutdown, anything there to share with us? Christine Leahy : Yes, on the federal shutdown, which started, as you know, at the end of last year, really no impact to Q4 results. We did have some projects slip because they were placed; orders weren't placed at the end of December. And we've obviously missed about a month worth of writing. Now, the good news is we had a holiday in there, we're in the period when our customers are really evaluating, as opposed to buying quite as much. And our teams were, frankly, on the phone with those customers during the shutdown to help them be ready when they got back. So we could see some shift in timing if orders aren't getting out. Now that they're back at working we could see some shift. But we don't expect that to be business that's lost, we just think projects might shift into Q2. Obviously, with the possibility of another shutdown looming there would be more concern because that could have longer-term effects and it could start to impact the rest of the economy. The other point I do want to make is, when you look at our federal business, we have Department of Defense teams and civilian teams, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And if you look at the mix of that business, a lower portion of that business is civilian. And civilian agencies are the ones that were primarily shutdown because it's a partial shutdown. And even for the agencies that were shutdown there were some essential workers working, and so we tried to take advantage as best we could of that. Matt Sheerin : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Christine Leahy : Good morning, Katy. Katy Huberty : Hi, good morning. Can you talk to whether you think there was any push out of demand -- or sorry, pull-in of demand around price increases due to tariff-related impacts in segments like networking during the quarter? Christine Leahy : Yes, thanks for the question, Katy. We did have conversations with customers around that. And we reached out to customers, frankly, proactively to see how we could help. But at the end of the day, we did not feel any significant pull into the fourth quarter as a result of tariffs. We just didn't feel it. Katy Huberty : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks and good morning. I just wanted to start on the solutions as a service, looks like that's a little bit of a change here. And hoping that you can talk about how this change could potentially change the competitive environment. Is there advantages that CDW has versus others in terms of scale, balance sheet, et cetera, versus small competitors? And if you could touch on how we can think about the key metrics as this picks up, is it deflationary to revenue growth but similar profit dollars? Thanks. Christine Leahy : Yes, thank you, Adam. Yes, when we think about as a service generally, it's -- I'll start with, it's compelling to our customers. It's complicated in how you'll see it in our financial results because of the various ways that it can appear. So, if you have software as a service, for example, that's pretty clear, and that's down. We have a broad portfolio of software as a service that we offer our customers, and we are heavily involved in helping them to implement where they see fit, something like device-as-a-service. And I went through the Census example, the multiple advantages that we have that all work together, frankly, in a solution like device-as-a-service, is what won us the trust of the Census to actually get it done. Now, how that looks on the balance sheet and how it looks in the financial statements, I'll have Collin take you through, because it is constructed in such a way that it will be reflected in the financials in a certain way. But we've got other device-as-a-service deals that are constructed slightly differently and they will show up separately in the financial statement. So, let me have Collin just jump in on that one. Collin Kebo : Yes, sure. Thanks, Chris. Adam, as we're taking these offerings to market the one consistent thing is that there is no standard approach to the accounting. All of these deals are being structured differently. In some instances it may come on to our balance sheet, in other instances we may lease from someone else, and in other instances it may just simply be a financing transaction where we're bringing in a third party to arrange financing and then through our financial statements it just looks like a normal product sale. But we did make the decision to move forward to non-GAAP operating income on a go-forward basis so that in those instances where we are putting capital to work, that we're including that depreciation expense, which is effectively the cost of goods sold on the offering. We felt that that was the right way to look at it. In terms of how it changes the model, I think because it's unclear exactly how all of these are going to be structured. It depends on each individual transaction. The Census is effectively a full revenue transaction, we are not netting down much on that. So I wouldn't expect that as an example to have a muted impact on the top line. I did make some comments on capital expenditures where we expect to be at our regular CapEx excluding the Census. We're not exactly sure when that CapEx will go out depending on the timing for the Census, whether it be later this year or early 2020, but I think the important point is that we don't expect it to change our free cash flow percentage [technical difficulty] So, whatever that CapEx number is we're still committed to the post tax reform free cash flow grew -- three-and-three-quarters to four-and-a-quarter percent. Adam Tindle : Okay, that's helpful. Just as one quick follow-up, since adjusted EBITDA margin is going away I want to ask one last question on it. Gross margin has been increasing. I would imagine that this could continue to be a trend as the mix towards net seems more secular in nature. Just want you to maybe touch on how we can think about the impact to adjusted EBITDA margin if this continues to occur. I know there's some offsets, but how can we think about drop-through, and could we see another level of adjusted EBITDA margin beyond the high sevens as you continue to ratchet up? Collin Kebo : Yes, as you know, there are a variety of factors that impact our gross margin. Chris mentioned mix and there are all these other different mix of products, mix of netted down revenues, mix of channels, mix of are you selling newer or more mature technologies, all of those things impact our gross margin. And then I think the other thing to keep in mind is we have a compensation structure that's tied to gross profit dollars, and we pay on that. And our solutions business does have a higher cost to serve. So, not all of that gross margin is going to drop down to EBITDA margin because of our variable cost structure. And so what I would say is it depends on how all of those things come together over time. Obviously, in the fourth quarter of this year we have a confluence of positive factors that caused a very strong increase in that gross margin. We'll see how that plays out over time depending on how all of those factors interact with each other. Continuing with EBITDA margin, you know we had mid sevens for a long time. And at our analyst day, a year-and-a-half ago, we did increase our outlook for that from mid-sevens, to high-sevens, to eight because of those factors that you mentioned. So, we'll see how that plays out over time. Adam Tindle : Thank you, and congrats on the solid results. Collin Kebo : Thank you. Christine Leahy : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to talk a bit more about the Canadian acquisition. I'm curious, is there anything that you expect to leverage from what they're doing that perhaps you can take into CDW? And then vice-versa, sort of how are you looking at the integration of that asset over the coming year? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes, no, thanks for asking. We're really excited about Scalar. I would say that this is really an organization with an exceptional fit. And when you tick through what we look for in an acquisition that works, Scalar really hit all the boxes. You think about their deep technical expertise in areas that our customers are looking to us for advice in, including services capability; they add in-market sellers and technical folks with business up and running. And they have a great cultural fit, as I mentioned before. One of the things that was really interesting to us is the non-overlapping customer base. So, when you think about the value that we can bring to each others' customers immediately it's pretty attractive. Scalar has been really primarily a solutions-focused and based organization. And CDW, as you might remember, in Canada, our transactional business has been very robust, and we've been investing in the solutions area for some time. So, by bringing those two together we've got a nice base of customer that we can now offer a more fulsome group of IT solutions. In terms of Canada-to-U.S., if that was part of the question, like we've done across the board, even with the U.K., where we find opportunity to take best practices in the U.S. or in the local market and bring it back, we certainly will do that. And I think one area you can think about is operating efficiency. So, while this acquisition is really all about growth and bringing value to our customers, as we combine the two we would look to get some good operating efficiency down the road. Shannon Cross : Thank you. And then I'm curious, I think you added about 300 coworkers last year, and I believe you mentioned you plan to add about 50% of that this year. Is that because you made this acquisition, that maybe you're not as aggressive in terms of hiring, or is that just the potential for upside if you find the right people? Christine Leahy : Yes, I think there -- there was a number that I mentioned in my prepared script, was the 350, and that's a Scalar coworkers that are joining our family. We brought in about 165 customer-facing coworkers last year, and so we're looking to about 125 to 175 this year. So, reflecting the same level of confidence in our ability to execute. Shannon Cross : Okay, thank you. Collin Kebo : Yes, I think some of the confusion may have been, I gave a number on total coworker account up about 300, and Chris was referencing just the customer-facing coworker count. Shannon Cross : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning. Thanks for the question. And just a follow-up on Scalar, can you provide a little bit color in terms of their margin profile and the impact to the bottom line? Christine Leahy : Keith, we're not going to provide that information. As we said, we don't expect them to be accretive this year, but we would look for them to be accretive next year, but we are not going to get into the details of the margin and frankly, it can fluctuate very much like CDW. It's based on the type and mix of solutions that they're selling at any given point in time during a quarter. But we're excited about the opportunity together and what we'll be able to drive overall in CDW U.K. as we bring the operations together. Keith Housum : Okay. And just as a follow-up question, in terms of the census project with regards to devices and service, what happens after the end of the product and the service becomes -- it comes back to you? Is there an opportunity to sell the product and perhaps have a gain or loss on the product, or is there an opportunity to recycle that into another project? Christine Leahy : Well, that's actually part of the full spectrum of everything that's happening in this product. We are not the third party that will be taking the devices back, but another organization will be taking the devices back and then you know through resale benefiting from that. But that's part of the -- from soup to nuts, the entire project includes a repatriation if you will, of the devices, but by a third party, not CDW. Collin Kebo : Yes, Keith, there is an assumption because of the accounting on this. There's a residual value that'll be assumed and ultimately what that is -- you know, there could be a minor variance, but I wouldn't expect it to be material. Keith Housum : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Rogers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. Jason Rogers : Yes, just following up on the M&A questions. Are you finding more opportunity in Canada as far as the potential for new customers, view that as more of a focus for the M&A or do you see just opportunities widespread geography wise? Christine Leahy : Thanks for that question. I wouldn't say that we find more or less opportunity up in Canada or in the U.K. or in the U.S. for that matter. I mean, we have a process where we're always engaged in knowing and looking at what is out in the marketplace. And frankly, given our institutional knowledge, we tend to scout outside what's on the market anyway and we see a lot in the U.S. and we assess a lot, but as I think many of you know, we're really quite disciplined about an acquisition and we look for something to complement our strategy. The cultural fit is really quite important to us. Is it going to enhance value for our existing and prospective customers, and then ultimately at a compelling price and you know, the compelling price is quite important to us. And when you look in the market, there can be a lot of interesting opportunities, but if the price isn't right it's not something that we're going to move forward on if we can build ourselves. Jason Rogers : And I wonder if you can make some comments around your cloud growth in the quarter, if you're seeing any material acceleration as far as shifting offsite and any potential cannibalization of your historical offering? Christine Leahy : Yes. We're not going to give that number this quarter. I think a couple -- maybe three quarters ago, we let you all know that our -- the customer spend which will be gross sales, gross revenue, customer spend was in the $3 billion area, so I would say it's a robust and mature practice with a broad selection. I think the question specifically around seeing growth in the cloud at the expense of on-prem, you know, we have always been, for several years now, a fan of the hybrid model, and you know, I think our view has always been that the world is going to land in a hybrid place, and I do think that's what we're seeing in the market. For us, it's opportunity across the board, we're not seeing -- certainly, some customers are repatriating back to on-prem for a variety of reasons as you know, but not at the expense of actually moving other workloads to the cloud. So I think we're seeing very balanced assessment by our customers. We're trying to help them understand what's best for them and their particular business, because obviously, the different businesses can take advantage of different types of technologies, but strengthen those and not one at the expense of the other is what we're feeling. Jason Rogers : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Chung : Hi, thanks, this is Paul Chung on for Coster, thanks for taking my question. So just on operating margins, I know you are investing in the sales force and probably create some noise, but how should we think about areas where you can see some operating leverage beyond fiscal year '19? Sounds like, from the comments you made earlier, gross margin should stay in the 516% range? Thank you. Collin Kebo : Yes, thank you. So our thoughts on 2019 are that our non-GAAP Operating income margin will be in the mid 7 -- again, I know it's a new metric, but if you think that our CapEx has historically run around half a point of sales, you can take 50 basis points and add it to that to give you kind of a comparable adjusted EBITDA margin. I made some comments earlier about some of the factors that impact our gross margin and how they interact with each other and also we do have a highly variable cost structure. So as the business does grow, and we generate more gross profit dollars, even if they come from solutions we have additional variable expense that goes along with that. And then secondly, we continue to make investments in the organization in terms of adding customer facing coworkers and other investments to ensure that we continue to drive that top line outperformance to market of 200 to 300 basis points. So yes, we feel good about our ability to deliver that mid-7 non-GAAP operating income margin and you know, depending on how the market evolves over the next several years, we could potentially update that, but for now it's 7.5%. Paul Chung : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Chris Leahy for closing remarks. Christine Leahy : Thank you. As we wrap up the call today, I'd like to thank our 9,000 plus coworkers for taking care of our customers every single day, and for focusing on our customers' success thereby ensuring CDW's continuing success, and for those customers listening in, thank you for trust in CDW. We never forget that your success is our success. To our new Scalar coworkers, welcome to the CDW family, we are truly excited about the future and the opportunity to serve our customers together. Thank you for everyone who participated. We appreciate your questions and we'll look forward to next time. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Beth. It's a pleasure to discuss CDW's results and strategic progress with you today. I'm pleased to report that we had an excellent start to the year, with strong top line growth and profitability. In the first quarter, average daily sales increased 11.5%, up 12.4% in constant currency. Net sales of $4 billion were up 9.7% on a reported basis, with one fewer selling day this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income increased 10.7% to $287 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 18.2% to $1.24 per share. This quarter's results reflect three key drivers. Our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio, and ongoing execution against our three part strategy. Let's take a look at how each of these drivers helped us deliver profitable growth this quarter. First, our customer end market performance; as you know, we have five US channel, Corporate which serves customers with coworkers from roughly 250 and up; Small business, which serves customers with roughly 20 to 250 coworkers, and healthcare, government and education. Within each channel, we have teams further focused on customer end markets and verticals. For example, in government, we have Federal, with teams focused on serving the Department of Defense and across civilian agencies, as well as state and local teams. Each of our US channels generated more than $1.3 billion of net sales in 2018. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together, delivered nearly $1.9 billion of net sales in 2018. As most of you are familiar, our balanced customer end markets position us to perform, even when external factors impact certain sectors and industries, reflecting a generally healthy economy, all of our customer end markets grew this quarter. I was particularly pleased with the execution of our government channel, which delivered strong performance, despite the government shutdown. Our Corporate, Small Business and Public segments, as well as our international businesses, all contributed double-digit growth this quarter. Taking a closer look at this performance, our Corporate team delivered a 13% increase in net sales, with balanced double-digit growth in transactions and solutions. Transactions growth was powered by our unique ability to provide high value services, including pre-orders, configurations and staging and to secure client device inventory in a supply constrained market. This enabled the team to meet strong client device demand, driven by strength in the economy and healthy employment. Client devices grew 20% in the quarter. This was the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. At the same time, the Corporate team continued to leverage our deep technical capabilities and strong solutions portfolio, to help customers modernize their IT infrastructure and realize the benefits of more flexible architectures. This drove excellent results in servers, storage, software and netcomm. Small business net sales increased 10% with double-digit growth in transactions, and high single digit growth in solutions. Small business customers remained optimistic and continued to invest in their businesses and employees. Similar to Corporate, our competitive advantages enabled the Small Business team to deliver client device growth of approximately 20%, on top of similar growth last year. Small Business continues to benefit from the focus created when we established a standalone segment. For example, our Small Business technical team provided advice tailored to the unique needs of Small Businesses, including emerging technology and consumption alternatives. Our ability to do this contributed to nearly 50% growth in software-as-a service this quarter, in Small Business. Public's 10% increase in net sales reflected strong contributions from government and healthcare. Government delivered high teen net sales growth, with double-digit growth in both Federal and State and Local. The Federal team delivered these excellent results, despite the partial government shutdown in January and tough year-over-year client device compares. Regarding the shutdown, the team worked closely with impacted civilian agencies when they reopened, and by the end of the first quarter, our sales to civilian agencies were generally in line with plan. Our ability to support the government's continuing priorities around modernizing infrastructure, enhancing cyber security and combat readiness, drove strong solutions performance. Federal solutions growth also benefited from timing, as we had several larger projects that were delivered earlier than anticipated. Solutions performance was partially offset by a decline in transactions. As you recall, Federal had tremendous success, helping agencies meet the Department of Defense mandate to move to Win-10 devices through 2017 and into the first quarter of 2018. We have now lapped the Win-10 shipments related to the DoD mandate. State and local performance was driven by contracts and ongoing success in Public safety projects, which contributed to growth in enterprise storage, netcomm and software. Education increased 2.4%, with both K-12 and higher Ed delivering low digit growth. K-12 net sales performance was driven by solid growth in client devices and video, which was offset by some lumpiness in solutions. The team continues to work with schools to design and transform classrooms, to enable collaborative learning and more active and flexible learning spaces. Higher education strength in client devices was partially offset by a decline in solutions as we lap strong performance from several large networking projects in the first quarter of 2018. Helping higher education customers address security drove strong growth in security software. Healthcare was up over 8%. The team continues to help customers secure their IT environments and modernize their infrastructure. This drove double-digit solutions growth in the quarter. Customers also continued to refresh client devices, which drove a mid-single digit increase in transactions. Our international team delivered strong growth with combined sales up nearly 13% in US dollars. Both teams executed well in the quarter, each posting strong double-digit growth in local currency. In Canada, solutions growth continued to outpace transactions. Scalar, which closed February one performed in line with expectations. Integration is on track, and we are starting to provide expanded portfolio options to both existing CDW Canada and Scalar customers. We are winning new business based on our enhanced value proposition and the combined breadth of our products, services and solutions. In the UK, the team did a great job capturing share of Public sector fiscal year end buying, delivering particularly strong growth, as they benefited from a go-to-market refinements we've made in our Government team. Multinational customers continue to leverage our international scope with US to UK referrals growing over 20% this quarter. To date, we have not seen an impact on demand from Brexit. As I mentioned last quarter, we established a presence on the continent to support CDW UK's broader growth opportunities in the EU. This presence also served as a Brexit contingency plan. With the new entity in place, we've expanded our ability to support customers on the continent. First quarter results also demonstrate the second driver of performance, our broad portfolio of both transactions and integrated solutions. This quarter, performance was strong across the entire portfolio. Hardware increased 10%, Software increased 18% and services increased 16%. Solutions grew mid-teens, our second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while transactions grew 10%. Solutions performance reflected the ongoing strength in the economy, coupled with customer need to replace aged infrastructure and their desire to take advantage of more efficient and flexible architectures. Our sales and technical teams did an excellent job helping customers successfully address these requirements. Our solutions results also reflect the benefit of backlog flush, as lead times and solutions categories such as netcomm returned to more normal levels. These trends contributed to our strong hardware growth, as we delivered more than 20% increases in both servers and enterprise storage. Hardware growth was also fueled by double-digit client growth, as we leveraged our competitive advantages of scale in our distribution centers to help customers navigate through supply constraint in the quarter. Software net sales increased 18%. As you know, software is becoming a larger component of IT solutions. Success helping customers adopt new architectures and secure their IT environments contributed to excellent performance in network management, storage management and security software, all growing strong double-digits in the quarter. Our cloud solutions capabilities also contributed to this quarter's strong results. We drove significant double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit, led again by productivity, platform, security and collaboration workloads. Services' 16% increase was led by professional services and warranties. Strong growth across solutions categories, including software-as-a-service and warranties, both of which are recognized on a net basis, contributed to our 30 basis point gross margin expansion in the quarter. As you can see, this quarter's results demonstrate the power of our balanced customer end markets and broad products and solutions portfolio; both clearly contributing to our strong top line and bottom line performance. While we benefited from some favorable timing, adjusting for this, net sales still increased double digits in constant currency, a great result by our teams, as they navigated through uncertainties, including the government shutdown, the looming Brexit outcome, and ship constraints. Our results also demonstrate the power of the third driver of our performance, our three part strategy for growth. For CDW, our strategy starts with our customers, maximizing their technology investments to drive productivity and growth is a priority for them, but given limited IT resources and the pace of technology change, our customers need help making technology decisions, implementing solutions, and managing their technology investments. Our three part strategy is designed to make sure that customers turn to us for the help they need to make the right decision for their business. Our three part strategy for growth is to first, acquire new customers and capture share. Second, enhance the solutions capabilities. Third, expand our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars intersect, together contributing to our ability to profitably deliver the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need. The first pillar focuses on productivity improvements. We do this through enhanced systems and data, sales force productivity initiatives and investments in our brand and marketing. This underpins our ability to achieve our overall strategy. Productivity gains fuel our ability to invest while delivering profitable growth. The second pillar ensures we stay relevant to our customers by investing in solutions capabilities that enable us to be their trusted partner today and into the future. And our third pillar ensures we have value added services capability, to deliver many of today's integrated end-to-end solutions. The combination of these three interconnected pillars with our scope and scale, creates powerful differentiation in the market. Let me share some examples of our strategy in action; our first pillar includes driving productivity through investments in process improvement and automation. Our new proprietary Partner Portal, which was implemented last year, is a great illustration of this. The Partner Portal further enhances our ability to onboard and to collaborate with our vendor partners. For example, we've enhanced the exchange and presentation of real-time data with our partners, delivering timely analytics and insights to our partners, enables us collectively to deliver more targeted and effective sales programs, training and enablement for our sales and technical organization. The portal will also help us more efficiently onboard the 50 to 75 new partners we add each year, that keep our portfolio optimally relevant for our customers. An example of the second and third pillars of our strategy is a solution we provided to a 500 location non-profit integrated health network. Having moved its electronic medical record system to the public cloud, the customer who is experiencing increasing costs and performance issues. An integrated team of our healthcare sellers and technical solutions architects worked closely with the customer to assess its IT environment and evaluate options. The solution was to move their entire electronic medical records platforms, networking storage, software and communication back to an on-premise data center. There were four key reasons why CDW was uniquely qualified to help the customer through this journey. First, because we are technology-agnostic, we were able to provide unbiased advice on the pros and cons of public cloud, on-premise and hybrid solutions. Second, our broad portfolio of products and solutions enabled us to draw upon multiple technologies and brand to create an integrated solution. Third, our seasoned healthcare team was able to leverage their deep industry experience, to develop a compelling best-in-breed solution. Finally, we were able to provide professional services capabilities to implement the solution. This project helped our customer reduce costs and improve performance and resulted in over $20 million of net sales. We have confidence that our strategy positions us for strong growth, serves us well when confronted with macro channel or partner challenges, and leverages our competitive advantages to deliver strong profitability and cash flow. We will continue to make strategic investments to ensure we remain our customers' partner of choice. One important investment we make is in customer-facing coworkers. In the first quarter, we added 55 excluding the approximately 300 customer facing coworkers from Scalar. We continue to plan to add between 125 to 175 customer facing co-workers in 2019. Now let me leave you with a few thoughts on the remainder of the year. Clearly, we are off to a great start. Our market outlook for 2019 is generally consistent with our view at the beginning of the year. We continue to expect full year US IT market growth in the 3% range. Given our strong performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our target for outperforming the market to 300 basis points to 375 basis points on a constant currency organic basis. We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an additional 100 basis points of growth for the year. These expectations recognize our strong 2018 performance and the year-over-year comparisons we face, for both client devices and international performance. We expect ongoing but moderating strength in client devices, as well as solid growth in solutions. That said, while we are pleased that lead times return to more normal levels in solutions categories, the potential for chip shortages remains a wildcard. Of course, we will continue to refine our expectations as we move throughout the year. Now let me turn it over to Collin, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Collin? Collin Kebo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated, our first quarter results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business to build on our long-term financial strategy, to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth, and return cash to shareholders. Turning to our first quarter P&L on slide 8, consolidated net sales were $4 billion, up 9.7% on a reported basis and 11.5% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one fewer selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 12.4%. First quarter consolidated results included two months of Scalar, which performed in line with expectations. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales declined 2.9% versus Q4 of 2018, which was approximately 500 basis points better than the average of the prior three years and better than expected. This reflected several factors. Client device growth was stronger than expected, particularly in corporate and small business, as we leveraged our competitive advantages of scale in our distribution centers to help customers navigate through supply constraints in the quarter. In the UK, the team executed really well, capturing March fiscal year end buying, notwithstanding Brexit uncertainty, and FX wasn't as much of a headwind as expected. We also benefited from favorable timing. Last year we shared that lead times have extended in certain categories such as netcomm, which caused our backlog to increase to higher than normal levels. In the first quarter, lead times returned to more normal levels, creating a positive flush that we previously had expected to receive throughout the year. In addition, Federal benefited from timing, as several large projects were delivered earlier than anticipated. In aggregate, favorable timing contributed approximately $60 million to $70 million to Q1 net sales. Gross profit for the quarter increased 11.3% to $672 million. Gross margin expanded 30 basis points driven by product margin, which continued to benefit from the strength in solution categories, as well as the overlap of client devices shipped to the Department of Defense last year. Strength in software-as-a- service and warranties which are recognized on a net basis, also contributed to margin expansion. Turning to SG&A on slide 9; our non-GAAP SG&A including advertising, increased 11.7%. The increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, which moves in line with gross profit growth, incremental Scalar expenses and investments in the business consistent with our go-forward strategy. Coworker count of 9,434 was up nearly 700 coworkers from March of 2018, with approximately half of the year-over-year increase from Scalar, and the other half from organic coworker investments. Roughly two-thirds of the nearly 700 coworkers added were in customer-facing roles. Non-GAAP operating income, which replaces adjusted EBITDA as our internal and external pretax operating profit metric, was $287 million, an increase of 10.7%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.3%. Historically, adjusted EBITDA margin was lowest in the first quarter, given that Q1 is a seasonally low sales quarter. We expect quarterly non-GAAP operating income margin to follow similar seasonality, as quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin. Moving to slide 10; interest expense was $38 million, up 1.8%. This was primarily driven by the interest rate caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to 2.375%, and the financing of Scalar, partially offset by savings from the term loan refinancing, which we will overlap beginning Q2. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on slide 11 was 20.2% in the quarter, compared to an effective tax rate of 23.4% last year. This resulted in Q1 tax expense of $39 million, which was flat year-over-year. The lower GAAP effective tax rate was driven by higher excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation in Q1 of 2019 versus Q1 of 2018, and a one-time benefit related to the Scalar acquisition. Both of these items, along with other tax adjustments consistent with non-GAAP add-backs, are adjusted to derive our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is shown on slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.8%, down 50 basis points compared to last year's 26.3% rate, primarily due to guidance issued by the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2018, on foreign taxes creditable against global intangible low taxed income. As you can see on slide 13, with the first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $149 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.02, up 25%. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects operating performance, was $185 million in the quarter, up 13.9% over last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was a $1.24, up 18% from last year. Currency headwinds dampened non-GAAP earnings per share growth by approximately 90 basis points in the first quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 14, as of March, 31, our cash and cash equivalents were $285 million and net debt was $3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion. As shown on slide 15, we maintained strong rolling three month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our three month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, flat from last year, and within our annual target range of high teens to low 20's. Free cash flow for the quarter was $303 million compared to $231 million in Q1 of 2018. Remember, Q1 is a seasonally strong cash flow quarter, because sales declined sequentially from Q4 to Q1, and cash tax payments were minimal. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profits and mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. For the quarter, we returned $220 million of cash to shareholders, which included $43 million of dividends and $177 million of share repurchases, at an average price of nearly $91 per share. Turning to slide 16, our capital allocation priorities remain the same and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value, through returns of capital and strategic investments. In order of priority, first increase dividends annually. To guide these increases in November 2014 we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.295 per share on June 11 to shareholders of record as of May 24, up 40% from a year ago. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 2.3 times, slightly below the low end of this range. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Scalar is a great example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Our capital allocation priorities support our updated 2019 outlook, which you see on slide 17. As Chris mentioned, we continue to expect US IT market growth of approximately 3%. We now expect net sales growth of 300 basis points to 375 basis points above US IT market growth in constant currency on an organic basis. We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an additional approximately 100 basis points of growth, on top of the 300 to 375 basis points. Currency is now expected to represent a 50 basis point headwind for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid 7% range for 2019. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis in the 11% to 12% range, which is just above our previous expectation of approximately 10%. Currency headwinds are projected to shave 50 basis points from the constant currency rate. Please remember, that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual basis. Slide 18 provides additional modeling thoughts. We currently expect 2019's first half to second half sales split to be approximately 48.5% first half, 51.5% second half, which is 50 basis points different than historical seasonality of 48% first half, 52% second half. This reflects expected Q2 seasonality below historical levels, given the strength of the first quarter, including the impact from federal timing and backlog flush. It also factors in upcoming client device overlaps in corporate, challenging comparisons in the UK, and a couple of key unknown such as chip availability and Brexit in the back half of the year. When modeling Q2, please keep in mind that FX headwinds are greater in the first half of the year, we expect second quarter headwinds to be in line with the 90 basis points we experienced in the first quarter. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid 7% range. Total annual depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $270 million to $275 million. This includes approximately $180 million of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, including a preliminary estimate for Scalar, that could change slightly, once the purchase accounting is final. Depreciation and amortization expansion in SG&A, excluding the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, is expected to be around $85 million. Equity-based compensation is expected to be approximately $5 million to $7 million higher than 2018, primarily driven by the true-up of performance-based plants in Q1. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $165 million to $167 million, with the year-over-year growth driven by the caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to 2.375% and the financing of Scalar. Our 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be near the lower end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings per share growth approximately 350 to 400 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth is expected to have currency headwinds of 50 basis points, similar to the top line. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow can be found on slide 19. Our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged to 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. Expectations for capital expenditures excluding the census remained unchanged at slightly more than half a point of sales. We expect the cash tax rate to be slightly below 25.5% of pre-tax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition related intangibles. We expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the target range of high teens to low 20s. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. And we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Matt Cabral from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Matt Cabral : Yes. Thank you. Chris, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the health of the broader demand backdrop, particularly for solutions, which it sounded like outperformed in the quarter and if you can just comment about the sustainability of the aged infrastructure refresh that you called out in your prepared remarks? Christine Leahy : Yes, hi Matt, it's great to have you back on the call again. I'd be happy to do that. I think if we break it down into a number of factors that are impacting the strength in solutions, you really have looking back at five to seven year period, where there is as you know, an accumulation of what we call - people call technical debt, in the traditional datacenter infrastructure. And whether or not it was budget constraints and customers were extending the useful life of assets, or whether it was a cloud-source strategy that our customers were considering. As we talk to our customers now, they really are looking at the new normal, I'll call it a hybrid enabled datacenter. So first of all old infrastructure, and certainly the upcoming deadlines of the Windows, End of service for 2008 and SQL Server in January are a catalyst for demand. But, at the same time, we're getting questions around which way to go; hybrid, cloud or a combination of the two. So you've got a couple of factors, aged infrastructure and absolute need to upgrade. You've got some deadlines coming up with - that's driving that. But at the same time, we've got a lot of conversation around a longer-term roadmap. That implies, I'd say growth for on-prem, growth for cloud and continuing view into, I'll call the on-prem metered model. So the demand continues to feel healthy, as I noted in our remarks, because of the centrality of the datacenter now to customers, as they are using it to drive their businesses. Matt Cabral : Great. And then on the international, I know it's early days, but just wondering, if you can talk a little bit more about the integration of Scalar, and just help us with how you're thinking about the opportunity for further international expansion going forward? Christine Leahy : Okay. Well, let me start with Scalar, and I'd say it's - the integration is on target. As you know from our history, we're very thoughtful about how we do that. Very planned, very focused on our customers first, and our co-workers as well. And it feels good. I would say the teams have come together and sales organizations understand when you bring added benefits to what they can offer to their customers to help their customers. And I'd say the sales organizations across both Scalar and CDW have felt that immediately, with some - frankly some quick wins. Our teams in the UK, the CDW teams are quite excited about the technical resources that Scalar had, and scalar is quite excited about the added portfolio that they can bring to our customers. So very positive there and on target. In terms of further expansion geographically, I'd go back to how we think about growth generally. If it's really valuable to our customers, that our starting point needs to fit into our strategy, and that could include extending our capabilities, both on the technical side, or on the geographic side. So at the end of the day, it's one of those two things and the value proposition has to be there and the price has to be compelling. So look, we are in the market. I think one of the questions that comes up frequently is when you're doing an integration are you not in the market? Are you not looking? And the bottom line is, if there is an opportunity that makes sense to help us drive accelerated capabilities faster than building it, we will absolutely look at it. But we will also want to ensure it's a compelling price. Matt Cabral : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for the question. I'm curious, the healthcare company or I misread, the hospital company, you talked about where they shifted back on-prem from the cloud. And we've heard about that or just at Dell World and it's clearly somewhat of a trend. But what I'm trying to understand is, at this point, how much are customers coming to you and saying, look, we don't know what we're doing, we're not sure of the best route here and then taking a look at their entire datacenter and making changes. Or is it still so early in terms of the cloud proliferation that we're not really there yet? Again it sort of goes back to the prior question about how long can this last. I mean some of the companies we talked to, look at it as sort of a multi-year refresh cycle throughout datacenter and hybrids. So I'm just curious as to your take on it? Christine Leahy : Yeah, hi, Katie. The question that you - oh, Shannon, I'm sorry. I got a different name up. Hi Shannon. I would say that the question that you articulated is precisely the question that our customers are asking us, taking a step back, understanding that they have infrastructure that needs to be updated, but also wanting to implement the right capacity, the right capabilities for the future needs of their business or their organization. So it is a roadmap conversation. What that presents for CDW as an opportunity, is the ability to help guide them in this strategy, and when you think about the plethora of choices, including gaining traction in what I'll call the on-premise metered model, and you know some of those providers, you now have legacy on-premise, you have cloud on-prem. You've got on-prem that is metered and as-a-service payment model, and you've got public cloud. The more choices, the more help the customer needs. And yes, it will be an ongoing long-term roadmap. You can't just - they can't - the customer can't just make the change overnight? Shannon Cross : And from a margin perspective for CDW, how should we think about the benefit to you? I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is on-prem a higher margin opportunity than shifting to cloud, which I understand is sort of more of a ratable recurring? Just - as we think about this playing out over the years, I'm trying to understand how much more sort of margin upside there potentially could be? Christine Leahy : Yeah, I'll start and I'll let Collin jump in. I think the way we think about margin. There are so many things that impact our margin. From not just mix into solution, but mix within solution as you know well. It's what we're selling, when we're selling it, whether it's radical, whether it's a transaction-based, either it's just quite a mix in the solution business that will drive variability, I would say, in the margin. Collin Kebo : Yeah. The only thing I would add to that Shannon is, building on Chris' comment, there's a lot of different kinds of mixes that are going on. I think your intuition is right, that you'd expect solutions to have a higher gross margin. But as we've talked about, it also has a higher cost to serve. So if you look at this past quarter, we did have great solutions performance. We had strong gross margin expansion year-over-year, but you saw the increase in our SG&A as well, reflecting that higher cost to serve. So I think you need to think about that, as opposed to the bottom line. Christine Leahy : And even in some of those solutions area, Shannon, we have, what I'll call commoditization pricing. So the pricing pressures in the solutions area come down as well. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I guess first question, how do you know or how did you come to the conclusion that the revenue upside you're seeing is share gains versus just the stronger overall market, given that shrinking lead times and Win 10 upgrades and some of the work around aged infrastructure, could just as well be a market phenomenon. Then I have a follow-up. Christine Leahy : Hi Katy. Good to hear from you. I think when we look at the market share rate of growth, at least what we're looking at, and we take a look at how the company performed. We are fairly confident that across the Board, we are actually taking share. I mean, when you look at server storage over 20% as an example and other areas, relative to what we're seeing in the market, it feels like a fairly robust share gain to us. Collin Kebo : Katy, it's Collin. I would say the market didn't really feel any different than we thought three months ago, and just building on what Chris said. When you look at the areas where we really had a lot of strength, I'm talking about high teens to 20% growth in government, client device growth in corporate, server storage in the data center, I just don't think the market's growing at that rate in those areas, and that's where you assign more of the over performance this year versus the market. Katy Huberty : Okay, that makes sense. And then how should we think about the $60 million to $70 million of earlier deal closings that showed up in the March quarter. Does that come out of the June quarter and should we be modeling slower revenue growth in June, as a result - or are there other factors that come into play in June and backfill that pull forward? Christine Leahy : Yeah, I'll let Collin take the modeling. But those are really some transactions - deals that were much accelerated. And we - so those come out of the year to go performance in our view, and we would not see them replaced. The flush from the lead time is something that's kind of a one-time impact. As a result, we wouldn't see - we wouldn't expect to see kind of replacement sales in the back-end for that. Collin Kebo : Yeah Katy. The way I think about the $60 million to $70 million, and it is a combination of both federal timing and the netcomm backlog flush. I would have expected the netcomm backlog flush to kind of play out over the course of the year. So some of that's in Q2. Some of it was in the back half of the year, some of the federal deal timing, those were things we thought were more likely to go in the second quarter, that actually shipped in the first. So I think it's a combination of Q2 and year to go, but if you look at the first half-second half splits, we gave and obviously you know, where Q1 came in, you can get our thoughts on Q2. Katy Huberty : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks and good morning. I just wanted to start on EPS growth guidance for 2019. You went from roughly 10% to just above 10% and just beat the quarter in Q1 by over 10%. So I'm trying to figure out why is there not more flow through. We just got competitor call, and they are experiencing similar trends. Is there an aspect of gross margin headwind from a pricing environment, getting more tough as growth gets more scarce as the year progresses, more investments that increased OpEx, conservatism after a strong Q1. Just any help with the buckets on why not more flow-through as the year progresses? Collin Kebo : Yeah, Adam, it's Collin. I think a couple of things are going on. One is the timing impact. So obviously, the timing of the $60 million, $70 million, there is an EPS that goes along with that. Depending on where people were with consensus, for the quarter and the year at somewhere around 12% to 13%. I think if you take a look at our thoughts on the full year, that would suggest we're flowing through somewhere between $0.08 to $0.11 of that. And so you can think about what's left over is primarily attributable to the timing. Generally speaking, we feel pretty consistent with how we - about a year to go as to how we thought three months ago. Adam Tindle : Okay, that's helpful, Collin, and maybe just question on cash flow. Now within the rule of thumb instead of above the rule of thumb and the cash cycles ticking up, but maybe we got spoiled. But it's a change, so I'm trying to get more color on why the change. You just said the backlog flush, are you investing in inventory to offset that flush as the year progresses? Any color would be helpful. Thanks. Collin Kebo : Yes, sure. I think last quarter we could have been a little bit clear on our expectations for the full year. From a free cash flow generation perspective, we expect it to be within the 3.75% to 4.25%. The above 4.25% was more of a statement around capital deployment and how we expect to use our cash, and we expect to return more than the 4.25%, and that was because we over delivered cash flow last year relative to our expectations. So little bit of a catch up there, what I'll call the capital return to shareholders. So I'd say, we continue to expect to be within the 3.75% to 4.25% this year. I do think it will be a little volatile as we move throughout the year. If you look at our balance sheet, we are carrying some higher than normal inventory levels, but we are doing that to assist customers, as we work through the supply constrained environment. So again, I think it could be a little bumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but as I look at the full year, I'd expect us to be within the 3.75% to 4.25%. Adam Tindle : Got it. Thanks and congrats on the strong results. Collin Kebo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of quick questions from me, one, just regarding your federal business, are you yet seeing any contributions from the census contracts, and how should we think about how that rolls into the P&L this year? Christine Leahy : Yes, very little at this point, Matt. As we've mentioned in the quarter before, we expected to see 40 basis points of growth this year. We're still working through with the census, the timing of the various devices, et cetera, so we don't have any update to that yet, nothing, nothing different from that, and just a little bit rolling right now. Matt Sheerin : Okay. And then regarding the healthcare business, and you gave some really good examples of customer engagements there. You've had - looked like there were several years a very choppy business and now you're four - or five quarters into a consistent mid to upper single-digit growth. Is that just a sign that the industry is finally making those investments and moving to sort of the digital world, or are you also just gaining share within that market, given your skill-sets? Christine Leahy : Yes, I think you've got insight. Well, it's a little bit of both. I think number one healthcare organizations, as you know well, when we were in the Affordable Care Act uncertainty world for a couple of years, our healthcare systems, which are the largest portion of our customers in that space were concerned about their revenue sources, and that caused them to slow down on their spending, notwithstanding aging infrastructure, et cetera. So number one, you've got that off the table, not as front and center politically it. It pops back up sometimes, but with that off the table and more certainty around income streams, the hospitals have decided to start spending, and - so that's the first part. The second part to your point is, as they are spending, they're going through the same modernization assessment, that many of our customers are, which is how do we increase productivity? How do we improve customer experience? And that all requires datacenter modernization, and more flexible architectures, et cetera. And so we're having those kinds of conversations. We do - when we look at the growth rates in healthcare, we do feel confident that we are taking share, on top of both of those trends. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Rogers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open. Jason Rogers : Yes. What was the organic growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis, ex-Scalar? Collin Kebo : Yes, we didn't provide that. But we did share that Scalar performed in line with expectations and previously, we said we expected Scalar to contribute about 100 basis points for the full year. So I think that'll get you in the general ballpark. Jason Rogers : All right. And with the hardware increase, the 10% increase for the quarter, what was the growth in client devices, and are you seeing any signs of a slowdown there, keeping in mind obviously, the difficult comps, but just wondering if there's any slowness beyond that? Collin Kebo : Yes. We grew client devices double digits in the quarter, and we continue to see healthy demand for client devices. Obviously, there is constrains around supply availability and we have some big overlaps coming up. So while we feel good about the client device business, I would expect the growth rate to moderate as we move throughout the year. Jason Rogers : And then finally, wondering if there has been any change in the competitive landscape, specifically on the solution selling that you're gaining traction with, if you're seeing any emerging competitors there? Christine Leahy : Yeah, I would say the stable part of our business is that the competitive landscape is always changing. So you have different types of organizations who pop up on the landscape. We have organizations that we're used to competing with. It's just a heavily competitive environment and that's just - that's something we're used to and we control - we can control and face it every day. So I wouldn't say more or less, it's just the continuing high competitive nature of what we do. Jason Rogers : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum : Good morning. Appreciate the opportunity. Chris, I was hoping you could compare and contrast Scalar with the Kelway acquisition. Kelway has provided you several years of revenue upside. And just help me to provide some long term expectations for what do you see in the Canadian market? And then, now with the Scalar acquisition, what is your market share in Canada compared with the US? Christine Leahy : Okay. Let me, let me take that apart a little bit. I'll start with the back and move forward. The market share in Canada is fairly consistent with our US market share and the UK, somewhere in the 5% range of the whole market. With Scalar, that might increase just a little bit. In terms of Scalar versus Kelway, they are highly consistent in the purpose of the acquisitions, in terms of bringing value to our customers, in areas where our customers had to ask for that. So you'll remember international customers wanted less touch points across the globe, and that's what we brought them there. In Canada customers are looking for full suite of portfolio options from single providers across the spectrum of clients, transaction, solutions, et cetera and also, additional expertise in the areas of high growth solutions such as security, managed services, infrastructure, et cetera, so both consistent in that way. Differences would be that UK, CDW UK also brought us the capability to support customers across the globe. That's a different capability than we had up in Canada. Canada is not a hub for us for supporting across the globe. So both of them are intended to be growth acquisitions. Both of them are not as focused on synergies, if you will. We will get operating synergies up in Canada as we scale that business, but these were not cost plays, they were growth plays intended to be highly consistent with our strategy of bringing more capabilities that our customers were telling us they wanted and needed. Does that help? Keith Housum : It does. I appreciate that. Just a follow-up and changing gears on your government side. Talking about some of the businesses kind of brought forward or - more a timing item. Does that really like reduce the government's overall budgets for technology spend during the year, and does that perhaps, free up your sales guys, your architects, engineers, the opportunity to grow additional revenues just on top of that. So instead of just pulling forward, the revenue. It just may be a gross add? Christine Leahy : Yes, it's a great question. I wouldn't think of it that way because many of these projects are multiyear projects. And as you know, when we describe and I know others describe, these solutions projects can be very lumpy. Getting the timing of them exactly right is not necessarily easy. So some projects pull up to January, February, March. Others that might have pushed into the back of the year from last year, frankly. So I wouldn't think about it is as freeing up dollars. I would just think about it as shifting the timing, and not freeing up sales time to work elsewhere, because they're already working on projects that relate to deliveries later in the year. Keith Housum : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. Christine Leahy : Thank you for joining us today and for your questions. As always, I want to especially thank all of our 9,400 CDW coworkers for their exceptional efforts and dedication to serving our customers each and every day. They are our true competitive advantage, and the heart, soul and reason why we consistently deliver meaningful value to exceed our customers' needs and expectations. They are the reason we have and will continue to lead the industry. I would also like to thank our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve and repeatedly earn your trust. Thank you and we'll look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

I also want to remind you that this conference call is property of CDW, and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn it back over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Beth. Second quarter results were ,excellent with both strong top line growth and profitability. Consolidated net sales were $4.6 billion, up 10.6% above last year, 11.2% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 11.2% to $774 million. Non-GAAP operating income increased 10.7% to $358 million and non-GAAP net income per share increased 15.7% to $1.60 per share. These results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of offerings that address customer priorities across the IT landscape, and ongoing success executing our three part strategy for growth. First, the balance across our customer end markets; as you know , we have five US sales channels; corporate small business healthcare, government and education. Each of these channels are meaningful businesses, generating annual sales of more than $1 billion. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including K12, higher ed, state and local government and federal government. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered nearly $2 billion in 2018. These unique sales organizations, serve us well when end markets behave differently from each other. Sometimes that occurs because markets are disrupted by macro or external challenges. Sometimes it occurs when customers' behavior differ due to different priorities. This quarter, our double-digit sales increase was driven by excellent results across all five of our US channels, each growing high single digits or better. US customers remain focused on client devices to meet growing needs from full employment, as well as refresh, driven by older equipment, new used cases and new security features. At the same time, customers continue to modernize their IT infrastructure and adopt more flexible architectures. The team did an outstanding job helping customers address these priorities. In corporate, the team delivered just under 9% growth, as they successfully addressed ongoing demand for client devices, while overlapping last year's strong results. The small business team continued to leverage end market specific offerings and dedicated solution specialists, to deliver nearly 15% growth. The government team drove a 17% increase in sales. Federal had another excellent quarter, with sales up more than 20%. The team leveraged our distribution centers to meet customer refresh needs, and continued to deliver ongoing projects, like the Navy CANES floating cloud initiative and newer cyber security related initiatives, as they lap the impact of last year's shipping delays. The state and local team delivered high single-digit growth, as they helped customers refresh client devices. Education's 9% increase reflected low double-digit growth in K-12 and low single-digit growth in higher ed. K12 delivered on networking needs, and overcame chip constraints to meet ongoing refresh. Higher ed continued to leverage our broad portfolio to help campuses use technology to upgrade and enhance student and teacher experiences. Healthcare was up 14%, as the team continued to drive excellent results, helping health systems improve endpoint access and security, as well as address medical record storage and accessibility needs. Other, which represents our Canadian and UK operations, increased 8% on a reported basis. Both markets faced challenging overlaps in local currency. Canadian growth was driven by both organic and Scalar performance. The UK team delivered excellent increases in software and services, but as expected, local currency growth slowed on top of last year's more than 25% growth, and UK was flat year-on-year. Clearly, second quarter results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Second quarter results also demonstrate the power of our second driver of performance, the breadth of our offerings. With over 100,000 products, services and solutions for more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. US transactions increased mid teens led by high teens increases in client devices. US solutions increased mid single digits, led by double-digit growth in Netcomm hardware, which drove excellent increases in associated services and software. On a net sales basis, hardware increased 11%, software increased 5%, and services increased 26%. Hardware performance was fueled by client devices and Netcomm, both up double digits. Lapping last year's supply constraints, Netcomm growth was driven by data center, modernization and campus refresh, including investments to support ongoing digital transformation initiatives. On the client side, the team did an exceptional job leveraging our unique ability to provide high value services like pre-orders, configuration and staging, in a supply constrained environment. Video also increased double digits, driven by both displays and digital signage. Performance was lumpy in datacenter hardware, both enterprise storage and servers posted mid-single digit declines. Server performance was mixed across channels . Once again hyperconverged infrastructure posted meaningful double-digit growth. Flash represented nearly one-third of total storage hardware in the quarter, with customer adoption, aided by expanded offerings and improved economics. Software net sales increased 5%. As you know, software is becoming a larger component of IT solutions. Success helping customers adopt new technologies and infrastructure refresh, drove double-digit growth in network management, storage management and operating system software. Cloud also contributed to this quarter's results, with double-digit increases in customer spend, and gross profit. Growth was driven by productivity, collaboration mobility and security workloads. Services' 26% increase was led by professional services, warranties and configurations. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making in our three part strategy for growth investments made to ensure we continue to serve our customers' IT needs in this evolving markets, whether in a physical virtual or cloud-based environment, in the US or internationally. Our three part strategy for growth is to first, acquire new customers and capture share. Second, enhance our solutions capabilities. And third, expand our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars work in tandem. Each is crucial to our ability to profitably deliver the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. The first pillar focuses on continuous productivity improvement. This is vital to our ability to achieve our overall strategy. Continuous productivity gains fuel our ability to invest, while delivering profitable growth. A key way we do this, is through disciplined sales management programs, like category penetration goals and book management. Prescriptive programs don't work unless we have the talent in place to execute them. So for CDW, a key way we drive productivity, is by hiring and retaining the right talent. This is more critical than ever in today's tight labor market, and we have several innovative programs in place to help ensure we continue to hire develop and retain the best talent. Our sales residency program is a great example. Launched in November 2016, the program drive increased performance both through engagement and enablement initiatives. Residency focuses on CDW account managers between five to 24 months length of service. After completing four months in sales academy, residents are placed on their permanent sales team and assigned to a dedicated resident sales leader. The program includes mandatory formal training across multiple dimensions, all focused on building both technology and sales skills, with a focus on building solution skills early on our sellers career. Results have been excellent to date, customer spend for residents within 13 to 24 months of service was 40% higher this quarter than in the second quarter of 2016. Solutions as a percentage of total sales for account managers in the program are 300 basis points higher than in 2016. At the same time, the attrition rate for account managers with zero to 24 months length of service, has declined nearly 25%. Of course, retaining the right coworkers requires hiring the right coworkers. In this competitive market, we are implementing innovative approaches to ensure we continue to attract targeted talent. We are currently piloting artificial intelligence solutions to identify top talent within an applicant pool. AI tools identify high potential candidates, by finding applicants with characteristics demonstrated by high performing CDW sales professionals. When there is a high match, recruiters target the candidate for more intense activity. Our AI pilots build on other investments we are making to drive recruiting productivity, combining texting software to stay in touch with applicants with our collaboration platform, to conduct video interviews, has helped us hire 35% more highly qualified and diverse candidates year-over-year. For our entry level sales role, integrating video interviews into our process resulted in a 25% percent increase in the number of candidates screened. These are just a few handful of the ways we are investing to hire, train and retain talent. These investments, coupled with the strength of our value proposition, contribute to both seller and customer retention. At the end of the quarter, nearly 30% of our sellers had at least 10 years of CDW experience. Longer tenured account managers have longer relationships with customers, and that has a direct impact on sales. Customers with more than 20 years with us represented just under half of this quarter's spend. Clearly our investments in our coworkers contribute to our profitable growth. Investments we have made to enhance our solutions and services capabilities, our second and third pillars, are also contributing to our profitable growth. These pillars are designed to ensure we remain relevant to our customers and to our partners. Our acquisition of Canadian solutions provider, Scalar, a great example of our second and third pillars in action. Scalar has locations across Canada and brings strong capabilities in fast-growing areas, like security, cloud, infrastructure and digital transformation, with deep services capabilities. Our investment thesis is straightforward with Scalar; accelerate our solutions capabilities, and expand our geographic reach within Canada. Let me share an example of how we are already benefiting from Scalar's solutions expertise. As CDW Canada customer needed to upgrade their security environment, key to the need was the desire to safeguard how they interacted with their clients. The customer had been with CDW Canada for some time, but we had limited success penetrating their solutions business. Knowing the breadth and scope of the Scalar portfolio, the CDW account manager brought Scalar in on the problem. Scalar's security services team did a deep dive with the customer and developed a comprehensive solution, which included hardware, software and services. The solution centered on a zero-trust security model, that utilizes cloud-based firewall virtualization, to protect both enterprise and customer facing environments. Importantly, incorporating Scalar delivered implementation and training services into the solution, meant deployment was fast. The solution generated more than C$500,000 product sales and C$100,000 in services. Great early proof points on the benefit of the technical and services investment made in Scalar. Cloud is another area, where you see the benefit of our technical and services investments. Investments made in our cloud practice since its launch in 2011, have enabled a portfolio of solutions that span the entire life cycle, from design, migration, integration, consumption management, and managed services. Last quarter, we shared an example of how we helped a customer migrate an electronic medical records workload from the cloud, back to on-prem solution. This quarter, let's take a look at an example of how our small business team helped a customer move a backup and recovery workload to the cloud. A small, rapidly growing global real estate support business, held their data on-site and needed a fail-safe backup solution, no downtime, right away. The customer had a cloud-based pay-as-you-go subscription for test-dev, but did not have any ongoing cloud application. Their dedicated CDW small business account manager brought in one of our small business Technical Solutions Advisors' to help. After assessing the situation, the advisor identified that one of our pre-packaged Small Business Solutions bundles was well suited for the customers' needs. The bundle included cloud-based recovery, with design and migration services, a perfect fit for the customers' needs, including quick implementation. Packaging solutions with services is one of the ways our dedicated small business segment is making solutions more accessible for the customer, and easier for the seller to sell. Prior to our investment in dedicated small business technical coworkers and development of small business focus packaged solutions, this solution would have required meaningful technical resources and investment of time, that would not have met our threshold for profitable growth. Solving key business problems for our sweet spot of customers in today's environment requires the right talent and strong services and solutions capabilities. These capabilities, combined with our competitive advantage of scale, scope and disciplined execution, helped drive sustainable profitable growth for us today and in the future. And that leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. Through the first half of the year, we have added approximately 165 customer facing co-workers, excluding Scalar. We now expect to be at or modestly above the high end of the 125 to 175 full year range previously shared. As we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust our plans as appropriate. Given first half market performance, our current view of 2019 US IT market growth remains in line with the expectations we shared last quarter of full-year growth, of roughly 3%. Reflecting our share gains to date, we now target constant currency organic growth between 400 and 475 basis points above the market. In addition, we continue to look for Scalar to contribute an incremental 100 basis points. As you can see, there is no meaningful change in how we feel about the balance of the year. We continue to expect ongoing, but moderating strength in client devices, and solid growth in solutions, as we overlapped last year's second half double-digit growth. The wildcards we spoke about last quarter like Brexit and tariffs has pushed out, but still exist. We'll keep a watchful eye, and as is our practice, update our view, as we move through the year. In the meantime, the team will continue to do what they do best, out execute the competition and leverage our competitive advantages, to help our customers address their IT priorities. Now, let me turn it over to Colin. Collin Kebo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated, our second quarter results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings, and ongoing execution of our three part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business, that build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth, and return cash to shareholders. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8; consolidated net sales were $4.6 billion, up 10.6% on a reported basis and in average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 11.2%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 15.2% percent versus Q1 of 2019. This was modestly below historical seasonality, given the strength of the first quarter, which included the timing benefits from the Netcomm backlog flush in federal, but stronger than expected, driven by one client device growth, which is very strong across the business, with most US channels growing healthy double digits, notwithstanding uncertainty from tariffs and CPU constraints. And to public, where we had really strong growth across three channels. Government was up 17%, even with the federal timing shift into Q1. Education were K-12 as up double-digits and healthcare, which was also up double digits. Gross profit for the quarter increased 11.2% to $774 million, gross margin expanded 10 basis points, driven by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, including warranties and software-as-a-service, partially offset by year-over-year net sales growth, outpacing the year-over-year growth in partner funding. Turning to SG&A on slide 9; our non-GAAP SG&A, including, advertising increased 11.7%. The increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, which moves in line with gross profit growth, incremental Scalar expenses, performance based compensation, consistent with higher attainment against goals and investments in the business consistent with our go-forward strategy, including co-worker count. Co-worker count of 9,783 was up nearly 870 coworkers from June of 2018, with almost half of the year-over-year increase from Scalar and the remaining from organic coworker investments. Roughly, two-thirds of the nearly 870 coworkers added year-over-year, were in customer-facing roles. Non-GAAP operating income was $358 million, an increase of 10.7%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%. Moving to slide 10; interest expense was $41 million, up 8.7%. This was primarily driven by the interest rate caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to 2.375%. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 11, was 24.7% in the quarter, which is flat compared to last year. This resulted in Q2 tax expense of $65 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation, which is shown on slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.6%, down 40 basis points compared to last year's 26% rate, primarily due to guidance issued by the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2018 on foreign taxes creditable against global intangible low taxed income. As you can see on slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 148 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.33, up 17.9%. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects operating performance, was $238 million in the quarter, up 11.5% over last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.60, up 15.7% from last year. Currency headwinds dampened non-GAAP earnings per share growth by approximately 70 basis points in the second quarter. Turning to first half results on slides 14 through 17, revenue was $8.6 billion, an increase of 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.1% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one fewer selling day in the first half of 2019. On a constant currency, average daily sales basis consolidated net sales were 11.8% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.4 billion, up 11.3% and gross profit margin was 16.8%, up 10 basis points. Non-GAAP operating income was $646 million for the first half of 2019, up 10.7%. Net income was $350 million, and non-GAAP net income was $423 million, up 12.5%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.84, up 16.8%. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 18, as of June 30 cash and cash equivalents were $195 million, and net debt was $3.1 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. As shown on slide 19, we maintain strong rolling three-month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our three-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down one day from last year's second quarter, and slightly below the low end of our annual target range of high teens to low 20s. Free cash flow year-to-date was $407 million, compared to $188 million in the first half of 2018. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow, primarily reflects higher cash profits and mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. For the quarter, we returned $198 million of cash to shareholders, which included $43 million of dividends and $155 million of share repurchases, at an average price of nearly $104 per share. Turning to slide 20, our capital allocation priorities remain the same and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value, through returns of capital and strategic investments. In order of priority, first increase dividends annually, to guide these increases; in November 2014 we set a target to achieve a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow over five years. For this quarter, we will pay a dividend of $0.295 per share on September 10 to shareholders of record as of August the 26, up 40% from a year ago. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 2.3 times, slightly below the low end of this range. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Scalar is a great example of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Our capital allocation priorities support our updated 2019 outlook, which you can see on slide 21. As Chris mentioned, we continue to expect US IT market growth of approximately 3%. We now expect net sales growth of 400 to 475 basis points above US IT market growth in constant currency, on an organic basis. We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an additional approximately 100 basis points of growth on top of the 400 to 475 basis points. Currency is expected to represent a 60 basis point headwind for the full year, assuming year-to-go exchange rates of $1.20 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. Given year-to-date exchange rates, this implies currency headwinds of roughly 60 basis points in the second half of 2019, with headwinds in the fourth quarter expected to be slightly greater than the third quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid 7% range for 2019. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis to be in the low teens, call it 13% plus or minus 50 basis points. This range is 150 basis points above our previous constant currency range of 11% to 12%. Currency headwinds are projected to save approximately 60 basis points from the constant currency rates. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual basis. Slide 22 provides additional modeling thoughts. Based on first half results and the expectations for the rest of the year, we look for sales in the second half to now be roughly 100 basis points lower than our historical sales, seasonality split of approximately 52% in the second half. We expect a low single-digit increase in sequential average daily sales from Q2 to Q3, which would be a couple of hundred basis points below the 3% average of the past three years. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid 7% range. Total annual depreciation and amortization is now expected to be in the range of $265 million to $270 million. This includes approximately $180 million of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, including a preliminary estimate for Scalar, that could change slightly, once the purchase accounting is final. Depreciation and amortization expense in SG&A, excluding the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. Equity-based compensation is expected to be approximately $5 million to $7 million higher than 2018. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $165 million to $167 million, with the year-over-year growth driven primarily by the caps increasing from a strike price of 1.5% to 2.375%. Our 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be near the lower end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings per share growth, approximately 350 to 200 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth is expected to have currency headwinds of 60 basis points, similar to the topline. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on slide 23. Our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. Expectations for capital expenditures, excluding the Census remain unchanged at slightly more than half a point, of sales. We expect the cash tax rate to be slightly below 25.5% of pre-tax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition related intangibles. We expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the annual target range of high teens to low 20s. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Joelle to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Matt Cabral : Thank you. I wanted to start off on a broader demand environment. So you're continuing to see healthy double digit growth, but some of your vendor partners are starting to see a little bit of softness, particularly on more solutions-oriented categories. So I guess, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're hearing from your customer base, in terms of their budget plans and just what you think may be driving that disconnect? Christine Leahy : Yeah. Hi, Matt. Look our -- in conversations with our customers, they are still feeling bullish, and they are still looking to spend. When you think about our customer base, and take a step back and think about some of the exposure that others have, that we don't have, things like China, things like consumer certain other end markets, hyperscaler is another example. But -- that are more challenged, that's not what our customer base is facing. And so we've got a broad portfolio, as you know and we can help our customers, wherever there IT priorities are. The other thing I would just say is, that in an environment like this, where the economy feels pretty strong and customer sentiment remains strong in our view, our competitive advantages allow us to drive even bigger share gains, as we do things like leverage our scale and our distribution centers, as I mentioned. So look, the outlook for the rest of the year is pretty consistent in our view, with how we felt at the beginning of the year. Not a lot of data points out there that has given us any reason to perceive it differently. If you look at -- as you said, peer results, competitive results, the VAR survey, CIO surveys, economic data, there's stuff that's kind of lining up on both sides of the ledger and net-net, we still see a 3% market rate of growth and pretty healthy demand from our customers. Matt Cabral : Got it and then government was a stand-out vertical for you in the quarter. Just wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into what drove the strength there, and just how we should think about the sustainability of it going forward? Christine Leahy : Yeah. Federal is doing a terrific job across refresh of those agencies, that didn't -- more mandated and refreshed under the Department of Defense. So we've seen refresh now in agencies that didn't have that mandate, and that's been strong. But what I really say about the Federal team, is they have focused their go-to-market investments over the past several years, on solution capabilities and we're seeing that come to fruition in the types of transactions that they're working on. So if you look at this quarter, they are driving strong results across, not just refresh, but strategic solutions, transactions for cyber security, for modernization of infrastructure, etc. And those are deals that take a long time to develop, and looking at the pipeline, continue to remain strong. So they will got the go-to-market in place to go after those deals. They have got the trust with the customer, that takes long time to develop. We've got the technology and support to be able to help them with that and expand those. And the other thing that they're doing is, they're creating really strong proof-of-concepts for certain agencies, that we're finding, we're now able to take this proof-of-concept and transport them to other agencies that are looking at similar types of problems they are trying to attack, and we have credibility because we've built it for different agencies. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Two questions from me as well. I guess first one, if my math is right, I think your share gains have been in the neighborhood of about 600 basis points in the first half of the year, and that's much better than the historical trend lines you've typically talked about. So I am wondering if you could maybe just touch on what are the levers that are enabling this outsized share gain growth rates in the first half, and what elements of that might be sustainable, versus not, as you go forward? Christine Leahy : I will start with that. When you think about the first quarter of the year. Remember, we had some one-time events there with the Netcomm flush that was the normalization of the lead time. So that's kind of a one-time that happened in the first quarter, that we wouldn't expect to see a repeat in the back half of the year. Certainly, we had a pull forward with some federal deals. But federal is doing a really good job. But at the end of the day, when you think about client devices, we think about that continuing to be strong but moderating. We think about solutions continuing to be solid. But we're also looking at really tough overlaps. And so if you look at the last year, we've got a number of our businesses and practice areas comping double-digit on double-digit. And so we're quite attuned to that, when we think about the back half of the year. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's fair. And then I guess, when I think of the gross margins -- is there a way for us to think about how much of the benefit you're getting on a year-over-year basis or perhaps from increasing contribution from reoccurring business streams or revenue streams on a year-over-year basis. And then I guess broadly is there a way to think about what percent of your gross profit dollars today are reoccurring in nature, and what that trend line or growth rates look like? Christine Leahy : Yeah, I'll start and I will let Collin talk a little bit more about the accounting rules. But at a high level, what I will say is, the accounting rules for where we fit in the channel, are really specific. They are complicated and there is not a one size fits all. So where we are fitting in as a service and how that's recognized is complicated. What I would say and what's really important, is that as our customers are having conversations about transactional on-prem-as-a-service other consumption models, we're agnostic to that. So we are having the conversations with them and we're advising them along the way, in terms of assessing, designing, implementing, consuming managing etc. How that reflects in our financial statements, I will let Collin talk through. But it's important to recognize, that we are part of those conversations in driving, as our partners business models change, we are driving what it is that they are bringing to market and bringing to our customers. Collin Kebo : Yeah Amit, I would say the traditional pure subscription or recurring revenue is still a relatively small percentage of our business. If you look at the amount of revenue that we're recognizing, that's booked over time rather than upfront or at a point in time, it's probably around 3% of sales. What I would say though is, because of the accounting that Chris mentioned and again, how we participate in this ecosystem, if you look at the percentage of our gross profit that is netted down, it was about 28% in the quarter. So a lot of those things that are getting netted down or things that have a finite term, we're selling a warranty, we're selling software-as-a-service, software assurance, etc. So I think that can give you some idea of the magnitude of what's flowing through our gross profit, in some of those transactional streams. Amit Daryanani : That's really helpful. Thanks a lot and congrats on the quarter guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good morning. As you highlighted free cash flow has doubled in the first half of the year, and if you look at historical first half versus second half seasonality, it would put you potentially well above the target range for the full year. Can you just talk about what is maybe driving the better first half seasonality, and what might slow free cash flow in the back half of the year? Collin Kebo : Yes, sure Katy. You're right. Q2 is typically a seasonally low free cash flow quarter for us, because sales grow sequentially and we have two tax payments we have to make. This year was unusual. I would say the stars aligned for us from a vendor mix perspective, and that's really what drove the free cash flow favorability in the quarter. I'd expect that will normalize, as we move into the back half of the year, would expect us to be within our 3.375% and 4.25% of sales rule of thumb for the full year. Katy Huberty : And then, Microsoft expressed the view that Windows 10 upgrades will continue past the January 2020 support expiration, especially for the small-medium business market where you have exposure. Do you tend to agree that you'll continue to see the upgrade cycle in 2020, or do you think that it's difficult to continue growing the client segment, as you annualize the comps from this year? Christine Leahy : Hi, Katy, it's Chris. I think it's not unreasonable to think that we will continue to see some of that spill into 2020 into the first quarter, for example, and maybe a little bit beyond. What that looks like over the course of all of 2020, hard to predict, but certainly some of it is spilling into the front half of the year. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks and good morning. I just have two related strategic questions Chris. In the past you've mentioned being open to a large acquisition, I think over $1 billion. On your slides Scalar is an example and obviously of M&A and it's much smaller than this. So the first question is just kind of update on your thoughts related to executing M&A over $1 billion, and I just mentioned this particularly in light of one of your largest competitors making a sizable transaction recently. That deal was arguably more of a financial transaction, or sizable cost synergies could drive that below five times EBITDA, which kind of leads me to my second question, it sounds like CDW's focus is more on capabilities. So just wanting to understand the part of not pursuing something like an Insight-PCM, given it would be significantly accretive based on where CDW trades relative to others? Christine Leahy : Yeah. Thanks Adam. Great question. Yeah, we're still focused on M&A. I think if you look at our track record, Kelway, and even the early proof points with Scalar. Our discipline around the right targets and then our methodical approach to integrating and our focus on getting it right for the customer right off the bat, and empowering our coworkers to deliver for the joint customers, is leading and has led to really positive success. So the model is working. We are in the market. We're looking, constantly, we are proactive. We tend not to be reactive, as you know. But, yeah our -- the way we think about it from a strategy perspective, is kind of pretty straightforward. Two things, expand our solutions capabilities or extend our services capabilities. Those two things plus geo expansion, that's essentially how we think about M&A. As far as the notion of a large, kind of more financial play. Look we have to look long and hard at that, because of the, the difficulty of integrating an organization. As I know, you know, we take that very seriously. That's why cultural fit leadership is so important, and we tick through the things that matter. So that's something we just have to take a look at. But we're really focusing on the capabilities and geographic reach always in the market. But it's got to make sense. Adam Tindle : Okay. Maybe just as a quick clarification for Collin on financing for an acquisition. I mean, is there a scenario where it might make sense to use equity in a larger transaction? Stock valuation is quite healthy and it would still be accretive? Collin Kebo : Yeah, Adam, given where we sit with our leverage profile, we are 2.3 times below the 2.5 to 3 times, I think that gives us plenty of headroom. And if we had to go above that 3 times and temporarily step out of that range, I think our investors and our rating agencies would give us the flexibility or latitude to do that, as long as we show the clear path to deleveraging and a reasonable amount of time in getting back within the target range. We demonstrated throughout our past, that if we set a leverage target, we'll get there. So I think our preference would be to use leverage, but obviously it will be dependent on situation. Adam Tindle : Makes sense. And congrats on the continued strong results. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Param Singh with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Param Singh : Hi, good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. So just wanted to get a sense of your productivity here. If I just look at sales per coworker, it was growing at 1% year-over-year this quarter, which is a slowdown from the last year quarters. Is that because you've had incremental co-workers coming in from Scalar, that you need to integrate and get up in productivity, or is there another reason behind that, and do you think the addition of coworkers is, while you're outperforming your competitors? And then I have a follow-up. Collin Kebo : Hi Param and welcome to the call. Glad you could join. Yeah, I would say a couple of things are driving that. One is Scalar, because of the high services mix and the service delivery co-workers that go along with it, the sales per coworker productivity isn't comparable to CDW, given the different business mix. Also we're in the summer, so there's a little bit of seasonality, where we bring in a lot of interns. This summer and this year, we brought in more than the prior year so that's impacting it. But I think if you looked at kind of apples-to-apples organic, regular CDW coworkers, you would see productivity levels more in line with historical levels. Param Singh : Understood, thanks. And then, I mean, just specifically on the educational segment, it was much stronger in seasonality then you've typically seen in prior years. Is it because the March quarter was weaker in education, or were there additional wins in the quarter, and would you expect that to persist? Christine Leahy : Yeah. I would describe the K-12 as really strong quarter and when you think about the constraints in the marketplace around client advices, and the summer months being very important for education to buy and implement those devices. We had a couple of things going on. First, the constraints were more severe in K-12, because of Chromebook and where Intel placed their priority around higher performing chips. So the team did really an extraordinary job of working with customers, working with our partners around what the options are, when to get things in, etc. and we're able to deliver over the summer months, which is really quite impressive. In addition, we've seen some net working positivity, and when you think about E-rate and where that falls throughout the -- any given quarter, it's really bumpy. It never falls in the same quarter it seems to be, because of some lag or some paperwork issue. But we did see some growth under the E-Rate program this quarter as well. So I would just say, all in all, solid quarter doing -- executing on the priorities that we typically execute on. Param Singh : Okay. All right, thank you so much. Really appreciate it, Chris, Colin. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thanks and good morning. So a question regarding your commentary on the UK and EMEA regions being somewhat slower growth. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing? Obviously there is some economic concerns across Europe, but we're still obviously in an upgrade cycle from a corporate standpoint. So any help there would be would be great. Christine Leahy : Yeah. Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question, and obviously we watch this closely. First, I would say that the team has been executing extremely well. When you look at overlap, double-digit on double-digit, and we are talking meaningful, last year plus 30%, the year before, high double digits. They're executing well. That said, I would say a couple of things. First, the market outside of the US probably feels marginally a little softer, a little more uncertain than it does in the US, and we're watching that. We hadn't seen in Q2, different buying behaviors but from our customers. But you got to believe Brexit on their mind, given that it's 90 days away, and we've got some new rhetoric and new leadership in place. So it's hard to believe that it's not on their mind. But that said, I'll tell you, our referral business continues to be very healthy. Our international meaning Rest of World business outside the UK, continues to be very healthy, and the team continues to be optimistic in terms of their conversations around customers. So look with the wildcard of Brexit looming, we are just being very cautious. The good news is, we've run this table-top before -- before the October 31st extension. Earlier in the year, we worked with customers to map their need, so that we would be prepared to help them. And we've also opened an office in The Netherlands, and we've got a number of customers actually that are transacting through the Netherlands. So we are getting more and more confident with our ability to deliver to the same service level agreement. So we're doing everything we can to be prepared, but we can't control what happens in the environments, and we'll just keep, I think, out executing as the team has been doing. Matt Sheerin : Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up question regarding your Census contract. Could you give us an update there in terms of contribution relative to expectations? Christine Leahy : Yeah. Well Census is going well. Contribution relative to expectations hasn't changed. We still expect 40 basis points of revenue growth, as a result of Census. I would give a shout out to the team, that it's a lot of hard work, a lot of collaboration, not just at CDW, but with a number of partners as well. And again, think about the number of devices that we have running through our configuration center. At the same time, we've got K-12 busy season. We've got inventory in there under constrained conditions, and we're really doing a great job of getting it in and moving it out. So 40 basis points for the year, so far so good. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Paul Coster : Yeah, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch on a couple of prior subjects. First up on the client device front, to what extent do you see customers sweating asset beyond the Windows 10 upgrade dates, and is that yielding a service opportunity for you? Christine Leahy : Yeah, thanks for the question. You know, we have seen a number of customer -- a very large number of customers now converting to Win 10. And so, I don't know that I would see that as an opportunity that there is going be a number of customers' sweating the assets after this conversion. It just doesn't feel that way with the activity we've seen with current customers, what we're hearing from Microsoft, etc. it doesn't feel like the market is going that way. Paul Coster : Got it. And then, Chris, just on this point of Europe -- a massive plan now, but still small in the context of the overall market. There is obviously a huge opportunity to scale up. But I'm wondering whether you think there is a limitation to how far you can go, given how important the sales culture is, and it's maintaining its integrity? Do you see a natural limitation to the growth? Christine Leahy : Yeah, it a spot on question because that sales culture is so important to an acquisition working. I can tell you that we have looked at a number of players. This is a constant rhythm for us, which is meeting with and talking to people, and it's very clear that there are some organizations out there, where there is not a fit. But equally there are organizations where we feel culturally, particularly on the sales side, they could be a really good fit. So is there a natural limitation? Sure there is, because organizations are all different. But we think that is not going to impair our ability to find a good solution or a good expansion path at all. Paul Coster : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum : Good morning. Thanks for the opportunity. Chris, client devices have been strong for a better part, two years now, and if it's the Windows 10 refresh or if it's the full employment. It kind of seems like it's getting more difficult to grow on top of that, just because kind of -- two years into it. Is there a concern or perception that client devices will be slowing down, or do you still see an opportunity for that to grow? And if so, how? Christine Leahy : Yeah. We definitely, when we look at client device and we look at the compares over the last couple of years and the quarters, it's going to be tough to grow at those kinds of rates. So we wouldn't expect -- we would expect our client device growth to be at a more muted rate, yet healthy, because we do have customers who continue to -- who are new refresh cycles frankly or continuing to expand their use of client devices for different things in the business, new use cases, etc. But certainly we are facing very difficult comparisons, and we expect that growth to moderate. Keith Housum : Got you. And then if I could just ask a bit more strategic question, following up on the question before regarding acquisitions. Is there assuming -- are your capabilities that you are not going to be able to either grow internally or to acquire, I mean, on the same front geographically is there -- sort of geographics areas that you're more targeted to expansion than others? Christine Leahy : Yeah I think when you think about capability, it would be the same areas that we frequently talk about, and you know, Scalar is a great example, infrastructure, security, managed services, digital transformation, those are all areas where -- when you think about bolstering our current capabilities, areas we'd look at. In terms of geographic, that's really driven primarily from what, where our current customers have needs, and that's been our strategy all along. So we look at our UK, US, Canadian customers and where the pipeline is growing, and where they're telling us, they really could use some help. And there certainly are some places on the continent that makes sense, but there are some places in other areas of the world that make equal sense. And at the same time, we do have smaller presence in a variety of locations. Dubai, for example, in Asia, in Singapore, Hong Kong, and we're also focused on bolstering those, to ensure that we can deliver on the current needs that our UK multinationals have Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. Christine Leahy : Well, thank you and let me close by once again thanking our 9.800 coworkers around the globe for their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. They are true competitive advantage and the heart, soul and reason why we consistently deliver meaningful value to exceed our customers needs and expectations. They are the reason we have and will continue to lead the industry. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve and repeatedly earn your trust, and thank you for your continued interest in CDW. I also want to send a shout out to Gary Woodland, winner of this year's US Open Championship, CDW is the official technology partner to the PGA Tour, and Gary has been a terrific CDW technology ambassador since 2014. Gary, we couldn't be more thrilled for you. With that I'd like to say thanks again and Collin and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

Please note that all references to growth rates are dollar amounts and our remarks today are versus the comparable period in 2018, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, all references to growth rates for hardware, software and services today represent U.S. net sales only and do not include the results from CDW U.K. or Canada. There was 1 extra selling day in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. There were the same number of selling days in the first 9 months of 2019 compared to the first 9 months of 2018. All sales growth rate references during the call will use average daily sales unless otherwise indicated. Replay of this webcast will be posted to our website later today. I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thanks, Brittany. Third quarter results were excellent with both strong sales growth and profitability. Consolidated net sales were $4.9 billion, up 12.2% on a reported basis. With 1 additional selling day in the quarter, average daily sales increased 10.5% and 10.9% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 14.4% to $816 million. Non-GAAP operating income increased 13.9% to $380 million and non-GAAP net income per share increased 19.8% to $1.70 per share. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP net income per share increased 20.4%. These excellent results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of offerings that address customer priorities across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. First, the balance across our customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education. Each of these channels are meaningful businesses generating annual sales of more than $1 billion. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including federal government, state and local governments, K-12 and higher education. In addition, we have our Canadian and UK operations, which together delivered over $2 billion of net sales the last 12 months. These unique sales organizations serve us well when end markets behave differently from each other, sometimes that occurs because markets are disrupted by macro or external challenges, sometimes it occurs when consumer behavior differs due to different priorities. This quarter, our double-digit sales increase was driven by excellent results across the U.S. business, with 4 of our 5 U.S. channels growing double-digits and solid local our performance from our international teams. U.S. customers remained focused on client devices to meet growing needs from full employment as well as refresh driven by older equipment, new use cases and new security features. At the same time, customers continued to modernize their IT infrastructure and adapt more flexible architectures. The teams did an outstanding job helping customers address these priorities. In corporate, the team delivered 10% growth as they successfully addressed ongoing customer demand for client devices, while driving solid solutions growth. The Small Business team delivered nearly 12% growth for the quarter driven by hardware strength, in particular client devices. Our corporate and small business customers continue to move ahead with technology decisions despite macroeconomic uncertainty, highlighting the importance of technology to achieve business goals. Customer activity and purchasing behavior remained strong in the quarter. The government team drove a 22% increase in sales. Federal had another excellent quarter of sales more than up 35%. The team delivered strong transaction and solutions result from both civilian and defense departments as we continue to benefit from investments we made to become a strategic technology partner to the federal government. In addition, in the quarter, the U.S. Census Bureau Device as a Service project contributed more to growth than previously expected. Changes to the final rollout schedule for 2019 resulted in more revenue recognized in the third quarter than other quarters this year. As we have discussed previously, we created a mobile technology solution that supports field data collection for the 2020 census that combine our services and logistics capabilities with our broad product portfolio and deep partner relationship. Census is a great example of the power of the breadth of our offerings and our technical capabilities. The State & Local team delivered flat performance as we lapped last year\u2019s mid-teens growth, which was driven by timing of new and existing contracts in the third quarter of 2018. The team continued to expand existing contracts and win new contracts and helped customers modernize their infrastructure and secure their environment. Education\u2019s flat performance reflected a double-digit growth in higher ed and a slight decline in K-12. We continued to gain market share on higher ed, leveraging our team\u2019s expertise and our broad portfolio to help campuses utilize technology to upgrade and enhance student and teacher experiences. K-12 couldn\u2019t fully overcome last year\u2019s nearly 20% growth driven by strong Chromebook results. Difficult compares aside, K-12 customer purchasing priorities otherwise remained consistent, focused on refresh and classroom transformation. The healthcare team delivered excellent performance, up 11% driven by double-digit growth in client devices and NetComm hardware. Healthcare demand continued to be driven by security needs, infrastructure refresh and a heightened focus on patient experience. Other, which represents our Canadian and UK operations, increased nearly 11% on a reported basis. In local currency, Canadian growth was driven by both organic and Scalar performance. Integration is on track, and we\u2019re providing expanded portfolio options to both existing CDW Canada and Scalar customers. The UK team delivered mid-single-digit growth in constant currency, successfully overlapping more than 20% growth for each of the last 2 years. The team continued to help customers transform their infrastructures, gain efficiencies and improve interoperability of their systems. As we have previously shared, our recently established presence in The Netherlands supports our broader growth opportunities in the EU and as needed serves as a Brexit contingency plan. Clearly, third quarter results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Third quarter results also demonstrate the power of our second driver of performance, the breadth of our offering, with over 100,000 products, services and solutions for more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well positioned to meet our customers\u2019 total needs across the spectrum of IT. U.S. transactions increased mid-teens led by over 20% growth in client devices. U.S. solutions increased mid single-digits and was the main driver of our gross margin improvement. Sales performance was strong and balanced with U.S. hardware, software and services all increasing double-digits. Let\u2019s take a deeper look. Hardware increased 10% fueled by client device growth. Client device growth was broad-based and driven by continued customer refresh, market share gains and the deployment of our Device as a Service solution to the Census Bureau. 4 of our 5 U.S. channels delivered double-digit client device growth. During the quarter we continued to leverage our competitive advantages and experienced minimal impact from tariffs and supply constraints. As we have discussed before, customers continue to focus on optimizing and modernizing their IT environment, however, infrastructure projects can be lumpy. The variability is driven by the timing of when projects come to fruition and also the mix of hardware and software in the solution. This quarter, data center hardware, including enterprise storage and servers and NetComm hardware, declined single digits on a consolidated basis, with the results mixed across channels. Once again, hyper-converged infrastructure and all-flash storage put us at meaningful double-digit growth as customers continue to seek improved economics and enhanced performance. Customers also sought to enhance the performance of their data centers and networks by investing in software. Success helping customers adopt new architectures, refresh infrastructure and secure their environments drove strong growth in storage management, security, operating system software and network management, driving total software growth of 12%. As you know, software is becoming a larger component of IT solutions we are working closely with our customers to maximize the return on their IT investment, whether it be hardware, software or services, which leads me to our services strategy. Services\u2019 16% increase was led by warranties, professional services and configuration. Cloud also contributed to this quarter\u2019s results with healthy double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit. Growth was driven by productivity, collaboration, security and mobility workloads. As you can see, we had excellent well-balanced performance in the quarter and were able to have our customers across a broad spectrum of IT needs part. That leads me to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making the three-part strategy for growth. Investments made to ensure we continue to serve our customers\u2019 IT needs in this evolving market whether in a physical, virtual or cloud-based environment in the U.S. or internationally. Importantly, our three-part growth strategy includes acquiring new customers and capture share, enhancing our solutions capabilities and expanding our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars work in tandem, each is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Our recent investment in Aptris is an example of our strategy in action. We acquired Aptris, a premier IT service management solutions provider and ServiceNow elite partner on October 1. As you know, IT service management and digital workflow platforms are rapidly becoming a cornerstone of IT and driving digital transformation across organizations. IT service management implementations and integrations are typically very complex, Aptris is a leader in IT service management solutions helping customers simplify the end-to-end process. Aptris\u2019 talent and expertise further expanded our capabilities in this fast growing segment of the IT market and enhanced the value we can deliver to our customers. Aptris has been a partner of CDW since 2017. We knew from our partnership that Aptris is also focused on exceeding customer expectations and that the two organizations are culturally aligned. Let me share an example of how CDW and Aptris partnered to solve a customers\u2019 business problem. A long time CDW customer wanted to migrate to ServiceNow to improve service levels from legacy systems that lacked full capabilities. The joint CDW and Aptris team started with discovery to understand the customer\u2019s pain points and goals to develop the right solution. With Aptris\u2019 deep team of technical talent and proprietary ServiceNow implementation processes, the team was able to develop precise plans for the migration and module rollout. Given the complexity of ServiceNow implementations, this expertise was critical to gaining credibility with the customer and successfully designing, integrating and delivering the solution. Aptris presents an exciting growth opportunity for our business, our customers, our partners and our coworkers. It brings the right talent and strategic capabilities we want to deliver to our customers. We welcome Aptris\u2019 nearly 100 coworkers to the CDW family. We remain focused on utilizing M&A as part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDW\u2019s strategic capabilities and we continue to explore M&A opportunities as part of our three-part strategy for growth. We also continue to invest organically in our three-part strategy for growth. Organic investments in our strategy include the addition of new coworkers, new partners, enhancing internal system and developing new capabilities. The next example I will share highlights how the three pillars of our strategy work in tandem as well as the importance of consistently executing and delivering for our customers as their trusted IT and business partner. A retail customer needed help modernizing one of its distribution centers. The customer wanted a partner who could assess, design, configure, deploy and implement different technologies from many vendor partners in a very tight window. Our ability to pull technical resources together from several different solutions practice areas enabled us to win the business and then execute the initial engagement at the highest standards. Note I said initial engagement because the team demonstrated CDW\u2019s competitive advantages and helped the customer to achieve its objectives, we earned a much larger opportunity to help the company open over 100 new stores and refresh another 400 stores annually, increasing the customer\u2019s annual spend with CDW by over 30%. For new stores, we developed an IT Store-in-a-Box, consisting of over 100 SKUs from over 20 different vendors to deliver the store\u2019s point of sale and credit card systems, customer interface tools, wireless access points and more. Our logistical excellence in large-scale project management, technical know-how and services delivered unique value to the customer. We have further partnered with the same customer to develop its store of the future and are helping the customer execute on its digital transformation strategy. This is a great example of our exceptional coworkers solving business challenges by leveraging CDW\u2019s deep solutions expertise and service capabilities to provide a unique offering and capture market share. That\u2019s how our three pillars work in tandem. Both of these examples highlight the importance of one of CDW\u2019s competitive advantages : our coworkers. They get it and make meeting the needs of our customers their first priority. We continue to prudently invest in customer-facing coworkers and ended the quarter up 275 from year-end, excluding Scalar. Additions are primarily due to an increase in service delivery coworkers to support the strong solutions and services growth seen year-to-date as well as technical coworkers and sellers. Fall timing of our account manager class has increased third quarter count, with normal attrition we now expect to end the year with new customer-facing coworkers in the mid-200, excluding Scalar and Aptris. As we always do, we will monitor the market and adjust as appropriate. And that leads me to our expectations for growth for the remainder of the year. Given year-to-date market performance, our current view of 2019 U.S. IT market growth remains in line with the expectations we have shared previously of full year growth of roughly 3%. Reflecting year-to-date share gains and expectations for the fourth quarter, we now target constant currency organic growth between 625 and 675 basis points above the market, roughly 200 basis points above our prior view. We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an incremental 100 basis points of growth for the year. Aptris is not expected to have a material impact on 2019 net sales. For full year 2019, we expect to deliver constant currency earnings per share growth in the mid-teens, meaningfully above prior quarter guidance. We continue to expect ongoing but moderating strengthen in client devices and solid growth in solutions as we overlap last year\u2019s fourth quarter double-digit growth. We will keep a watchful eye all of this, including the wildcards we have spoken about this year, like Brexit, tariffs and supply chain constraints. In the meantime, the team will continue to do what they do best, out-execute the competition and leverage our competitive advantages to help our customer address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives. I hope you can from tell my comments that this quarter\u2019s performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place, a strategy that leverages our competitive advantages and flexible business models to deliver both excellent profitability and strong cash flow. This confidence has led our Board to approve a 28.8% increase in our annual cash dividend, which puts us on track to achieve our capital allocation priority of delivering a dividend payout of 30% of free cash flow by year end. I know many of you are maybe wondering what we expect for 2020. We are in the middle of our planning process and Collin and I will provide the 2020 outlook on our year-end results conference call. Now let me turn it over to Collin to share more details on the financial performance. Collin Kebo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Chris indicated, our third quarter results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business that build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth and return cash to shareholders. Turning to our third quarter P&L on Slide 8, consolidated net sales were $4.9 billion, up 12.2% on a reported basis and 10.5% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 additional selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 6% versus Q2 of 2019, which was approximately 300 basis points better than historical seasonality and better-than-expected driven by one, client device growth, particularly in corporate, small business and government as we leveraged our competitive advantages to gain market share and help customers refresh their devices and two, successfully delivering device-as-a-service to the United States Census Bureau for the 2019 canvassing phase of the project. The majority of the devices were rolled out and the majority of the 2019 revenue was recognized during the third quarter. Gross profit for the quarter was $816 million, an increase of 14.4%, reflecting the benefit of an extra day in the quarter. Gross margin expanded 30 basis points driven by an increase in the mix of netted-down revenues, such as software-as-a-service and warranties. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9, our non-GAAP SG&A, including advertising, increased 14.9%. The increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, which moves in line with gross profit growth, incremental Scalar expenses, performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals and investments in the business consistent with our bold forward strategy, including coworker count. Coworker count of 9,843 was up over 900 coworkers from September of 2018 with nearly 400 of the year-over-year increase from Scalar and the remaining from organic coworker investments. Roughly two-thirds of the 900 plus coworkers added year-over-year were in customer-facing roles. Non-GAAP operating income was $380 million, an increase of 13.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.8%. Moving to Slide 10, interest expense was $42 million, up 15.6%. This was primarily driven by a higher effective interest rate on the term loan in 2019 than 2018 when we had 1.5% caps in place. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 22.7% in the quarter, down 20 basis points compared to last year. This resulted in Q3 tax expense of $59 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation, which is shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.8%, down 110 basis points compared to last year\u2019s 26.9% rate primarily due to guidance issued by the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2018 on foreign taxes creditable against Global Intangible Low-taxed Income. As you can see on Slide 13, with third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 147 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.37, up 14.6%. Our non-GAAP net income, which better reflects operating performance, was $250 million in the quarter, up 14.8% over last year. Recall that 1 additional selling day positively impacts third quarter profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. Not GAAP net income per share was $1.70, up 19.8% from last year. Currency headwinds dampened non-GAAP earnings per share growth by approximately 60 basis points in the third quarter. Turning to year-to-date results on Slides 14 through 19, revenue was $13.5 billion, an increase of 10.9% on a reported basis and in average daily sales basis, since the additional selling day in the third quarter offset 1 fewer selling day in the first quarter. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales were 11.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $2.3 billion, up 12.4% and gross profit margin was 16.8%, up approximately 30 basis points. Non-GAAP operating income was $1 billion year-to-date, up 11.9%. Non-GAAP operating net income margin was 7.6%. Net income was $551 million and non-GAAP net income was $673 million, up 13.4%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $4.54, up 17.9%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20, at September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $167 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion. As shown on Slide 21, we maintained strong rolling 3-month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down 1 day from last year\u2019s third quarter and at the low end of our annual target range of high-teens to low 20s. Free cash flow year-to-date was $590 million compared to $459 million year-to-date 2018. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profits and favorable timing of collections. For the quarter, we returned just over $200 million to shareholders, which included $43 million of dividends and $161 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $114 per share. Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 22, we announced earlier today that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share to be paid on December 10, 2019, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 25. This represents a 28.8% increase over last year\u2019s dividend. We are pleased to announce that with this increase, the annualized dividend of $1.52 per share achieves our dividend payout target of 30% of free cash flow based on the midpoint of our free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. The objective of increasing the dividend to 30% of free cash flow was established when we provided our capital allocation priorities in November of 2014. Having met our 5-year dividend commitment, we are updating our dividend objective going forward to grow in line with the earnings. We will target our dividend paid in the fourth quarter, annualized, to be approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income. This earnings payout ratio is equivalent to maintaining the dividend at approximately 30% of free cash flow. We are expressing the payout ratio as a percentage of non-GAAP net income because non-GAAP net income is a less volatile metric than free cash flow on an annual basis. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and continue to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through returns of capital and strategic investments. In order of priority : first, increase dividends annually to guide these increases. As discussed, we will target annual dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the quarter at 2.2x, slightly below the low end of this range. In September we took advantage of favorable capital markets to extend our debt maturity profile by redeeming the outstanding $525 million of 5% senior notes due 2023, with the proceeds from the issuance of $600 million of 4.25% senior notes due 2028. The increased proceeds were used to cover transaction cost and term out a portion of the data from the Scalar acquisition. Subsequent to the quarter, we further linked the maturities by extending our term loan by 3 years. With these 2 transactions now closed, our weighted average debt maturity increased from 4.7 years as of June 30 to 6.7 years on a pro forma basis as of September 30. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Our recent acquisitions of Aptris and Scalar are great examples of this. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. At the end of September we had $842 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation priorities support our updated 2019 outlook, which you can see on Slide 23. As Chris mentioned, we continue to expect U.S. IT market growth of approximately 3%. We now expect net sales growth of 625 to 675 basis points above U.S. IT market growth in constant currency on an organic basis. Included in the 625 to 675 basis point premium is the Census project, which we now expect to contribute approximately 60 basis points of net sales growth this year. Given the majority of the Census revenue was recognized in the third quarter, we expect Census to have a modest contribution to fourth quarter growth. We continue to expect Scalar to contribute an additional approximately 100 basis points of growth on top of the 625 to 675 basis points, while Aptris is not expected to have a material impact on 2019 net sales. Currency is expected to represent a 60 basis point headwind for the full year assuming year-to-go exchange range of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. Given year-to-date exchange rates, this implies currency headwinds of 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2019. Considering our performance in the first 9 months and year-to-go expectation, we expect to exceed our previous outlook for 2019 non-GAAP earnings per share growth. We now look for non-GAAP earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis to be strong mid-teens, call it, 16% to 16.5%. Currency headwinds are projected to shave 60 basis points from the constant currency rate similar to the top line. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual constant currency basis. Slide 24 provides additional modeling thoughts for full year 2019. Moving down the P&L, total annual depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $265 million. This includes approximately $180 million of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, including preliminary estimates for Scalar and Aptris, which could change slightly once the purchase accounting is final. Depreciation and amortization expense and SG&A, excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, is expected to be approximately $80 million. Equity-based compensation is expected to be approximately $7 million to $9 million higher than 2018. Interest expense is now expected to be between $162 million and $164 million, reflecting our recent refinancing and expected lower short-term interest rates. Our 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be slightly below the low end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings per share growth approximately 400 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 25. Our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. We now expect capital expenditures to be roughly 1.25% of sales. This includes business as usual CapEx of slightly above 0.5 point of sales, plus approximately 0.75 of a point of sales to support Device as a Service for the Census. Recall that CDW is the lessor for the devices and procurement of most of the devices is treated as CapEx, which is effectively our cost of goods sold. To be clear, this increase in CapEx does not change our free cash flow rule of thumb. We now expect the cash tax rate to be approximately 24.5% of pretax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We expect to deliver a cash-conversion cycle within the annual target range of high-teens to low 20s. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. And we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I guess to start off with, I was hoping we could just talk a little bit more about the Census Bureau ramp and I think Collin you talked about this program that had contributed 60 basis points of growth in year 1 in 2019. That thing is an update from what you guys had talked about before. I guess could you just talk about the scope of this program and is it fair to think that, year two calendar \u201820 should have a much more meaningful contribution than what you have in 2019? Collin Kebo : Sure. Amit. Good morning. You are right we did pickup the 2019 outlook for the Census to 60 basis points from the 40 basis points we had previously shared earlier in the year. That was primarily due to finalizing the actual device count with the sensors and then deploying those. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the majority of that revenue will be recognized in the third quarter of 2019. As it relates to 2020, we will provide more thoughts on 2020 at our year-end earnings call. I did comment on a tick-up in CapEx and most of that CapEx is for devices that will be deployed in 2020. As you think about that though and the contribution to growth, remember we have 60 basis points of contribution sitting in the base. So as you think about the 2020 growth, you need to think about the delta between the two. Amit Daryanani : Totally fair. Understood. And then I guess Chris, when you look at the 2019 growth which is going to be at this point plus 650 basis points versus IT spend. As you reflect on that, I am curious what do you think are sustainable in that growth trend versus unsustainable as you go forward, just help us parse that because this seems to be a fairly impressive outperformance versus the broader markets? Chris Leahy : Yes. Thanks, Amit and really pleased with the team\u2019s execution so far this year. I mean look, this is a year where we have been hitting on all cylinders with a strategy that is right for what our customer needs and the capabilities to deliver. So, when you think about client devices as an example, certainly some tailwinds there from a refresh perspective, from an end-of-life market event coming up and full employment and the teams have taken full advantage of that in making sure that we are helping our customers along that journey. By the same token, infrastructure modernization and optimization is also equally important, particularly as organizations continue to digitize across the organization and as IT has become, I call it, front and center. It\u2019s really in the middle of driving outcomes for our organizations. So the trends that we see across the full landscape of IT seem to be continuing to be strong. Now all that said, as we move into Q4 and look forward to 2020, we do have some challenging overlaps, that\u2019s for sure. When you look in the client side, for example and you look at corporate and small business and double-digits on double-digits. And even as a segment, we\u2019re working on double digits on double digits. We\u2019ve got some headwinds coming forward with that end of life coming to fruition, we\u2019ve got some wildcards out there that we\u2019ve talked about, Brexit, and tariffs and trade, etcetera. So we\u2019ll have to keep our eye on all of that. I guess what I would say is that, as we said in our prepared remarks, customer sentiment continues to feel strong. And activity is strong, notwithstanding the uncertainties. But it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going to happen next year and our expectation is we\u2019ll see solid growth in Q4, although client in particular moderating down. Amit Daryanani : Perfect thank you and congrats on the quarter, guys. Chris Leahy : Thanks very much, Amit. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matt Cabral : Yes thank you. It sounded like data center hardware was a bit of a drag in the quarter. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what drove the slowdown there. And if you\u2019re seeing any impact at all from budget dollars being shifted over to PCs in support of the needed refresh on that side. Chris Leahy : Yes, Matt. Good question. I would say a couple of things there. First of all, when you see this kind of client growth, customers can only absorb so much. So there is a factor of what customers can absorb and what they\u2019re focused on right now. That\u2019s absolutely part of it. In terms of data center in particular, what you saw was on a consolidated basis, data center hardware not as strong. It was still up but not as strong. If you look at data center solutions, including software, we had very strong growth in software, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. And so what you\u2019ll find is in these types of projects, I\u2019m going to try and find another word, but lumpy is the best word that we have right now. They really are lumpy. When they come to fruition, when they roll out and frankly what the mix is in the solution between hardware and software. So we are not feeling a tangible softness there. We continue to have conversations with the customers. I would say frankly, that I think uncertainty, macro uncertainty right now, is weighing on these types of decisions that are complex, where there are so many options, where customers are deciding things on-prem, off-prem, private cloud, multi-cloud, consumption models, as a service, all underscored by OpEx and CapEx decisions. It does feel like customers are weighing those options and scrutinizing them with a little bit more carefulness right now. But the conversations continue to take place, and we\u2019re feeling good about them. Matt Cabral : Got it. And then on international, wondering if you can talk a little bit more about, first, how the ramp of Scalar is going? And then I know you just bought Aptris, but curious how you think about the potential for a larger M&A down the road, particular to move more meaningfully into newer geographies? Chris Leahy : Yes. Thanks for the question. Scalar is going as planned. I have to say and a shout out to the teams up in Canada and also the teams here in the U.S. who have been working diligently to make that integration successful. It\u2019s lot of hard work while you are trying to support your customers, deliver performance and integrate. So they\u2019ve been doing a really terrific job. And our customers have been \u2013 what they\u2019re telling us is they\u2019re really appreciative of the ability for us to bring them a full portfolio and have holistic conversations, and we are seeing wins across the board with customers on the Scalar side and the CDW UK side, where we are able to benefit them both with a broader portfolio. So that\u2019s all going well. We said and we continue to expect that Scalar will add 100 basis points of growth this year, and we still expect that to be the case. Regarding Aptris, Aptris is a great example, frankly, of a clear need in the marketplace, a pipeline of opportunity, an organization that brought to bear the type of expertise needed in a fast-growing software area with great implementation and assessment skills and a culture that fit. And as we think of some Aptris smaller sure but what I\u2019d call a mature practice, a well-developed practice, and so for us it\u2019s really building that to scale as quickly as we can, and that\u2019s what we intend to focus on. We certainly will continue to focus on larger opportunities, but as you know, we\u2019ve got a number of filters that we use. It\u2019s got to be a strategic fit from a capabilities perspective or a deal perspective. Operationally, it needs to be something that we feel confident we can absorb. We know how hard these things are and we know how important it is to get them right. It needs to have \u2013 to be a cultural fit. That has proven to be very important, frankly, in the success of our acquisitions. And then finally, obviously, the financials screens. We need to feel that the financial return is going to be where we need it to be. Matt Cabral : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks and good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start maybe on the growth strategy, that the two \u2013 the last two enhancing capabilities in solutions and services, if you could just maybe double click to help us understand why each of these are important to your existing customer base? You have always talked about being the trusted adviser you have been with many of them for decades. What\u2019s causing the increased focus? Are they to the point where they are willing to pay separately for services in particular? Chris Leahy : Yes. Actually, let me start with that last comment and work back from there. Yes, they are. Customers are willing to pay for added services. What\u2019s important is a service-lead conversation that we are able to have as we develop a spectrum of service capabilities and depth in our service capabilities create conversations with the customers that are, frankly, more rich and strategic. So it allows us to have a seat at the table at the front end of when they\u2019re making decisions about their organization. The acquisition of Aptris is a great example of that because the conversations that are taking place when customers are thinking about IT service management are instrumental and fundamental to how they\u2019re thinking about overall modernizing their infrastructure and digitally transforming their organization. So those types of things, number one, the projects customers do pay for, but they also get us a seat at the table which creates broader, deeper and larger opportunities for us to help our customers and, obviously, opportunities for us. When you think about Scalar in particular, we really \u2013 in Canada, we really replicated, if you will, what we have in the U.S. now, where we have, what I would say, is a very broad-based offering capability. We\u2019ve got depth in our technical organization now in the areas where customers are needing help sorting through complexity in the area of security, infrastructure, cloud questions and those types of things that they\u2019re grappling with. And we\u2019ve got presence across the whole of Canada at this point. End market presence, the geo presence is also very reflective of what we have in the U.S. We\u2019ve got nice balance up there. We\u2019ve got a nice diversity up there. We\u2019ve got nice depth in Canada. And we become a place where a customer can come as a one-stop shop for their IT needs. So that\u2019s how we think about services and solutions capabilities that we have been folding into the larger organization. Adam Tindle : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe just as a quick follow-up and tie in some financials to that, could you touch on non-GAAP operating margin when you make exchanges? I know you talked about device cycle moderating, spending, shifting to data center and services. You typically expect a higher gross margin, but higher OpEx and similar if not improved operating margin. But is there a difference maybe at this time as we think forward on vendor programs and devices that would theoretically not repeat being a greater headwind to gross margin and offsetting some of that upward mix to where operating margins could be flat or down or maybe just some directional things with mix and operating margin in particular? Thank you. Collin Kebo : Boy, there\u2019s a lot in that question. I would \u2013 I guess I\u2019ll stick with our \u2013 look we expect a mid-7% non-GAAP operating margin. As I think about the quarter and the strength we saw in gross margin, I guess it\u2019s a little counterintuitive given the heavy client device strength that the margin would have \u2013 the gross margin would\u2019ve ticked up 30 basis points. We have seen quite a bit of success helping our customers with cloud solutions, and so that mix in the netted down items provided some lift to offset some of the margin pressure from heavy client device growth. What I would say though, and you touched on this in your question, is we do have a highly variable cost structure and pay people on a percentage of GP. So that was mitigated to some extent at the bottom line. I think there was also a question in there on vendor funding. Typically, we\u2019ll comment on that if it\u2019s growing or contributing meaningfully more or less in the overall rate of sales growth. We didn\u2019t this quarter, so that wasn\u2019t a material factor. Hopefully, that addresses your question. Adam Tindle : Yes. Thanks Collin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good morning. A number of your vendor partners are announcing a shift from CapEx to OpEx model, essentially, subscription model for data center infrastructure. What are you hearing from your customers in terms of where this model makes sense, what type of customers, what types of applications do they want to buy as OpEx? And to the extent that the model were to significantly shift in the direction, is there any difference in the way that you recognize revenue? Chris Leahy : Hi, Katy. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Yes, we do have, as you know and you\u2019ve mentioned a number of OEMs who are shifting to that model. The good news for us is that creates, frankly, more complexity and more choices for customer to sort through in terms of understanding a couple of things. Number one, as you point out, OpEx versus CapEx. But also when you think about performance and reliability and scalability and agility in our customers\u2019 infrastructure needs, they\u2019ve got to take all of those and put them together and determine what\u2019s going to be the best modern infrastructure that they\u2019re looking for. So we do have the capability and have those conversations, frankly, more and more frequently given the technology now becoming available in as a service basis. In terms of the accounting, I\u2019ll let Collin take that because the accounting for CDW, as you know, is different than how our OEMs would recognize on as a service basis. Collin Kebo : Yes, Katy. I\u2019d say very early innings on this in terms of on-prem subscription. So the models are \u2013 and there is no standard is the easiest way to say that. It depends on the way the transaction is structured. So if there\u2019s a third-party intermediary in there and we\u2019re just selling it, then we would recognize it as we typically would, which would be upfront. To the extent that we\u2019re performing more of an agent role, we would take that on a netted down basis. Katy Huberty : Okay, thank you. And Collin, just as a follow-up, cash conversion cycle is stronger year-to-date, as you noted and you are tracking ahead of your free cash flow targets for the year, rule of thumb. Any reason that we shouldn\u2019t expect a seasonally strong fourth quarter cash flow and does that put you ahead of the model this year? Collin Kebo : Yes. I think, Katy, we are still expecting to deliver within our rule of thumb for the full year. We\u2019ve had some favorable timing that\u2019s helped us year-over-year as we moved throughout. This year, in the second quarter, we mixed into vendors with extended payment terms, so that helps us on the payable side. And then this most recent quarter, we had favorable timing of collection just the way the calendar fell. We had a lot of really good cash collecting days in the month. I would expect that to normalize by the time we get to the end of the year. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open. Maggie Nolan : I wanted to take a slightly different spin on the M&A question. After that acquisition with the ServiceNow capabilities, is quite interesting. Is M&A going to become a more consistent part of your strategy going forward, and especially considering where your leverage is today? And then, are there any other capabilities or partnerships in particular that you feel like need to be added to the portfolio? Chris Leahy : Good morning Maggie. Thanks for the question. I would say that M&A is always part of a means to achieving our strategy. And we are, as we\u2019ve said consistently, actively examining potential targets. And those are folks who come to us. Those are folks that we know in the market. But again, we are a really disciplined buyer. Again, as I know you know this, we hold to those 4 lenses very strongly. And so certainly, M&A is part of how we think about scaling capabilities, filling in areas where we think we could bolster those capabilities. But it just comes down to what\u2019s available and whether or not it\u2019s affordable and whether or not there\u2019s a fit there. So the answer to the question is yes, but it all depends on what\u2019s in the market and whether we think it\u2019s a good fit. In terms of certain areas, look, we feel like we\u2019ve got some real strength across the full spectrum of solutions\u2019 needs right now. So we\u2019re growing those organically. And to the extent we can find some that fit externally, we\u2019ll think about that as well. As you know, we\u2019ve recently brought on a new cloud partner, a couple of \u2013 about 18 months ago now, and so you can imagine that we\u2019ve been building capabilities in our public cloud area pretty aggressively. Maggie Nolan : Okay, thanks. And then obviously, the Device as a Service census work was a strength this quarter. Are you seeing continued traction with that type of offering? And do you feel confident that you can land additional Device as a Service engagement on a consistent basis or is this something that we should be thinking about as kind of more of a one-off type of engagement for the time being? Chris Leahy : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Maggie. I think I would suggest you consider it more of a one-off for the time being. Similar to what Collin said about on-prem, private cloud, we are really are at the front stages of Device as a Service being developed as, what I\u2019ll call, a repeatable solution. That said, we do have a number of customers, some large customers, some small customers, who are really quite interested in Device as a Service that we are centrally focused on building out the capability and the practice area in a consistent uniform way to approach a solution like that. Maggie Nolan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi good morning and thank you for taking my questions and congrats on another strong quarter. Just wanted to ask on the government side, you had strong above seasonal growth this quarter. Were there any pull-ins from the fourth quarter? And should we expect above seasonal growth again in the fourth quarter, so just any thoughts on strength going forward on the government side? Chris Leahy : Yes. Government had a great year. And when I think about federal government, in particular, there are a couple of things happening there. One, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks we have, over the past several years, worked very hard on bringing to bear the right capabilities in terms of internal resources, such as technologists, as well as things like contract capture and project management, and all the things that the federal government needs from a technology supplier like CDW. And we\u2019ve really seen the teams leverage those capabilities into success. So as a real strategic partner to the federal government, we continue to support them and more and larger projects that they\u2019re working on, which is obviously good for us. The other thing about federal government this year is census, as we\u2019ve just talked about, has also been helpful in terms of the third quarter in particular. And then, lastly, what we are seeing is we are actually seeing refresh in the federal government. You will recall, Department of Defense a few years ago mandated moves to Win 10 client devices, and frankly, we\u2019re seeing those devices actually already being refreshed. So, we have a lot of nice momentum. That said, they\u2019ve delivered very well this year and we expect a solid fourth quarter, but somewhat cautiousness. In terms of pull-ins for the third quarter, we didn\u2019t see anything other \u2013 out of the ordinary. We saw what I would characterize as a pretty normal year-end for federal government. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Chris. Maybe as a follow-up, I think HP as a vendor accounts for more than 10% of your consolidated net sales. On their Analyst Day, they talked about a shift in their business model, at least on the printer side where they\u2019re going to charge more for printers upfront. I was wondering if you have seen any changes in their go-to-market and how do you think this impacts CDW if at all? Chris Leahy : Yes. We wouldn\u2019t talk about any, in particular, vendor. I can\u2019t say that there is a shift that we\u2019ve been seeing in the market yet. That sounds like a fairly recent announcement, but we wouldn\u2019t comment in any of our particular vendors. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris Leahy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thank you and good morning. I just wanted to touch again on your comments regarding the strong client refresh cycle that you\u2019ve seen both on the Government and in Corporate side. As you talk to your customers, do you have any visibility, particularly as we\u2019re getting close to this Microsoft deadlines in January? How many of your customers are not complying and still need to upgrade? And then, as you pointed out, Chris, you\u2019re already seeing some government customers sort of lap their last refresh because they were the first ones to adopt Windows 7 or Windows 10. Are you starting to see the Corporate customers sort of get in line as well or are you seeing expectations for more of a drop-off following this upgrade cycle? Chris Leahy : Yes. Hi, Matt, thanks for the question. There is a lot of things in what\u2019s happening with client, I would say. First of all, when we look at our customer base, we have a large number of customers who\u2019ve moved to Win 10, but we still will expect more in Q4, frankly. There\u2019s always a bit of a rollover. So we would still expect to see people moving to Win 10 at least through the first quarter of next year. But we do have a lot of customers who have already moved to Win 10. That said, yes, we are seeing refresh. Some that I mentioned Corporate customers from a couple of years ago, we\u2019re seeing refresh. When you think about the strength in the employment, full employment that continues to drive purchases and, frankly, refresh as well. And also, new use cases. We talked about that a number of times in terms of tablets and what not being used for a variety of industries from a digital expansion perspective. So if the economy remains solid, we\u2019d expect customers to continue on a refresh trajectory. But again, moderating due to the Win 7 end-of-life coming to an end, we would expect that to dampen the demand a bit. And remember for CDW, we have, as I mentioned earlier, very high overlaps that we\u2019re going to have to deal with in 2020. And then lastly, there\u2019s been some noise around potential supply chain constraints again in 2020. And obviously, we\u2019ve done a great job this year. The team\u2019s done a phenomenal job of using our advantages to be able to take supply, and really have no impact from that constraint. But we are hearing again potential constraints in the market going into 2020. Matt Sheerin : Okay, thanks for that. And then, regarding your Healthcare sector, which has had double-digit growth for two or three quarters now and I know that was prior last 2 or 3 years, fairly lumpy. It seems like more sustainable. Is that tied to just more investments in the Healthcare community as they transform more towards digital or is that \u2013 some of that a client refresh story as well? Chris Leahy : It\u2019s a little of both. You hit them both. I think budgets are stabilized. So that\u2019s number one. That\u2019s good. And we are seeing healthcare systems that are finally adopting Win 10. They are usually little laggards in that area, but they are. And also, as you said, very much focused on infrastructure to drive patient experience, clinical mobility, efficiencies etcetera and M&A activity frankly continues to happen out there and that\u2019s an opportunity for us to work with the healthcare systems as well. Matt Sheerin : Okay, thank you. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. My first question is just you had mentioned customer sentiment remains strong, but I\u2019m curious during the quarter what was the linearity like? Did it strengthen? Is it weakness? And I guess, frankly, was there any variation from what you usually see on a seasonality basis? Chris Leahy : Yes, Shannon. Hard to answer that question. Throughout the quarter, I would say, that customer sentiment and activity remained pretty much consistent during the quarter and consistent with seasonality. I think that\u2019s how I would answer that question. Collin Kebo : Shannon, just as a matter of policy, we typically don\u2019t comment on intra-quarter momentum or trends, unless we feel that there\u2019s something noteworthy to call out. And as Chris said, there wasn\u2019t anything noteworthy to call out on the floor within the quarter. Shannon Cross : Okay thank you. And then Tim, last night on the Apple call, talked about utilizing the trade-in program for the iPad business that\u2019s going through the census. So I\u2019m just curious, how are you \u2013 are you exposed at all to residual risk on those? And I assume, just in general, you talked about how you\u2019re setting up sort of a Device as a Service capability. Will you manage that? Are you going to use outside partners to minimize the risk? Collin Kebo : Sure. So we do not have residual value risk on the census offering. So I think Apple referenced that in terms of the strong residual value being able to drive down a lower cost to the ultimate customer the Census Bureau. And then, I\u2019m sorry, the other question was on the capability? Shannon Cross : Well, just in general. I\u2019m curious as to how involved you\u2019ll be on managing, because that\u2019s one of the areas where you can find a lot of profitability, correct, if it\u2019s managed correctly and be resold into the market. So I was just curious if that\u2019s part of what you are going to do or are you just going to partner with somebody and not get involved? Collin Kebo : Yes, we will work with a reseller then when those devices come back and we are not going to get into the economics of that. Shannon Cross : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning guys. Chris, just a question for you just in terms of employees, especially customer-facing, obviously, we are in times of full employment here. Can you talk about the opportunity or just the challenge you guys have in terms of retaining your top sales guys and any challenges in recruiting new salespeople and retaining them? Chris Leahy : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. It is a tough market out there. I would say a couple of things. Number one, we pay a lot of attention to it. We are seeing \u2013 for a variety of positions, we are seeing an extended time to hire and sometimes requirement of bringing more candidates in to be able to convert. But one of the things that we do very well here as a core competency is talent acquisition and development. And so the teams have really become very creative around uses of data, artificial intelligence and ways to target, very specifically, folks that we know will be high-performing, have the characteristics and will be high-performing at CDW and then really laser-focused in from a recruiting perspective. And they\u2019ve been very, very successful during this period of a tight labor market. Our attrition rates have not increased higher-than-normal. And in fact, in some of the areas within CDW that you\u2019d expect that they might be, like in our technology teams, they\u2019re lower than the average. And look, CDW is a unique culture as we talk about, but the ability to make a good living here, particularly as a seller, when you think about our outperformance of the market and that translates into GP dollars and commissions for our sellers and for our technical specialists, it\u2019s a good place to be right now. Keith Housum : Great. Appreciate it. And just moving back over to the Census Bureau contract, can you give us an idea in terms of how many contracts of that type or size are generally out there in any given year? And I\u2019m assuming the sales cycle is relatively long. Is there any idea what the pipeline looking into 2020 about most of the deals that might be out there where you guys compete with? Chris Leahy : Yes. I\u2019ll start on this one. What I said earlier, and I communicate again, we do have customers, large customers and smaller customers who are very interested in Device as a Service for the obvious reasons. It\u2019s an operating expense model. It makes sense. But how these are constructed is pretty complicated we\u2019re finding. And so what I wanted to convey is we\u2019re at the front end of trying to develop a methodology and practice that allows us to deliver, I\u2019ll call it, consistent offerings to our customers in ways that are repeatable, as opposed to highly tailored offerings that are not necessarily repeatable at scale, so that we are really at the front stages of that. If I look across the market, I would suggest that I think most of the folks who are in this business are also at the front stages. Collin Kebo : Yes. I would just add, I think the census is a very unique use case, right. It\u2019s once every 10 years. The devices are deployed for a relatively short period into the field relative to the useful life of the asset. And so you have a unique use case and a unique use period. And so I don\u2019t think there are a lot of other things like that floating around out there, but that doesn\u2019t mean that customers in general aren\u2019t interested. And as we\u2019ve talked about though, those are all kinds of different flavors. Keith Housum : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back to Chris Leahy for any closing remarks. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Lauren. Let me close by highlighting CDW\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 in September. This marks another important milestone in our company\u2019s history. I also want to recognize the hard work of our over 9,800 coworkers around the globe and their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. They are the reason we have and will continue to lead the industry. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals and thank you for your continued interest in CDW. Thanks again everyone. Happy Halloween. Collin and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris. Christine A. Leahy: Thanks, Brittany. 2019 was a year of both excellent financial performance and progress against our three part strategy for growth. Once again, we delivered record quarterly results and both strong sales growth and profitability. In the fourth quarter, net sales were up 11.3% on both the reported and constant currency basis to $4.5 billion. Gross profit increased 12.1% to $778 million. Non-GAAP operating income increased 14.3% to $342 million and non-GAAP net income per share was $1.57, increasing 18.4% on both the reported and constant currency basis.  For the year, net sales were $18 billion, up almost $1.8 billion year-over-year or 11% on a reported basis and 11.5% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 12.3% to $3 billion, non-GAAP operating income increased 12.5% to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP net income per share increased 18% to $6.10. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP net income per share increased 18.5%. Our excellent performance reflects the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, a full suite of solutions and services that address customer priorities across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three part strategy for growth. I'll walk you through each of these and how they contributed.  First, the balance across our customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels; corporate, small business, government, education, and healthcare. Each of these channels are meaningful businesses generating annual sales of more than $1.5 billion. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including federal government, state and local government, K-12, and higher education. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered over $2 billion U.S. of net sales in 2019. These unique sales organizations serve us well when end markets behave differently from each other. Sometimes that occurs because markets are disrupted by macro or external challenges, sometimes it occurs when customer behaviors differ due to different priorities. In 2019, the teams did an outstanding job helping customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives, delivering exceptional results. I am really proud of our team's accomplishments. Our 2019 double-digit sales increase was driven by excellent results with strong underlying performance as well as some incremental drivers. The U.S. and UK both increased almost 11% in local currency. Our competitive advantages drove outsized growth in a market that played to our strengths. Our scale, scope, and robust distribution capabilities helped minimize the impact on tariffs and supply constraints and helped us gain market share. Our devices and service solution to the U.S. Census Bureau also contributed to our excellent net sales growth. The success of the Census depends on everyone's participation and that is what our mobile solution is enabling. Confirming addresses of 2019 and this year collecting census data from households that do not respond otherwise. The census project will be complete at the end of 2020, Collin will talk more about the expected impact of census on our financials. And lastly, the acquisition of Scalar. Recall Scalar brought capabilities and security, cloud, infrastructure, and digital transformation to our Canadian business bolstering past solutions investments. Those investments also paid off last year, delivering double-digit organic gross profit growth. I am excited to share that both Scalar and Aptris are now operating in market as CDW. We are one company, one CDW, leveraging our integrated capabilities to deliver a seamless experience to customers. In short, 2019 was a terrific year.  Turning to the fourth quarter, you also see the benefit of our diverse customer end markets. So let's take a deeper dive. In corporate the team delivered 7% growth with balanced transactional and solutions growth as they successfully addressed ongoing customer demand for client devices while driving solid solutions results in particular, double-digit growth in servers and enterprise storage hardware. The small business team delivered nearly 8% growth driven by client device strength. Both channels lapped double-digit growth rates. Customer activity and purchasing remains strong as corporate and small business customers continued to move ahead with technology investments highlighting the importance of technology to achieve business goals. The government team increased sales over 20%, federal had another excellent quarter with sales up over 20% driven by very healthy client device performance as the team helped civilian departments move to [indiscernible].  The state and local team delivered high teens growth driven by double-digit solutions results. The team continued to leverage expanded contracts, helping customers secure their environments and modernize their infrastructure with strong growth in enterprise storage and server hardware. Education increased 1% with low single-digit growth in higher Ed and flat K-12 results. Higher Ed continued to leverage our sector expertise and broad portfolio to help campuses enhance student and teacher experiences through client device upgrades and collaboration tools. For K-12 strengthened Netcom hardware and desktops was offset by a decline in Notebook due to Chromebook performance.  The healthcare team delivered excellent performance, up almost 14% with double-digit growth in client devices as well as enterprise storage hardware and software. Healthcare demand continued to be driven by infrastructure refresh and a heightened focus on a patient experience and clinical mobility. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations, increased 27% on a reported basis. The UK team delivered excellent double-digit growth in local currency. The team continued to help customers transform their infrastructures and gain efficiencies, which drove double-digit solutions growth.  Canadian growth was driven by Scalar. Integration is nearing completion and we are providing expanded portfolio options to both legacy CDW Canada and Scalar customers. So as you can see, our results demonstrate the power of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Our results also demonstrate the power of our second driver of performance, the breadth of our portfolio with over 100,000 products, services and solutions from more than 1000 vendor partners we are well-positioned to meet our customers total needs across the IT spectrum. For the quarter, U.S. transactions increased low double-digits, led by 16% growth in client devices. U.S. solutions increased mid-single digits.  Sales performance was balanced with U.S. hardware and software increasing high single-digits and services increasing 15%. Let's take a deeper look. Hardware increased 9%, fueled by double-digit growth and client devices and data center hardware. Client device growth was broad based and driven by continued customer refresh and market gains. For data center hardware, we saw customers move forward with larger projects driving a strong growth. As we've discussed before, solutions business can be lumpy with the variability driven by the timing of when projects come to fruition and also the mix of hardware and software in the solution. Customers continued to be focused on optimizing their data center infrastructure with economical yet high performing solutions. They are leveraging on premise and off premise solutions, as well as software based technologies that create efficiencies. Total software grew 8% with strong double-digit growth in storage management, operating system software, and network management. We continued to work closely with our customers to maximize the return on their IT investment, whether it be hardware, software, or services, which leads me to our services category. Services' strong growth was led by configurations and professional services. Our services business had a tremendous 2019 with high teens growth reflecting our services led go to market approach. Cloud also contributed to this quarter's results, with double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit. Growth was driven by productivity, security, and collaboration as well as public cloud infrastructure as a service. As you can see, we had excellent, well-balanced performance in the quarter and we were able to help our customers across a broad spectrum of IT needs.  That leads me to the final driver of our performance, the impact of investments we are making in our three part strategy for growth. Investments made to ensure we continue to serve our customers IT needs in this evolving market, whether in a physical, virtual, or cloud based environment in the U.S. or internationally. Our three part strategy for growth is to first acquire new customers and capture share. Second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Importantly, these three pillars work in tandem. Each is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver, and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. These pillars help us stay in front of our customers emerging and ongoing priorities. Let me share a couple of examples of our strategy in action. Last October one of our customers, a medical technology company with over 1 million patients had a cyber attack. The attacker locked the company's on premise data centers and public cloud access and proliferated through its entire IT environment. A few months prior members of CDW sales and technical teams had presented to the company on CDW's approach to information and network security. Historically this customer had primarily purchased transactional products from us not fully leveraging our solutions and services capabilities. The company's IT Director called CDW to utilize our expertise in this critical situation due to our team's presentation. CDW Security Incident Response Team was engaged and immediately helped to assess and limit the attack. It was crucial to maintain patient safety and protect sensitive information. Ultimately in the coming days and weeks CDW helped to assess, contain, and remediate the attack. Then we advised and installed security technology to ward off future attacks and rebuild the customer's data center infrastructure to get the businesses operations running again with enhanced security. CDW had a well orchestrated response providing deep technical knowledge and services in addition to our full suite of product capabilities.  This is not an unique example. In today's environment, a cyber attack is a question of when not if. Security is a top priority for our customers. We have made investments in this capability from a coworker and vendor partner perspective to provide the right services and solutions to increase our customer's readiness and protection from future attacks. Another important IT priority that CDW is helping customers address is the upgrade of IT infrastructure to utilize Internet of Things and data and analytics. Customers are pursuing these investments to increase automation, improve safety and efficiency, manage quality control, and drive growth and higher profits.  One of our manufacturing customers has positioned itself at the forefront of advanced manufacturing in recent years by upgrading its IT infrastructure to enable Internet of Things technology and enhancing automation throughout its plants. Several years ago the customer began modernizing all 47 of its manufacturing plants in North America. At the start of the customer's modernization journey the Executive Director of IT turned to CDW as his trusted strategic IT partner given our past track record successfully completing turnkey projects. To take advantage of the data they wanted to collect CDW developed and deployed solutions to upgrade the customer centralized IT capabilities and infrastructure as well as each plants network infrastructure. In each plant CDW designed and deployed high speed state of the art secure network with redundancy and plenty of bandwidth and scalability to serve as the foundation for the customers advanced manufacturing push. On top of the secure and reliable high speed network that CDW created, the customer deployed scale sensors and robots modernizing its manufacturing and operating processes. The customer is now reaping the benefits of its upgraded IT capabilities including automating tasks which significantly reduce costs making more informed business decisions at a quicker pace based on the new data. And lastly improving security due to the protocols and protections put in place supporting the customer's focus on safety. CDW is an integral partner for each step of this initiative and we continue to work on other projects to support our customers goals. These examples highlight CDW's three part strategy for growth including how well CDW is positioned for important IT trends and how IT is crucial to achieving our customer's objective. CDW has a proven track record of evolving with IT trends. These examples also underscore the importance of one of CDWs competitive advantages, our coworkers. They get IT and make meeting and exceeding the needs of our customers their top priority. We continued to invest thoughtfully in customer facing coworkers and ended the year up 223 excluding Scalar and Aptris.  As our services business has grown the composition of customer facing coworkers has changed to a mix of demand generating coworkers and service delivery coworkers. Additionally other factors such as leveraging third parties for service delivery have made this metric less meaningful. Therefore going forward we plan to share stats on our customer facing coworkers periodically rather than quarterly. Know that we will continue to invest prudently in coworkers and as always adjust our hiring plans based on market conditions. And that leads me to our expectations for 2020 financial performance. In 2020 we currently expect the U.S. IT market to grow between 2.5% to 3% which is below 2019 U.S. IT market growth reflecting a lower 2020 GDP growth forecast. We expect our top line to grow faster than the U.S. IT market slightly above our 200 to 300 bps range in constant currency. The census project is expected to partially offset moderating client device growth in 2020 which drives our expectations slightly above our target range. For 2020 we expect non-GAAP earnings per share growth of approximately 10% on a constant currency basis. We will of course continue to keep a watchful eye on the macro environment including wildcards like supply constraints, the UK EU trade deal, tariffs, Coronavirus, and the U.S. Presidential election. In the meantime the team will continue to do what they do best, out execute the competition and leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives.  I hope you can tell from my comments that 2019's outstanding performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place. We want to continue to evolve with the market, continue to capitalize on technology trends, and continue to invest in fast growing areas of the business. We do this by performing a rigorous, detailed, strategic plan every three years and executing against it. We recently kicked off the planning process for our next cycle. Also we recently made two important leadership announcements. Chris Corley named Chief Commercial and Operating Officer and the addition of Sona Chawla and the newly formed role of Chief Growth and Innovation Officer. Chris is known for her strong sales and operating leadership, cultivating talent, delivering for our customers, and delivering results. Sona joined CDW with a track record of success shaping omnichannel sales operations, building e-commerce businesses developing digital platforms, and driving innovation. They will work with CDW's outstanding executive committee and teams across the organization to enhance our competitive advantages and to continue to drive differentiated performance generating superior returns and serving our stakeholders. Now let me turn it over to Collin to share more details on the financial performance. Collin B. Kebo: Thank you Chris, good morning everyone. As Chris indicated our fourth quarter and full year results reflect the combined power of our balanced portfolio of channels, broad product offerings, and ongoing execution of our three part strategy. They also reflect successful investments in our business that build on our long-term financial strategy to drive strong cash flow, deliver sustained profitable growth, and return cash to shareholders. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 8, consolidated net sales were $4.5 billion up 11.3% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. Currency was neutral in the quarter. On an average daily sales basis sequential sales decreased 6.1% versus the third quarter of 2019. As expected the sequential average daily sales decline was greater than historical seasonality given the strength in the third quarter but better than expected driven by one strong client device growth in four or five U.S. channels as we continued to leverage our competitive advantages to gain market share and help customers refresh their devices. And two, over 20% local currency year-over-year growth in the UK where we saw solutions projects come to fruition. Gross profit for the quarter was $778 million, an increase of 12.1%. Gross margin was 17.1% up 10 basis points over last year driven by product margin partially offset by netted down revenue streams not growing as fast as net sales.  Turning to SG&A on Slide 9, our non-GAAP at SG&A including advertising increased 10.4%. The increase was primarily driven by sales compensation which moves in line with gross profit growth. Coworker count of 9,896 was up over 870 coworkers from December 2018 with roughly 50% of the increase from our 2019 acquisitions and the remaining from organic coworker investments. GAAP operating income was $284 million up 16.8%. Our non-GAAP operating income which better reflects operating performance was $342 million, an increase of 14.3%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.5%.  Moving to Slide 10, interest expense was $38 million up 3.2%. The increase was primarily due to paying a rate on the term loan in 2019 that exceeded the capped rate in 2018. Our GAAP effective tax rates shown on Slide 11 was 21.4% in the quarter down 150 basis points compared to last year. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $50 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation which is shown on Slide 12. For the quarter our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.7% flat with last year's rate. Our full year 2019 tax rate was favorably impacted by a benefit from research and development tax credits. As you can see on Slide 13 with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 146 million GAAP net income per share was $1.27 up 21%. Our non-GAAP net income was $229 million in the quarter up 14.2% over last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.57 up 18.4% from last year.  Turning to full year results on Slide 14 through 19, revenue was $18 billion, an increase of 11% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency basis consolidated net sales were 11.5% higher than the prior year. As Chris mentioned 2019 was a terrific year reflecting great execution against the right strategy and our balanced portfolio. Additionally, 2019 net sales growth benefited from several extra drivers. One, the Scalar acquisition which contributed just over 100 basis points; two, our device as a service solution for the U.S. Census which contributed approximately 60 basis points; and three, a backlog flush in certain categories such as Netcom. You will recall that lead times extended in 2018 and then returned to more normal levels in 2019 creating a onetime positive flush. Collectively these three items contributed approximately 250 basis points of net sales growth in 2019. While difficult to quantify we believe our competitive advantages of scale and distribution centers helps us navigate chip shortages and gain additional share and client devices.  Gross profit was $3 billion up 12.3% and gross profit margin was 16.9% up approximately 20 basis points due to product margin and an increase in the mix of netted down revenue streams partially offset by year-over-year net sales growth outpacing the year-over-year growth in partner funding. GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion up 14.8%. Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion for the year up 12.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%. Net income was $737 million and non-GAAP net income was $902 million up 13.6%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $6.10 up 18%.  Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20, at December 31st cash and cash equivalents were $154 million and net debt was $3.2 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.3 billion. As shown on Slide 21, we maintain strong rolling three month working capital metrics during the quarter. Our three month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days down one day from last year's fourth quarter. Full year free cash flow was $789 million which is 4.4% of net sales and slightly above the high end of our free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. The $37 million year-over-year increase in free cash flow primarily reflects higher cash profit partially offset by higher inventory. 2019 capital expenditures totaled $236 million or 1.3% of net sales. This higher level reflects CAPEX for the 2020 phase of the census device as a service offering which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. As expected we returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2019. We deployed $840 million of cash to shareholders which included $183 million of dividends and $657 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $108 per share.  Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 22, our priorities remain the same from the previous quarter and continued to reflect our intent to drive shareholder value through returns of capital and strategic investments in order of priority first, increased dividends annually. To guide these increases we will target the annualized fourth quarter dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio in the range of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 2.2 times slightly below the low end of this range. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Our acquisitions of Scalar and Aptris are great examples of this. And fourth return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. At the end of December we had $679 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.  Given our current leverage we expect to once again return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2020. Our capital allocation priorities support our 2020 targets which you see on Slide 23. Before I review our annual targets let me first provide some comments on the device as a service solution for the United States Census Bureau. As you've heard us discuss the rollout consists of two phases, the address canvassing phase which was completed in 2019 and contributed approximately 60 basis points to 2019 growth, the majority of which was recognized in the third quarter. In the 2020 phase or the census collection phase Hundreds of thousands of smart phones and tablets are being deployed into the field to take the census. We currently expect the 2020 phase to contribute approximately 110 basis points of incremental net sales growth in 2020. As a reminder CDW is the lessor for the census device as a service offering. Therefore we will recognize lease revenue over the period that devices are used in the field. Depreciation from the CAPEX most of which was spent in the fourth quarter of 2019 will be matched to the lease revenue. As Chris mentioned the census project will be complete at the end of this year.  To summarize the census really showcases how CDW helps customers achieve their objectives by leveraging CDW's differentiated capabilities. Integrated solutions from multiple vendor partners, professional and configuration services, logistics and distribution capabilities all delivered as a service. Turning to our 2020 targets we expect U.S. IT market growth of 2.5% to 3%. This modest deceleration compared to 2019 reflects lower GDP forecasts, strong client device comparisons, and moving past some end of support dates. We expect CDW net sales growth slightly above the high end of our 200 to 300 basis point range over U.S. IT market growth.  The incremental contribution from the Census helps us overlap 2019 strong outperformance including some of the extra drivers I previously mentioned. Currency is expected to be neutral assuming foreign exchange rates of $1.28 to the British pound and $0.75 to the Canadian dollar. We expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid 7% range and non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be approximately 10% on both the reported and constant currency basis. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering financial targets on an annual constant currency basis.  Slide 24 provides additional modeling thoughts for full year 2020. We expect net sales in the first half of the year to be in line with our historical norm of 48% to 49% of full year net sales. Keep in mind that the normal rhythm of our business is for first quarter net sales to typically be the lowest dollar amount and sequentially below our fourth quarter. Over the past five years on an average daily sales basis the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline has averaged down approximately 7%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be generally in line with historical seasonality.  Moving down the P&L non-GAAP operating income margin is expected to be in the mid 7% range. Total annual depreciation and amortization is expected to be in the range of $390 million to $400 million. This includes approximately $160 million of amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets and approximately $145 million of cost of goods sold depreciation. Depreciation and amortization expense and SG&A excluding the amortization of acquisition related intangibles is expected to be around $90 million. Equity based compensation is expected to be several million dollars higher than 2019.  Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $156 million to $158 million with the year-over-year decrease driven by expected lower short-term interest rates. Our 2020 non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5%. We expect share repurchases to drive non-GAAP earnings per share growth 200 to 300 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income growth. Currency is expected to be neutral for the full year to non-GAAP earnings per share growth. We expect constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth in the first half of the year to be higher than our full year constant currency target as we have one additional selling day and one more -- and more incremental contribution from the census project. In the fourth quarter we will have one fewer selling day and the contribution from the census winds down. One selling day difference impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 25. Our free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. We expect capital expenditures to be roughly 0.7% of net sales slightly above the normal half a point of sales primarily reflecting gross capital investments related to our downtown Chicago office move. To be clear this slight increase does not change our free cash flow rule of thumb. We expect the cash tax rate to be in the range of 25.25% to 26.25% of pre-tax income adjusted for amortization of acquisition related intangibles. We expect to deliver a cash conversion cycle within the annual target range of high teens to low 20s. That concludes the financial summary. With that I'll ask Shannon to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matthew Cabral : Thank you. Just starting off on the downtick in the wider active spending environment that you talked about, wonder if you can touch on what you're hearing in terms of customer budget plans heading into 2020 and what's driving your expectation for return to a more normalized two to three points of share gains this year? Christine A. Leahy: Good morning Matt it is Chris. Customers have returned the corner in 2019. Customers were clear that IT continues to be a priority. So we saw some good momentum and they're buying in our business. They continue to hire, they're continuing to focus on investing in IT. So that felt good coming out of the year. The downtick is you know based on what we see in front of us. We've got GDP forecasts that have come down, we've got uncertainties out there I tick through those wild cards in our prepared remarks. And so when we take a look at what's out there that's how we think about it. We also frankly from an IT growth perspective take a look at a wide variety of data both internal data that's proprietary as well as external factors and try to land on a solid expectation for the upcoming year. In terms of our premium you know us, we're always going to be focused on outgrowing the market by that 200 to 300 basis points but we're confident this year in guiding slightly above that 300 because we feel good that the census work that we're doing will contribute and will offset some of the client moderating growth that we expect to see. Matthew Cabral : Got it. And on that point about declining growth moderating PCs is definitely top of mind given cross currents around Win 7 and the CPU shortages, can you just talk a little bit more about what you've baked into your current plans for PCs in 2020 and just how we should think about the cadence of that through the year? Christine A. Leahy: Well, as we anticipated last year we expected client device to grow but at a moderated rate because we've got a couple of years of strong, strong growth from refresh. We have at the end of service that's already happened now in January and our expectation was that we'd see some growth in the first half of the year because based on past experience when there was end of service you'd still get some flow through into the quarter or a little bit beyond. There are some more wildcards out there. Right now you look at Coronavirus for example and it's too early to tell how that's going to impact but that could impact supply chain and add to some delays. We are still looking at Intel shortages. Of course we leverage our competitive advantages to take inventory but there are a couple more factors now that we weren't looking at six months ago that make it more difficult to understand where those client purchases will be taking place throughout the course of the year. Matthew Cabral : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from Amit Daryanani, Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Two questions for me as well I guess. Maybe I will start with the 2020 guide Chris, could you just help clarify you're basically saying it is IT spend a 2.5% to 3% plus share gains of 200 to the 300 basis points and then plus 200 million of revenues from Census Bureau. Is that the right way to think about your 2020 guide? And then just on the Census Bureau contribution is it going to be fairly linear through calendar 2020 or is it going to be more H1 heavy given the way that's going to ramp up? Christine A. Leahy: Yeah, hi Amit. Let me let me back up and get that right. So we're looking at -- there are two components, 2.5% to 3% is what we expect the U.S. IT market rate of growth to be and we're saying that our typical target, our premium above that 200 to 300 basis point you should expect us to come in slightly higher than that 300 basis points as a premium over it. It is not a premium plus additional debts, does that make sense. Amit Daryanani : That makes perfect sense. Thanks for clarifying that. Christine A. Leahy: Okay. And in terms of the sequencing I'll let Colin give you the details. Collin B. Kebo: Yeah Amit, we would expect more contribution from the census in let's say the first half or first three quarters of the year. As I said in my prepared comments we expect it to wind down by the time we get to the fourth quarter. Amit Daryanani : Got it and then I guess just call it a follow-up, your net leverage targets at least based on the math we were doing will be well under two times by the end of the year as you know there's no deal done you maintain the buyback dividends we've talked about. If that's really the case are you comfortable with leverage going under two times or should we start thinking about 2020 being a year where perhaps buybacks will be more larger to get you back in the 2.5 to 3 times target range? Collin B. Kebo: Yeah Amit. So we ended the year at 2.2 times. In my prepared comments I did say that we again intend to return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. Obviously we're mindful that we're sub 2.5 to 3 times target. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks and good morning. Chris, I just want to revisit the goal to expand capabilities that you talked about on the slides. I think the leverage math would suggest that you have about 2 billion in liquidity to still stay within your leverage target probably even more if you want to temporarily sit above it like you have in the past. I know you've done some smaller tuck ins but just first question would be wondering if you would consider something more elephant sized to borrow buffet term and what would be the key items you'd look for in that potential asset? Christine A. Leahy: Yeah. And thanks for the question. Elephant size I don't know how big that that means but I would say this, look you know that we are actively looking for potential companies that can supplement our solutions and services capabilities. And we're looking at different kinds of organizations, small tuckins frankly can be more simple to do and very easy to gain traction quickly. Larger organizations we need to think about a lot of factors including the ease of integration and the way that we can operationally bring onboard a large organization. You know the filters that we look at, we look at is it strategic fit for our customers that's first and foremost, is it going to create more relevance to our customers. We don't get that through that filter, we don't get even further than that. Operational alignment is the second one and then obviously cultural fit and financial return. I will tell you on cultural fit when I think about Kelway several years ago and Scalar and Aptris the cultural fit in those firms has been really terrific. And I think that's been a very large portion of why we've been successful, the teams have done a great job integrating and becoming CDW one company and going to market as a seamless team to our customers who have really appreciated that. And that actually feeds the ability to leverage our solutions capabilities across the whole of the organization. In terms of a larger company. If we find one that makes sense and ticks through all those levers we absolutely would take a look. Adam Tindle : Okay that's helpful. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, Collin thanks for all the model commentary. I just wanted to ask on you talked about Q1 revenue expecting to be down about 7% sequentially per day. I think that's maybe a little over 5% sequentially as reported. The question is historically EPS it's a little bit imperfect but I think generally down somewhere around two times that revenue decline on a sequential basis. Correct me if I'm off here but given your investment plans and timing with this normal seasonality that you're talking about on revenue also apply to EPS in Q1 or as reported would be down maybe just over 10% sequentially? Collin B. Kebo: Adam I don't normally think of sequential EPS quarter-to-quarter. What I did say though in my prepared comments is that we do expect the first half of the year EPS to be stronger than the full year. Some of that is due to a sense of timing and some of that is due to the extra day we have in the first quarter. Adam Tindle : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter and on the guide. Collin the guide for full year of rating margin at mid 7s, I mean that's actually -- that's pretty strong. I mean your margins have been better than many of your competitors. Just wondering, I mean you -- we assume you are going to see a mix shift between client devices versus more of cloud solutions and netted down items. So can you talk about what are some of the things that can drive that a little bit higher than mid 7s, what do you need to see to get operating margin a little bit higher? Collin B. Kebo: Thanks for the question Ruplu. Yeah. You know, there are a lot of things that impact our operating margins starting at the gross margin. There's the mix of items that we sell, which you're referencing. There are commoditization headwinds and market mix. So there are a whole series of mixes that move in and out. As we mix into solutions that does put upward pressure on our gross margin. But we do have a higher cost to serve associated with solutions. So the flow through to the operating margin might not be as great or I think the operating margin might be closer in line to the transactional side of the business. I think the big wildcard here is how strong hardware is as we go forward. This narrative that our margins are going to float up over time has been out there for several years. And I think a lot of that was -- had an assumption that hardware growth was going to slow down and not be as robust. And clearly, we've been through a pretty heavy cycle here of three years where that hasn't been the case and you haven't seen as much upward movement on the operating margin as you might expect, notwithstanding all the success we've had in cloud and solutions and netted down items. So I think if we were to go through an extended period of time, multiple quarters or years where we saw that play out, I think we would revisit it at that point in time at our Analyst Day a few years ago. We took our margin target up a little bit as a result of that trend. But again, I think we'd want to see more sustainability of the strength of netted down items relative to where hardware is. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks for that, Colin. For my follow-up, I just wanted to touch on the education end market. You know, you've seen some strong growth in the higher Ed segment, but maybe a little bit slower on the K-12. So any thoughts on how that segment trends in 2020? Christine A. Leahy: Yeah, it's Chris. On education, we're just under a little pressure right now. We've seen ASPs declining a bit and also the Chromebook space has been the one that has been most constrained when it came to supply opportunities, the supply availability this past year. And availability simply if it was out there, we could get it. So we do expect to continue to see into 2020 those same pressures on the business. The other thing that's happened is Google's extension of its auto update expiration, which is simply the equivalent of end of service. They've extended it a year, so that alleviated what I'll call the urgency of customers to refresh and upgrade. But that will be an opportunity when the year expires next year. Well K-12 we still consider to be a growth area for us. And the teams are really focused on specific solutions that they can bundle and bring to those customers that have to do with things like modern classrooms that are more collaborative and learning environments that are modular, etc. So we feel good about K-12 in the long term. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for all the details. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you and good morning. A question regarding the strength that you saw in the UK, I think you said that was up 20% year-on-year. Is that related at all to the BREXIT transition and post that close, are you seeing any impact either positively or negatively? Christine A. Leahy: Hi, Matt. Yeah, thanks for the question. The answer is no. We haven't seen a lot of change over the last couple of years in client behavior as a result of BREXIT and the uncertainty surrounding that. We've tried to comment on that regularly with you. I think that's just great execution and performance by the team and a number of solutions, projects coming to fruition. We also have, if you recall, a Netherlands entity. And so customers are comfortable using that in the regular course of business. When I look at the UK business, the nice thing is the balance that we've seen in growth in both their UK local business as well as referral business, meaning U.S. to UK business and also collectively UK and U.S. customers doing business outside of those regions. So call it widely international. All of that is on a good growth trajectory and we're really excited to see that because you know, that reflects the power of the thesis going into the combination and it's working. Matt Sheerin : Okay, thanks for that and then relative to the expectations on hardware and we certainly get the headwinds that you're going to see in terms of the PC refresh cycle. But looking at the solutions side of the enterprise class, hardware, networking, storage servers, you had some strength as you talked about networking for some of those reasons. But what should we be expecting there in terms of your outlook for the enterprise class products? Christine A. Leahy: Yeah, I think of it this way. As I said, customers are still prioritizing IT investments. And, they had different priorities. Sometimes it's clients, sometimes it's the data center, depending on where they're focused in their business and what they're trying to accomplish. Looking forward, we expect to see a benefit of that investment. And the key thing is that when it comes to these solutions projects they are lumpy. And I keep saying we're going to find another word, but that really is the best word. I mean, if you think about 2019, we had some lumpiness throughout the quarters and we just saw a number of deals come to fruition and you saw a nice healthy Q4. You got to expect that going forward just because of the timing and also the mix, which is a big part of that whether it's hardware, software, or services. The more software component, the more muted the top line.  So, again, customers are focused on using technology to drive strategic outcomes in their business and they're focused on securely running their \"utility IT\" and we've got the full portfolio to help them do that. Matt Sheerin : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. I just have one, Chris can you talk a bit about what drove you to put a chief growth and innovation officer in place, how you're sort of thinking about that position, and how still work with others within your executive team at this point. I'm just I'm kind of curious as to what created that role? Christine A. Leahy: Thank you. Yeah, sure. Thanks very much for the question. We'll all start with a simple reason. Know when we think about forward looking, we're really focused on scaling sustainable growth. So this is about focus for growth. And in particular, when we think about our customers or partners in products and the channels and platforms that we use to sell and the technology and digital capabilities that underpin those. The connective tissue between them is becoming more and more important. So this role is really intended to help align and focus our efforts and investments around driving that connectivity there. When you take a step back, PTW has historically delivered meaningful, profitable growth and we've done that through continual innovation and continual investment, disciplined investment and focus on investing where the growth is. So when I think about growth and innovation and bringing that team together, it's just another natural step in the way that we think about growth in the future. Shannon Cross : Okay, thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good morning. Just thinking through seasonality for the year in the first half, you have the bulk of the benefit of senses that spillover of some of the wind, 10 refreshes and the extra selling day. So just what are the offsets to those tailwinds that land you at more normal seasonality in the first quarter, in the first half versus maybe a little bit better seasonality given those factors? Collin B. Kebo: Can you repeat the question, Katy? Katy Huberty : Yeah, just thinking through some of the tailwinds in the first half, in the first quarter. You have the bulk of the census impact in the first half of the year and hopefully get some spillover effect of PC refreshes, at least in the first quarter and then you have the extra selling day. So just curious why you wouldn't see maybe a little bit better than normal seasonality in 1Q and the first half because of those factors, are there some offsets that you're thinking through? Collin B. Kebo: No, I would say no real offsets. We do have some pretty meaningful overlaps in the back half of the prior year. So I think that's also informing us. Katy Huberty : Okay, and then just as a follow up, have you gone back and looked at just spending trends and customer behavior around elections in terms of any expectation around how that might impact spending this year? \" Christine A. Leahy: Yes, Katy, it's Chris. If you go back to the 2012 and 2016 elections, what we did see is we did see a deceleration in IT spend, IT growth. So that's why we call out as a wildcard U.S. election this year, because, the uncertainty leading into it could cause some deceleration. That came in those two years in the back half of the year. Katy Huberty : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Chris, you've been pretty specific about the three part investment strategy and investing in the future generically. But where do we see this in terms of the dollar spend, is it in CAPEX, is it in the operating expenses, what kinds of people are you recruiting, how are you reallocating resources to capitalize on these opportunities? And suddenly could you even argue that you're under earning a little bit because of the investments that OPEX is a bit higher than it might be otherwise? Christine A. Leahy: Yeah, thanks for the question. I think you see it up and down wherever in various line items in that P&L. So, for example, we're investing in people, investing in technologies, solution architects, delivery engineers. We're also investing in technology and digital capabilities to enable our sales organization and to enable our coworkers to deliver to our customers to create an experience for our customer that becomes more seamless and useful to the sales process. So we're investing in a number of different areas, as we always do at CDW in terms of the impact on our profitability. Look, we I don't think you'd see anything different, but we're always outperforming the market allows us to deliver on our commitments to shareholders, but also reinvest in the business. And that's pretty that's very important for the future growth of the organization. When I think about scaling for sustainable growth It's not just about performing for today, but it's also about laying the foundation for growth against our growth model in the future. And that's where we're investing today and tomorrow. Collin B. Kebo: Paul, I would just add, the investment is both in the OPEX and the CAPEX line. The majority of our normal CAPEX goes against our IT infrastructure. And then in your question, are we under earning, I guess similar to that is, are we overinvesting and I would say no. We feel like we have the right balance between investment back into the business that allows us to continue to create differentiation in the marketplace that enables the sustainable outperformance versus the market. So could we pull back on investment in the short term? Yeah, absolutely, with the margin pulled up, yes. But I think that 200 to 300 basis point premium that we've consistently been able to deliver over time, you would see that get shipped away. So we think we have the right balance between investing in the business and growth in margin. Paul Coster : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning everybody. Can you just help me understand last year and the past two year spending in the 110 refresh cycle was that generally done within companies or the customer's general budgets or were they special I guess one time expenditures as either won't repeat or you expect to be reprioritized going forward? Christine A. Leahy: Yeah. Hi, Keith. My sense, having talked with customers and feedback from our sales organizations is we didn't hear a lot of chatter about onetime increases in budgets to refresh client. It's really a natural process of their IT investment cycles. Collin B. Kebo: Yeah Keith, again just as we think about how we manage our own business, our CIO sure didn't get incremental budget to get us upgraded to Win 7. And, I think it's part of what a customer goes through every year is determining what their priorities are and addressing those priorities within the context of their budget. Keith Housum : Yeah, that's helpful. And then changing gears here is slightly is my follow-up. I know -- I respect this completely with the Coronavirus, but can you help us understand, like in terms of the supply chain and inventory in the channel, how long could the Coronavirus go on or how bad it could get before it actually impacts anybody, is there enough inventory in the channel that can withstand, quarantine for some factories for several weeks? Christine A. Leahy: Yeah. No, I wish I had an answer to that, Keith. I just don't, it's too early in the process right now. And what I can say is that we're working very closely with our OEMs right now to get a better understanding. But we don't have visibility to that. I think our vendors are still trying to figure that out. And it all depends on how long it lasts, what alternatives they have. But we'll just do the best that we can to ensure that we take care of our customers and till the extended inventory is available we'll leverage our competitive advantages and take that. But I just it's hard to know at this point in time. I don't want to project out into the future. Keith Housum : Okay, appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I am currently showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. Christine A. Leahy: Thank you, Shannon. I'd like to recognize the hard work of our almost 10,000 coworkers around the globe and their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. They are the reason we had such exceptional performance in 2019 and we will continue to outperform the IT market going forward. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you for your time today and continued interest in CDW. Colin and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Brittany. I first want to take a moment to share our respect from CDW to all who are suffering hardships or loss as we face this COVID-19 health crisis, and also to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices and contributions being made by so many who are devoting themselves to serving others. I\u2019ll begin this morning with a high level overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance. I\u2019ll also discuss how we are addressing the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our co-workers, customers and operations and share some thoughts on the balance of 2020. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We\u2019ll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for Q&A. We had a very strong first quarter. Net sales were $4.4 billion, 9.2% above last year on average daily sales basis, adjusted for the impact of one more business day in the first quarter of 2020 than 2019, and up 9.4% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $304 million, an increase of 5.8%. This includes a $29 million increase in our credit loss reserve to reflect the macroeconomic environment due to COVID-19. Non GAAP net income per share was $1.38, up 11% on a reported basis, and up 11.3% in constant currency. As the quarter progressed in March, we served a meaningful increase in customer demand. CDW teams orchestrated solutions for client\u2019s devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security and others from our broad portfolio to address our customer\u2019s remote work in business continuity needs. We experienced solid results across the US business with all five US channels growing high single-digits and solid local performance from our international teams. This growth came from both existing and new customers. To address anticipated supply constraints we leveraged our scale, distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, strong vendor partner relationships and healthy balance sheet and liquidity position, fulfilling our customers and prospects urgent and critical IT needs. We procured the supply in key categories early and managed through longer industry lead times for our customers in a supply-constrained environment. Our net sales performance for the quarter was balanced with 9% growth for both US hardware and software and 26% services growth. In March, customer priorities quickly redirected to remote workforce enablement and work continuity, driving strong transactional performance of almost 20%. During this time, customers de-prioritized infrastructure and less urgent service projects, resulting in a low single digit year-over-year decline for solutions. Cloud customers spend and gross profit increased double-digits drive by strong growth in collaboration, security and productivity, workloads consistent with remote workforce enablement. We generated strong double-digit growth in product categories that enabled work from home and operations continuity plan, including client devices both notebook and desktops, video, collaboration tools, configuration services and security. Our teams orchestrated a seamless combination of these products and services plus others from our broader portfolio to provide full solutions to our customers. Clearly the team delivered strong performance. I am proud of and grateful to our co-workers who persevered for our customers. Now, looking more closely at our customer end-markets performance, our corporate and Small Business teams both delivered over 8% growth, driven by double-digit growth in transactional categories as the team successfully developed work from home capabilities for our customers. The Government team increased sales almost 15%, Federal had another excellent quarter with sales up double-digits primarily driven by the census project. The state and local team also delivered double-digit growth driven by strong transactional and solutions performance that enabled remote work capability and crisis readiness efforts. Education increased 17% with strong double-digit growth in both higher ed and K-12. Customers in both markets were focused on enabling remote learning capabilities.  Our healthcare team delivered 7% growth primarily driven by transactional product categories to adapt to the new care delivery environment. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations increased 3% on a reported basis. UK was up low constant currency. That was on top of four years of first quarter double-digit growth. The UK team has been instrumental in helping with the government\u2019s response to COVID-19, providing crucial technology to the new critical care field hospitals as well as enabling remote work capabilities for our customers. Canada increased double-digits, also driven by remote work enablement and strong demand from healthcare and education customers. Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, our full suite of solutions and services that can address even rapidly shifting customer priorities across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. I want to take a minute to review each of these for two reasons. First, because these are important drivers of CDW\u2019s first quarter performance and second they provide frame work to think about CDW\u2019s performance under various macroeconomic condition. As you know we have five US sales channels, that each generated annual net sales of 1.5 billion in 2019. Corporate, small business, government, education, this scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end-markets, including Federal Government, State and Local Government, K-12 and higher education. Providing us insights into our customers\u2019 objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered over US$2 billion of net sales in 2019. The diversity of our customer end-markets serve us as well with macro or other external challenges impact various industries and business differently. This is especially relevant in the current environment. Next, the breadth of our offerings, with over 100,000 products, services and solutions for more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well-positioned to meet our customers\u2019 total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends and customer demand. And, finally, our three-part strategy for growth, which is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share, second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and, third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Before I turn to our thoughts about the balance of the year, I want to provide insights into our managing COVID-19 impact on our business. To holistically manage our response in mid-February, we activated a cross-functional response team led by executive committee members. The team leveraged our pre-established crisis management protocols to ensure we responded as quickly as possible. The team has three key principles, safe guard the health and well-being of our co-workers, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers and partners, and support ours communities. One of the key actions, we took to maintain the impact of the virus on our customers, on our co-workers and our operations was to implement a global work-from-home order from office co-workers in mid-March. We have excellent IT infrastructure and support so the transition to work from home was shift and seamless. We are monitoring developments closely, developing plans accordingly, and we will be prepared for our return to office at the appropriate time. We are focused on our co-workers\u2019 safety and well-being in the workplace. To do this at our three distribution and configuration centers, we are operating under precautionary measures advised by public health authorities, including social distancing, segment and shift, personnel protective equipment, enhanced facilities cleaning and temperature screening for anyone entering the facilities. Currently, all distribution and configuration centers are fully operational. At the end of March to limit the virus spread after a few co-workers tested positive for COVID-19, we decide to close our Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center for several days and to require a shift to configuration center co-workers to self-isolate. These actions did not have a material impact as the team\u2019s leveraged flexibility in our distribution and capabilities where possible. Our distribution center in Las Vegas fulfilled customer orders and orders were drop shifted directly to customers, and where not shipping times modestly increased. I regard our exceptional co-workers and our unique culture to be a meaningful competitive advantage. Our team has responded to the current environment in exemplary ways. One example is our internal dig marketplace created to match areas of our business where demand has spiked, with internal talent on temporary assignment. Another example is the reallocating of our sales and technical resources to where the growth is and will be going, which we successfully did during the great recession. We will again be nimble by identifying and implementing ways to optimally utilize our highly skilled co-workers. In addition and consistent with our strong culture of giving CDW has and continues to contribute meaningfully to support the COVID-19 response efforts locally in the US, UK and Canada. Now let me turn to our 2020 financial performance. As a result of COVID-19 and the unknown duration and depth of its impact, we withdrew our 2020 targets on April 16, as most all companies are doing. The near term impact of COVID-19 on some customers we serve could be meaningful, with some ed markets impacted more significantly than others. Consistent with prior experience where commercial customers have reacted relatively quickly to economic conditions, we anticipate the demand will be lower for some of our small business and corporate customers. We expect demand from our public customers to be relatively firmer, led by resiliency in our federal channel, due to the Census project and the IT priorities we support, including infrastructure upgrades and security enhancements to remain top priorities. Demand will likely be next for our other public channels, with budget uncertainty for healthcare, state and local and education customers. We continue to track stimulus support and, where possible, help our customers navigate the various programs. Regarding product categories, we expect customers to prioritize mission-critical IT spending and for some to push out longer term solutions projects, including infrastructure projects and service engagement. In recent weeks, our focus has shifted to helping our customers manage their work from home environments at scale. Solutions that \u2013 solution for that includes security, network augmentation to accommodate new demand, remote performance management, virtual desktops and effective application management. Longer term, we expect our customers and prospective customers to design and implement technology driven strategies to not just survive, but to thrive. We expect to see an acceleration in digital transformation, cloud migration and automation strategies, as companies invest to successfully compete in the future. We believe that technology will be as or more essential to all sectors of our economy, and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We intend to continue to help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape. During our 35 year history, CDW has a successful track record of evolving with customer needs in the ever-evolving IT industry. We are committed to continuing to invest in our three-part strategy, including capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity and enhance our competitive position. As we do so, we will keep a watchful eye on the impact of COVID-19, the macro environment, and other unpredictable variables, such as potential supply disruptions, trade policies and the upcoming US election. CDW will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objective. And out-execute our competition. While this is a particularly uncertain and challenging time for all, I\u2019m confident that CDW will continue to grow to new heights. Now Collin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin? Collin Kebo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to provide more detail on our first quarter results and capital allocation priorities in the current environment. Turning to our first quarter P&L on slide nine, consolidated net sales were $4.4 billion, up 10.9% on a reported basis, and 9.2% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one additional selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 9.4%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 4.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. This was better than expected and historical seasonality. As the quarter progressed and we moved into March, the impact of COVID-19 led to a meaningful increase in customer demand for client devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security and other solutions to keep other solutions to keep customers\u2019 operations running. While there were pockets of supply dislocation, as Chris mentioned, we leveraged our scale and distribution capabilities to help customers get access to the IT they needed for business continuity. Some portion of the record monthly sales we achieved in March is likely attributable to a pull forward of future demand, but it\u2019s difficult to quantify at quantify at this point. Gross profit for the quarter was $757 million, an increase of 12.6%. Gross margin was 17.2%, up 20 basis points over last year, driven by product margin and services, partially offset by netted down revenue streams not growing as fast as net sales. Turning to our SG&A on slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A increased 17.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $29 million increase in our credit loss reserve to reflect the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of COVID-19. SG&A also reflects higher payroll costs consistent with higher co-worker count and higher gross profit as well as roughly $2 million of incremental COVID-19 expenses, primarily to safeguard our co-workers. Co-worker count of 10,104 was up 670 co-workers from March 2019, with approximately 100 of the year-over-year increase from the Atheros acquisition and the remaining from organic co-worker investments. Roughly 60% of the 670 co-workers added year-over-year are in customer-facing roles. As you know, we have a variable cost structure, given that sales commissions are paid on a percentage of gross profit and growth in co-worker count is one of our biggest investments. We have implemented hiring restrictions and are letting attrition run for a while as we closely monitor the macroeconomic and demand environments. GAAP operating income was $246 million, up 7.4%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $304 million, an increase of 5.8%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 6.9%. Moving to slide 11, interest expense was $38 million for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on slide 12, was 20.7% in the quarter, up 50 basis points compared to last year. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $44 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation, which is shown on slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 10 basis points versus last year\u2019s rate. As you can see on slide 14, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share $1.16, up 13.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $200 million in the quarter, up 7.9% over last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.38, up 11% from last year. The increase in the credit loss reserve equates to approximately $0.15 per share. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 15, liquidity is a clear priority in the current environment. As of March 31st, cash and cash equivalents were $214 million and net debt was $3.3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we bolstered our liquidity position by issuing $600 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 4.8% for general corporate purposes. Additional measures to enhance liquidity includes suspending share repurchases and implementing various cost savings initiatives. Free cash flow for the quarter was $116 million, as shown on slide 16. This is lower than normal seasonality and below last year\u2019s $303 million for several reasons. One, because sales growth was back-end loaded in the quarter, the receivables associated with those sales are sitting on the March 31 balance sheet. Two, we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. And three, we leveraged our scale and distribution centers to increase investment in inventory to better support customers in a supply-constrained environment. Moving to slide 17. The three month average cash conversion cycle was 20 days, up 3 days from last year\u2019s first quarter. The balance sheet dynamics I just described are somewhat moderated when you look at three month average working capital metrics because of how sales phasing played out in the quarter. Looking ahead, our working capital metrics could be impacted as we strategically invest in inventory or due to pressure on receivable collections as customers are impacted by the macroeconomic environment. One of our greatest assets is our long-term customer relationships, and we know it\u2019s important to be there for customers during challenging times like we were during the Great Recession. We will continue to balance managing customer\u2019s working capital needs, while appropriately managing risk. For the quarter, we deployed a $195 million of cash to shareholders, which included $54 million of dividend and $141 million of share repurchase at an average price of approximately $123 per share. Turning to capital allocation on slide 18. As I mentioned earlier we are focused on liquidity and have reassessed other uses of capital within that context. Our priorities are, first, continue to pay the dividend. Today, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per common share, reflecting CDW\u2019s strong liquidity position and confidence in the cash flow generation capability of the business. We expect to evaluate any changes in the dividend in the fourth quarter of this year consistent with historical timing. Future dividends will be subject to board approval. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We remain comfortable with the current target net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times for several reasons. One, we have no debt maturities in 2020 and just $57 million, due in 2022. Two, the weighted average interest rate on the debt portfolio was 3.9% pro forma for the $600 million notes issued in April. So cash interest is manageable. And three, our debt capital structure was covenant light. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.2 times slightly below the low end of our target range and flat to year end 2019. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions, a challenging economic environment could present attractive M&A opportunities. So we remain active in evaluating targets. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating and cultural fit and financial return all within the context of liquidity at that point in time. Fourth, as I noted previously, we suspended our share repurchase program to enhance liquidity with first quarter buybacks of 1.1 million shares. We have already offset expected dilution associated with stock compensation for this year. The decision on when to resume stock buybacks will depend on several considerations, including the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and working capital, leverage and other potential uses of cash, such as M&A. Lastly, on the topic of capital. We intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We have a CapEx light model, historically, running around 0.5 point of sales or slightly more. We believe it\u2019s important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that will allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. While we have withdrawn 2020 targets, and will not be providing an updated financial outlook, I do want to provide insights into what we\u2019re seeing roughly five weeks into the quarter. On the demand side, customer activity has been mixed. We entered April with a healthy backlog of remote workforce enablement solutions, which contributed to solid shipment growth in April. However, writings and corporate and small business were down double digits year-over-year, which will weigh on shipments going forward. This is consistent with past experience, where we\u2019ve seen commercial customers react sooner to macroeconomic conditions. On the other hand, public sector writings were up year-over-year, reflecting strength in government and K-12 and more muted demand in higher education and health care. Our international businesses are generally seeing similar trends with their customers. You may recall that both the UK and Canada have a lower mix of sales to public sector customers than the US. On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a fluid environment with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. We are in constant contact with our vendor partners whose manufacturing operations are generally back up and running. Freight is a challenge, resulting in pricing surcharges and price increases on certain products. On the operating front, both distribution centers in the US continue to be fully operational since the brief closure of our Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center at the end of March. Finally, I want to provide an update on the device as a service solution to the US Census Bureau. The contribution to first quarter sales was generally in line with expectations. In March, the Census Bureau temporarily suspended field data collection activities and steps are being taken to reactivate field offices next month. In April, the Census Bureau announced it was seeking statutory relief from Congress for an additional 120 days, which would extend the window for field data collection and self-response to October 31. The delay is expected to shift a modest amount of net sales from to Q4 from Q2. Finally, we are working with the Census Bureau to help meet the customers\u2019 objective of making up lost time due to COVID-19. CDW expects to provide additional devices, enabling the Census to have more workers in the field. As a result of these changes, we now expect the Census project to contribute up to approximately 140 basis of incremental sales growth in 2020. The rollout schedule is fluid, so we could see revenue shift from 2020 into 2021. We will continue to provide updates on the Census as we progress through 2020. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I\u2019ll ask Olivia to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one, with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe to start off with Collin or Chris, I was just hoping you could spend a few minutes maybe just comparing how CDW performed through the \u201808, \u201809 recession and what are sort of the puts and takes when one compares SARS to what\u2019s going on right now. Maybe you can kind of frame that up that would be really helpful. And then, just - I\u2019ll ask my second question as well upfront. How does the share gain narrow to work for CDW in an environment like this? Is it easier? Are customers more willing to engage with new vendors? Or is that something that happens in our post-COVID post-recession world? Thank you. Christine Leahy : Okay. Hi Amit, good morning, it\u2019s Chris, and I\u2019ll start, and then Collin can add in. When we think back to the 2009 recession, first of all, I would say, as we all know, two downturns are the same. And with respect to where we sit today, we can\u2019t tell with any level of certainty what\u2019s going to happen. This is that essence, the health crisis and the economic issues are derivative. But if we look back to 2008 and \u201809, it can be informative. So, if we look at the segments, corporate and small business, they did tend to react more quickly, as Collin suggested in his script to the downturn. And if you look at our investor deck, you can see that corporate was down 22% and small business declined small business declined 18%, so significantly. The public sector channels, as we\u2019ve mentioned, were more resilient, and we saw growth in government and education. Health care was a little flat. But I would think about coming out of the recession, we saw corporate, small business and health care grow quite nicely. And if you think about similarities, the business model that we have, the resiliency of that business model, our ability to stick with our customers and to offer them a wide slot of products, particularly coming out of the recession, remains strong. As I think about today, we are in a stronger financial position than we were in 2008 and \u201809. And I remember, Amit, meeting interest obligations in \u201809, when we were at 10 times debt leverage, which was our peak. Today, we have, obviously, a strong balance sheet. And we have more opportunistic outlook. I would also say that, technology today has become much more essential to our customers\u2019 strategy, hard stop. There\u2019s been increasing complexity. The breadth of our portfolio, what we sell, our evolution, has grown. And so today, we\u2019re better positioned than ever to help our customers through this downturn. But the lack of visibility that we all have still makes it difficult to predict with any level of certainty. Collin? Collin Kebo : Yeah, Chris. I don\u2019t know that I have much more to add to that. That was a pretty thorough review. I mean, as you think about, the various channels, as we\u2019ve said corporate small business reacted sooner. GDP bottomed, I think, in the fourth quarter of 2008 and then improved sequentially. It was still down a bit year-over-year over the next couple of quarters. We saw corporate and small business react very swiftly in the first quarter of \u201809. So that first quarter declined more than the full year. And then, the rates of decline improved as we move throughout the year. But as Chris said, look, every recession like this is different, so not much more to add other than that. Christine Leahy : Yeah. Amit, I\u2019d add one more thing. And I\u2019ll come back to your second question is when you think about the complexion of our resources. And remember, we\u2019ve got over 3,000 technologists today. And we\u2019re really very well positioned to support customers and where they\u2019re heading. As we think about what might accelerate coming out of this current situation, we\u2019ve got physical distance. Digital is now mandatory. It\u2019s a prerequisite for market survival, frankly. And we\u2019re very well positioned to help our customers with that. But on your second question on taking market share, we did acquire a healthy dose of new customers. We had product to offer them. And we could get it to them quickly. So we feel confident that we were able to take share in this environment. Amit Daryanani : Thank you very much for the answers. Appreciate it. Christine Leahy : Sure. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Matt Cabral : Yeah. Thank you very much. Just given the magnitude of uncertainty that\u2019s out there right now, can you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about managing the expense base versus the desire to maintain investment? And just how we should think about the flexibility of SG&A this time around compared to prior downturns? Christine Leahy : Matt, it\u2019s Chris, and I\u2019ll start, and then Collin, you can add in. Listen, you know we have a naturally variable cost structure. And just as it did in 2008 and \u201809, we benefit from that as we go through downturns like this. I would say that we\u2019ve been proactive and prudent. We consider to manage our business prudently, part of what we need to do every day. But the team has been at this in a very granular level on a daily basis, watching a couple of things. Obviously, demand we\u2019re very focused on sales trends by channel, gross profit that we\u2019re seeing in NGLI and we\u2019re managing that and looking at that more closely than we ever had. Obviously from a liquidity position, Collins and his team have been very granular around our cash collections and other things that impact our liquidity. So I would say, number one, we\u2019ve been very proactive and very detail oriented and making changes and moves quickly, as opposed to waiting. As Collin mentioned in his prepared remarks, I think we\u2019ve already done things like change events and other expenses that we can do. We do have a performance excellence team and we\u2019ve talked about this before, it\u2019s called reinvent to reinvest and they have - they\u2019ve actually contributed meaningfully over the past few years to our results. And they are laser focused on our operating model and ensuring that we are being as efficient and effective as we possibly can. So as we go through this frankly, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re managing the business, but we aren\u2019t being shy about, really finding places to improve from an operational perspective of the business, so that we can continue to invest as we move forward. And some of that might be not moving some resources, we\u2019re working on that. We\u2019ve got resources that actually can flex across the business. That\u2019s part of the beauty of the types of sellers and technical folks that we have in terms of their experience and their capabilities and our training programs, which are such an engine for us. So we\u2019re also moving resources on the right opportunities. Collin? Collin Kebo : Yeah. I guess I would just add, again, Matt, we have a variable cost structure. Sales compensation, pay down gross profit is our biggest expense. And our biggest investment is in people cost and so letting attrition run add some variability to the cost structure. Obviously, we\u2019ve taken a look at other parts of the cost structure, travel, events and things like that that don\u2019t make sense in this environment. As Chris mentioned, ongoing productivity and efficiency is a part of the culture, and we\u2019ve dialed that up. And we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in managing costs, and we\u2019ll make adjustments based on market conditions and the demand \u2013 the demand environment as we go down the road here. But we are going to prudently invest in the business, so that we do emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. Matt Cabral : Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, you talked about supply constraints a few times. Can you just talk about what availability of product looks like across your business right now? And going forward, just how you\u2019re thinking about managing inventory given the lack of visibility versus the potential for any future disruption of the supply chain? Collin Kebo : Yeah, sure. I would say, I think we used the word fluid or dynamic. It\u2019s choppy out there. We are running heavy on inventory just because we felt it made sense to carry additional days of safety stock. We provide pre-orders to some of our customers, and they get a lot of benefit out of that. So we\u2019re doing that to try to mitigate some of the choppiness in the market. I would say, unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a lot of demand for notebooks. So that\u2019s where we have taken some of our inventory positions, as well as within the Chromebook market, obviously, given the strain that this has placed on our education systems. And then I would say we\u2019ve seen lead times pick up in some other categories on the solutions side of the business in servers. It\u2019s not, I would say, disruptive per se, but just extended lead times. And then I did comment a little bit about where we have seen some price increases, and that\u2019s primarily due to just increased freight costs that our OEM vendor partners are incurring and the passing along of some of those costs. So we have seen some price increases in client devices as well as within servers. Matt Cabral : Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thanks and good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start with some questions around the structural changes to the structural changes to the competitive landscape. Obviously, there\u2019s a number of clients out there in the industry that are hurting and you\u2019re in a position to issue $600 million of debt at attractive financing terms to help those clients. But industry landscape is very fragmented, there is many small players that won\u2019t have visibility. So maybe if you could just touch on how you see the competitive landscape changing as this unfolds? What structural changes are you thinking about? Christine Leahy : Yeah. Matt, I want to make sure I understand your question. You\u2019re talking about customers; you\u2019re talking about others within the channel that are competitors for CDW? Adam Tindle : Other competitors in the channel to CDW and whether that leads to basically more industry consolidation over time as time as you potentially gain share through this? Christine Leahy : Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think, look, when there is a downturn of any kind that is severe, it exposes weaknesses across any industry. And not like - not unlike other industries, I think we will see that certainly in our industry. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ll continue to keep our eye on opportunistic M&A. And I wouldn\u2019t say that we would - you\u2019ve heard me say this before, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re focused on a roll up, but we certainly are focused on M&A that fits our various lenses that you know well. It\u2019s strategic fit, operational fit, cultural fit, makes financial sense. We haven\u2019t turned that lens off, and we will continue to look. Adam Tindle : Okay. And just as a follow-up, Collin, on the $65 million debt offering, part of that, you talked about helping our clients. Just, if you could double-click on what you mean by that? It would seem to be a bridge to help maybe on payment terms. So why not tap the revolver for that? And also the systems and processes you\u2019re putting in place to control risk as you do so? Thanks. Collin Kebo : Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Adam. I think in terms of the $600 million, just in this kind of environment, given the uncertainty and with the wide range of outcomes out there and very difficult to probability assess where those outcomes are going to be, we just felt it was prudent to go and get excess liquidity. And I think most companies in corporate America that have the ability to do so, went ahead and did that we were able to get it at an attractive rate at four and an eight. So, we viewed it as relatively inexpensive insurance in case you know these outcomes, go to a more bearish place, but in the event we don\u2019t need the insurance. It\u2019s relatively cheap capital that we can deploy offensively. In terms of what we would do with that, we are mindful of the pressure that that\u2019s out there for customers, so I think in terms of investing in working capital. I talked a fair amount about potentially using some of that within inventory and to help smooth out some of the disruption, that\u2019s out there and that would competitively advantage CDW as well as help our customers get access to the IT they need sooner rather than later. From a receivables perspective, obviously our customers are under pressure and they\u2019re managing their own liquidity circumstances and looking at their cost structures and things like that. One of the things that CDW does is we orchestrate financing solutions for our customers, so obviously our OEM vendor partners and others make financing available and so we\u2019ve been very active in making those solutions available to our customers and that obviously helps both the customer, but also helps us manage our DSO risk. There are certain situations where customers are under pressure and we\u2019ll deal with those on a case-by-case basis. In terms of how we\u2019re managing risk, we did a pretty thorough review of the portfolio in terms of credit limits and where we had exposures to various industries and customers and adjusted credit risk appropriately. Again managing or balancing some of these long standing customer relationships we have, while still protecting the balance sheet and ensuring we had an appropriate risk profile in place. And obviously again like every other company in corporate America we are very closely monitoring our daily cash collections and understanding where risks might be emerging in the portfolio and then adjusting credit limits accordingly. Adam Tindle : Very helpful. Thanks, Collin. Collin Kebo : Thanks, Adam. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. For the first question, I\u2019d like to ask, how many of your co-workers are currently still working from home. And how did that impact your ability to close deals in the first quarter? Or maybe if you can just help us quantify the impact of COVID-19 on both the top line and the operating profit line in calendar 1Q? Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yeah, good morning. It\u2019s Chris on the co-workers, we have a north of 80% of our co-workers are now work from home, and the others are in our distribution centers configuration centers and onsite engineers and a few security folks are also on site, so it\u2019s a fairly large portion of our workforce. And, I\u2019ll give kudos to our technology teams and all of those individuals because the move to work from home was swift and seamless. Our IT infrastructure was ready to go. And it was almost eerie how few hiccups we had on that Monday morning. My view on their productivity is it\u2019s been incredibly strong and in many ways, you might have heard this from other companies. This is driving even higher levels of productivity in some areas and greater connection between our own workforce and with our customers, it\u2019s been really quite interesting to see. In terms of dimensionalizing impact from COVID-19 on the numbers, I just think that\u2019s almost impossible to do. As we mentioned, we know we saw the surge in March because of work-from-home and remote work needs. And now there were some pull forward redirection of investment into that first quarter. But to quantify it just seems impossible to do. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for that, Chris. And just as a quick follow-up. As we stand, as we sit here today, can you comment on the business mix you\u2019re seeing between client devices and netted down items? And how do you see that impacting margins? Thanks. Collin Kebo : Yes, I mean as we commented in the prepared remarks, Ruplu, client devices, very strong in the quarter and particularly as we exited the quarter. And also in my prepared comments, I talked about how we had a pretty healthy backlog then that we carried into April that contributed to solid shipment growth. You can assume that a lot of that was in the client device category. In terms of 100% gross margin items, they did not grow as fast as the rest of the business in the first quarter. I think that was largely driven by the focus on client devices and video and accessories and all the other things that you would need to enable, work-from-home and learn from home and things like that. I think it remains to be seen what\u2019s going to happen as we go forward in terms of how some of those 100% gross margin items perform. It\u2019s logical that those things are cloud, we\u2019d see strong growth on a go forward basis in previous environments, when things have slowed down, we have seen customers sweat assets. And you can see warranties and software assurance and things like that pick up as well. But I think we\u2019ll need to see what happens over the next few quarters here before I\u2019d want to make a more definitive call on what happens with that portion of that business. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. Collin Kebo : Yes. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Thank you and good morning. A clarification question. First, when you referenced the double-digit declines in late March and April for the corporate sector, was that a revenue comment or that was new bookings that won\u2019t impact the reported results for several months? And then one of the clearest trends, and you talked about this in your prepared remarks is an acceleration adoption of public cloud. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re doing to enable the sales force or expand the portfolio of services to capture more value from that shift? Thank you. Collin Kebo : Katy, I\u2019ll take the first one and maybe Chris will take the second. Just to clarify my comments. When I was talking about what we were seeing, those were comments really for the first five weeks of the second quarter, so primarily April. And when I said shipments, we saw solid growth as a result of the backlog. You can think of that as equivalent to revenue. When we talk about writings or bookings, and that\u2019s what I referred to as being down double-digits in corporate and small business, those at some point turn into future shipments or invoices. So that\u2019s more of a leading indicator. Hopefully, that clarifies it for it. Katy Huberty : That\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s what I figured. I wanted to make sure. Collin Kebo : Yeah. Okay. And then I think\u2026 Christine Leahy : Yeah. I\u2019ll take your question, Katy. Good morning. On cloud, as you know, we\u2019ve been building our capabilities around cloud and the hybrid multi-cloud work environment now for years. And when we think about cloud generally, I think about it adding even more complexity to the choices that our customers need to make and you add the uncertainty of the world that we\u2019re in today, there\u2019s even another layer of complexity. Even simple cloud choices like the video and call solutions that we all are using now creates complexity for the IT staff as they\u2019ve got to enable co-workers to use it consistently, and at high-performance levels, et cetera. So this plays very well into our value proposition. We have, as you know, I think, we have over 250 cloud offerings on our line card, and we\u2019re essentially \u2013 our value prop is we\u2019re vendor and technology and consumption and consumption agnostic. So we can play that trusted adviser role for organizations as they\u2019re sorting through what their strategies ought to be. And frankly, when we talk to customers now, the questions, because they\u2019re moving so quickly, is help us figure this out, what should we do, how should we do it? We\u2019re having those types of questions around assessing and design more frequently than ever before. So you think about professional services, managed services for public and hybrid cloud. Those are areas that we have been investing and we\u2019ll continue to invest in. So we can help our customers assess their options, where to migrate and how to evaluate how to integrate, how to support the deployment and then how to manage cloud workloads. So I would say, it\u2019s a full spectrum from a CES design, integrate and manage across a multi-cloud world. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Operator Our next question coming from the line of the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open. Maggie Nolan : Hi. You\u2019ve talked about kind of reallocating sales and technical resources and maybe this builds on that previous question a little bit. But obviously, some of that has probably been done to meet the surge in demand in March and into April that you saw. But can you take a little bit more of a bit more of a medium-term outlook on that? Where are the strategic changes coming into play as we think about the coming quarters and the rest of the year? Christine Leahy : Yeah, Hi, Maggie. So in connection with the resources, yeah, think about it a couple of different ways. One is you think \u2013 I think about our sales organization and where demand is and how we can help generate demand and also help customers facilitate through stimulus packages and things like that. So some of the more resilient end markets, we\u2019re ensuring that we\u2019ve got the sales organizations well aligned from a resource perspective there. From a technology perspective, we\u2019ve been building capabilities across the full spectrum of solutions and certainly focused on the most pressing solutions right now. We talked about network augmentation, things like that. But we are building our cloud capabilities, our automation capabilities. Aptris was a great example of an acquisition that brought us extremely strong capabilities in a cornerstone IT software application and Scalar is another great example of doubling the size of our business up in Canada through a strategic acquisition of organization that has, from your cloud capabilities, both professional services, all the capabilities, both professional services, all the way through to managed capabilities. And we continue to add those in the US as well. You might be familiar we introduced our CDW Amplified Services last year. And one key focal area, a pillar of those services is around a multi-cloud environment. So we\u2019ll continue to focus there. The other area that I think, we all believe is going to be accelerating is helping customers with their digital needs. Digital now is a matter of survival in addition to competitive advantages. We hear it across the board. Even retail fast food organizations, who are taking a real accelerated approach to digital. Our technology organization has solutions architects as well as engineers who can support in the design and deployment of digital strategies. And so we\u2019ll expect to see more and more of that, I think, over the next few months. Those might not come to fruition perhaps until later in the year. But certainly, we are having those conversations now. Maggie Nolan : Thanks. And then as we think about some of the segments, obviously, you\u2019ve stated it\u2019s very difficult to see where demand is going to come from in terms of the client base. But if we think about the segments in the context of your growth strategy, in particular, picking up market share. Is there a strategic change there, particularly maybe around small business, which is something that was starting to get traction? And obviously will change in this environment? And then would be interested to hear what you\u2019re hearing from clients in higher ed and education in general as well, given some of the dynamics going in that segment at the moment. Christine Leahy : Yeah. Okay. So let me try and take those in order. In terms of strategic shift, the way I\u2019d think about it is our overall strategy and the value proposition to our customers, it stays the same in terms of diversified portfolio of end markets, breadth of product and services that we offer to meet the customers\u2019 needs now and in the future. In terms of new segments potentially or within segments, we also sub-segment and sub-verticalization is a focus of how we serve our partners and our customers more effectively. And so certainly, coming out of this environment, I could envision some additional sub-segmentation or markets that we serve in a different way or a more concentrated way. On the small business side, we\u2019ve been investing in our e-commerce capabilities over the last several years when we started the small business of stand-alone unit, 2.5 years ago, and we\u2019ve been seeing great results. And I would expect in this environment and in the future, that digital will play a continuing bigger role in small business. But just as it will, with respect to the rest of our segments, I expect to see kind of the human and digital combination be very strong. Within education, on the K-12, we\u2019ve seen strength there. And as you know, there\u2019s the educators are focused on access and equity. There\u2019s a large proportion of students across the world and across the US that do not have access to endpoint devices, client devices and/or the Internet. And there\u2019s quite a focus on ensuring as e-learning is expected to continue, that those devices get into their hands. And so we\u2019re helping try to support that. On the higher ed side, we saw strength in the first quarter, as we said. But equally, we think that budget, I\u2019ll call it budget concerns, as we go into the latter half of the year in a couple of the segments, could weigh on demand, and we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. Maggie Nolan : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I was wondering, Collin, you talked a bit about what you\u2019ve seen in the past five weeks. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more -- you mentioned stimulus or maybe, Chris, you did during your conversation. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve seen any near-term changes in discussions as some of the dollars have started to hit the small businesses as well as some of the states are starting to open up. So that\u2019s almost sort of maybe a change in conversation in the last couple of weeks? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Collin Kebo : Yes. I think it\u2019s difficult to say, Shannon, what -- how those stimulus dollars have changed the tone of the conversation in just the past few weeks because it has been moving so quickly. I think those are part of longer-term conversations with our customers and some of the resources we bring to bear and helping them understand how those stimulus dollars are ultimately going to flow from care. So for example, in education, I think there\u2019s $13 billion -- $30 billion roughly split between higher end and K-12, and it follows public funding and title one and things like that. And helping our end-user customers understand how those funds might be made available to them and ensuring that they have their best opportunity to go ahead and access. And there\u2019ve also been modifications made to e-rate and timing changes. And again, just helping our customers understand those. So I would say, it\u2019s unlikely that it has factored into the trends that I referenced in April. I think it\u2019s more of a go-forward opportunity. Shannon Cross : Okay. Thank you. And then I was curious, in the discussions with some of your customers, when obviously priority shifted during the quarter to more work from home and just business continuity. The longer-term projects that you had sort of in place, have those been canceled, pushed out? Have any customers started to revisit a time line for some of those? I am just again trying to get into the mindset of your customer base. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes. Yes, Shannon, thanks for that question. All of the above, I would say. And it is such a -- I\u2019ll call it almost diverse experience, depending on the industry, depending on the customer. We have not seen a large portion of customers cancel projects. That\u2019s the number one thing. We have seen more customers who have just diverted their resources and their attention to the more urgent needs. And they\u2019re still focused on urgent needs in terms of optimizing the work from home or remote working situations that they\u2019re in. There\u2019s a lot of focus on that right now. But equally, we have seen some customers who are coming back. We\u2019ve got some larger digital transformation projects that customers have actually accelerated. And we\u2019re working with them across the board because, as I said before, it\u2019s a matter of obviously survival, but also competitive advantage coming out of this. So it\u2019s quite a wide range, and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much that we can pull out of that in way of trend. We\u2019re just staying close to our customers and ensuring that we keep the projects going forward that can. But very few have canceled, canceled, Shannon. Shannon Cross : Thank you, very much. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Matthew Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Matthew Sheerin : Yes, thanks. Good morning and thanks for all your candid answers so far. Just one quick follow-up from me regarding your comments on the Census project in federal. It sounds like trends in federal continue to be normal in terms of seasonal demand. The only change being, Collin, your discussion about some of those Census projects get pushed out from Q2 to Q4. So could you give us some more color on that and confirm that? Collin Kebo : Yes, Matt. As both Chris and I said, we expect federal to hold up relatively well from a budget perspective. And the time change I referenced was primarily due to the devices being in the field longer, which is spreading the revenue over a longer period of time, largely from Q2 into Q4. Matthew Sheerin : Okay. And just actually one more follow-up. Just regarding and the surge in demand, near-term demand you\u2019re seeing for work at home solutions. And you know that that\u2019s one slow trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years as is technology as a service, where there\u2019s a leasing component. Are you seeing any acceleration in that as customers look at their own capital requirements and their own balance sheets and perhaps look to that as a service model? Collin Kebo : Yes, Matt. I would say, I mean, in terms of the most recent surge, the objective was speed and getting it deployed rapidly. So most of that transacted in a traditional way. I think as we go forward and customers are wrestling with their own budget challenges, I think, we could see that option enter into the discussion more than it has historically. But in terms of the recent surge, it was primarily transacted in a traditional purchase model. Matthew Sheerin : Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Yeah, quick follow-up question on work for home, if you don\u2019t mind. Has this demand drawn you into at-home sort of shipments, at-home installations, at-home maintenance of the client technology. If it has, is that a good business to be in? And is it sort of yielding in any sort of value-added opportunities of any materiality? Christine Leahy : Yeah, it\u2019s Chris. It has in some ways because of the urgency of getting the devices where they needed to be. And CDW\u2019s team did a really great job of moving shipments. So, you know, give you an example. When you\u2019ve got a shipment for 10,000 devices, that goes to one location. And those 10,000 devices now need to go to 10,000 locations or 5,000 locations. That\u2019s not easy to do. And the organization did a great job being flexible and responsive there. In terms of continuing to support, yes, we are adding additional hardware, software and support services to these work-from-home and remote requirements. But generally, we\u2019re - those are being managed centrally through the IT group of the organization. So it feels like it\u2019s more just a dispersed workforce, if you will, managed centrally. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re highly capable of doing. Paul Coster : Got it. And then, Collin, you mentioned that you sense there\u2019s a pull-forward for work-from-home, of course, that\u2019s intuitively correct. So I\u2019m just wondering at what point you\u2019ll know whether or not there\u2019s real pull-forward, and if it\u2019s sort of post factor, then I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter, but when do you think you\u2019ll know and how do you think you\u2019ll know? Collin Kebo : Yeah. Good question, Paul. I\u2019m not convinced we\u2019re ever really going to know because I think the wildcard here is, how much is pull-forward of something that was going to be purchased anyway versus what\u2019s an incremental use case, meaning that companies, school districts, government agencies never intended for these co-workers or students or teachers to have had mobile devices. And it\u2019s effectively a shift from their IT budget to a use case that they didn\u2019t know that they were going to need. And I think it will be nearly impossible to ultimately parse that out. Paul Coster : Yeah, okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning. Chris, I hope you can provide a little bit of color in terms of the ability to access client facilities. Historically, how important has that been to the CDW sales process? And I guess, as we look at the potential that, some customers may some customers may not allow any visitors on-site for the next several months. How are you guys looking at that for the next several months? And could that be an impact on sales? Christine Leahy : Hi, Keith. Yeah, great question. Thank you. There are a couple of different levels there. Let me just start first with the service engineers. And then move into the sales organization. Our service engineers, we broke immediately into several components, what could be done remotely and what needed to into several be done on-site and then provided them with the protective equipment and peace of mind that they could go on-site with customers. And they have been doing that and doing that very effectively. But we did break that into pieces. And remote access can get us very far in some of the work we\u2019ve had to do for work from home. Regarding our sellers, I\u2019ll come back to the comments I mentioned earlier. Certainly, in-person connections and meetings at the office, and relationship building live has always been important to any relationship sales organization. But the -- I don\u2019t want to call it surprising. But it\u2019s been a really positive discovery for me in any event is the incredible way that our sales organization is staying connected with our customers, almost more deeply than in person. So I think what we\u2019re going to start to see is, flexible ways of working. Our hybrid world will probably become our workforce hybrid world. And they\u2019ll all do what they need to do to make the connections and serve the customers and ensure that we can have learning sessions and white boarding sessions that are as effective as possible. And some of that might go back to kind of the way it was prior to this epidemic. But I also think we\u2019re going to see some significant changes. The other thing I would say is our sales organization, as you know, is a legacy inside organization that goes back a long way. And so the teams have been built with resources wrapped around them that have, in many cases, been remotely accessed. So it\u2019s not a new thing for our sellers, and our solutions architects and engineers to be on collaborative tools actually helping to solve solutions. So I hope that answers the question. I think we\u2019ll see a little bit of a new world going forward. And I feel like the team has already been effective. And we\u2019ll take the learning\u2019s and continue to drive even greater and deeper relationships with our customers. Keith Housum : Okay. I appreciate that. And then, Collin, just a follow-up to the commentary regarding the $29 million credit reserve. I guess how does that compare to, I guess, the average quarter? And then, are you already starting to see some credit deterioration or is this some credit deterioration or is this in anticipation of what you expect to see later in the quarter and the rest of the year? Collin Kebo : Yeah, Keith. I\u2019ll take the last one first. I think it\u2019s too soon to see any credit -- any material credit deterioration. I think it\u2019s in anticipation of what we expect to come down the road. When you look at our balance sheet, you\u2019ll see that at March 31st, the reserve was approximately $35 million, which is a little bit more than 1% of our outstanding customer receivable balance. Historically, that balance has been much lower. If you look at where it was at year-end or in the year ago period, it\u2019s been running around $7 million to $8 million previously. So we used a variety of data points to estimate the reserve. We looked at historical information, what our experience was back in 2008, 2009, current conditions. And again, estimates of what we think could be coming. Keith Housum : Great, Collin. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. Christine Leahy : Thank you. Thank you all for staying on a little longer with us. Concluding today\u2019s call, I want to once more recognize the remarkable dedication of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. They continuously reaffirm my conviction that we will enjoy better days ahead. I\u2019m so proud and grateful to be part of this team. So thank you to the team. And thank you to our customers and our partners for the privilege and opportunity to serve you during these times and to our investors and analysts for participating in this call. We appreciate you and your continuing interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Until then, stay healthy, stay safe and be well. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Good day.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of second quarter results and drivers of performance. I'll provide our perspectives on the current macro environment, its impact on our customers and market and how we are responding. Collin, will then take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. For the second quarter net sales were $4.4 billion, 5.7% below last year and down 5.3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $338 million, a decrease of 5.6%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.56, 2.6% below last year on a reported basis and down 2.3% in constant currency. For the quarter net sales performance varied by month and by customer end market. As we shared on our last earnings call, we entered April with a healthy backlog of remote workforce enablement solution, which contributed to strong performance in April. As the quarter progressed, for some of our customer end markets projects were postponed and demand declined, as the economic toll of the crisis impacted customer spend. In other customer end markets, IT investment was prioritized and remained healthy. During the quarter, we helped customers across a spectrum of IT priorities, remote enablement, business and operations continuity and security remain top customer focus areas to manage remote environments at scale, and to prepare to work and learn from home in some capacity for longer. Customers also focus on initiatives to reduce cost, optimize resources, and leverage technology for better customer and employee experiences through digital transformation. CDW teams orchestrated turnkey solutions from our broad portfolio of clients' devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security, software and cloud offering to help customers build these capabilities and achieve their goals. At the end of the first quarter, we had strategic stocking positions in the key remote enablement categories to meet expected customer demand. During the second quarter, we continue to leverage our distribution centers extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationship and strong balance sheet and liquidity position, to successfully navigate supply challenges. We continue to procure supply in key remote enablement categories, and managed through longer lead times for others. Now let's take a deeper look at customer end market performance. Corporate and small business both declined double digit. As you know these channels include our small and medium business customers. The unique nature of the COVID-19 crisis has posed greater challenges for some small and medium businesses. Intra quarter net sales results decelerated each month as softer writing impacted subsequent month performance. During the quarter, corporate and small business customers spend was prioritized on three areas. First, remote work enablement and new use cases, driving notebook and mobile device spend. Second, infrastructure support and optimization which resulted in strong growth in cloud offering, and several software categories including security, network management and virtualization. And third, maximizing of past IT purchases and reduction in expenses through extended maintenance contracts and shorter commitments for new contracting licenses. The government team increased net sales 24%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up almost 50%. During the quarter our devices of service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau contributed meaningfully to our federal results. Field operations to collect data from non-responders has started. This solution will continue to be a meaningful contributor to federal net sales for the remainder of 2020. Excluding Census' results, federal was up healthy double digit. Growth was driven by civilian projects and demonstrated the team's great work delivering CDW's value proposition to multiple agencies. The team delivered strong transactional growth with almost 100% growth in notebooks, and double digit growth in enterprise storage, video, collaboration, hardware and security software. The state and local team delivered low single digit growth driven by double digit transactional growth that enabled remote work capabilities, including notebooks and collaboration hardware, software to enhance security and optimize technology assets and investments to accelerate e-government initiatives. Education increased 13% with strong double digit growth in K-12, and a mid-single digit decline in higher ed. In K-12, customers continue to focus on equity and access for students. K-12 growth was primarily driven by strong Chromebook results, as our team helped school districts prepare to start classes later this month or early next month in a variety of teaching format. Higher ed performance reflected the uncertainty that universities and colleges are facing. IT spending on remote enablement, such as notebooks and collaboration tools was strong. It was offset by delayed infrastructure projects due to budget concerns. Healthcare declined low double digits, with strong April results, followed by net sales declines in May and June, as COVID-related response efforts took priority and budget pressure intensified. Our team continue to work closely with healthcare customers on expanded virtual care capabilities, as healthcare delivery in the U.S. fundamentally changes. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations decreased 8% on a reported. The UK team delivered high single digit growth in constant currency with strong public sector demand, driven by healthcare customers and more muted corporate customer demand. Canada net sales decreased double digits in constant currency due to a higher mix of small business customers, who have been more impacted by COVID-19, and pressure on the oil and gas industry in Alberta. As you can see, our second quarter performance was varied across customer end market. This also drew a various performance across our major product and services categories. U.S. hardware was down mid-single digit. However, client devices grew almost 6%. Software declined low double digits and services grew mid-single digits. Transactions declined low single digits on top of last year's mid-teens growth. Solutions declined low double digits as some customers deprioritized infrastructure and larger project engagement. We delivered strong growth in our cloud offerings. Customers spend increased double digit, driven by strong growth in analytics, collaboration, data storage and recovery, compute and security. We expect strong customer demand for cloud offerings to continue. On July 1, we acquired IGNW, a leading provider of cloud native services expertise and software development capabilities. IGNW is a leader in digital velocity solutions, including advisory, consulting and development services, and has been a partner of CDW since 2018. IGNW presents an exciting growth opportunity for our business, our customers, our partners and our co-workers. It brings the right talent and strategic capabilities we want to deliver to our customers. We are pleased to welcome IGNW's approximately 170 co-workers to the CDW family. This is a great example of our continued investment in our cloud capabilities. M&A is an important part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDWs strategic capabilities. During our 35 plus year history, CDW had a successful track record of evolving customer needs in the IT industry, in part through acquisition. Our second quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end market, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. Let me take a moment to review each. First, our balanced portfolio customer end market. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels that each generated annual net sales of more than $1.5 billion in 2019. Corporate, small business, government, education and healthcare. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including federal government, state and local government, K-12 and higher education, providing us insights into our customers' objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered over $2 billion of net sales in 2019. The diversity of our customer end market serves us well, when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. This balance is especially relevant in the current environment. Next, our offerings are broad and deep, with over 100,000 products, services and solutions, from more than 1,000 vendor partners. We are well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT, and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. For example, in response to the current environment, customers have turned to us for return to work technology solutions beyond our traditional offerings, including enhanced video surveillance, temperature scanners and device sanitizing solutions. We now offer a full suite of IT enabled solutions to meet these demands. Our teams have productized different solutions for our various customer end markets. This is a great example of our thought leadership and ability to pivot to growth opportunities. And the final driver of our performance or three part strategy for growth, which is to first acquire new customers and capture share. Second, enhance our solutions capabilities. And third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want in need today and in the future. Today's environment doesn't impact our commitment to executing our strategy. In fact, it strengthens our resolve so we will emerge stronger than ever. So let me share a few examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers this quarter. A financial services company turned to our team to mobilize its employees to work from home. Only 30% of its workforce had worked from home capability. The customer delegated an emergency blanket purchase order for $3.5 million for our team to have full responsibility to develop the right solution across client devices, remote access, security and it's data centers. We leveraged our long standing relationships with the customer to get it right, and with our vendor partners to get supply. A large corporation was challenged with improving productivity for its remote employees. The customer needed to provide employees with additional IT equipment consistent with corporate standards, but did not have the systems in place to identify which employees required equipment, to place thousands of orders or to deliver the equipment to the employees homes. The customer returned to us due to our robust e-commerce platform and extensive logistics capabilities. Our team created a digital catalogue that integrated CDW and the customers' e-procurement system, making a complicated process simple. Through this project, we expanded the partners and products we sold to the customer. Our team did such a great job that the customer cancelled RFP midstream to award us another meaningful engagement. Another example of a 5,000 students school district in Ohio, turned to us to create a complete remote learning environment for its students. Our teams helped the district with client devices, and developed a collaboration platform for its teachers and students in the cloud. This is one of many examples from the quarter, where our teams helped customers with cloud collaboration tools. These examples also show how quickly solutions need to be implemented in this environment. Customers turn to us for expertise, thought leadership and a high level of customer service. We won a ServiceNow engagement for a leading medical school after two weeks sales cycle, less than half the typical cycle time, because of our past experience with this customer and our ability to deliver in a compressed timeframe. These examples highlight CDW's three part strategy for growth including CDW as a trusted advisor, and how IT is crucial to achieving our customers' objectives. I now want to update you on our efforts to manage COVID-19's impact on our business. As I shared previously, we have a cross functional response team in place. The team has three key principles, safeguard the health and well-being of our co-workers, serve the mission driven needs of our customers and support our communities. Our office co-workers are still working from home. We have excellent capabilities in the culture of collaboration, so co-worker engagement and productivity have been strong. We continue to evaluate when and how to return to the office and where and how our customers will work -- our co-workers will work in the future. All distribution and configuration centers are operational, and we maintain precautionary measures advised by public health authorities, including social distancing, segmented shifts, personal protective equipment, enhanced facility cleaning, and temperature scanners. These teams have done an exceptional job maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while taking the necessary precautions. During the quarter, more of our sellers and technical specialists began to reengage in-person with customers. We have taken proactive measures to keep the worker safe in these settings as well. Our teams have done a great job of adapting to virtual channels to ensure we reach our customers, and we continue to develop our co-workers. For example, our marketing and events transitioned from in-person to virtual, so customers could continue to learn from our technical experts. Also during the quarter, our sales and technical teams completed over 20,000 hours of training and earned over 400 certification, almost doubled last year's activity. Our marketing and events and co-worker services teams have done an excellent job adapting to the environment. They demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our culture, a culture we believe is important competitively to us. Let's turn now to the balance of the year. The economic outlook for the foreseeable future remains uncertain, as the duration and severity of COVID-19 are unknown and also uneven. Therefore, we are not providing 2020 targets. We continue to watch closely the near-term impact of COVID-19 on our customer end market. For Q3 to-date writing, the rate of decline has stabilized for our most impacted customer end market, and trends for more resilient customer end market continue. While encouraging, we believe it's premature to call this a trend as weekly writing do fluctuate. Customers are in various phases of responding to the macro environment. Some customers remain focused on remote enablement and operational continuity, others are moving forward with organizational efficiency and optimization, and other customers are investing behind digital transformation, including cloud migration and automation strategies. Our teams can help with all phases and will continue to be trusted partners to our customers, to help them smartly deploy their IQ resources and solve some of their toughest challenges. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors in the economy, and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy in place. We will help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape and adopt new technology. We are committed to investing in our three part growth strategy, including the capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity, and enhance our competitive position. We will also keep a watchful eye on the impact of COVID-19, the macro environment and other unpredictable variables, such as potential supply disruptions, trade policies, and upcoming U.S. elections. CDW will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers, address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out execute our competition. Now, Colin will share some more details on our financial performance. Collin? Collin Kebo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our second quarter results, liquidity position and capital allocation priorities. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 9, consolidated net sales were $4.4 billion down 5.7% on a reported and average daily sales basis. In constant currency, consolidated net sales declined by 5.3%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 0.5% versus the first quarter. As expected, this was lower than historical seasonality due to the first quarter stronger than normal seasonality, and the ongoing impact of COVID-19. As Chris mentioned, our customer channels generally perform consistent with the demand and writings commentary shared on our last earnings call. April sales benefited from the carryover of strong demand in March, whereas May and June sales were impacted by lower demand in certain customer end markets. Pockets of supply dislocation continued in the quarter. And we leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure the IT products and solutions our customers needed, for remote enablement, operations continuity and resource optimization. Gross profit for the quarter was $747 million, a decline of 3.4%. Gross margin was 17.1%, up 40 basis points over last year, driven by product margin and by the mix of netted down revenues primarily software as a service. Turning to SG&A on Slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A decreased 1.5%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales payroll consistent with lower gross profit, reduced performance based compensation and cost savings measures including decreased travel and entertainment and ongoing productivity and efficiency efforts. The June 30, credit loss reserve balance decreased modestly versus the March 31, balance reflecting our customer collection experience in the quarter, a lower receivable balance at June quarter end and expectations for future collections. While we are generally pleased with second quarter's bad debt experience, we recognized that much economic uncertainty exists and remain cautious on year to go credit loss expectations. These expense reductions were partially offset by approximately $7 million of COVID-19 expenses, primarily to safeguard and compensate frontline co-workers. As we always do, we are closely monitoring our cost structure relative to the demand environment. Co-worker count at the end of the second quarter was 10,048, down 56 from the first quarter, reflecting restrictions on hiring and backfilling attrition that we put in place in April. Year-over-year co-worker count increased 265, with approximately 120 of the increase from the Atheros acquisition last fall, and the remaining from organic co-worker investments. Our recently completed acquisition of IGNW adds approximately 170 co-workers, most of whom are customer facing technical co-workers. GAAP operating income was $283 million down 5.6%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance was $338 million down 5.6%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%. Moving to Slide 11, interest expense was $40 million, down 1.8%. The incremental interest from the $600 million notes issued in April was offset by savings from a lower LIBOR rate on the term loan. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 12 was 22.9% in the quarter, compared to 24.7% last year. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $65 million last year. The rate decrease is primarily related to higher excess tax benefits and equity based compensation in 2020. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation, which is shown on Slide 13. For the quarter our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.9%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate. As you can see on Slide 14, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $144 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.31 down 1.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $225 million in the quarter, down 5.2% compared to last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.56 down 2.6% from last year. Turning to first-half results on Slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $8.8 billion, an increase of 1.9% on a reported basis and 1.1% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one extra selling day in the first-half of 2020. The extra selling day will reverse in Q4 when we have one fewer selling day compared to prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, first-half consolidated net sales were 1.5% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.5 billion up 4% and gross profit margin was 17.2% up 40 basis points. Non-GAAP operating income was $642 million for the first-half of 2020, down 0.5%. Net income was $357 million and non-GAAP net income was $425 million, up 0.5%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.94 up 3.4%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 21. Liquidity continues to be a top priority in the current environment. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $958 million and net debt was $2.9 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was roughly $2 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $468 million, as shown on Slide 22. This is higher than normal seasonality and above last year's $407 million, primarily due to tax payment timing. Last year, we made cash tax payments on April 15 and June 15. And this year, the comparable payments were made on July 15, after the end of the second quarter. Moving to Slide 23, the three month average cash conversion cycle is 25 days, up nine days from last year's second quarter. While cash collections were solid in the quarter, DSO increased seven days as we mix it into some larger public customers who can take longer to pay, and we have seen certain commercial customers extending payments. DIO increased four days, as we continue to invest in inventory to help our customers manage their IT projects with greater certainty of product availability. One of our greatest assets is our long-term customer relationships, and we know it's important to be there for customers during challenging times, like we were during the great recession. We will continue to balance managing customer\u2019s working capital needs, while appropriately managing risk. In the quarter, we returned $54 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and did not repurchase any stock. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 24, as I mentioned earlier, we remain focused on liquidity and our capital priorities remain the same as last quarter. Our priorities are, first, continue to pay the dividend. Today, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per common share, reflecting CDW\u2019s strong liquidity position in competence and the cash flow generation capability of the business. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We remained comfortable with the current target net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times for several reasons. One, we have no debt maturities in 2020 and just $57 million due in 2021. Two, the weighted average interest rate on the debt portfolio was 3.6%, so cash interest is manageable. And three, our debt capital structure is covenant like. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2 times below the low end of our target range. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of IGNW which closed after quarter end is a good example of this. IGNW is not expected to have a material impact on CDW's 2020 net sales and non-GAAP earnings per share. We remain actively evaluating targets and will seek to be opportunistic in this environment. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating in cultural fit and financial return, all within the context of liquidity at that point in time. Fourth, as I previously noted our share repurchase program remain suspended to enhance liquidity. The decision on when to resume stock buybacks continues to depend on several considerations, including the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and working capital, leverage and other potential uses of cash, such as M&A. Lastly on the topic of capital, we intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We have a CapEx like model, historically running around half a point of sales or slightly more. We believe it's important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity, and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. We previously withdrew our 2020 targets and will not be providing an updated financial outlook, but consistent with last quarter, I want to provide insights into what we're seeing roughly one month into the third quarter from a demand, supply and operating perspective. On the demand side, activity continues to be mixed across customer end markets. In corporate and small business, looking back to the second quarter for a moment, the year-over-year decline in writings peaked at over 20% in May or June depending on the channel. Consequently, preliminary July sales are down double-digits in both channels. July writings are down year-over-year with the declines less negative than the peak levels of May or June. While encouraging, as Chris mentioned, we believe it's premature to call this a trend as weekly writings have been volatile, and we expect commercial customers will be sensitive to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases and the potential economic implications. In public, preliminary July sales and July writings are up year-over-year, driven by continued strength in K-12 and parts of government, partially offset by healthcare where both preliminary sales and writings continue to be down. Our international businesses are generally seeing similar customer trends to last quarter. We expect to continue to mix into public channels, which could add some headwind to gross margin in the back-half of the year. On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a fluid environment with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. Notebook supply, particularly lower end devices such as Chromebooks is tight. We are also experiencing extended lead times in certain networking and server products. We are in constant contact with our vendor partners, whose manufacturing operations are generally back up and running. Free challenges have moderated, but we are still seeing some pricing surcharges and price increases on certain products, which we are generally passing along to customers. On the operating front, all distribution centers continue to be operational. Finally, I want to provide an update on the devices of service solution to the U.S. Census Bureau. The contribution to second quarter net sales was in line with expectations. We have now deployed all of the devices into the field. The period for which the devices will be used remains fluid, and we could see some net sales shift among the next three quarters. The team has done an outstanding job managing through a challenging environment to help the Census Bureau deliver its mission. From a financial perspective, this year, we now expect the Census to contribute up to approximately 160 basis points of incremental net sales growth over 2019. On an absolute basis, we currently expect the Census to contribute over 200 basis points of net sales in 2020. We will continue to provide updates on the Census as we progress through the second-half of 2020. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Jake to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Adam Tindle : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start with a strategic question. I think about CDW's competitive advantage is at scale, we obviously saw strong cash flow in the quarter. And those things seem to be a major potential weapon in this environment, where the long tail of competitors in your fragmented industry are struggling. So, the question is how are you thinking about options to potentially play a little offense, while others are on defense? And maybe if you could specifically tie this into your goal to acquire new customers and update that on the quarter that would be helpful. Chris Leahy : Sure. Good morning, Adam. Yes, we've accelerated. I think I mentioned this on the last call, we see this as an opportunity and we've accelerated our acquisition programs. If you look across the breadth of our competitive advantages, customers right now are looking for those who have the expertise to help, and I'll just say it very simply, figure it out. The world is moving very quickly. The mandate to evolve and transform from the digital perspective are moving quickly. The access to cash is not what it used to be. And so having a provider that has the scale can get the supply, has the relationship with the vendor partners, and equally has the spectrum of solutions and experts, who can help design and plan and move quickly to get from solution design and development to implementation has been very important, particularly for those customers that I mentioned, who are going on the offense, and who are accelerating their own strategies and digital needs. So, we are being aggressive in helping the customers that are in our base now. But we're equally being aggressive about finding customers, who are in need. The financial situation that we sit in the financial strength, the strength of our balance sheet has also been very important to customers, who want to ensure that they're working with an organization that is large and credible and is around for the long-term? Adam Tindle : Okay. Thanks. And a as a follow-up maybe Collin. And I just had a question operationally. Operating profit dollar decline essentially match the revenue decline. So there was very little decremental detrimental margin here. I know the variable cost structure probably helps, but portions of the business were down significantly. So, maybe you could just touch on the performance in the quarter and how we can think about decremental margin moving forward? Collin Kebo : Yes. Adam, there were -- if I understand your question, I think it was, why wasn't there more deleverage? There were a couple things that helped us in the quarter that I touched on in my prepared remarks. One was on the credit loss reserve. We ended up not booking any bad debt expense in the quarter. We just drew down against the reserve that we had previously established, and in fact, released a little bit of it just because of receivables balance had wound down. The second thing that happened in the quarter is we did true-up our performance based compensation accruals, based on full year estimates, and we took a half a year's benefit in the second quarter. So, I wouldn't expect those two things to continue as we move through the balance of the year. Adam Tindle : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Thank you. Chris, you talked about the pace of decline and writing stabilizing so far in the third quarter. Just wondering, if you could spend a little bit more on that comment? And just how we should think about the timing lag between writing translating into shipment or revenue trends? And maybe more broadly, just hitting on the health of IT budget at this point as we're thinking about the balance of the year. Chris Leahy : Hi, Matt. Sure. I'm pausing for a bit because, it's such a tapestry out there of customers. We have obviously diversified customer end markets. And even within the end markets very diversified customer base. So, if you take corporate for example, across industry across geography, and different areas are getting hit differently, so different geographies. You guys know oil and gas in the south suffering a little some of those customers. You've got tech in the West, not suffering as much. You've got the virus resurgence in some areas, and the concerns about retreating back to stay-at-home orders. So, there's a number of layers that various customers are dealing with. And what I would say is it's hard to paint a picture, a single picture of where IT budgets are going. That said, we are having robust conversations with all of our customers, those that are spending today and those who are planning tomorrow. So, how budgets work? It's really going to be a reflection on the economy in this health crisis, which we continue to believe is just unpredictable. There's not a lot of visibility there. That said and back to your writings question, we watch writings daily and weekly. And we've had a couple of weeks of stability, as I said. But it can also be a little bit volatile. So, we watch it very carefully, that will typically turn into revenue in the next 30 to 60 days is how we think about the impact of the timing. But what I would leave you with is, technology is the top of everybody's minds. And for those customers that are focused on just surviving, they've got rent to pay, they've got payroll to pay. They're not going to be paying for IT right now. But we are talking with those customers about what's to come in the next quarter and beyond. Matt Cabral : Got it. And then, I think I heard in the prepared remarks solutions are down double digits. Just wondering if you dig a little bit more into the categories underneath there, and talk about where you're seeing the biggest headwinds. I guess I'm curious, your perspective on how much is just near-term projects being deferred versus maybe customers starting to reevaluate their broader on-premise footprint as cloud adoption is starting to pick-up a little bit? Chris Leahy : Yes, that's a fair question. I think, at a high level, Matt, what we've seen is a real refocus on the urgency of remote work, optimizing employees working remotely, really bolstering those capabilities over the last couple of quarters. At the same time, we absolutely are seeing acceleration in discussions towards cloud and moving towards the cloud. In terms of on-prem, we've said and we'll say it again, that we believe that there's going to be a hybrid world out there. It continues to be a hybrid world. And we're having those kinds of conversations with our customers. So, assessing options for cloud, what to migrate, how to migrate, what cloud vendors to choose. The good news is we've got the ability to help our customers through cloud deployments, and then manage once they're up and running. But we still think there's going to be a lot of on-prem opportunity going forward. It's going to be more of a multi cloud hybrid cloud situation. Matt Cabral : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good morning guys. I have just two questions as well. First off maybe on the gross margin performance, it was fairly impressive given the discussion we just had on solutions and the frontline devices did well. So could you maybe walk through kind of what drove the gross margin upside year-over-year, if it's sustainable as we go forward? Collin Kebo : Sure. Amit, I can start on that one. Product margin held up pretty well, and we did get some benefit from mixing into software as a service. On the product margin within there, I would say in a supply constrained environment in particular categories, the margins can be a little bit firmer. And then within products, there's mix. So, for example, desktops happened to be weak in the quarter, they tend to be lower margin. So, within that product, we did see some lower margin. I think in terms of the outlook, as always difficult to predict because there are a lot of moving factors. I did say in my prepared comments that I do think that we will mix more into public as we move into the back-half of the year. Q3 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for both government and education. And given what's happening in education today, I would expect it to be quite strong. And then, where we do see a little bit more firmness on the commercial side of the business tends to be in the larger, better capitalized customers, which tend to have a little thinner margin. So, we were pleased with margin performance in the quarter, just cautious as we think about it over the back-half of the year. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's helpful. And then, I was hoping to get your perspective on client devices of PCs, I guess, as you go into the back-half of the year, I think, you guys mentioned it was up 6% in June, if I'm not mistaken. And of the industry data centers suggest that this may remain somewhat stronger for a couple of more quarters. So, I'd just love to understand how you guys think about the segment in the back-half? And if you were indeed able to meet all the demand within client devices for the June quarter. Chris Leahy : Yes. So Amit, the client device obviously was very strong and we did take strategic inventory position, so that we were able to meet demand as we moved through the first and the second quarter. Look, as we said before, pre-COVID we thought we were kind of in the late innings around PC refresh and the Win10 upgrade. And so that will continue. So, if we think about going forward, certainly work from home, we think will be a trend [Indiscernible]. It will be -- we think, fundamentally how people work in the office and at home will be a lasting and durable change. How people learn from home will be a durable change, and those will be opportunities for client. And we've got devices that were out there past three, four years ago now, 2017, where there might be refresh opportunities there. Obviously, the economic environment and employment would have an impact on that. But we've always said, we've expected moderated growth. And I think that we're looking at the same way going forward. I'm sorry, Collin, did you want to add something? Collin Kebo : Yes, the only thing I was going to add is, and I think you know this. When you look at industry data points, you just need to make sure you're comparing apples to apples at what point in the supply chain you're measuring. So, I think some of those industry sources are OEM shipments into the channel and distributors and retailers and others like that. So, there's a little bit of the lag in that. Obviously, we saw very strong growth in client devices in the first quarter and in April as we shift against our backlog. So some of these shipments you're seeing are effectively replenishing lower levels of inventory further downstream in the supply chain that had been pretty well depleted. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. That\u2019s really a fair point. Sorry, go ahead. Chris Leahy : Yes. Amit, I was just going to say, in the supply chain, we are seeing some delays, particularly in the lower end Chromebook space. So that will make its way through the supply chain over the next few months. But that's happening as well. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate you're not providing guidance for the year. But do you expect the same business model mechanics to play out in terms of growing 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market? Our survey work points to maybe 4% to 5% declines for the year. Is that also the ballpark of what you see in the data? And then I have a follow-up? Chris Leahy : Yes. Katy, I\u2019ll start. I think what we see is there a variety of data points around GDP and IT growth. What I would say is we do expect ourselves -- we do hold ourselves accountable to outgrow the market by a meaningful amount. As you know, typically when we have a more robust environment and we are selling more hardware, which we recognize at the topline, that's when we tend to outgrow by the 200 to 300, sometimes higher basis points. When it's in an environment that's more like the one we're in recessionary and customers are doing things like extending the useful life of their assets, with warranties that net down and other things that are netted down, we will continue to outpace the market, but typically it's by a slightly lower margin, 100 to 200, 250 basis points. Katy Huberty : Do you have a view as -- do you survey your customers and have a view as to what you think the IT spending decline will look like this year? Chris Leahy : We don't have a collective view that we're sharing. There are so many data points out there that are so desperate. I mean there's such a wide variation that we're listening to our customers and just taking every opportunity to help serve them and grow our business where we can, and support our customers so that they can grow coming out of this recession. Katy Huberty : Okay. That makes sense. And then just one other clarification. When you referenced some early stability in writings in July, when you say stable, is that -- do you mean flat year-on-year? Or you mean the rate of decline is stable from what you saw in the June quarter or the month of June? Collin Kebo : Just to clarify, I think what I was trying to do in my comments was particularly the commercial side of the business in corporate and small business give an indication of the peak decline we saw in the second quarter. So in May or June, those writings declined over 20% in both corporate and small business. What we're seeing in the month of July is that they are not as negative as those peak declines we saw earlier. So, it's a relative to what we had been seeing in the business statement. Katy Huberty : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Chris, I just wanted to clarify, are the trends that you're seeing in corporate and small business customers -- is that playing out as you had expected 90 days ago? Or are the trends better or worse than you expected? And any change to your outlook for the next couple of quarters? Chris Leahy : Good morning, Ruplu. Thanks for the question. And I would say the trends are playing out, as we expected and as we shared with you. You remember last recession 2009, we talked through what we saw there. And it was a faster reaction by our small and medium sized businesses. In particular, they reacted more quickly to the economic downturn. And that is what we saw here. Now we have, as I mentioned, a diversified customer base even within small and corporate. And so, even within that, we saw some of the customers in certain industries, hospitality and things like that, who were suffering a little more, others who were actually being very aggressive in their strategies. The other thing is when you think about, as I mentioned, the uniqueness of what we're going through with the virus, and the fits and starts if you will, in different geographies, that's also tending to have an impact on our customers. But all of that said, I'd say that the trends played out as we expected. Look, small business channels are going to be impacted by economics, and they're going to focus on what they need to do to survive first and then invest for the future. So, what I'd say is it's really affirms our business diversification strategy, and provide optimism and the competence of our business model. If you think about what we were able to deliver, our free cash flow through the year is at $470 million. We've paid our dividend. We're continuing to invest in the evolution of CDW going forward. We've got other customer segments that are going very strong, given the demand in the market. And I'm really proud of how the team is managing through this. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for all the details on that, Chris. I appreciate it. One question for you Collin, how should we think about SG&A as a percentage of sales going forward? Right now, you mentioned you've got reduced performance based comp and travel is less and you've enacted cost savings measures. But as lockdowns get relaxed, how should we think about SG&A? Can you hold the line? Or should we expect OpEx to trend upwards? Thank you. Collin Kebo : Yes. I mean, we're not going to provide a specific guide on SG&A. As you know, we do have a variable cost structure. So there are elements of it, variable sales compensation that will move with our gross profit. And then we have put hiring restrictions in place and continue to let attrition run, so that'll add a little bit of variability. And then we've taken other cost savings measures. And the other point I would make Ruplu is, we are not managing to a short-term SG&A target here, as I think we've been communicating pretty consistently. We do think that this is an opportunity to invest and get stronger in this. And so, we're going to take a balanced approach and that we are going to continue to invest both in CapEx and OpEx. But having said all that, we are mindful of the demand environment, and we\u2019ll take a balanced approach and ensure we have an appropriate cost structure. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for all the details and congrats on the quarter. Collin Kebo : Thank you. Chris Leahy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. My first is just regarding what you\u2019re seeing in terms of extended maintenance sort of contract terms? Can you give us some perspective on how the magnitude of this. And maybe if you can go back to other times when the economy has been under pressure, if you kind of talk about how this compares. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Collin Kebo : Yes. We are seeing customers, particularly those who are looking to save cash move into shorter duration maintenance contracts, as opposed to going to multi-years, those that are paying on for software a number of seats and things like that, looking at true-ups and things like that. It\u2019s difficult to compare to previous times, Shannon. I think back in 2009, we saw a similar behavior and then when we experienced a bit of a slowdown in the \u201915 \u201916 period, we saw customer sweating assets at that point in time. Maybe a little bit more pronounced today than it was back in \u201915 \u201916, but I think that\u2019s logical just given the severity of the crisis relative to the slowdown we saw back then. Chris Leahy : Shannon, I would just add that our managed services capabilities are more robust now. And so, these conversations with customers in terms of service contracts and potentially shortening them have also led to some robust conversations about managed services and some wins for us in managed services as a result of those conversations. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you. And then, how do we think about education budgets? I'm just trying to understand, obviously all of these school districts are now -- well, not all, but a lot of school districts are going to hybrid model, clearly there are a lot of kids out there who don\u2019t have access to Chromebooks or who\u2019re just getting access now. So, I'm wondering what you\u2019re hearing from the school districts in terms of the state of their budgets? And then also how are you thinking about -- and I know there\u2019s a lot of talk regarding the magnitude of the stimulus bill when and if it ever gets decided. But how quickly does sort of federal funding tend to run through? I'm just trying to get an idea of what we might see in the next year months frankly. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes. Shannon, on the education side K-12 in particular, they are accessing funding and we\u2019re helping them with that. So funds are flowing. And they are really all hands on deck, trying to get devices into the hands of students. And so, there\u2019s a lot of activity there regarding client devices, remote enablement as well as what we call kind of broadcasting from the school. It\u2019s very complicated and we had a highly seasoned sales organization that works with the schools. But the breadth of the solutions that we\u2019re looking for are fulsome as I mentioned in my remarks, all the way from thermal scanning and sanitation stations to dividers and carts and things that CDW can just help them provide, so that they have kind of turnkey solutions. But there is strong demand to get the kids in the classroom environment, whether virtual or hybrid as quickly as possible. So, there\u2019s a lot of pressure there and they are accessing funds. In higher ed, we\u2019re seeing some falls on the budget side. Obviously, they've got concerns around various revenue streams. And the solutions provided in the business there in terms of on campus robust network support, et cetera has been falling a little bit. But we are starting to see a pick up when it comes to remote enablement and devices and would expect that to continue as the school gets sorted out, coming into this September-October timeframe. In terms of the timing of funds flowing through, I don\u2019t have a particular timeframe that I would know how to share, But I would say, they\u2019re moving a little faster than I would have expected in some areas. And again, our teams are really excited, figuring out where they\u2019re going to flow, how they\u2019re going to flow and how to make sure you write up the order so that the funds can apply. But they are flowing, and I would expect the same would happen with any new build that we see that makes it true. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Ted Starck-King with William Blair. Ted Starck-King: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I want to follow-up on one of the earlier questions on new clients. Can you talk about sales productivity and the ability to win new clients in this environment? And then maybe also around kind of a customer retention rates, both historically and what you're seeing today? Chris Leahy : Hi. Ted. Yes. On acquisition and new clients, we haven't really shared specific information about numbers of acquisition and penetration rate. But I would say that it has not been relatively harder, because we are remote. Because we've moved all of our marketing, for example, to digital channels. So, we're reaching more customers and we're reaching more people within customers, and taking the opportunity to follow-up. So, we've, retooled how we put together acquisition programs to be as effective as possible. Our sellers are really quite amazing in their ability to connect with people and develop relationships, virtually. And as I did mention, we do have sellers who are now more out in the field with customers as well. But I've been really pleased with how they've been able to transition and the aggressiveness or the assertiveness and the success with our acquisition programs right now. And the second question, Ted, was around retention. Yes, we don't -- that's not a number that we share. But I would say that the customer satisfaction in this current environment has been really quite high, what we measure from the satisfaction perspective. Collin Kebo : Yes. Ted, I would just add, I mean, it's difficult in this environment, particularly for the most challenged customers who are looking to preserve liquidity, they're pulling back. So, they may not be spending period versus not spending with CDW. I think in an environment like this, consistent with our remarks, we are staying in front of our customers, even those that may not be spending. And I think if there's wallet to be had, we're getting our fair share of that. Ted Starck-King: Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up question. So, on that note, are you guys flexing some of your financing offerings for customers? And how would that kind of make its way through the P&L? Thanks. Collin Kebo : Yes. When you say the note, you mean the notes we issued in April, those were for general corporate purposes to enhance our liquidity as well as to make sure we have sufficient working capital to support our customers. I would say one act area that we're very active in is working with our customers and helping them understand the variety of vendor partner financing programs that are out there. And that's where we start and many of our OEMs have been quite aggressive in terms of providing attractive financing, and we are seeing a pretty material uptake on that from our customers. So, the nice thing about that is, it doesn't flow through our financials. As I mentioned, there are some instances though, where we are investing in inventory for customers, or have seen terms pick up a bit and that's where you would see it in our working capital. Ted Starck-King: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask just about, again about the public sector, specifically the state and local government, which has been I know, a strong, fast growing market for you. What are the trends you're seeing there? And are there concerns about budget cuts just due to lower revenue and lower state taxes? Chris Leahy : Hi, Matt. Yes, there are concerns. Certainly, we talked about that in the last call budget concerns. But again, we are finding that in the state and local area. Budgets are being prioritized against IT initiatives, both work from home and also that various projects, government e-projects that are in flight. The hope and expectation is we will see in a stimulus package some sort of relief for state and local governments. And again, we hope that governments figure out where to get that. But they are struggling a bit now, but continuing to spend on the IT needs that's been prioritized and essential for their workforce and for their mission. Matt Sheerin : Okay, thanks. And relative to the healthcare space, which had been a market that turned around for you. I know last year you saw some positive trends, and obviously budget shifts there has impacted demand near-term. But in terms of conversations you're having with customers in that sector, do you still expect those investments towards digital transformation to still occur at some point? Chris Leahy : I do, Matt. Look, healthcare literally caused the global pandemic virus, and protected all of us and has been protecting all of us. But, they've been forced to see revenue generating businesses or at least diminish them. And I'm confident, given the demographic trends and changes that have already taken place regarding loosening regulations and accelerating digital transformation, that it will result in a strong recovery and long-term growth in the healthcare end market. And we are having extensive conversations with our healthcare systems around virtual care, across all spectrums. You've got telehealth and telemedicine, virtual rounding, you've got remote patient monitoring and then you've got enhanced patient monitoring in places like the ICU. And all of those require slightly different sorts of solutions. And we are building those out for some customers already. But I do see that as a long-term positive trend. Matt Sheerin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. In terms of the overall capital strategy right now in terms of M&A. How does M&A fall in terms of your priority of this thing? Are you seeing an opportunity for some add-ons that can perhaps benefit the future? Chris Leahy : Well, we just -- I'll start and Collin, you can jump in if you like. Yes, we just did an acquisition of IGNW, and that's made of cloud services provider. That's a great example of investing our capital behind our strategy of developing the solutions and services that our customers need now and in the future. So, we absolutely will continue to look at potential targets. And we're very active in inbounds, we're very active in outbound. And this organization IGNW like Aptris is a partner that CDW had worked with some time. So, we got to know them very well. We got to know the people and the quality and the culture and their capabilities. So, we will continue to look in the market for opportunistic acquisitions. Collin Kebo : Yes. In terms of prioritization, liquidity is our top priority, but we have $2 billion of it. So, we feel really good about where we are. The dividend is a priority. We just declared that. And again, given the cash flow generation capability of the business, feel good about that. We're below our target leverage, sitting at 2 times. So our next priority is M&A. And so, if we find the right opportunity at the right price, we'll take the opportunity to enhance our competitive position in this environment. Keith Housum : Great. I appreciate that. And then just turning over to the public sector, obviously, that's an area that usually declines in the fourth quarter. But my understanding, especially in the Chromebook area, there's a significant delay in [indiscernible] the market. Based on that combined with approach to going hybrid schooling that a lot of businesses are taking. Is there an expectation that public will actually have a good rest second-half of the year, including the fourth quarter? Collin Kebo : I mean, we're not going to -- in normal times, we wouldn't guide by channel, and certainly in the current environment, we're not going to. I think you can tell from our comments on the second quarter and writings and comments about where we think the mid-business is going to mix into the second-half of the year, that the demand is more resilient on the public side, particularly federal government education. You did call out Chromebooks. We are keeping an eye on that. Supply is tight there, given the extraordinary demand. And that's a little bit of a wild card that we've see in the third or fourth quarter. But given the breadth of our vendor partners and our scale, we think we'll be able to manage that as well as anyone. Not that there may not be disruption, but in terms of customers looking for supply, we think CDW can help them given our multi vendors. We're also having conversations with customers around alternative processors and things like that. So we're doing what we can to get creative, to get supply for our customers to help them through the Chromebook shortage. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have a question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Chung : Hi, this is Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just to drill in on your SMB segment. Can you kind of give us a sense for the overall health of these customers? Are you seeing more sales kind of postponed or cancelled? And are most customers kind of paying on time as well? And, any verticals or regions you want to call out that you're seeing a little bit more signs of life? Chris Leahy : Well, yes. Collin Kebo : Yes, I mean, in terms of writings, I think the commentary we provided on writings for small business gives you a good overview of the demand environment. Obviously, within that you have industries that are relatively stronger, and those are a little bit more challenged. And even within industries, you have some winners and losers. On the cash collections front, I would say we were generally pleased with the pace of cash collections from our commercial customers, including our small business customers. We do have a long tail of small customers that we're keeping an eye on that portion of the credit portfolio. But, overall, I would say the collections held up reasonably well in the quarter. Paul Chung : Thanks. And then just to follow-up on free cash. Very nice performance there kind of despite softer topline and higher CapEx levels. It looks like you had a bit of working cap benefit in the quarter. Can you just talk about the puts and takes on operating cash? And how we should think about trends heading into the second-half, even despite the tough macro? Also on CapEx levels, I assume that level comes down in the second-half? Thank you. Collin Kebo : Yes. In terms of working capital, I think one of the dynamics you would expect to see is when the business shrinks that we would liquidate some working capital, and you did see that dynamic play out in the quarter. That was partially offset though, by seeing the cash conversion cycle tick up a bit. I think the other thing to keep in mind as you think about free cash flow, we did get some timing favorability in terms of cash taxes. We didn't make a payment in the second quarter and historically, it's one of our biggest quarterly payments, and that reversed a little bit. In terms of CapEx, you're right, it is a little bit heavier, front end loaded this year. You might recall that some of the Census devices that we procure for our device as a service offering or running through CapEx. With all of those devices out in the field, now we are virtually done with additional capital expenditures for the Census. So, those are some things to think about and the puts and takes of free cash flow and working capital. Paul Chung : Thank you so much. Collin Kebo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris Leahy. Chris Leahy : Okay. Thank you. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the many continued challenges due to COVID-19, and to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices and contributions being made by so many who are devoting themselves to serving others. I also want to recognize the remarkable dedication of our co-workers around the globe, and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. They continuously impressed me, and reaffirm my conviction that we will emerge stronger from this. Thank you. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and the opportunity to serve you during these times. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you everyone for joining. That now concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I may turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of third quarter results and drivers of performance. I'll provide our perspectives on the current macro environment, its impact on our customer end market and how we are responding. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We'll move quickly through the prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.  For the third quarter net sales were $4.8 billion, 3.1% below last year and down 3.3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $386 million, an increase of 1.5%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.83, 8% above last year on a reported basis and up 7.7% in constant currency. The quarter demonstrated the balance and strength of CDW's business model. The diversity of our customer end markets served as well. For our most impacted customer end market the rate of decline stabilized and generally improved in the quarter. Trends for a more resilient customer end markets continue to be strong. Our value proposition really resonated with customers this quarter. There was a flight to quality as customers start to de-risk projects in their technology investments. Our teams are trusted strategic partners to our customers. We compete on value and advice, not on the price. We helped customers this quarter across a spectrum of IP priorities. Customers were focused on remote enablement, optimization, cost reduction, security, and leveraging technology for better customer and employee engagement through digital transformation, with an increasing focus on cloud. Customer demand for software-as-a-service increased almost 50% quarter-over-quarter. Customers leveraged our cloud solutions capabilities further bolstered by our acquisition of IGNW at the beginning of the quarter. Our solutions business strengthened this quarter as some customers resumed projects that had been put on hold earlier in the year and others started new projects.  During the third quarter, we continue to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. We successfully secured supply in high demand categories and managed to longer lead times for others. Now let's take a deeper look at the customer end market performance. Corporate declined 13%, markedly better than May and June. Solutions strengthened increasing low single digits year-over-year. The significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in solutions reflected customers restarting infrastructure and project engagement. Transactional projects were down double digit as spending on remote enablement moderated. Small Business also declined 13%, a considerable improvement versus the second quarter. Most product categories declined less this quarter as small business customers remained focused on remote enablement, security, cost management, and optimization.  The government team increased net sales high single digit. Federal delivered another strong quarter with net sales up mid-single digits. During the quarter our device-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau contributed less incremental growth than other quarters since the majority of last year's revenue was recognized in the third quarter. We are in the final phase of the project. Data collection has ended and devices are returning to us for decommissioning. Our team has done an excellent job navigating the complexity of this program from the very start. Outside of the census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies to promote enablement and device refresh. Some Department of Defense solution projects got pushed to future quarters dampening performance. The state and local team deliver high single-digit growth. IT investments continue to be a priority for public safety. In some cases budget was reallocated to support technology initiatives. Our team helps customers enable remote capabilities, enhanced security and optimize technology assets. Education increased over 30% with excellent growth in both K-12 and Higher Ed. In K-12, customers continue to focus on equity and access for students. K-12 growth is driven by strong notebook results and related accessories, security and software as well as cloud solutions to support remote learning. Higher ed performance strengthen this quarter as schools turned to us to leverage our extensive logistics capability to optimize technology to teach in new formats. Healthcare declined about 25% as budget pressures continued to impact spending. Customers are spending where they have to in areas like security and software. Otherwise, projects are still on hold during this quarter.  Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, decreased 8% on a reported basis. U.K. net sales declined high single digits in constant currency. U.K. corporate and public channels declined as government support programs ramped down during the quarter. Canada net sales decreased low double digits in constant currency, an improvement compared to second quarter performance and some corporate projects came off hold and education remains strong driven by remote learning needs. As you can see, our third quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base. It also benefited from our deep and broad product portfolio. We were able to meet the varied and shifting demands of our customers. U.S. hardware was downloading the single digits, the client devices declining 2% due to desktop performance. [Indiscernible] is still strong driven by our public sector. Software increased low single digits and software gross profit increased strong double digits reflecting the impact of mixing into software as a service. Services grew high single digits driven by strong professional services. Transactions were down slightly on top of last year's mid-teensgrowth. Solutions declined low single digit, a significant improvement from last quarter's double digit decline as some customers restarted infrastructure and larger project engagement. We again delivered strong growth in our Cloud practice. Cloud customers spend increased double digits across all customer end markets driven by robust growth in security, collaboration, infrastructure as a service, and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue with.  Security also continues to be a top priority for customers. Security customers spend grew strong double digits this quarter as customers improve their security frameworks to respond to the increasing threats. Our third quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio customer end market, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. There are important drivers of our past and future performance. Let me review each.  As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels; corporate, small business, government, education and healthcare. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets including federal governments, state and local governments, K-12 and higher education, providing a deep industry knowledge and insights into our customers' objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our U.K. and Canadian operation. The diversity of our customer end market serve us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Next, our offerings are broad and deep. With over 100,000 products, services and solutions from more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well-positioned to meet our customers total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I shared, the balance of our customer end markets in our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment.  And the final driver of our performance our three-part strategy for growth which is first to acquire new customers and capture share, second, to enhance our solutions capabilities. And third, to expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deploy and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Today's environment strengthens our commitment to executing our strategy so we will emerge stronger than ever after this crisis.  Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers this quarter. Our K-12 team was extraordinarily busy this quarter. One reason was the award of a contract from the Mississippi Department of Education to support its Equity in Distance Learning program. This is one of the largest education technology initiatives in the United States in the last decade, funded via the CARES Act. It will help close the technology gap and support all public school districts in the state by providing students and teachers with secure devices and accessories backed by our services. The team leveraged our logistical excellence, our broad services capabilities and our strong vendor partner relationship to procure and deploy the devices in a supply-constrained environment, all done within a very compressed time frame given the urgency. This is a great example of how our teams align with their customers' missions and deliver creative solutions and differentiated value. Digital transformation in particular cloud adoption and integration is a top priority for many of our customers. Cloud creates complexity, especially if customers integrate their infrastructure balancing applications on-prem and in the cloud. Our team worked with a large retailer to develop its future state business strategy for its on-premise and cloud platform to operate as one. This is a great example of where our services and products and solutions portfolio combined for the best outcome for our customers. It also demonstrates the value IGNW brings to CDW and how we are leveraging its cloud native service expertise. Another customer in our corporate channel had a problem with this incumbent primary IT partner, which was exacerbated due to the pandemic. The IT director urgently turned to the CDW account manager to help with the company's employees to work from home when the other partner failed to deliver. The account manager responded quickly and exceeded expectations, which has since resulted in the customer moving all of its IT business to CDW. Our team has also helped the customer to develop a strong collaboration platform and is helping with a variety of initiatives including lowering IT costs, increasing flexibility of its on-premise backup storage, evaluating cloud options, shoring up its security, and augmenting its IT staff and CDW resources. Our work here represents another example of how customers turn to us for a high level of customer service, expertise across the full IT lifecycle and thought leadership.  These examples highlight CDW's three-part strategy for growth and how IT is crucial to achieving our customer's objectives. This quarter demonstrated the importance of our competitive advantages, the success of past investments in cloud and security and our trusted partner relationships with customers. I'm proud of the way our teams continues to execute and deliver. Let me now update you on our efforts to manage COVID-19's impact on our business. We remain focused on three key principles, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers, serve the mission driven needs of our customers, and support our communities. Our office coworkers are still working from home and the team is settled well into the new way of working. We expect most coworkers will be working from home until the start of next summer. Coworker engagement, productivity and collaboration are strong testament to the strength and resiliency of our culture. We are planning for when and how to return to the office and where and how our coworkers will work in the future. We will remain agile in this unpredictable environment. All distribution and configuration centers are operational and we maintain precautionary measures as advised by public health authorities. These teams have done an exceptional job maintaining a high level of customer service we are known for while taking the necessary precautions. Let's now turn to the fourth quarter. The macroeconomic outlook for the near term and for the foreseeable future remains uncertain. Wildcards include the duration and severity of COVID-19, tomorrow's U.S. elections, additional stimulus programs, supply disruptions and UK-EU trade negotiations. Therefore, we are not providing 2020 target. Q4 to-date writings trends for our corporate channel are in line with Q3. Writings trends have improved for our small business channel.  Public strength continues to be driven by education and governance offset by healthcare. We are encouraged about our performance and how our teams are executing. That said, we are also cautious about the macro environment. There are a lot of unknowns and factors that we do not control. This is just the time of unprecedented uncertainty.  Our customers continue to be in various phases of responding to the macro environment. Some customers remain focused on remote enablement and operational continuity. Others are moving forward with organizational efficiency and optimization. And other customers are investing behind digital transformation including cloud. It's important to remember that cloud is not an endpoint. Cloud is the element of our customers IT environment and it adds complexity which is a core to our value proposition. Our teams help our customers with a full IT solution stack and full IT lifecycle. We will continue to be trusted partners to help our customers smartly deploy their IT resources, adopt modern software and infrastructure patterns and practices, and solve some of their toughest challenges. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years to come. We have confidence that we have the right strategy in place. The increase to our dividend and restarting of our share buybacks that we announced today demonstrate the confidence that our board of directors and I have CDW's strategy and future performance. The investments we have made including investments to support our cloud and security practices will enable us to continue to meet our customers' needs. We will help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape and adopt new technologies. While there is uncertainty in the near term, we believe we are making the right moves for long-term success. We are committed to investing in our three-part growth strategy including the capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity, and enhance our competitive position. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best. Leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and now execute our competition. Now, Colin will share more details on our financial performance. Colin? Collin Kebo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our third quarter results, liquidity position and capital allocation priorities. Turning to our third quarter P&L on slide 9, consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion down 3.1% on a reported and average daily sales basis. In constant currency, consolidated net sales declined by 3.3%. On an average daily sales basis, Sequential Sales increased 8.9% versus the second quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality primarily due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on second quarter results. Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand and writings commentary shared on our last earnings call. Pockets of supply dislocation continued in the quarter, and we leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure the IT products and solutions. Our customers needed for remote enablement, operations continuity and resource optimization. Gross profit for the quarter was $826 million, an increase of 1.1%. Gross margin was 17.4%, up 80 basis points over last year. The better than expected gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues primarily software as a service, which more than offset mixing into public. Turning to SG&A on Slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A increased 0.7%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs from the acquisitions of Aptris and IGNW and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline co-workers partially offset by continued savings, measures including decreased travel and entertainment and hiring restrictions. In September to ensure the alignment of our cost structure and resources to best position CDW for future growth, we've reduced our workforce by approximately 2%. Our realignment measures enable us to continue to evolve with customers' most important priorities ensuring capacity in high demand areas to support future growth and to continue investing in the business to emerge stronger from the crisis. We recorded a charge of $8.5 million which you can see in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on Slide 10. Co-worker count at the end of the quarter was 9,980 down 68 from the second quarter reflecting the realignment measures and restrictions on hiring and backfills, partially offset by IGNW. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 137, primarily driven by the Aptris and IGNW acquisitions. GAAP operating income was $380 million, down 0.9%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $386 million, up 1.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.1%. Moving to Slide 11. Interest expense was $40 million, down 5.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate on the term loan. 2020: To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation, which is shown on Slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%, down 250 basis points versus last year's rate. The rate decrease is primarily related to a one time impact of state tax refunds and reduced global intangible low tax income and non-deductible expenses due to recent IRS regulations. As you can see on Slide 14, with third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.33, down 2.6%. Our non-GAAP net income was $265 million in the quarter, up 6.2% compared to last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.83, up 8% from last year. Turning to year-to-date results on Slides 15 through 20, revenue was $13.5 billion, an increase of 0.1% on a reported basis and down 0.4% on an average daily sales basis, as we got one extra selling day in the first quarter of 2020. The extra selling day will reverse in Q4 when we have one fewer selling day compared to prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, year-to-date consolidated net sales were down 0.3% from prior year. Gross profit was $2.3 billion, up 3% and gross profit margin was 17.2%, up 40 basis points. Operating income was $847 million and non-GAAP operating income was $1 billion, up 0.2%. Net income was $550 million and non-GAAP net income was $691 million, up 2.6%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $4.77, up 5.2%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 21. As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $1.25 billion and net debt was $2.7 billion. Liquidity continues to be strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $837 million, as shown on Slide 22. This is higher than normal seasonality and above last year's $590 million, primarily due to higher cash profit and lower investment in working capital this year. A portion of the better than normal seasonality is working capital timing that we expect to reverse over the next few quarters. Moving to Slide 23. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down one day from last year's third quarter. While cash collections were solid in the quarter, DSO increased five days driven by the strength of netted down items such as software-as-a-service, mixing into some larger public customers who can take longer to pay and certain commercial customers extending payments. DPO increased six days driven by the strengthen in netted down items and mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. In the quarter, we returned $54 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and did not repurchase any stock. Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 24, as Chris noted, we announced earlier today that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share to be paid on December 10 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 25. This represents 5.3% increase over the current dividend. We also announced that we will be resuming share repurchases this quarter. The dividend and share repurchase actions reflect our strong liquidity position, net leverage below the target range and the free cash flow generation capability of the business. The decision to return capital to shareholders, that's consistent with our capital allocation priorities, which are, first, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. The annual dividend of $1.60 is approximately 25% of trailing 12 month non-GAAP net income through September. The Q4 2020 dividend marks the seventh consecutive year of increases with since our initial public offering in 2013 with the dividend growing at a compound annual growth rate of 38 percent from its initial level. We will continue targeting a 25% payoff ratio going forward growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 1.8 times below the low end of the range.  Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisition. We closed IGNW at the beginning of the third quarter and remained active in evaluating targets and will seek to be opportunistic in this environment. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating and cultural fit and financial return.  Fourth, as I previously mentioned, we are doing our share repurchase program. Going forward we expect to move closer to our target net leverage range to a combination of organic investments, M&A, and/or returning greater than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. As we always do, and particularly in this uncertain environment, we'll closely the macro-economic environment, our liquidity, working capital and leverage and adjust as needed.  Lastly, on the topic of capital, we intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We believe it's important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that will allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position.  We previously withdrew our 2020 targets and will not be providing an updated financial outlook. But consistent with the last three quarters, I wanted to provide insights into what we're seeing roughly one month into the fourth quarter from a demand, supply and operating perspective. On the demand side, activity continues to be mixed across customer end markets. In corporate, October writings declined in line with the level of Q3 writing declines. In small business, October writings improved from Q3 levels. And in public, October writings were up year-over-year driven by continued strength in education and government partially offset by declines in healthcare. While encouraging, as Chris mentioned, we believe it's premature to extrapolate October writings over the balance of the quarter given the wildcard, the COVID-19, the election, stimulus, and supply. We expect commercial customers to continue to be cautious. As I previously mentioned, we have one fewer selling day in the fourth quarter which adversely impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points.  On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a food environment with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. Notebook supplies particularly lower-end devices, such as Chromebooks are tight. Also, freight challenges may develop as we get closer to the holidays. On the operating front, all distribution centers continue to be operational. Finally, I want to provide an update on the device-as-a-service solution to the U.S. Census Bureau. The contribution to third quarter net sales was in line with expectations as we had deployed all of the devices into the field. The contribution to incremental growth was less than preceding quarters since the majority of last year's revenue was recognized in the third quarter. As Chris mentioned, data collection for the U.S. Census has ended and we're in the final phases of the project.  Devices are returning to us for decommissioning. From a financial perspective, this year, we now expect the census to contribute up to approximately 180 basis points of incremental net sales growth over 2019. On an absolute basis, we currently expect the census to contribute over 230 basis points of net sales in 2020. The collection and decommissioning timing remain fluid, so we could see some net sales shift into the first quarter of 2021.  That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Jaclyn to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tim Yang from Citi. Your line is open. Tim Yang : Hi, thanks for taking the question. In the past three years your Q4 gross margin was higher than Q3. What do you think about Q4 this year? I think your mix should be better on quarter-on-quarter basis given the recovery. So, your gross margin should be better sequentially. Is that -- like what do you think about the gross margin for Q4 this year? Collin Kebo : Good morning, Tim. Thanks for joining the call. We're not going to provide guidance on the Q4 outlook. I guess, what I would just share on your observation is that historically Q3 has been a seasonally high sales quarter driven by strength in education and government which tend to have lower gross margin. So, I think what's happening historically is coming off of that seasonally high quarter where we mix into government and education you come off of that into Q4 and that's why you would've seen the gross margin pick up historically. I think that given what's happening in the marketplace right now particularly in education, all bets are off on normal seasonality. So I would just offer the response. Tim Yang : Got you. And then regarding your Q4 corporate and SMB writing commentaries, I think you mentioned a decline seeing with your last quarter and the last quarter, I think that the decline was roughly leaping down -- you think year-to-year basis. You obviously -- merchant companies mentioned that projects are coming back. I was wondering, like, why you're not seeing that increments in U.S. SMB and corporate business. Is that more just conservatives -- conservatism or it's just like you're -- your visibility is not quite improving compared to last quarter? Thanks. Chris Leahy : Hi Tim, it's Chris. Good morning. And, yeah, I don't think that we saw a nice increase in our solutions project based business. We have mentioned in the last call that customers had continued to pause on moving forward. They were in planning stages. We did see more customers both in our corporate space and small business space start to move forward on infrastructure projects, for example, in larger projects. I would say, you know, on the corporate side there's still caution and they're not quite as nimble as the small business organizations generally have a lot more kind of bureaucracy and approval to get through. So that seems to be going a little slower but certainly we're seeing some pick up in both of those segments. Operator  Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani for Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess, I have two as well. Just firstly, just clarify the writing discussion. I think what you guys characterize this as from the corporate side things are about stable or they are about what they were in the June -- in the September quarter so far. And in SMB started to improve the pace of decline has tried to ease up. I'm wanting to make sure I got that right. And then any sense on how transactional versus solutions is trending from a writings basis so far? Chris Leahy : Amit, it's Chris. Yes, you read that right. You got that exactly right on the writings the way we described it. But we're not spreading out writings for solutions versus transaction. Amit Daryanani : Got it. I guess, maybe I would ask you a different one then. If you could talk about what percent of your gross profit dollars today in the September quarter are agency based or weaker in nature and as you do longer term it would be really helpful to understand, what is the growth side look like for that gross profit dollar bucket versus the overall company? And then what are the components within this agency and recurring revenue stream that you have? Collin Kebo : Good morning, Amit. Yeah, netted down items were approximately 30% of total growth profit dollars in the quarter which is when the higher numbers we've seen and that mainly reflects the strong mix into cloud specifically software-as-a-service that both Chris and I talked about in our prepared comments. Included in that bucket is cloud security software and other software offerings that net down warranties, those would be the primary things that you would see in that bucket. In terms of, you know, how that trends over time I think, you know, we would expect customers to continue moving into cloud and to -- you know, we expect strong demand for security software. So I think we would expect solid growth in that bucket. I think the wild card again in terms of where it goes and what happens to the hardware part of the business. Obviously, that's been a little bit more challenged in the COVID environment. In the preceding three years, it was very strong. So, I think exactly where that mix goes is probably more a function of how hardware gross profit trends over the next couple of quarters and years. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks. Good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start on the decision to resume share repurchases and how we should read into that. You still have over 2 billion in liquidity. You're low below your optimal leverage levels and, you know, previous discussions before COVID you were not precluding yourself from a larger sized acquisition, $1 billion plus type of an acquisition. So, I guess, the question would be, wondering if you could maybe share your latest stocks on M&A landscape and how that's evolved? Chris Leahy : Yeah. Sure, Adam. Well, you know the decision to restart our buybacks is a real reflection on both our confidence in our strategy and performance of U.S. going forward in addition, obviously to our strong free cash flow and liquidity position. On M&A in particular, I'll repeat what I've said over the last few quarters, we are actively looking to invest prudently to supplement high growth technology areas. You've seen us do a couple of acquisitions recently, in service now capabilities and cloud native capabilities, both of which has been taken up -- had been taken up very well by our sales organization, and really solidifying our advisor position with our customers. Those are the types of acquisitions we'll continue to look at and do look at. I would tell you, Adam, that there -- that the market itself feels a little [indiscernible]. Organizations are out, open to discussion now more than I'd say they were a couple months ago, but as you know our lenses. We look for those that fit our capabilities, our strategic capabilities, our culture, and operating model, and then ultimately makes financial sense. Adam Tindle : Okay. That's helpful to me. Maybe just as a follow up, I wanted to ask on some aspects, I think, if I have it right, you previously talked about letting attrition run its course. Looks like demand is, kind of, turning the corner a little bit, EBITDA margin was very healthy in the quarter. So I just wanted some more color on why reduce the workforce. I know, it's not a significant number in and of itself, but a little bit unusual for CDW to do that, so maybe more color did expectations for future growth change. What -- why would you ever take that? Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah. Adam, it's a great question. And you're right. Those are hard decisions for CDW in particular. It's just the second time in our history that we've produced the workforce, and reduced it by -- that by 2%. But really, this is all about ensuring alignment of our cost structure and resources to best position us for the future. So we really need to ensure we've got the resources to continue to evolve with customers in their most important priorities. We wanted to make sure that there's capacity in the high demand areas to support the future growth and continue investing in those more emerging areas. So while we have cutbacks some positions, we also are hiring in those areas that we think are critical to our future growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Cabral from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matt Cabral : Chris, you mentioned a lot of moving pieces out there from a macro standpoint in prepared remarks and clearly spent a year that's below trend from an IT spending point of view. I guess, just thinking about looking forward curious if you think customers are sitting now at this point with a meaningful amount of pent-up demand as we head into next year as to maybe help turn things around, or if there's a risk of this more sluggish demand environment continues as we start getting into the next year? Chris Leahy : Yeah. Good morning, Matt. I think is it possible to have both, I would say yes to both. Why do I say that? Because, I think, until this medical problem is resolved, it's going to have -- it'd be very difficult to have a closer trajectory of the economic environment and that has an impact obviously on uncertainty and actions that our customers are taking. So it's just murky, and that murkiness makes it very difficult to project. I certainly think that we have two things. We have pent up demand and we have customers who are frankly pressing advance, if you will, buying technology and implementing technology at a higher pace to press their advantage.  But as far as pent-up demand, I think, the real question becomes when our customer is feeling -- when are they feeling comfortable enough to make larger investments and I just think that's incredibly difficult to predict. What we're doing is staying closer to customers, if you've heard us talk about the complete spectrum of IT that we're providing and we're just making sure that they get what they need, when they need it better than anyone else in the industry can do it. But it's hard for me to predict the future, given the murky nature of this current outlook. Matt Cabral : And then looking by vertical education was clearly the standout in the quarter. Why don't talk a little bit more about just what you're seeing there and how sustainable you think those headwinds are just particularly relative to the ability to actually get enough supply to meet demand going forward? Chris Leahy : -- : Operator : Your next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to ask a high level question first. As we see new restrictions and lockdown measures in Europe, can you just give us your thoughts on that? And also, how many -- what percent of your workforce is now working from home? And do you think CDW is in a better position to handle if there's a resurgence in COVID and lockdowns? Chris Leahy : Good morning, Ruplu. Thank you. Good to hear from you. Yeah, I think that we have to be cautious in all the locations where we start to see more restrictions and lockdown. And for a couple of reasons and for a couple of segments, I think, in the U.K., as you know, we have some government stimulus money that is rolling off and that is tending to have an impact that we're seeing. Add to that lockdowns and the economic commercial impact that has, we do worry about that. That said, we still have customers, as I said before, who are digitally advanced and really pressing their advantage and absolutely moving forward with some larger projects. Across the U.S., I would also say that cautiously if you look over the last week or so and the trajectory an uptick in cases is worrisome as different states potentially are moving backwards in their restrictions and lockdown. So look, as I said, I'm so encouraged by the team and the execution and the performance of this team. But I'm highly cautious about the excess exogenous factors that we can impact.  As far as work from home, look, the team settled in. This is a performance-oriented organization and they -- everybody went home, we got ourselves set up and we're off to the races. I think our co-worker services and sales leadership a huge kudos for figuring out very quickly creatively to drive productivity, connectivity, and human touch both across our sales organizations and with our customers. And they've been doing just great. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Great. Thanks for that. And appreciate all the color there. Chris, I wanted to ask you also on the device-as-a-service project, now that the census project is coming to an end. What's the plan for those devices and can you reuse them in some other program? And how do you see the device-as-a-service business going over the next couple of years? Thank you. Collin Kebo : Good morning, Ruplu. I'm going to take that one. Yeah, so we are winding up the device-as-a-service offering to the census, those devices are coming back to CDW for decommissioning. And what we will do then is turn around and resell those to our remarketer and we have plans in place to go ahead and execute against that.  In terms of devices and services and offering, I think that will continue to be an opportunity for CDW. Clearly, we have competitive advantages in our ability to bundle integrated solutions across multiple vendors, integrating services, as well as our logistics capabilities. And I think what we're doing for the State of Mississippi Department of Education is just another flavor of our ability to deliver that value to customers. And in a world where being able to work productively, remotely from anywhere is becoming increasingly important, I think that's going to be an important part of our growth drivers going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much and good morning. I'm wondering about the customer demand for SaaS. And specifically -- or actually just netted down revenue in general, how much of this revenue is coming from sort of application versus utilization of the cloud for data storage and processing? I'm just trying to figure out where our customers are in their cloud progression, and then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah, Shannon, I guess, let me start where customers are in their cloud progression and I would say that it's a full spectrum. We don\u2019t break all applications versus consumption usage in those numbers. But I would just tell you that we have customers that are across the full spectrum. Small customers fully on cloud, high consumption, medium and large customers who are dealing with heavily cloud-oriented applications but on-prem legacy obligations such as on working the cloud and we're working this in terms of modernizing their data center infrastructure to create one cloud environment, if you will, between their public on-prem private and on-prem legacy work. So it's really hard I think to say where customers stand because they're on quite a spectrum but what I can say is they are all moving to some form of cloud environment. And when I say cloud environment, I don\u2019t mean landing in the cloud because, you know, the cloud is not a place. It's more an operating system. It's a pattern, not a place and it delivers an experience, not a destination. So what we see ourselves involved in is the planning and design accelerated by this accelerated digital environment to determine what that cloud environment works for a customer taking into consideration not just the benefits of a cloud-like environment that agility, susceptibility, scalability but also the cost issues and the legacy technology that they have to deal with. So I'm sorry that's a long-winded answer but we're selling the spectrum. We're helping customers with the spectrum and our comprehensive suite of capabilities allows us to do that wherever a customer is on their cloud journey. Shannon Cross : Okay. Thank you. And then maybe on a segment basis, can you talk about where customers are versus, like, new projects versus continuing to work remote enablement and continuity. I know you mentioned with education, you think it's going to kind of wind up by the end of this year and then or at least hopefully get -- you know, be done pretty much by then. But SMB and maybe enterprise, are you seeing customers still really focused on just making sure their employees have end devices and connectivity or do you feel like that\u2019s kind of done and now people are moving back to, I don't know, prior investments or new opportunities? Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah, Shannon, it's a mix across segments. If you look at corporate, for example, we had seen the work-from-home moderated a bit and what I mean by that is the -- you know, the notebook devices and the rush to get everybody working from home. I suspect in that segment, for example, we're going to have to see what work in the future looks like and when and how customers start going back to the office and then they make their decisions, you would expect to take off then in terms of things that help optimize either to work from home or the work in the office now or the hybrid place that they land. But it has moderated a bit in the corporate space.  Small business, we continue to see strength in work from home. Now, that could be in some part because small business were a little later to get there than maybe the larger businesses. And so it's really, it's really different across segments. Healthcare really rushed to the front end, they were obviously a high priority from an allocation perspective for us and others. And so that's moderated in the healthcare space as well. So we're really seeing education, K through 12, higher ed, as the primary drivers of continuing work from home, as well as federal. I would say that the government space as well as been continuing to be fairly robust in work from home support. Operator : Your next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Katy Huberty : Colin, as we think about the census project wrapping up over the next quarter and one less selling day, is it possible that the revenue declines doesn't improve in the fourth quarter or do the improved SMB writings create a tailwind that we continue to see a lesser decline trajectory like what you use on the third quarter Collin Kebo : Yeah, Katy, we're not going to give a specific guide on fourth quarter sales. So what I would say is we do have one fewer day, we report sales on an average daily sales basis. So that would normalize for that. The 200 basis points is really a comment about the impact it has on the bottom half of the P&L, as we get a little bit of deleverage year-over-year.  As it relates to the census, I would expect the census to provide solid contribution to the fourth quarter; it is going to provide a benefit. Again, as we look at last year's overlap, most of it was in the third quarter. So it will contribute incrementally year-over-year. And then, I think, as it relates to the comments on writing, we are back to the wild cards and I think particularly on the commercial side of the business, how those customers choose to react to the election, and what impact the virus and potential additional shutdowns has on their spending plans as we come into the end of the year. Katy Huberty : Okay. Thank you. And then just on third quarter margins, you mentioned that product margins were better in the quarter, in addition to the mix shift in netted down revenue. Can you just talk about what drove the better product margins? Is that a mix shift away from client and starting to see some growth again in some of the infrastructure areas like servers and computers? Collin Kebo : Yeah. Katy, I would say it was a combination of things. There was some mix within products, so, for example, desktops were pretty soft as notebook has become the form factor of choice, desktops tend to have low margin. So that helped the product margin a little bit. But I would say that this pandemic and economic shock is a little bit unique compared to other recessions or slowdowns that we've been through. I think one thing that's different is you have supply-demand imbalance occurring at the same time. And so that supply imbalance, I think, has provided a bit of cushion on the margin.  And then I think that the second thing that's unique is just how important technology is to being a part of the solution here and customers focus on getting things done with partners they trust, and that can manifest itself in speed, level of service, logistics capabilities, but I think what we're seeing is customers just want it done, they want it done quickly, and they want it done right. And maybe we're not going to go through another round of bids through the procurement department or whatever it is, and that that has played into, I think, some of the product margin durability that we saw in what you might think would be a period of compassion on the on the product margin. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Matthew Sheerin : Chris, in your commentary, you mentioned some customer engagements including some new customer wins due to your capabilities. Can you just talk about that competitive environment? Are you seeing the acceleration of new customer wins due to that, and due to the fact that customers need more help? Chris Leahy : Yes. Good morning, Matt. You know, I won't repeat everything that Collin just said, but when I think about what customers feel today, technology is more critical, technology is more complex, and they need a comprehensive solutions to the issues they're trying to solve. And so with a valued trusted partner like CDW, they're more inclined to start leaning into CDW versus, for example, local vendors. So what we're seeing out there as well as a competitive environment, certainly from a pricing perspective, the value that CDW brings to their -- to customers would become more important. I mentioned their de-risking their investments. They want to ensure that they are getting the full suite -- comprehensive suite of advice, because of the complexity of choice that they're facing, and the stakes are high that they get technology right and get it to work for them. So the value that CDW brings is resonating very well in this environment. We are seeing new customers and winning new customers and growing those customers frankly, pretty quickly. And we're also seeing vendor move -- a quicker move to vendor consolidation, that's always been a value is brought to customers but it's -- that's ticked up significantly in the environment that we're in across all of our segments, frankly. Matthew Sheerin : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I just wanted to ask again on the client devices, particularly on the commercial side where you talked about it being down. You did have some commentary about trends you're seeing. But I just wanted to see if you're seeing basically that upgrade cycle we saw last year and obviously crept into this year due to work from home. Are you just seeing signs that that's sort of ending and you're going to be faced -- facing some tough year-over-your comps in next couple of quarters on the client device side? Chris Leahy : Yeah. Matt, what I'd say is, look, we get -- when we were coming into this year, we thought we were in the late innings of client device, refreshing growth is moderating. Now what picked it up early this year, work from home, obviously, learned from home, we're seeing new cases in the digital world, think of retail organizations, et cetera. And certainly, we might start to see some more pickup and refresh from the 2017 period. But yes, you're right, the overlaps that we're facing from the growth of last year and that pull forward at the beginning of this year and the education et cetera, as I said. And then you layer on that just the economic environment employment, it's hard to say what to expect going into next year.  That said, work from home does have a lot of requirements to make it work effectively. So we continue to help customers even in the mid large space with their security needs, for example, with their collaboration needs, with their productivity suites that they're working through. So even if we don't see notebooks as robust right now, it's the whole solution, work from solution, including the accessories and the services and the collaboration, et cetera. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. Hey, I want to explore the supply constraints challenges in the quarter. I think it's well-known one of the challenges getting the Chromebooks in the door. But pressing for rather the commentary, did you see that's easing at all during the end of the quarter? And then are there other areas of this analogy is that you see having also some supply constraints that can help out in the fourth quarter? Collin Kebo : Good morning, Keith. Yeah, I think the constraints within Chromebooks are well-documented. I don't know that I would say it eased as we exited the quarter, I think it's going to be tight for a while here. Now, obviously, our scale and the fact that we work with multiple OEMs will hopefully help us manage through that and get at least our fair share, as Chris has talked about earlier.  In terms of notebooks in general, I would say again, high demand. And we're just seeing longer lead times than normal. We are hearing about component shortages for things that go into Chromebooks and Notebooks, things like panels.  In terms of other parts of the market, I would say on the solution side of the business the supply environment is maybe a little bit better than it was a quarter or two ago. In other areas where we see pockets of dislocation or delays with the other remote, more mission critical categories, like collaboration, hardware, headsets and webcams. Keith Housum : Got you. Is it possible to quantify what the supply shortage is perhaps costing business in third quarter? Collin Kebo : Boy, it would be really difficult to put a number on that. I mean, I could say our backlog is up meaningfully in the Notebook category over where it's running -- where it's run historically. Operator : And your last question comes from Paul Coster from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering, Chris, if you could just elaborate a little bit on the uncertainty you're seeing. I think we all understand the weather and when part of it, but I'm wondering that how is this part of the uncertainty as well, given that COVID seems to have been an accelerant, as you've described, of change in digitalization, in particular, how many of your customers just feel unsure of what to invest in, given the change to their processes and sort of infrastructure paradigm? Chris Leahy : Yeah. That's a great question. I think here's how I would answer it. Their -- projects that many customers had into, they're rethinking what those little like now, infrastructure projects, for example, in particular. The good news is we've got that capability to sit down and work through that design with them. And in last quarter's earnings call, I mentioned that that had ticked up. We thought we were starting to sit down and help customers design for a new world. Every customer understands the criticality of technology and the need to get it right and how different it is today than it was literally just 12 months ago, the acceleration of digital, not a new trend, but an acceleration. So we see that as an opportunity to help our customers get the other side of this stronger than ever. leaner: Paul Coster : Got you, and one quick follow up for Collin. The -- can you, sort of, quantify the revenue headwind associated with the netting down effects of the cloud revenue with the cloud contracts? Collin Kebo : Yeah. I mean, Paul, what I would say is we have historically seen netted down items growing faster than full revenue items. So in normal periods of time, I would say that impact has 200 basis points impact, so a little bit more than that, given the acceleration of it. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Christine Leahy, CEO. Please go ahead. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Jaclyn. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the continued challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to recognize the remarkable dedication of all of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all of our CDW stakeholders. They continuously impress me and reaffirmed my conviction that we will emerge stronger from this. Thank you. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of fourth quarter and full-year results and drivers of performance and share some thoughts on 2021. Collin will take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $5 billion, 11% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of one fewer business day in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019 and up 10.7% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 13.3% to $881 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $376 million, an increase of 9.9%. Our non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, 16.1% above last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant currency. For the year, net sales were $18.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion year-over-year or 2.4% on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross profit increased 5.6% to $3.2 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 2.6% to $1.4 billion and non-GAAP net income per share increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis to $6.59. 2020 was an extraordinary year. I am very proud of how the CDW team quickly and smartly adapted to help our customers and partners during a challenging time. The diversity of our solutions portfolio and customer end markets served us well in 2020, providing balance and driving our exceptional results. During the year, our team helped customers across the full IT solution stack in the full IT life cycle from client devices to cloud from design to managed services. We executed against our strategy and continued to invest in high growth solutions and services capabilities, including three acquisitions, IGNW, a leading provider of cloud-native service expertise and software development capabilities, and - excuse me, and Southern Dakota Solutions, which expanded our ServiceNow team. Performance for our customer end markets varied. Demand increased in some and decreased in others, but all experienced change or disruption to their technology needs and to their operations last year due to COVID-19. Our value proposition resonated with customers. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and logistical and distribution capabilities to deliver the best outcomes for our customers. This led to meaningful outperformance compared to the US IT market. We emerged from 2020 stronger and even more committed to executing our strategy. Turning to the fourth quarter. We continue to help customers with remote enablement and resource optimization, cost reduction, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. Similar to the third quarter, some customers resumed solutions projects and others started new projects. Performance for our most impacted customer end markets improved, and trends for our more resilient customer end markets remained strong. During the fourth quarter, we continued to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges and support our customers, in particular, for Chromebooks for K-12 customers where demand greatly outstrip supply. Now let's take a deeper look at fourth quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 11% with similar levels of performance for transactions and solutions. In total, there was improvement versus the last two quarters. Customer spend for corporate customers is not uniform. Some customers were doing well and investing in technology, whereas other customers, those who are in challenged industries or geographies who were impacted by spikes and COVID cases were still cautious. Small Business declined mid-single digits, as notebooks returned to growth. Small Business customers tend to be more nimble than corporate customers, which drove the improvement versus the third quarter. The Government team increased net sales 30%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up strong double-digits. During the quarter, our Device as a Service solution for the US Census Bureau was mostly completed. All devices were returned to us for decommissioning, and we started the process to resell the clean units through third-party re-marketers. Our team did an excellent job with this program. It was a multi-year effort to develop and execute this large complex undertaking, moving the nation's once-a-decade population count from paper to digital for the first time. Our services and logistical capabilities and multi-vendor solutions set us apart from the competition. We are unique in what we can deliver to our customers. Outside of the Census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies with remote enablement and device refresh. We also delivered on Department of Defense projects that were awarded at the end of the third quarter. The state and local team delivered strong double-digit growth. IT investments continued to be a priority despite budget pressure. Our team helped customers enable remote capabilities and restart solution projects. Education increased in extraordinary 140%, driven by phenomenal growth in K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access and remote learning, which drove triple-digit growth for notebooks, related accessories and solutions, as customers turn to us for holistic capabilities. Higher education increased low double digits, as schools continued to help students with remote enablement and resumed net comp projects with a focus on creating connected communities to enhance the student experience. Healthcare declined mid-teens, a meaningful improvement compared to the third quarter. Customers continued to be cautious with their spend due to ongoing budget pressure, focusing on key areas like remote enablement, telehealth and support infrastructure. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations was flat on a reported basis. UK net sales increased mid-single digits in constant currency, and Canada net sales decreased low double digits in constant currency. Performance for both markets was driven by strong education demand to enable remote learning and health care spending to address the pandemic, with softer corporate performance. In the UK, there was some pull-in up customer demand before the announcement of the agreement with the EU, as customers prepared for a potential hard exit [ph] Over the last several weeks, the UK team has executed against its well-planned Brexit mitigation strategy and has done a great job helping customers navigate through the complexity of the new agreement. Our fourth quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers across all categories. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth, in particular for our public segment customers, leading to over 30% client device growth. While software was flat, software gross profit increased mid-teens, reflecting continued growth into Software-as-a-Service. Services grew low double digits, driven by device decommission services for the Census project and configuration services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. Transactions increased strong double digits. Solutions declined low single digits, as some customers continued to restore infrastructure and larger project engagement. The team delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in collaboration, infrastructure as a service, security and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue. Let me also share a little more color on our security practice, given its importance to our customers, as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double digits, as customers improved their security framework to respond to increasing threat. Last year, customers spent $2 billion with us on security. Our fourth quarter and full year operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy. They are important drivers of our path and our future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customer's total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I've shared, the balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in current environment. And the final driver of our performance, our three-part strategy for growth is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share, second, enhance our solutions capabilities, and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy and action and how we helped customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped the born-in-the-cloud financial technology company add more agility and flexibility to its operations and technology stack by becoming multi-cloud. The customer initially came to our team requesting help to implement a backup solution for its existing public cloud provider. After a review by our Digital Velocity team, our team uncovered the need for the customer to become multi-cloud with additional capabilities and redundancies. Our team helped the customer build a secure second public cloud environment and address additional needs, including application development, functionality and consumption management. Our team has established CDW as a trusted partner with expensive cloud capabilities to help with research, evaluation, procurement, implementation and management. Our customers are increasingly adopting cloud but are also finding a growing need to become multi-cloud. CDW's cloud expertise and cloud management platform across the multi public clouds are a differentiator in the marketplace. Let me share another story in health care sector. To address COVID, health care customers have turned to CDW to provide care in new settings and in new ways. An independent non-profit health care provider in the US Northeast needed our guidance to enable remote COVID testing and vaccine distribution in numerous outdoor locations. The CDW account manager engaged one of our networking specialists to develop a solution that would deliver the required performance and scale quickly. The solution has since been rolled out to all locations and in next work with the customer on the site's wireless connectivity further leveraging our technical resources and strengthening their relationship. Our team saved the customer time and energy and provided great service as a forward-thinking partner that the customer can trust. The pandemic has created new issues requiring creative solutions and leading customers to rely on us more than ever as an extension of their team. This is the value that CDW brings to our customers. We pair our broad solutions portfolio with our deep technical expertise to deliver the full outcomes that customers need. Finally, the digital divide has created significant learning challenges around the world. Our teams have worked closely with education customers in the US, in the UK and in Canada to tackle this challenge. In the UK, we are working with the London Grid for Learning, a charitable trust dedicated to the advancement of education to provide technology for hundreds of schools across the country. Last quarter, our team developed and provisioned unique turnkey solutions comprised of client devices, accessories, software and services, leveraging our strong logistical and distribution capabilities and deep vendor relationships. There has been tight collaboration with our clients' vendor partner to provide the best possible device availability for the customer due to the current global Chromebook's buy constraint. Our distribution center in the UK has done a tremendous job to deliver over 100,000 units to date to hundreds of schools. CDW is uniquely positioned to deliver for our customers and our vendor partners. This is a great example of our critical role. These examples highlight CDW's three-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the success of investments in cloud, our strong relationships with customers and vendors and the importance of our competitive advantages. I am proud of the way our team continues to deliver. Let me briefly update you now on our COVID response efforts. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have followed three key principles : First, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers, second, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers, and third, support our communities. I'm proud of how the team has managed the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Teams at our distribution and configuration centers have done an outstanding job, maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while adhering to new protocols that safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers who come to work every day. We've also taken deliberate actions to foster collaboration and coworker engagement and to maintain connectivity and productivity to preserve and bolster our culture, even while we are distant. These actions include leveraging new tools and learning and development opportunities, expanded health and well-being programs, increased content from our business resource groups and compensation investment to recognize the team's tremendous efforts and performance. Now let me share some thoughts on 2021. The near-term global health and macroeconomic environment is still uncertain. Our current outlook is for the US IT market to return to growth and grow between 2.5% and 3%. As you know, we hold ourselves accountable for growing faster than the IT market, and we expect our topline in 2021 to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. There are many wildcards, though, including COVID-19 government restrictions and vaccine rollout; policies from the new administration, including stimulus programs and tax changes, and supply constraints, in particular, for Chromebooks. We are encouraged about our Q1 performance to date and how our teams are executing, but we are also cautious about the macro environment. Even though uncertainty continues, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Last year, we went through our rigorous strategic planning process, as we do every three years, and we are now accelerating investment and execution against it. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, to enhance our competitive position and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. This confidence has led our Board of Directors to increase our share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives; and of course, out-execute the competition. Now, Colin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin? Collin Kebo : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full year results, capital allocation priorities and initial thoughts on 2021. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on slide nine. Consolidated net sales were $5 billion, up 9.2% on a reported basis and 11% on an average daily sales basis as we had one less selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 7.6% versus the third quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality of a mid-single digit decline, primarily due to how COVID-19 is impacting our channels differently. During this uncertain time, seasonality has been and is expected to continue to be, different than historical experience. Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand writings commentary shared on our last earnings call other than K-12, where demand was even stronger than expected. Pockets of supply constraints continued in the quarter, primarily for lower end client devices such as Chromebooks. Our team did a great job navigating the fluid environment and leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure a healthy share of supply for customers. Gross profit for the quarter was $881 million, an increase of 13.3%. Gross margin was 17.8%, up 70 basis points over last year. The gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Turning to SG&A on slide 10. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 15.9%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs due to higher gross profit and compensation investments in our coworkers to recognize and reward their tremendous efforts and performance in 2020. The acquisition of IGNW, an ongoing investment in Aptris, and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline coworkers, partially offset by continued cost savings measures, including decreased travel and entertainment. Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,982, up two from the third quarter. Year-over-year, coworker count increased 86, driven by an increase of approximately 150 customer-facing coworkers, including IGNW, partially offset by a decrease in non-customer-facing coworker count. GAAP operating income was $332 million, up 17.1%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $376 million, up 9.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%. Moving to slide 11. Interest expense was $37 million, down 2.9%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from the August refinancing. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 12 was 19.2%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $57 million compared to $50 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2%, down 150 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with new regulations for global intangible low tax income and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by lower tax credits. As you can see on slide 14, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.65, up 29.6%. Our non-GAAP net income was $264 million in the quarter, up 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, up 16.1% from last year. Turning to our full year results on slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $18.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. Gross profit was $3.2 billion, up 5.6%. Gross profit margin was 17.4%, up 50 basis points, driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to put 2020 sales and gross profit in context. We have consistently highlighted the power of our diverse portfolio and customer end markets. We pivot to where the growth is, leveraging our competitive advantages to better serve customers and gain share. In 2020, we estimate the US IT market declined low single digits, call it down 2%. CDW net sales grew 440 basis points faster and gross profit grew 760 basis points faster than the 2% market decline. Census contributed 170 basis points of year-over-year net sales growth. Excluding the Census, CDW still delivered meaningful net sales and gross profit growth in excess of market. During the 2009 recession, our net sales premium narrowed as customers paused on hardware purchases, and gross profit margin compressed due to product margin pressure in the competitive environment. In 2020, our portfolio performed differently, partially because of the unique dynamics of the pandemic, but also because of the progress we've made building out the solution and services capabilities our customers value. For example, while US software and services collectively totaled 18% of US net sales in 2020, they accounted for approximately 40% of US gross profit. Returning to the full year P&L. Operating income was $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, up 2.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, down 120 basis points versus last year's rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to new regulations for global intangible low tax income and non-deductible expenses that are not expected to contribute as much of a benefit to the tax rate in 2021. Net income was $789 million and non-GAAP net income was $954 million, up 5.8%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $6.59, up 8%. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 21. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion, and net debt was $2.5 billion. Liquidity further strengthened with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.5 billion. Full year free cash flow was $1.2 billion, as shown on slide 22, this equates to 6.7% of sales, well above our historical free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25%. A portion of the outperformance was driven by timing or one-time items, including mixing into vendors with extended payment terms, the Census, deferred payroll and UK tax payments and the timing of collections from some large customers. We expect the favorable timing to reverse over the next few quarters. Moving to slide 23. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down one day from last year's fourth quarter. DSO and DIO were unchanged from last year, while DPO increased by one day. The increase in DPO was primarily driven by mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. As previously mentioned, we resumed our share buyback program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of stock. For full year 2020, we returned $561 million to shareholders, including $220 million of dividends and $341 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $129 per share. Turning to capital allocation priorities on slide 24. Given our strong liquidity position, our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times. We ended the year at 1.7 times. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we acquired two small ServiceNow solution practices to build on the success from our 2019 acquisition of Aptris. We remain active evaluating targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to move closer to our target net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. At the end of December, we had $338 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As Chris mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.25 billion increase to the share repurchase program in support of our capital allocation priorities. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on slide 25. The current environment continues to be highly uncertain, making it challenging to forecast expectations for IT market growth with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, we are providing a base case for 2021 IT market growth and how we expect CDW's business to perform in that environment. Our base case assumes US IT market growth between 2.5% to 3%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than market. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 50 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. In terms of performance by segment for the year, there continues to be uncertainty among customers across end markets, but here are some drivers to consider. On the commercial side of the business, Corporate and Small Business customers tend to respond quicker to the macroeconomic environment. We saw that last year, Q1 was the strongest quarter, then Q2 experienced the steepest decline with quarterly declines moderating thereafter. We expect the timing and slope of the rebound in 2021 to be closely tied to customer confidence, which will be a function of the macroeconomic environment and success containing the virus. Moving to Public. We expect continued success supporting Department of Defense and civilian agencies. However, Government is not expected to fully make up the loss of the Census project, which contributed a total of approximately 230 basis points of net sales to CDW in 2020. Education growth is expected to be strong earlier in the year, with sales above historical seasonality and then decelerate throughout the year due to overlaps in the unusual seasonality experienced in 2020. Chromebook supply continued to be a wildcard. Healthcare overlaps are tougher in the first half as customer demand spiked at the beginning of the pandemic and then comparison feeds in the second half. The timing and slope of a rebound in 2021 is linked to budget clarity, which we expect to be a function of success containing the virus and potential stimulus support. Finally, our international businesses are more weighted to Corporate customers, so the pace of recovery will be driven by the macro environments in the UK and Canada. Moving down the P&L. Assuming IT market growth of 2.5% to 3%, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range and non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid to high single digits, call it 6.5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the following below the operating line assumptions. One, a modest decline in interest expense to the mid to high 140s, two, a non-GAAP effective tax rate at the low-end of our typical 25.5% to 26.5% range, assuming current tax rates. The low end of the range is approximately 150 basis points higher than 2020's 24% rate, creating a headwind of over 200 basis points on earnings per share growth. Three, contribution from share repurchases with non-GAAP earnings per share growing approximately 200 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Currency is expected to contribute approximately 40 basis points to reported earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization can be found on page 26. Turning to the first quarter. Historically, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline on an average daily sales basis has averaged down approximately 7%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be down high single digits more than historical seasonality, primarily due to Census and Mississippi Department of Education. On a year-over-year average daily sales basis, this equates to mid-single digit growth, reflecting continued education and government strength, improving commercial trends, partially offset by the overlap of the March 2020 work-from-home surge. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be a couple of hundred basis points higher than the full year EPS outlook, as we overlap last year's increase in the credit loss reserve, partially offset by having one fewer selling day, which adversely impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. This is timing, and we will recoup the day in the fourth quarter. January segment trends are generally in line with my commentary on first quarter expectations. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on slide 27. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged to 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. We expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. We believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cree to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each one of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you. Operator : Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good morning. How much do you think the supply constraints on Chromebooks impacted the December quarter? In other words, how much better would you have done in December? And then, when do you expect those supply constraints to loosen up this year? Collin Kebo : Hi, Katy. Good morning. We did carry a higher backlog than normal out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter. In terms of when we expect supply conditions to get better, obviously, very difficult and fluid to call with any precision. But our expectation would be through the course of the first half of the year, we would see supply on the Chromebook side of the business begin to return to normal. Katy Huberty : Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up. As netted-down revenue increases and drives gross margins higher, how should we think about the flow-through to the operating margin line? Does sales commission fully offset that gross margin expansion? Or should we see some scale benefits and potential operating margin expansion over time? Collin Kebo : Yeah. I mean, you're right. There is a little bit of a give back on the sales comp line because we pay on gross profit dollars. I think, Katy, from a secular perspective, our expectation is consistent with yours that we would expect netted-down items in software and services to grow faster than the balance of the business. I think we're just a little careful though of trying to understand where we are in the cycle and whether a hardware refresh is coming and if it is coming, how strong it could be. So I think that's something to keep in mind as you think about that netted-down mix and the impact it has on gross margin going forward, at least over the next several quarters. I think the other thing to think through on the margin and then the flow-through to NGOI margin is we did benefit from really an exceptional product margin in 2020. And I think some of that was due to the unique dynamics of the supply environment, as well as the premium that customers were placing on speed. And so I think that's just also another thing to keep in mind as we think about gross margin going forward. And I think those are probably more secular - cyclical than secular, but something to think about. Katy Huberty : That's helpful color. Congrats on the quarter. Collin Kebo : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Chris, you're guiding fiscal '21 for another year of 200 to 300 basis points outperformance versus the US IT market. And that's despite the year-on-year 200-odd basis points headwind from the Census project. Given all the uncertainty that you've talked about, I mean, maybe for us, can you just give us your thoughts on what are some of the opportunities you have? What is giving you confidence to guide for the full year, that 200 to 300 basis point outperformance? And what - and in that vein, what can the federal - are there other opportunities to offset that headwind from Census? So just your thoughts on what's driving your confidence on the full year? Chris Leahy : Sure. Thanks, Ruplu. Thanks for being on the call. Yeah, we always hold ourselves accountable for outperforming the market. So on a relative basis, we always expect ourselves to do better. And when you think about the combination of our competitive advantages, you saw them in play really in one of the hardest periods in history in 2020. So we are confident that the advantages that we bring to the market will position us and allow us to continue to outperform a pivot to where our customers need us and grow faster than the market. When I think about headwinds and tailwinds going into 2020, certainly, think about remote work and remote everything. And that has certainly been driving growth in 2020 and should continue to do so into 2021. That we've got some very significant compares, as you all know, because of the first quarter of last year, because of the timing of the education needs the end of this past year in Census. But it will still continue to be a trend, we believe. Everyone will not be going to straight back to work, and we think it will be a work-from-everywhere kind of situation. We also believe that this digital acceleration is just going to continue. And so our strength across the full stack, and when I say full stack, I mean, cloud services, software and hardware plays very well with our customers because customers are always full stack, and they're looking for a full solution. So as they think about combined multi-vendor, multi component solutions, CDW is a great partner for them. And we can take them from the very front end of advising and designing to building, implementing, integrating, orchestrating and managing. And I'll tell you, it seems that 2020 has really propelled customers to look for that value-added one-stop shop trusted IT provider that can do the full spectrum across the whole life cycle. So, we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our customers. On the federal side, I think you asked about specifically the Department of Defense and Civilian, we expect to continue to maintain pretty strong. Look, on the commercial side on Small Business and Corporate, I'll tell you as Colin said, the speed and the slope of any recovery is tied to confidence, which is tied to the macro, which is tied to the virus. It's all tied together. So that's very hard to predict. But we've been staying so close to our customers during 2020 that we feel absolutely confident that we will be well-positioned to help them on their way up and to capture growth as they're growing. On the Government side, stimulus is another wildcard out there. And under the new administration, if we see some stronger stimulus, that should also help to support on the education, healthcare and state and local side. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for the details there, Chris. That makes sense. Just for my follow-up. In the UK, given the resurgence of COVID-19, have you seen any impact to your operations? And you talked about M&A on the call. Can you just give us your thoughts on any geographic expansion possibility in 2021? Thanks. Chris Leahy : Yeah, sure. In the UK, I'll tell you, I mentioned that we saw a little bit of buy ahead as people - as customers were anticipating possibly a hard Brexit. So we saw some benefit in the fourth quarter. But the good news Ruplu, remember, we put the mitigation strategy in place with our Netherlands entity, and we've really been helping customers utilize that entity in the EU. So while we've gone back into lockdown, it does feel like - it feels like customers are used to working that way and are still buying in the areas where they have needs, like remote work - optimizing remote work, et cetera. So we haven't seen a significant impact any different than we would have seen in 2020. And we're managing this really quite well at this point. In terms of M&A, yeah, look, we never really pinpoint where we're going to be - what we're going to be doing, but you know we're focused on geographic expansion, as well as expanding our capabilities, our technology capabilities. So, we continue to look. We continue to be very active. I doubt there's a deal out there that doesn't get to CDW store to see, but we also have our screens that we need to adhere to, which are - the cultural and operating match, the financial match and the strategic match. So we'll continue to look. We're excited about this [indiscernible] we did this year that continue to grow our cloud native and ServiceNow capabilities. And frankly, we're seeing the real benefit from those in terms of traction with our sales organization and deeper connections with our customers because we're really at the front end of that IT supply chain, if you will, helping them to devise solutions and then fulfilling. So those have been real positive winners for CDW and our customers. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Congrats on the strong results. Chris Leahy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a really good print [ph] here. I guess, two for me as well. First off, when I think about this calendar '21 revenue guide, 4.5% to 6%, give or take, I'd love to understand how does that stack up between transactional and solutions? What does that SKU look like? And then - I guess, how do you do PCs in that narrative for /21? Chris Leahy : Yeah, good morning. It's really interesting - rather, I'm sorry, it's really interesting. I would tell you that 2021 is almost a harder year to determine what sits underneath that IT market rate of growth. There's a wide dispersion of forecast out there across various technologies. And what I would say is, I don't think anybody really knows precisely. What we plan to do is what we do best, which is pivot where our customers need us. And whether that be in the client hardware, refresh area, whether it be in building out cloud capabilities, we're able to go in either direction. And we're just staying very close to our customers working with them literally day-by-day, week-by-week and supporting them in their technology needs. Certainly, technology is more essential than ever. We don't see any of the trends slowing down, frankly. We might see some things prolonged as a result of the pandemic, and the vaccine don't go as we all hope. But at the end of the day, it's a mix, and it's really quite hard to tell. I know that's not a great answer to the question of what it comprises, but it's very hard to know given the unprecedented uncertainty that we still have. I think sometimes, I think people felt in some ways we've come through 2020, and now we're in 2021. And it's sunrise and glory ahead. And I think we really have to be cautious and conscious of where we sit in the vaccine rollout and new strains coming up, and we just have to be very methodical in listening to our customers and taking care of them, which we're very good at doing. Amit Daryanani : That's really fair. And then I guess on the cloud spend, Chris, you talked a few times about that business being up double-digits, and I think you said you expect this to continue. Is the shift to cloud driving new customers to CDW that haven't engaged with you before and they need to help to get to the cloud? Or is it more existing customers that are just migrating from on to off-premise? And in that latter scenario, how does that play out through your P&L? Is that a good thing for CDW's revenue and profitability? Or it's [Indiscernible] impact? Chris Leahy : Yeah. On the first question, Amit, I'd say both. We are - you know, we certainly mean more heavily into penetrating current customers as you saw, but we are bringing in new customers with our cloud capabilities and our Digital Velocity and ServiceNow processes in particular. Again, as I mentioned earlier, they're really at the front end of that discussion advisory. And that's where we're able to bring a great deal of value to the customer and the planning, particularly in a world where things are changing so quickly and plans that had been expected and in place four, five, 12 months ago are moving, and we're very well-positioned to help them with that. So it's both customers, new and existing. And we do expect to continue to see growth there. I would note that on the - you asked about existing customers and migrating to the cloud. One of the interesting things that I know you're aware of, that it's not just migrating to the cloud, but it's also some customers who are already cloud and becoming multi-cloud. So multi public cloud, other customers who are - have some public cloud capabilities that they need to almost mirror that on-prem. So it's the whole - I'll call it the cloud environment, the whole ecosystem that our teams are able to support customers with now. Again, which is a real advantage because it's bringing the customer the best for the customer and not just some narrow product category that we sell. In terms of the impact on the P&L, I think Collin is going to jump in here. Collin Kebo : Yeah. Good morning, Amit. I mean, because most of it gets netted down, it obviously has the lift on gross margin and operating margin. I think if you look at it on gross profit divided by what the customer is actually spending, I would say cloud is very much like our entire portfolio. There are some things in it that are higher margin. Security would be a good example of that. A lot of it's delivered via the cloud. And there are other things that are more commodity like in terms of cloud offerings and would have lower margins. So, in terms of the absolute amount of profit, it's really a function of how margin-rich the particular offering is, which is typically rooted in value from the - perceived value from the customer, as well as then the services that we can wrap around at another value we can bring by consumption. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you, very much. Operator : Next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Adam Tindle : Morning. Chris, you alluded to the strategic planning process and accelerating investments alongside that. As I look at the fiscal '21 early outline, it looks like operating margin is going to be flattish year-over-year. CapEx is going to be above the rule of thumb. So just hoping if we could get a little bit more color on the nature of these implied investments, and how we can think about gauging success or expected return over time? Chris Leahy : Sure. Good morning, Adam. Yes, let me step back on the strategic process. You know, we do this every three years. And our overarching strategy hasn't changed, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. I would say what we do is we really hone where we're focusing our energy and investments to evolve the business, as technology evolves. And where we're focusing now, are those areas in strategic services and solutions that our customers need. You heard me mention full stack is a way that we go to market. And investments in the capabilities across that full stack, such as cloud solutions, cloud services, software solutions and services, in particular, security and then obviously, our hardware. I think about a couple of recent acquisitions, Scalar, and IGNW, as excellent examples of that strategy in action where we invested in cloud and DevOps capabilities and ServiceNow capabilities, and those are the areas that customers are needing advisers. The other area that you can think about that we're investing in is our talent and digital in particular. So our technology, our own technology, we kind of put the mirror on ourselves and made some decisions about what we need as an organization. And we're investing in our own technical capabilities, but also those digital tools that we've talked about in the past for sellers. I think you've heard us talk about AMANDA [ph] We have a number of other tools in the pipeline that allow our sellers in our digital platform, our e-commerce platform to work for our customer in a really integrated, seamless intelligent way. And that's what we're going for. And then obviously, we're also reviewing our operating model as we always do, but even what was more custom-wide, I'd say now to really remove those things that we - that are inefficiencies and recoup where we can and then re-imagine critical elements for a digital world and then reinvest back in the business. So investing in technology, also investing in talent. We talked last quarter about a reduction in our workforce, but a reduction was also to open up capacity for those rules and capabilities that we need, and we have been investing in people there. So technology, people and digital is where you see the investment, as well as capabilities behind those high growth areas. Adam Tindle : Okay. It makes sense. And maybe this is a follow-up for Colin, more in near term. You talked about how seasonality is expected to continue to be different than historical for the next few quarters and modeling has gotten tougher for us. You've historically talked about a first half, second half split of 48 to 52. Is there any way that we could maybe think about 2021 in those terms? Collin Kebo : Yeah. Adam, we elected not to provide thoughts on that, just given the highly uncertain environment, both on the demand and the supply side, frankly. I mean, some of my comments in the prepared remarks were slope of recovery tied to economy and virus, which I think is inherently uncertain and the supply environment is uncertain. So at this point, no perspective on that. Obviously, when we get on the call next quarter, we can provide more thoughts on that. Adam Tindle : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to dig into more of the on-premise hardware side of the business. Just curious if you could give a little bit more color on what you're seeing across categories like servers, storage, NetComm? And just how we should think about that business and the potential for some refresh activity heading into 2021? Chris Leahy : Yeah. Good morning, Matt. Yeah, I'll go back to the comments I made earlier, which is, it's hard to know the timing and slope of when we might see server storage in particular pickup. For example, in the Corporate space, we think about timing around when customers are really getting back to the office, which probably won't be through the second half of the year. We are seeing some pickup in areas like higher Ed as example, where they're really focused on a connected community. So they've really extended what that connected campus looks like. But until we start to see, I think a strength in recovery, which, of course, is related to the virus, we're pretty cautious around on-prem solutions. We also haven't obviously been able to get into locations. We still haven't been able to get into too many locations to help our customers there. So I would just say, look, a refresh will be coming. It's hard to know when in 2021 or beyond that will be. Matt Cabral : Got it. And then on the commercial side of the business, just looking at the fourth quarter, is it - an improvement in this trajectory in Small Business, a little bit more of a modest uptick in Corporate. Just wondering if you can compare and contrast a little bit what you're seeing across those two customer types? And how we should think about the pace of recovery, particularly for Corporate as we head into 2021? Chris Leahy : Yeah. Matt, I think, you know, and we said this before Small Businesses just tend to be more nimble. And so at the beginning of 2021 - 2020, excuse me, they went - they slowed down more quickly and they've come back up more quickly. So I think that's just the nature of Small Businesses. On the Corporate side, it's really - we referenced it as kind of multiple layers and mosaics, and it's to say that we're really seeing the same thing. It depends by geography. It depends by industry, even individual customers within segments, winners and losers, so to speak. So it's really a mix across geo industry and individual customers. I will say that we did see some budget flush at the end of the year, which felt like a good thing. But again, until we see the macroeconomics uncertainty subside and we see more customer confidence, which, of course, is driven by the success in stemming the virus, I think we're still going to be a little cautious on Corporate. On the other hand, look, when things do normalize, we would expect Corporate and Small Business similar to what we saw in 2009 and '10 to really pick up again, and we'll be well-prepared to help them do that. Matt Cabral : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tim Yang with Citi. Tim Yang : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a question on Corporate and Small Business recovery as well. Chris, on slide six, you show that your sub-sector recovery cadence in financial crisis, and I think it took only 1.5 to 2 years for Corporate and Small Business to be back to pre-crisis level. For 2021 recovery, do you expect Corporate and Small Business to recover faster or slower than financial crisis, given we might have more stimulus package, but also there are COVID uncertainties? Chris Leahy : Yes. No, these are great questions. I wish I had a better crystal ball to answer them. It's just hard to say, the unique dynamics of this downturn and the pandemic have really, I think, made it harder to predict and I think less comparable to what we saw in 2008, '09 and '10. And as Collin said in his prepared remarks, the speed and the slope of the recovery is really in every way related to the success containing the virus. So if we can get that under control and we can stem the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and I think we'll see it recover more quickly and maybe with a very healthy slope given the importance of technology. If we don't see that, I think we're going to see more muted growth over a longer period of time. Certainly, the stimulus is yet another wildcard, which can help in the areas that we've mentioned, education, state and local, et cetera, and can of course help get that positive momentum going with the consumer, which ultimately impacts the businesses. But I just think the dynamics of this environment and the pandemic make it incredibly difficult to predict timing and flow. Again, the beautiful thing is the diversity of our end markets allows us to make sure that we are where the growth is and able to support our customers wherever they need us better than anyone. Tim Yang : Got it. That's very helpful. You mentioned K-12 demand strength and your education sector Q4 performance was much better than normal seasonality. Can you maybe just talk about how sustainable the demand is? And how should we think about the full year growth for the sector? Chris Leahy : Yes. Well, I would say a couple of things about K-12. It's really important to understand that what was happening here was a great focus on equity and access [ph] for students and student success. And therefore, schools were looking to get full holistic outcomes solutions to their schools with a lot of speed. And not a lot of providers could do that because they needed to get in the hands of the students quite quickly. And so when you look at the tremendous success our team had in K-12, it is because of the capabilities that they're able to bring together and literally get turnkey solutions to the schools in a timely fashion. And it's because of the relationships we have with our vendors to make sure we're getting a healthy proportion of the supply out there, which was really constrained. So I would say a couple of things. Number one, the timing, the seasonality was different because of the great urgency schools have. Number two, our execution was just extraordinary. And I want to say that loud and clear because our teams did an extraordinary job. We have some backlog going into the first quarter of the next year, which will certainly benefit us in the first quarter. And then one would expect that going into the back half of next year, we'll get back to more, I guess, normal seasonality in K-12. But it's a confluence of both the demand and our capabilities and an unbelievable execution by the team. Tim Yang : Very helpful. Collin Kebo : Yeah. Thanks, Tim. I just want to add a little bit more color on Q4 and build on Chris' comments. I mean we did see extraordinary demand. And I think everybody knows we benefited from Census. But we also had that really large offering with Mississippi Department of Education that Chris talked about on previous earnings calls. Just to dimensionalize the magnitude of those two offerings. If you excluded those from Q4 results, we would have grown our average daily sales in the neighborhood of a 6% to 7% range. So even excluding those two big deals, we still had a meaningful contribution from the education part of the market. Tim Yang : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Patrick Jackson [ph] on for Shannon. I wanted to ask what you're seeing during sort of the year from health care customers, as budgets continue to shift and customers focus on security and software spend, while also considering time lines for investment in virtual care solutions, as there seems to be heightened demand for new offerings, as you referenced in your work with the non-profit health care provider. Then I have a quick follow-up. Chris Leahy : Yeah. I agree with everything you said there, so not to repeat it. I'd say what - we're pleased with the improvement in health care this past quarter and continuing to be encouraged by first quarter performance so far. The real wildcard with health care is budget. And more than any of the segments, I think that tied to the virus is successfully containing it. It impacts the healthcare segment. Long-term certainly, there is opportunity in vital and in virtual care and all the components of it. On the 2021, to me, it's going to be a bit of a wildcard year with health care because of the pandemic. They are really just fluctuating back and forth between the urgent care, reductions in elective care, their revenue streams, et cetera. So we'll just have to see how it plays out in 2021, but the areas that you've identified yet are areas that they are focused on. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. And then you also referenced customers spent $2 billion with the company on security during 2020. I just wanted to ask where you're seeing security investments primarily being targeted. And do you expect securities spend to grow faster than the total IT market in 2021? Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah, sure. Security is across the full stack. So from the hybrid infrastructure, all the way out to the digital experience and endpoint devices. So we're seeing it across the full stack hardware and software in particular. We certainly provide some services reps around those, but it's across the full stack. Right now, given the remote enablement going on, there is I would say, increased focus on endpoint devices and all things endpoint security. But that's not to diminish the security focus on the full data center as well. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thanks. And good morning. Chris, I wanted to ask concerning your comments about work from home and remote working and working from everywhere, as you put it. Obviously, we've seen a very strong first wave of investments. But we're hearing from other solution providers about a potential second wave as customers go back and upgrade the hardware, but also infrastructure, as you said, endpoints and then also security. Are you having those conversations with customers yet? And are you working with customers and see that as an opportunity? Chris Leahy : Yes. Matt, yes, we are. And again, I'd say there are different flavors of what customers are doing. We have a healthy dose of customers who are - and someone like CDW, not so much waiting, seeing, but planning in a very flexible, adaptable optionality type kind of way. So they're not clear on whether they are going back at the end of the year or whether they are going to go back 50% et cetera. So I guess what I'm saying is we've got customers some who already are back in the office, may be 20% of our customers and we've obviously helping them setup in the office et cetera. But others are still planning for what their workforce ought to look like. I mean, I'm sure you hear the types of things that companies are saying they need to be in-person for now - collaboration, innovation, acculturation, these are things companies are saying, we need to be in the office for that. So we're helping them to design spaces that are more suitable for that. If in fact customers decide 80% of the workforce can work from anywhere, we are absolutely and necessarily talking with them about what the blueprint for that looks like in terms of 80% work, 20% in the office or alternatively kind of a different kind of office environment where everybody is coming into the office at different times for different types of work. I mean, it's a really interesting time right now because I don't - well, while there was a lot of talk about where this would settle out, the hard work really begins in the planning and what that looks like and how you create efficiency and productivity for your workforce. And we're right in the throes of that. And I think we're going to see a number of flavors, frankly. So we'll be - we're helping customers with all kinds of flavors. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thanks for that. And I wanted to ask another question regarding client devices. I know you talked about the double-digit strength across most of your end markets. Last year, we've seen a strong PC upgrade cycle for going on three-years now. How should we be thinking about that number this year, particularly both on the Corporate side and in the Public sector? Chris Leahy : Yeah. I think, look, with client devices, look, we have some headwinds and some tailwinds certainly going into 2021. And you named one of them. I mean, refresh is something that might be on our side. We've talked about devices that were from 2017, 2018. Also the need for more devices depending on where organizations end up in terms of long-term remote and bolstering those and refreshing those at some point, extending those. New use cases, we've been talking about this for quite a long time as companies are evolving their business models, think retailers, for example, contactless purchasing. We think new use cases will be a tailwind for client devices. And again, thinking about what comes in from the stimulus package that will be really interesting to see how our state and local education health care organizations can take advantage of it. Look, for CDW, we've got some big overlaps, we've talked about that we'll have to overcome, and we'll have to keep an eye on the economy and employment. But look, there are - again, there are winners out there who are hiring and investing heavily in technology. And that's a positive also for client devices. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. Regarding the comment about the security software, $2 billion in customer spending. Is that a gross number or netted-down number? Chris Leahy : That's a gross number. That's customer spend. So that's what customers spend with us. Matt Sheerin : And that's really what you recognized because of the netted-down, right? Collin Kebo : No, no, no. The gross is what customers are spending with us. We're recognizing fewer dollars in that in revenue because a lot of that is getting netted-down because it's software assurance and Software as a Service. Matt Sheerin : Exactly. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Collin Kebo : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Trevor filling in for Keith. How broad were the supply chain constraints across the portfolio? Were Chromebooks the only products affected? Or were there others? Collin Kebo : Chromebooks were the primary area of constraints. We did see some tightness in some of the other lower end notebooks and continue to see, I would say, pockets of dislocation on collaboration of hardware, webcams and things like that. But I would say those things are - were gradually getting better, but Chromebooks by far were the biggest source of constraints. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks. And a quick follow-up. Would you say the supply chain issues during the quarter got better or got worse as the quarter progress? Collin Kebo : I would say that's a difficult question to answer because we were chasing a moving target. And what I mean by that is, I think we were pleasantly surprised by our ability to procure supply in Chromebooks. We were also pleasantly surprised by the amount of demand. So on an absolute basis, I think the supply was a little bit better, but it still came in short of what demand was because demand was just so much than expected. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks a lot, and congrats on the quarter. Collin Kebo : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no questions. I would now like to hand the call back over to Chris Leahy, President and CEO. Chris Leahy : Thank you. And thank you all. I want to recognize before we head off the tremendous, tremendous dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all of CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. And thank you to our investors and analysts participating in this call. We appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. We had a strong first quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the first quarter, net sales were $4.8 billion, 12% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the first quarter of 2021 than 2020, and up 10.9% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 5.1% to $795 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $368 million, an increase of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26. 2% on a reported basis and up 25.3% in constant currency. The diversity of our end markets and solutions portfolio continued to serve us well,  providing balance and driving our strong results as we overlap last year's end-of-quarter surge in demand for remote solutions. During the first quarter, we saw early signs of recovery as customers became more optimistic about the macroeconomic environment due to lower COVID case count, higher vaccination rates and new government stimulus. Customer spending and channels most impacted by COVID last year rebounded. We continue to help customers with remote enablement, resource optimization, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. This past quarter, customers allocated more technology spend to infrastructure needs, driving growth for our solutions portfolio. Customers were focused on investments for the future, reconfiguring how they interact customers, strengthening hybrid environments, industrializing remote enablement and restarting projects that had been delayed due to COVID. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. Customers choose CDW for 3 simple reasons. First, customers want a partner who know their business and their industry. Second, customers want to partner with broad and deep technical capabilities. And third, they want a partner who is focused on the optimal outcome, one who is agnostic across brand, technology and consumption model and has an informed opinion. These reasons are fundamental to why CDW outperformed in the first quarter and will continue to win in the marketplace. During the first quarter, we remained focused on executing against our strategy and investing in high relevance and high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including our acquisition of Amplified IT. Amplified IT is a Google premium education partner and a leading provider of cloud-based services, solutions and software for education customers and has been a partner of CDW since 2016. We share a similar culture that puts customers first, and together, we will accelerate our work to help customers' schools achieve great educational outcomes through technology. Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers' extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. Supply constraints and availability for client devices and some infrastructure products have been more challenging since the first quarter ended. Disruption has been caused by both component availability issues and supply chain logistical issues. The supply situation is fluid. Constraints will likely continue through the second half of the year and potentially into next year. Now let's take a deeper look at first quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 4% as customer spend continued to recover. Customer expectations that a hybrid environment will become the future work model drove investments in notebooks and other remote enablement tools, while desktop and video sales declined. Solutions performance was flat, a significant improvement versus the previous quarter as net comm and data center projects returned. Small Business delivered strong growth, increasing 12% as optimism improved. Our team helped customers with remote enablement, netcomm and data center projects, leading to solid growth in both transactional and solution spend. Net sales for our government channel decreased high single digit. Federal declined mid-single digits. However, excluding our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau, Federal grew high single digits, led by engagements for the Department of Defense across both transactional and solutions categories. The state and local channel decreased high single digits. Customers paused their spending as they took a wait-and-see approach during the quarter for a stimulus support under the new administration. Education again grew triple digits, achieving over 100% growth, powered by K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access as well as ways to address learning loss, which drove strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers turn to us for holistic capabilities and expertise to help schools enable a variety of learning models, remote, hybrid, blended and in-person. Higher ed increased low single digits. Growth slowed versus prior quarters as customers assess their plans to invest stimulus funding to prepare for returning students. Healthcare declined 2%, a meaningful improvement to prior quarters. Customers were more optimistic due to increased income generated from the return to elective procedures and the accelerated vaccination pace. Solutions returned to growth driven by customers refreshing and updating their data centers. Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, the U.K. team increased net sales double digits, and the Canada team drove high single-digit growth. Strong results for both markets were driven by fiscal year-end government spending as well as continued investment by health care and education customers. Our first quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers. Transactions increased strong double digits and solutions returned to growth, increasing low single digits. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth across all channels, leading to 26% client device growth. Software declined high single digits due to a decline in software licenses, but software gross profit growth remains solid. While services decreased low single digits when adjusted for overlapping the contribution from the Census project last year, services grew strong double digits, driven by strength in our professional and managed services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in Infrastructure as a Service, security, productivity and collaboration. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflects the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. And the final driver of our performance is our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share 2 examples of our strategy in action and how we help customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped a customer that enables digital platforms to utilize natural language processing and machine learning to upgrade its technology infrastructure after it had been postponed due to COVID last spring. In early 2020, our account manager was working with the customer's technology team on a server upgrade at its primary data center. COVID hit and the customer froze all capital expenditures.  Our account manager did a great job nurturing the relationship so that CDW is well positioned to help our customer when the project resumed. Last quarter, the customer was more optimistic about its future prospects and ready to proceed. It got access to capital and wanted to take advantage of its employees still working remotely. The project scope was expanded to upgrade all infrastructure, security, networking, storage, servers and software at its headquarters and its primary data center. The customer relied heavily on our team for its expertise to design and implement the complex solutions. In 2020, customers had to react quickly to the impact of COVID. In 2021, we see that our customers are being strategic and proactively looking to technology to be more effective and efficient in a post-COVID world. As I shared earlier, we acquired Amplified IT at the end of the first quarter. We are excited about the opportunity to go to market together with our combined strengths and to orchestrate complete hardware, software, services and cloud solutions that leverage our full stack capabilities and drive full outcomes for and deep engagement with our education customers. We started to execute against this vision immediately. CDW's relationships and extensive contract vehicles with the State Department of Education enabled the customer frictionless access to Amplified IT's portfolio. The school system needed to enhance its communication and collaboration tools to service community in different learning formats, so it centralized and standardized its technology with the help of Amplified IT and CDW to provide the right tools and support to its teachers and students across approximately 250 schools. We are excited about the addition of Amplified IT and see significant opportunity ahead. These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate our relentless focus on customer service, the importance of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I'm so proud of the way that our teams continue to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. We expect our office coworkers to continue to be remote until at least this fall, with plans underway by our ReunITe team to reimagine our future of work to continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can. Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are increasing our outlook for both the U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market growth to be about 4% and our top line to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. For the second quarter, we are encouraged about customer demand to date and how our teams are executing. That said, we are cautious about the supply environment, which, as I mentioned, has become more challenged since the end of the first quarter.  While there are other wildcards such as new COVID variants, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects of the business have never been higher. Technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable profitable growth. CDW's role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition. Before I turn the call over to Collin for his comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition plans we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Collin for his contributions to CDW over the past 13 years and his strong leadership as our CFO since 2018. Collin has played a significant role in our evolution and consistent market-leading growth as a public company, and he has established a truly best-in-class finance team. On a personal note, it's been wonderful to be a close colleague of Collin's over 13 years, and I've greatly appreciated his partnership. We are also appreciative of Collin's commitment to support CDW in the search for his successor and to remain on the Board to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn it over to Collin. Collin Kebo : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My 13 years at CDW have been among the most rewarding of my career, and I want to thank you, the leadership team and all coworkers for making CDW so special. I also want to thank the finance team for bringing it every day. I'll miss CDW, but I'm confident the company has never been stronger and its best days are ahead. Following a successful transition, I'm looking forward to retiring so I can spend more time with family and helping others. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion, up 10.2% on a reported basis and 12% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 3.9% versus the fourth quarter. First quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the timing and slope of the recovery was better than expected in several channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Small Business, CDW Canada and CDW U.K. all delivered strong growth and declines in Corporate and Healthcare improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter. On the supply side, our team did a great job navigating the challenging environment, leveraging our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships and was able to work down a portion of the backlog in Chromebooks, which was higher than normal coming into the year. This supply, coupled with continued strong demand from education customers, resulted in education net sales doubling compared to the prior year. Gross profit for the quarter was $795 million, an increase of 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.8% on an average daily sales basis. Gross margin was 16.4%, down 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by lower product margin, including notebook mix and rate and overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year, partially offset by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased 5.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and entertainment expense. If you recall, last year, we increased our credit loss reserve as a result of the expected impact of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher investments in coworkers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 10,186. Coworker count increased 204 from the fourth quarter, driven by an increase of approximately 120 customer-facing coworkers, including over 40 from Amplified IT. The increase in coworker count reflects investments to support high-growth solution areas and the digital transformation of our own business. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 82, driven by organic and inorganic investments in coworkers to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation, partially offset by cost management actions in 2020. GAAP operating income was $323 million, up 31.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $368 million, up 21%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%, a record high margin for our first quarter, reflecting the benefit of our variable cost structure. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 6.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from last year's refinancing, partially offset by notes issued in April of 2020. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 19.5%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $44 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to lower global intangible low-taxed income and lower nondeductible expenses. As you can see on Slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 143 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.63, up 40.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $249 million in the quarter, up 24.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $879 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $101 million, as shown on Slide 15. This was lighter than a typical first quarter, but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. In Q1, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms and made payments related to the Census. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, purchasing Amplified IT and returning $415 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $358 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $148 per share. Moving to Slide 16. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 22 days, up 2 days from last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 2-day increase in DIO as we made investments in inventory to support customers through the choppy supply environment. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 17. Our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the first quarter at 2x, up 0.3 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Amplified IT that Chris highlighted is a great example of this. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We continue to expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 18. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we are encouraged by the activity and building momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers, where April writings for corporate and small business were up healthy double digits on a year-over-year basis. We're also seeing good activity at CDW Canada and CDW U.K. On the supply side, uncertainty has increased since the first quarter. Our backlog is higher than normal and increasing with lead times extending and visibility challenged at suppliers. Notebooks, certain Chromebooks, displays and pockets of infrastructure hardware are becoming more constrained. Net demand, particularly with commercial customers, feels stronger than 3 months ago, but supply is more challenged. With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 4%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency, including the contribution from Amplified IT.  Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 60 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the low double digits, call it, 11% to 11.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 50 basis points to earnings per share growth. This updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.30 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate are unchanged from last quarter and can be found on Page 19. Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. On the February earnings call, we did not provide a first half, second half sales split as we typically would because of the uncertainty. Based on our current assessment, we expect the split to be approximately 48.5% to 49% first half, 51.5% to 51% second half. This assumes a slight sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis and equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth in the second quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth. If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the next 3 quarters and potentially into 2022. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 20. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. We continue to expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. As we mentioned before, we believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cristal to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Collin, best of luck on your retirement. It's really been a pleasure working with you. I guess maybe first question, this is the one I'm getting asked by clients a lot. Please step back and talk a little bit of what happened to gross margin, at least on a sequential basis, I'll hold on the year-over-year. But what drove the drop on a sequential basis, the lowest we've seen in a while. And then how will be gross margins progressing as we go through the year? Collin Kebo : Thanks, Amit. On both the year-over-year and sequential basis, there's some recurring things. I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate. Obviously, we've had strong growth in Chromebooks in education. The other thing that happened in the quarter was really strong growth in our U.K. and Canadian businesses. It was a fiscal year-end for many of their public customers. We had a very strong fiscal year end in those markets, and a lot of those deals tended to be in client devices. So you have public and client device end market mix internationally. In the previous quarter, Q4 benefited from strong configuration services as we decommissioned the majority of the devices we had from the Census Device as a Service offering last year. A little of that spilled over into the first quarter, but for the most part, it was done. As you think about gross margin, as you know, we don't provide an outlook. It can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on a variety of factors. We do tend to focus on the NGLI margin because of our variable cost structure, and that's more variable. But if I can just share some thoughts on some of the puts and takes to gross margin as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think from a tailwind perspective, I would expect the longer-term secular trend to 100% gross margin items and as well as us continuing to grow our higher-margin services businesses. In terms of headwinds, we've talked about this for some time, but there's hardware mix, and particularly within the hardware mix, client devices and Chromebooks. And then from a product margin perspective, I think some things to think about, there's that continuous commoditization that you can see. I think we went through a unique period over the past couple of quarters where we saw customers prioritizing speed and execution over price. We're beginning to move into what I would describe as a more normalized customer behavior environment where customers are willing to wait a little bit longer and prioritize price over speed because the urgency and kind of existential threat of the pandemic in business continuity isn't as great as it was just a few quarters ago. From an OEM perspective, obviously, there's some supply challenges out there and OEMs aren't getting as aggressive on special pricing programs as they might with a channel with more normalized environment. So I think you have a lot of things going on there.  We have been through cycles like this before. I'd point to the 2018 to 2019 time frame, where our top line ticks up into the high single digits or even low double digits as we sell a lot of hardware, we exceed our 200 to 300 basis point premium by a meaningful amount, but gross margin has a '16 handle on it. And I think that's part of the power of the business model is that we pivot to where the profitable growth is, and that's why we do focus on non-GAAP operating income and EPS and free cash flow. Amit Daryanani : That is really helpful. And if I can just follow up with Chris on a different topic. Chris, you've seen this hardware business grow double digit, software and services is lagging somewhat. I'm curious, is this something normal that you would expect as we are at the onset of a macro cyclical recovery? And perhaps as IT budgets become more normalized, should we expect the software and services business to start growing in line with or faster than CDW averages, maybe by the end of the year or something? But just curious how you stack the hardware versus software and services as you go forward. Chris Leahy : Yes. One thing, Amit. And I'd say, look, as customers continue to work through their budgets and keep a close eye on the macro environment, the vaccine rollout, that's really going to dictate where they're spending and if we continue to see this uptick in hardware refresh. In terms of software, look, that can be fairly lumpy as we've talked about before. Depending on the mix of software, this quarter, we saw license -- shorter-term licenses and licenses not as strong, but I'll tell you, SaaS continues to be quite strong across the portfolio. So we don't expect software to start to diminish as we move forward in the year, notwithstanding a hardware refresh. It's still critically important, obviously, to the full stack. So I think we'll continue to see software strong. It's just going to bounce around depending on what's being bought and whether or not it's netted down. Amit Daryanani : Perfect, and congrats on a nice quarter. Chris Leahy : Thanks, Amit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Just a clarification first. I think IDC forecast hardware or software both of north of 6% at this point. Why do you think 4% is the appropriate forecast? And if you think about the increase since 3 months ago, is it largely PC and Chromebook driven? Or is it more broad-based than that? And then I have a follow-up. Chris Leahy : Okay. Katy, it's Chris. I'll take that. I think I heard -- you cut out for a minute, but I think the question was on the IT market rate of growth given some of the forecasts out there. And as you know, we triangulate from a variety of sources. We do customer input partner inputs the CIO and VAR surveys and the IDCs and Gartners. And I'd share a couple of thoughts. I think the forecast tend to lag current market conditions for the third-party analysts. And while demand feels very healthy, I'm not sure how many of the external forecasts are incorporating the impact of supply chain that we've talked about. And the CIO surveys, if you focus on that, they are a little more cautious than some of the others. So we feel pretty confident that we've landed on a growth rate that feels right, right now. But of course, as we go through the year, as we always do, we'll update based on what we see the changes in the market. Katy Huberty : And is the increase, in your mind, largely PC-driven? Or is it more broad-based than that? Chris Leahy : I would say it's overweighted to -- it's overweighted to hardware and clients, but it's really broadly driven. The demand is across both transactional and solutions, and that's driving the market rate of growth in our view. Katy Huberty : And Collin, just a follow-up for you. You mentioned strong writings growth in the April quarter. Can you just talk about the gap in the last 3 months or so between writings growth and revenue growth and whether that gap increased as you moved into April given the supply constraints? Collin Kebo : Yes, Katy. What I would say is we came into the year with a higher-than-normal backlog. And while there were some ups and downs as we went through the quarter and some ups and downs by end market, by the time we ended the first quarter, the backlog was relatively consistent with where it was at the beginning of the year. So that would tell you that writings in sales and sales generally kept pace with each other. Where we've seen the backlog increase has been more subsequent to the end of the first quarter, and that would tell us that we're writing well ahead of shipments. Katy Huberty : Okay. Congratulations on retirement, Collin. Collin Kebo : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I was just wondering with regard -- I know you touched on it a little bit during the call, but stimulus, how are you thinking about the benefits? I mean there's a significant amount of money that's going to be, I guess, has, and will be flooding into education. I think government is going to have a fair amount of funding as well. So as you look ahead, given your customer mix in that, how are you thinking about stimulus maybe through -- and how long do you think it will continue to benefit, I guess? Chris Leahy : Yes. That's a great question, Shannon. It will be a tailwind in our mind for sure. I think about it a little bit like getting an elephant through the snake. It takes some time to actually get it moving through the system. So when you think about the 3 different stimulus acts that have been passed last March and then last December and then most recently in March, there are funds that have been available for state and local K-12 and Healthcare, in particular, where we see the most benefit for our customers. And we have a team actually that goes through the stimulus bills and understands where the dollars are going and frankly, help our customers quite a bit in understanding how and where and when they can spend their dollars. So we see it as an absolute tailwind and our customers do look to us to help understand how best to utilize those funds. If you look at the most recent of the American Rescue Plan in March, there's about $350 billion going to state and local and $130 billion going to K-12. So we certainly look forward to helping them use those and invest in technology as they come out of the current environment. Shannon Cross : Are there any specific areas that are targeted within stimulus? I mean is it continued Chromebook sales? Or will we see maybe a move up the stack from a hardware perspective? Chris Leahy : So yes, if we take K-12 for example. We go to market with what we call customer-centric solutions. So we're focused on those areas that are most strategic and important to our customers. K-12, for example. Think of classroom transformation, think of school-facing, think of networking augmentation. So certainly, after the stack, starting with a consultative role in a design role and then bringing to bear our implementation, integration and management capabilities. But we -- K-12 really turns to CDW and state and local health care, who are going to be beneficiaries of the stimulus, for the holistic capabilities that we bring to bear. And at the end of the day, that actually helps them maximize the dollars they can use through stimulus because we know how to work those dollars through the needle. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Adam Tindle : Chris, I wanted to start on the growth premium versus the market, which you're raising today. And I think coming out of the last cycle, the growth premium contracted. So I'm wondering, is the raise today more reflective of device demand remaining stronger for longer? Or do you think that you're noticing structural changes versus the last cycle that are enabling you to stay at an elevated growth premium regardless of product cycles? Chris Leahy : Well, our premium does tend to be 200 to 300 basis points higher than the market when we start the year. We hold ourselves accountable for that. And when we sell a lot of hardware, as you know, which is recognized at full revenue, we tend to outperform that premium. So we brought it up to 300 to 400 basis points. When you think about the mix of hardware, that seems to make a lot of sense to us. So if I just go through the math. If we take Census out of the baseline, which contribute about 2 -- 200 to 240 basis points to premium last year, we're looking at a good 500 to 600 basis points this year by bringing our premium up those 100 basis points. So when you ask about whether or not we, as I said, kind of durable forecast or outlook for outperformance, I would say it really depends on the mix. In years where we have high hardware, we tend to outperform because we recognize much of what we sell on a full net sales basis. In times when we have slower sales of hardware, and we have more netted down items, that's when we'll see the top line more muted. So we're hesitant to commit to a higher premium generally because of the mix of the business. And the beauty of the model is exactly that mix of the business. We've got the full range of IT products and we go where our customers need them when they need us. So I don't see us bringing that up to a higher level at any point soon, but rather toggling to where our customers need us. Adam Tindle : Understood. And maybe as a follow-up, Collin, congrats, and I'm sure there's going to be some aspects of the job that you won't miss like this one where I'm going to beat a dead horse on gross margin. But I do have to ask. I mean I know there's notebook demand, but devices have been strong for some time. Sequentially, SMB and international grew most, which are among the higher gross margin segments. But this gross margin compression is so much more than normal. So I guess the question would be, on a like-for-like product basis, are you seeing pressure on gross margin? And why? Is there inflation or price increases that you're eating more of or sharing in some of the pain that's helping you to gain some share? Collin Kebo : Yes, Adam. I mean, we -- first, thank you. You're right. This is one of the parts of the job that I won't miss down the road. But putting all the mix issues aside, we are seeing some product margin compression in certain categories. And just to go a little bit deeper on some of the comments I've made before. Again, I just -- I think 2020 was really unique in the way that customers were prioritizing speed and execution overtaking every last basis point off the table in terms of their IT buying behavior. And I think now that we're moving into a different phase of the pandemic where that mission-critical nature of getting that IT purchase as quickly as possible just isn't there, we're seeing a return to kind of some of that more normal customer buying behavior. I would characterize the competitive environment as competitive, not irrational, but we compete in a highly competitive marketplace. From an OEM perspective, they are obviously wrestling with higher input costs and supply challenges, right? And so because of that -- that drives a couple of things. One, they are not incentivized to aggressively invest as much in the channel and special pricing programs and things like that, that they might in a more normal supply environment and a more normal competitive environment where they're battling it out to gain share. And in some instances, they're taking those higher costs and passing them along in the form of price increases. Now we do work on a cost-plus model, as we've talked about over the years. But if you just think about the math of the way a price increase works, if, for argument's sake, we make $100 per unit of gross profit on a notebook. And that notebook price goes up by 5% or 10%, that is going to be a lower reported gross margin percentage. So I think those are some of the dynamics that are driving some of the changes we're seeing on product margin currently versus some of the preceding quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Collin, I also wanted to extend my congratulations on your retirement, all the best going forward. Chris, I guess, good to hear some momentum coming back into the business on the infrastructure side. I guess I'm wondering if you could expand a little more on what you're seeing underneath there and talk about trends across the data center in categories like server, storage, netcomm? And I guess taking a step back, I'd be curious for your perspective on just how customers are balancing the desire to refresh or invest in their on-prem footprint versus this push to accelerate the move toward the public cloud going forward? Chris Leahy : It's -- let me start with a step back. If you think across our customers, you hear quite a bit about when people are going back or returning to the office. And I'll tell you, while certainly there you see in the news a couple of large organizations that are returning to the office pretty quickly in the summer, most of our customers around -- across Commercial and Small Business are still, I'd say, not rushing. They're still planning and they're still a little cautious because they've got employees on both sides of the spectrum. Those who want to get back and those who frankly aren't yet ready to get back. So first, I would just say we're in a time right now where as the vaccination pace might accelerate and we see what happens over the next couple of years. We've got to be patient for a couple of months. All that said, clearly, the hybrid world is here to stay and our customers are thinking and planning around how to have flexible -- where people are now calling Hyflex environment, hybrid and flexible environment.  And so we are in the -- we are still planning with them. We are seeing some customers that have had just old infrastructure and a real need to upgrade get to it over the past couple of months. But we are still heavily in the phase of, I'll call it, assessment to optimize, whether old plans to upgrade throughout the window and we start to move more to cloud, whether customers think more strongly about on-prem cloud-like solutions, which are now really readily available and of great interest. So what I would say, Matt, is that we're still -- customers are still assessing and they're being more reflective. As Collin mentioned, last year, there was just a kind of a rush to get business continuity. And now there's a more measured, reflective strategic approach on what's going to be durable competitive advantage for the long term. So what does that all mean? We have seen customers spending more on infrastructure, hardware infrastructure. Obviously, cloud is doing really quite well. We saw a server uptick. Storage is getting stronger. One would expect we'd see netcomm really come to life later in the year or midyear as customers are heading back to the office. But there's -- on-prem hardware is not going to go away, it's just what's going to be most optimal. And as I said, customers are really weighing the benefits right now. Matt Cabral : That's really helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the commentary for the second quarter. And I think I heard slight sequential growth, and I know we're coming off of a really strong first quarter base. I guess if I look back prior to last year, the business was typically up much more meaningfully from the first quarter to the second quarter. So I'm wondering if you could just help bridge the gap a little bit and just speak to how much is maybe normalization on the education side or some of the supply challenges versus just the trajectory in the wider business? Collin Kebo : Yes, I would say abnormal education seasonality is the single biggest driver here. If you look historically what has driven the increase in sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, education is, by far, the number one factor when you look across our end markets. So we just come into the typical education peak season with a much stronger base. And we've talked about several quarters now of unusual or abnormal education seasonality. So I would say that's the first driver. I touched on a couple of other ones in my prepared comments. But again, just an unusually strong public year-end finish in the U.K. and Canada. I know it's public year-end every year in the first quarter, but we just had a particularly strong finish this year. And then we also carried a little bit of Census revenue in the first quarter as we completed the device to decommissioning. We are completely done with that and have no Census revenue going forward. I think the other thing that I would think about, and I made this comment in one of the answers earlier, was that our backlog was relatively unchanged over the course of the first quarter. If supply is more resilient than we think -- actually, I don't think it is. But if supply is more resilient and we can begin whittling down that backlog or if demand is even greater, and supply can keep up with that greater demand, I think that could provide some upside in terms of sequential growth and into the back half of the year. We just don't have the visibility at this point, though, to build that confidence on supply into the full year outlook and into the second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Collin, it was a pleasure working with you and wishing you the best for your retirement. My first question is for you as well. Can you give us some details on CapEx spend this year? What areas are you investing in? And what utilization are your distribution centers running at? And at what point would you need to invest in another facility? Collin Kebo : Thanks, Ruplu. In terms of our own CapEx, again, we talked about this a little bit on the call. But a lot of that is going into our own digital transformation, and that can be better tools for our sellers, more AI, how our customers interact with CDW and making those transactions more frictionless as well as investments we're making in supply chain, both resiliency as well as flexibility. So I would think about CapEx going across those buckets. In terms of adding another distribution center, I don't know that in the next few years, we would have a -- build another 0.5 million square foot distribution center. I think we would look at more dynamic and flexible models, working with third-party logistics organizations and really thinking through how to optimize our footprint across the U.S. from a supply chain perspective. Oh, and I think you had a question on utilization. Yes. Look, the distribution centers are busy. There's no doubt about that. Part of that is us flexing our muscles and where we can, bringing inventory in and configuring that and staging it for our customers and helping them through this choppy environment. So there is some capacity there. It's tight. And again, I think we would use more of a flexible model and more of a renting space in the short term as we need it until we get a better sense of what supply and demand look like over the longer term. Ruplu Bhattacharya : My second question is for Chris. What percent of your coworkers are currently working from home? And given certain regions are going back into lockdowns, I mean, how do you think about that? And is the updated revenue guidance for the year that you gave this morning, is that dependent on a certain percent of coworkers being able to go back into the customer sites and get acceptance for projects? So is the mix of coworkers working from home versus being able to travel impact the revenue for the full year? Chris Leahy : Thanks for the question. Let me start with the second part first. Our guidance isn't dependent on when or how many people we get back into the office or going on to customer sites. So we've really done a great job. The team has done a great job of staying connected and staying productive. So we're not -- it's not dependent on that. In terms of going back to the office and how we think about that, a couple of things. First of all, we have coworkers on both ends of the spectrum. As I mentioned before, as most companies do, we've got some who are really eager to be back and some who are still cautious until we get through the pandemic more fully. So what we've done is we've created opportunities for customer -- for coworkers to come together and have social and networking time in a safe way. We've also given guidance to our coworkers who are customer-facing around getting together with customers who would like to get together again in a safe way, and that started to happen. We also have customers who are very comfortable with our service provision in a remote way, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic. But we also have customers who are now opening up and allowing us back on site. We have bases that are opening, et cetera. So I guess I'd say, look, we're doing very well from a productivity and connectivity perspective. We are starting to get together with customers in-person. And you can imagine it depends on what's happening within each state, for example, or each country. I think the U.K. just had their garden pubs open, and that was a big event and customers do want to get together. But we're going to do this right. We don't really want to do this with fits and starts. That's really the key for us. We want to be able to have our coworkers come back together in a way that is -- continues our highly engaged and high-performing culture and keeps the customer at the center of how we actually work together so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment. Jim Suva : As you start to see some mid- and small-sized businesses coming back to work and in-person meetings and in-person works, are you seeing that they are still very kind of PC notebook-centric weighted? Or are they going back to kind of pre-COVID mix level? Or any type of preference to what they're installing when they do come back to work? Chris Leahy : I would say if you were to take a scale of 1 to 100, how many are actually back in work, we're still very much on the lower end of the spectrum. So we still have a very large number of customers who are continuing to work remotely. For those who are going -- have some folks going back into the office. What we're observing is a continued investment in mobile employees, the ability to be in the office on a flexible basis, the ability to move around the office and use the office in a different way. Now the question is, what work are you doing in the office? And do you need to have more -- even more collaboration spaces and the ability for your employees to have mobile devices that they can move around with and take home? So I would say our view is that the flexible hybrid work environment is what the preponderance of our customers expect to be in over the long term. And that includes notebooks, a higher density end of notebooks, obviously, more enterprise-level collaboration capabilities.  We do have some customers who are contemplating whether to have a desktop in the office and a notebook at home for coworkers, it really depends on the industry. Things like lockers and hoteling are really points of discussion now. But that's what we're seeing overall, if that's helpful. Jim Suva : Great. And now that we're lapping 1 year of COVID, like for the education and government sectors, are they still very much needing to catch up and do a lot more PC and Chromebook installations? Or are they kind of this summer going to be in the procurement cycle for schools going back to school? Are they going to be like a little less notebook and Chromebook dependent? Or are they actually going to be more, because maybe there are some districts who are fully stocked and others who aren't?  Or are they not going to do more infrastructure? Just kind of curious of kind of what's your view for that. Chris Leahy : Yes. I guess if I think about K-12 education, I'll start with K-12, there are a couple of things. Device demand continues to remain strong because there is such a gap to that one-on-one device ratio that schools are trying to get to for equity and access and also for something they're referring to as learning loss, these gaps that might have happened over the pandemic. So there's plenty of headroom for devices going forward. With regard to CDW, what we face are tough compares from last year. So if you think about our growth over last year, very tough compares, but the demand is strong.  The other thing I would say is, as we're going into the next school year, schools are figuring -- and we're working with schools to figure out how to create the most optimal classroom experience, and that would be a blended experience, hybrid experience, all in-class. Schools really have -- they're looking at the ways of learning that they can use technology within a classroom or outside the classroom but within the walls of the school in much more creative ways. So from an infrastructure, I call it networking and particular perspective, we would expect to see upticks there. And then think of audio and visual. The older interactive flat screen panels are getting old now, but there are newer availabilities of solutions that work better. So that's another opportunity to help really modernize the classroom. So net-net, demand will remain strong with regard to devices, but the opportunity for infrastructure, network augmentation and for video will be a good opportunity as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt Sheerin : I just wanted to ask another question regarding the client devices and the PC upgrade cycle that's going on 3 to 4 years now. There's been talk obviously at some point that leveling off or being down, but we're also seem to be lapping the 4-year anniversary when companies started to upgrade to Windows 10. And given the constraints out there, it seems like there's still backlog. So could you talk to the client devices and notebook upgrade cycle and your thoughts there? Chris Leahy : Yes. Sure, Matt. Let me -- we'll talk a little bit about maybe tailwinds and headwinds. So when we think about tailwinds, certainly, the need for more remote devices, and we've talked a lot about that today, whether it's remote-enabled work or learning and device density. Then there are new use cases. We've seen a great uptick in Catalyst, for example, in terms of how our customers engage with their customers in new ways. So you've got demand from there. You've got leverage -- get the ability to leverage the stimulus. We've got those dollars flowing through. And then we also have our Corporate and Small Business segments that are recovering nicely, and the comparables over last year are pretty low. So we've got some positives in there. Then you mentioned the refresh, absolutely, 2017 and '18, we have seen and would expect to continue to see that refresh go on. So we are selling into that. On the headwind side, look, we had big overlaps over 2020 in some of our segments including K-12. And the economy is still a wildcard, though employment looks like it's picking up, and that's been quite helpful, frankly, in the Small Business space with regard to endpoint solutions. And then the last thing I would just emphasize is the headwinds and the challenges that we're facing. There's real lot visibility there. But otherwise, the demand for client devices continued to be strong. Matt Sheerin : Okay. And just a last quick one regarding the headcount, you talked about, I think, 200 additional coworkers, including 40 from the acquisition. But are you looking to continue to expand your coworker count this year given the relatively strong outlook for demand? Chris Leahy : Yes. We absolutely are going to continue to invest in our business, whether it's coworkers, other acquisitions or digital transformation, as Collin mentioned. So we certainly will continue to invest in our coworkers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast. Keith Housum : Collin, I'll echo a congratulations on retirement. In terms of this supply chain environment that we're currently in, does CDW have any pricing power, I guess, with some of its customers in the fact that it's just harder to get some of the product into their hands? Collin Kebo : No, Keith, I wouldn't think pricing power per se. I think the competitive advantage is probably more on the ability to secure supply to the tenants available and getting at least our fair share. I think ultimately, your ability to price through it is a function of the competitive environment and the customer's willingness to wait. And I think that's what's different now versus, say, 2, 3 quarters ago, where the customer wasn't willing or couldn't wait. So I don't know that there's a huge opportunity to pass along incremental pricing beyond what the market will bear is what I would say. Keith Housum : Fair enough. Fair enough. And in terms of the supply chain challenges that you're facing, are the challenges more on the logistical side? Or are they more on the components side that's going into the final products? Collin Kebo : I would say it's both. The components -- I mean, obviously, the processor shortage is well documented, but things like glass and -- it just -- all of the challenges associated with that. And then, again, the logistics challenges of ports and canals and natural disasters and all of those things. So it is really a confluence of events that are impacting supply. Operator : We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Chris Leahy, President and CEO, for closing remarks. Chris Leahy : Thank you. And thank you to everyone on the call today. I would like to really recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and they're extraordinarily committed approach to serving our customers, our partners and all of our CDW stakeholders. Our coworkers bring it every single day. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Brittany. I will begin this morning with an overview of second quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at the financials and capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks as always to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. We had a record second quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW\u2019s business model and strategy. For the second quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, a quarterly record in our first quarter over $5 billion of net sales. Net sales grew 17.9% above last year on a reported and average daily sales basis and up 16.3% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 18.2% to $883 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $418 million, an increase of 23.6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% on a reported basis and up 27.9% in constant currency. Our outstanding results reflect our team\u2019s extraordinary execution and the importance of our scale, industry experience and knowledge and strong customer relationships. The diversity of our customer end markets and breadth of our solutions portfolio continues to serve us well. Our record second quarter performance reflected a rebound in commercial customer spending, driving excellent results in our corporate small business and Canada segments and continued strength in our education channel. Our results reflect strong momentum across our business as technology spending recovers from lower spending last year and also increased demand as customers seek to modernize, optimize and innovate. In 2020, customers prioritize remote enablement and continuity. So far in 2021, customers have prioritized digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions as well as continued investments in endpoint solutions, driving strong growth for solutions and transactions. Customers are investing to enable the future and adding resilience into their operations, strengthening and securing infrastructure, platforms and endpoints, leveraging the cloud, preparing for return to in-person operations and industrializing remote enablement for permanently changed work models. We have combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and new logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. Our scale and strong financial position enabled us to continue helping customers navigate the choppy supply environment. As we previewed on our last earnings call, supply challenges increased during the second quarter for many transactional products and some infrastructure products. While riding strengthened as economies rebounded and more customers turn to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and lifecycle, our backlog increased compared to the first quarter. Another impact in the tight supply environment was increasing prices, which our teams were generally able to pass on. We expect supply constraints to continue through the second half of the year and into next year. Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the second quarter customer end market performance. Corporate increased 27% as customer spend sharply recovered with strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers remain focused on digital transformation, hybrid and cloud and security. Customers also began to prepare for employees to return to the office in the coming months, driving endpoint solutions, including notebooks, video and accessory growth. Our corporate backlog increased during the quarter as customers await availability due to standards requirements and generally larger orders. Small Business delivered exceptional growth, growing 60%, yes, 6-0 percent as optimism improved and hiring increased. Our team helps customers with remote enablement, security and video, leading to strong growth in both transactional and solution spend. As we have shared previously, Small Business customers tend to be nimbler in their technology requirements. So, performance was less impacted by supply constraints. Net sales for our government channel decreased 29%. Federal declined double-digits due to overlapping our device-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other client device programs that were strong last year. State & Local decreased mid single-digits. Customers evaluated their needs at the beginning of the quarter and started to make investments utilizing stimulus funding towards the end of the quarter, making timing versus demand more of a driver of performance. Our education channel grew 27%. The team delivered another $1 billion plus quarter with strong double-digit growth from both K-12 and higher ed. K-12 and higher ed customers are focused on investments to support equity and access and to enhance the in-classroom experience as schools prepare for students to return this fall, which drove both strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers continue to turn to us for our holistic capabilities across technology solutions and our deep education experience. Healthcare increased 7%, returning to year-over-year growth. Customers resumed projects that have been sidelined during the pandemic as budgets reopened driven by patients returning for elective procedures and providers made investments for the future. Growth was balanced between transactional and solutions categories. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, UK net sales decreased low single-digits overlapping strong public sector performance and reflecting a slower commercial recovery. The Canada team drove strong double-digit growth in local currency, powered by commercial customer strength and strong transactional and solutions performance. Our second quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. Transactions increased strong double-digits driven by client device growth of 17% as well as strong growth in video and accessories. Solutions also increased strong double-digits driven by software, collaboration tools and data center solutions. This led to balanced double-digit growth across hardware, software and services. Our services growth reflects strong organic performance and inorganic contributions. As I have shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double-digits across all customer segments driven by robust growth in security, infrastructure-as-a-service and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue and we are well-positioned to deliver. I want to take a moment to highlight our security process given its importance to our customers as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double-digits as customers improved their security frameworks to respond to increasing threats. Our teams help customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation. Our second quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. They are all important drivers of our past and future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extent of products, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers\u2019 total needs across the sector of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. Technology has become more essential to our customers and we are best positioned to help them navigate the complexity. And the final driver of our performance, our three-part strategy for growth, which is to : first, acquire new customers and actual share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action. Earlier this week, we announced that we acquired Focal Point. Focal Point is a leading provider of cybersecurity services with deep capabilities in identity and access management as well as the ability to serve customers across the full cybersecurity landscape. Focal Point is a leader in the cybersecurity space with an expert team and complementary customer relationships. As I have shared earlier, security is a top focus area for our customers. The addition of Focal Point expands and accelerates our security practice, adding over 200 coworkers who we welcome to CDW. We see many significant opportunities ahead and this is a great example of adding capability to help customers across the full technology solution stack and full technology lifecycle. We view M&A as an important part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDW\u2019s strategic capabilities. Our success is a testament to our coworkers, including those who joined CDW through acquisition, who have delivered consistent with the strategic rationale of each deal, delivering tremendous value to our customers. Let me share another example. Over the last year, education customers have embraced technology more than ever and fundamentally changed how they purchased with districts and school systems banding together to access stimulus programs and procure technology to enable remote hybrid and in-person model. A long-time higher ed customer who was transitioning from a decentralized technology program to centralized turned to us to provide a better end-user experience for its students and staff across its 20 plus campuses. Our team leveraged our digital capabilities to integrate directly into their systems. This greatly improved the ease of purchasing, providing configured branded bundles, hitting pre-negotiated pricing, direct-to-home logistics and product availability in a constrained environment. Our customer-first focus and logistical capabilities continue to be differentiators that drive value with our customers and vendor partners. This is a great example of how we leverage our competitive advantages win. Last, I want to share a story about a corporate customer that our team helps execute a global compute refresh, changing from a BYOD organization to corporate standards. The Director of Global IT service delivery leading the project has turned exclusively to us to partner on this important initiative for over 8,000 employees in 20 countries. Having a global partner was very important. Our teams in the US, UK and Canada worked closely together to deliver for the customer. We worked with our vendor partners to ensure we had product when the customer needed it, which is crucial in the current environment and the capability we have, given our partner relationships, strong financial position and distribution centers. What started as a device refresh has led to partnering on the customers\u2019 return to office initiative and technology enhancements as well as software and security projects, throwing the account from less than $1 million in net sales last year to over $7 million this year. Our team understood the customers\u2019 challenges and leveraged CDW\u2019s capabilities on a worldwide basis to provide outstanding service, leading to more opportunities. These examples highlight CDW\u2019s three-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the value of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I am so proud of the way our teams continued to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. During the quarter, our teams continued to safely reengage with customers and partners in-person. Although the environment is dynamic, groups of coworkers have started to return to our offices for key meetings and small events and others are starting to work more regularly in our offices. Our ReunITe team is working hard to thoughtfully re-imagine and orchestrate the future of work, so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can, while we continue to fortify our strong culture. Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are again increasing our outlook for both U.S. IT market growth and CDW\u2019s net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market to grow about 5% and our top line to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. For the third quarter, we expect customer demand trends to continue and have confidence in how our teams are executing and in our solutions and services portfolio. That said we remain cautious about the supply environment, which we expect to continue to be challenged. While there are other wildcards such as COVID variant, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. Technology is more essential to all sectors of the economy and will continue to play an increasingly important role in years ahead. We have great confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and outexecute our competition. Finally, let me take a moment to update you on our CFO transition. The process is progressing very well. I am really pleased with the caliber of candidates interested and excited about CDW. We will provide further updates once the process is complete. Until then, Collin is fully engaged and after his successor\u2019s name, we will remain on board to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I will turn it over to Collin. Collin Kebo : Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with more detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8, consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, up 17.9% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 16.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales increased more than $0.5 billion or 11.2%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 4.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were stronger than expected reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the rebound was sharper than expected in several channels, most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Corporate, Small Business and CDW Canada all delivered very healthy double-digit growth versus 2020 and are up versus 2019. So, the strong growth reflects more than easy comparisons. As Chris mentioned, education momentum continued, delivering the fourth consecutive quarter of over $1 billion of net sales. On the supply side, while the backlog increased several hundred million dollars in the second quarter, the team did a great job leveraging CDW\u2019s competitive advantages and supporting stronger than expected demand, so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $883 million, an increase of 18.2%. Gross margin was 17.2%, up approximately 10 basis points versus last year primarily driven by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily software-as-a-service and strong professional services performance, partially offset by overlapping higher margin configuration services for the Census project last year. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9, non-GAAP SG&A increased 13.6%. The increase was primarily driven by payroll costs, including sales compensation, which moves with gross profit growth; performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals; and investments in the business, including coworker count to drive our strategy. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was 10,666. Coworker count increased 480 from the first quarter and 618 from the prior year. The increase in coworker count reflects organic and inorganic investments to support high growth solution areas and our digital transformation. GAAP operating income was $370 million, up 30.5%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $418 million, up 23.6%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.1%. Moving to Slide 10, interest expense was $36 million, down 10.6%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year\u2019s refinancing, a lower LIBOR rate and lower revolving credit facility borrowings. Other income reflects $36 million from the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investment. Proceeds from the sale were excluded from non-GAAP metrics. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26.2%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $97 million compared to $56 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.4% and up 50 basis points versus last year\u2019s rate, primarily due to higher foreign taxes. As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $142 million GAAP net income per share, was $1.93, up 47.4%. Our non-GAAP net income was $286 million in the quarter, up 27%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% from last year. Turning to first half results on Slides 14 through 19, net sales were $10 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 14.9% on an average daily sales basis as we had one fewer selling day in the first half of 2021. The one fewer selling day will be made up in Q4 when we have one extra selling day compared to the prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, first half consolidated net sales were 13.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.7 billion up 11.6% and gross profit margin was 16.8% down approximately 40 basis points. Operating income was $693 million and non-GAAP operating income was $786 million, up 22.4%. Net income was $507 million, and non-GAAP net income was $536 million, up 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $3.76, up 27.9%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20, at June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion and net debt was $3.4 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $110 million, as shown on Slide 21. This was lighter than a typical first half but expected given last year\u2019s record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and one-time items. Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. Additionally, working capital increases during periods of rapid growth and we made strategic investments in inventory to support customers during this choppy supply environment. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $433 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $377 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $170 per share. Moving to Slide 22, the 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 4 days from last year\u2019s second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by improved accounts receivable collection performance. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 23, our priorities remain the same : first, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the second quarter at 2.1x, up 0.4 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Focal Point and Amplified IT are great examples. And fourth, we turn excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5x to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We now expect to return over $1.7 billion to shareholders in 2021, including at least $1.5 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. This $0.5 billion increase from last quarter\u2019s comments reflects our confidence in the cash flow generation and earnings power of the business. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets, and we will continue to deploy capital for M&A that passes our screens. Of course, as we always do, we will closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 24, the current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers and in CDW Canada. On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Notebooks, displays, docking stations, certain infrastructure hardware, including networking and servers are constrained, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call, and most vendor partners do not expect the situation to improve in the second half. With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency including the contribution from Focal Point. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 80 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the strong mid-teens, call it, 16% to 16.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. The updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.35 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter, the 2015 to 2019 5-year average sequential increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis was approximately 4%, and we expect this year\u2019s third quarter to be in line with normal seasonality, which equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow low double digits. Our updated outlook for the balance of the year assumes modest growth in the backlog. If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the second half and into 2022. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over-delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow, including capital expenditures and the cash conversion cycle, can also be found on Slide 25. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I\u2019ll ask Tamia to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matt Cabral : Yes. Thank you very much. It sounds like a strong quarter on the client device side again. There is some concern out in the marketplace around just the sustainability of PC and Chromebook demand. Curious what you\u2019re hearing from your customers around sustainability of demand. And I guess I also heard the commentary about the backlog continuing to grow. Just curious how much of that increase was within PC specifically. And when do you think you\u2019ll actually be able to catch up to that backlog? Chris Leahy : Good morning, Matt. It\u2019s Chris. Look, on demand, I would tell you what we\u2019re seeing from customers is continued resiliency and need for devices, whether it is more devices in the hands of people who are working remotely or at least partially remotely kids in school, new use cases the ability to utilize the stimulus dollars now to buy those devices. And then you add on refresh that\u2019s coming up a pretty large installed base that\u2019s looking towards refresh. I would just tell you that the demand feels resilient. Vis-\u00e0-vis CDW, we certainly have some tough overlaps, some compares we\u2019re looking at in K12 given the enormous growth last year. But generally speaking, demand remains solid. On the supply side, Chromebooks have really started to ease up a little bit. That\u2019s \u2013 the OEMs had to plan for that last fall and they did, but we are still seeing supply constraints with regard to notebooks. Collin Kebo : Yes, Matt, I would just add in terms of the composition of the growth in the backlog. As Chris said, notebook certainly contributed to that with Chromebooks getting better, but we did see backlog growth in some of the other areas in the transactional part of the business, things like displays and panels and monitors, things like that. And then we also saw the backlog increase across some infrastructure products. Matt Cabral : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then for my follow-up, on operating margin, you guys just did 8.1%. And if I look at the first half, you\u2019re slightly below 8%. I guess the full year guidance, if I heard it correctly, is still for mid-7s. So I guess just wondering what the offsets are in the second half of the year. And maybe just help us bridge from that first half to the second half. Chris Leahy : Yes. On the full year guide, mid-7s, obviously, there is a range there. I\u2019d expect us probably to be at the stronger end of that mid-7s. But as you think about the back half of the year, as we talked about in our prepared comments, we believe now is the time to invest in the business, and we will continue to aggressively invest in the business. You saw that we added nearly 500 coworkers in the second quarter. As those coworkers come into the P&L, obviously, all of that\u2019s not reflected as we go forward. So we will be carrying two full quarters of expense for that and continuing to make additional investments in the business. Matt Cabral : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryani with Evercore. Your line is open. Lexi Curnin : Hi. This is Lexi Curnin on for Amit. So, yes, thank you for taking the question. And I guess, Collin, you just mentioned investing back into the business. And it would be great if you could talk about some of those initiatives that you\u2019re set to undertake there. Collin Kebo : Yes, I\u2019m happy to take that. It\u2019s really a variety of initiatives, both organically and inorganically. On the organic side, we continue to invest behind the areas solutions areas that are particularly high value to our customers, so customer-facing coworkers and technical areas, both on the presales and the service delivery side. I think you began to see some of the fruits of those investments in the second quarter as we referenced the success that we were having in the professional services part of the business. We are also making investments in our own digital transformation into our own infrastructure to drive productivity with our sales force and how we interact with customers and just how we scale and operate the business more efficiently. Lexi Curnin : Great. Thank you so much. Collin Kebo : Thanks, Lexi. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess first, talk about what the drivers are behind the assumption of greater share gains this year, which is reflected in the 425 to 500 basis point growth premium. Chris Leahy : Well, good morning, Katy. Good to hear from you. In terms of our increase, look, if you look at where we\u2019ve had meaningful growth, client devices, video, other hardware categories and what customers\u2019 priorities are going forward, where they are allocating more technology spend to infrastructure needs, we don\u2019t think the market is growing at the same rate that we are growing. So we\u2019re flowing some of that increase through to our premium. And as you know, the CDW tends to outpace the U.S. IT market by more than 200 to 300 basis points in periods of hardware fresh. So we tend to overindex because we have more recognized at the net line. The one thing I would say is supply remains a wildcard. Collin\u2019s talked about it. I\u2019ve talked about it. We\u2019re not underestimating supply. The teams have done a phenomenal job, frankly, in managing it and getting our fair, fair share. But we think that given the mix of what we\u2019re seeing our customers buy and how that hits the top line, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving this \u2013 the view on that. Katy Huberty : But also just to follow-up on that, Chris, it does seem like the supply environment is working to your favor. It\u2019s hitting everyone but it seems like it\u2019s hitting your business less than others, and that\u2019s also driving some of the share gains. Is that fair? Chris Leahy : Well, yes, that is fair, Katy to some extent. Look, our distribution center, our logistics capabilities, all the things that we talk about put us in a position where we \u2013 customers are betting on us. They are turning to us as their best bet to get supply, and partners understand that. So I\u2019d like to say we get our fair, fair share. You can say we get our unfair share, but we do tend to benefit in supply-constrained environment. That said, I just \u2013 I\u2019ll repeat what we\u2019ve been saying for the past couple of quarters. It\u2019s so prevalent at this point and the visibility is very difficult that it\u2019s hard to really have a good view over the next couple of quarters other than just saying we think it\u2019s going to get a little worse before it gets better. It\u2019s going to continue into next year. But I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019ve been working very closely with our OEMs, and they have just been terrific. And we\u2019re also working closely with customers to find choices for them if they are willing to move their requirements and their standards, which small businesses or others aren\u2019t. But yes, we generally \u2013 because we can create a solution and deliver to customers, we generally get our greater than fair share, if you will. Katy Huberty : Thank you for that. I guess maybe a follow-up for Collin. As you turned into the September quarter and the month of July, was \u2013 did you see any change in the pace of order growth or the degree of supply constraints in the first few weeks of the current quarter? Collin Kebo : Yes, Katy, we\u2019re really not providing more detail on Q3 intra-quarter beyond what we shared in the comments, which was we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with commercial customers and in CDW Canada. And on the supply side, we are expecting modest growth in the backlog as we move throughout the year. Katy Huberty : Great. Thank you. Collin Kebo : Thanks, Katy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. And congratulations on great results and the increased outlook. There is a bit of a debate out there about double bookings and over-ordering from basically every end market. So I was hoping you could kind of give some commentary because I would kind of assume, and maybe I\u2019m wrong, that small and midsized businesses and Education really can\u2019t and don\u2019t double order because they just don\u2019t have quite a large needs as maybe, say, the Fortune 100 companies where they know they are going to always need so much. Maybe I\u2019m wrong on that, but any thoughts about double ordering from your end markets? And then that leads to the follow-up question part about \u2013 the concern about a potential pocket of error or a slowdown post when the supply chain gets back to equilibrium. Any commentaries on those would be great. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes, sure. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with the first one in terms of double ordering. Of course, that\u2019s something that we would \u2013 we always worry about and look at carefully in this type of environment. What I\u2019d tell you is the information that we are working with our OEMs to get and provide some level of visibility to our customers is resonating really well. And therefore, they have a level of content, when CDW says it\u2019s going to be 8 weeks or 12 weeks, and we can get it, that we actually have it or can get it. We have seen minimal. It\u2019s really any double ordering with our customers. So we feel very confident in the new orders have come in, in our backlog and in the way that we\u2019re operating with the customers. In terms of an air pocket, Collin, do you want to chat a little bit about backlog supply and air pockets? Collin Kebo : Yes. Sure, Chris. Maybe I\u2019ll just add a little bit on to the double ordering comment as well, Jim. I think also, when you think about what the majority of our customers are ordering, they are not widgets. It\u2019s customized to the specs of a large corporate customer or the needs of the school district. And the thought that you\u2019re going to place an order like that with multiple vendors, I think, is low. At very small and \u2013 a small office, home office customer that needs 20 notebooks, it\u2019s impossible that there is some double ordering going on there. Yes. But I think overall, when you look at the backlog, we feel pretty good that those are firm orders sitting in the backlog. The comment I\u2019ll make actually gets into your next one. What we have seen, though, is what I would call an order pull-forward-where customers are placing orders sooner than they might normally because of the supply environment or to try to get ahead of expected price increases from our OEM vendor partners. So sitting in that backlog is a little bit of a pull-forward. And I think that\u2019s getting to your question around the air pocket. I guess the way I think about it is there is a little bit of a hedge here. To the extent that there may then be a little bit of a lull in the ordering. If, at some point in the future, orders return to a normal timing and flow pattern, we would also then have the flush of the backlog at some point in time. So I think maybe that\u2019s one way to think about it. Jim Suva : Great. Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. Appreciate it. Collin Kebo : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about some of the stimulus programs that are out there and being discussed and how you think it may benefit, I realize timing is a question. But thinking about the infrastructure plan that\u2019s being discussed, also E-Rate, I think there were some changes to that. And then are you hearing any of the education customers talking about using some of the prior stimulus, because I think there is still an awful lot of that money floating around. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes, Shannon. Well, yes, to all your questions, let me start with education. There is the Emerging Connectivity Act which is about $7.1 billion, and we have worked closely with educational systems to tap that. So, that\u2019s been something that the education customers are very focused on and taking advantage of with our help facilitating and navigating. So, absolutely there. And we also say State & Local, we have talked about the three rounds of stimulus funding, last March, last December, this March and how that impact is stable, in particular, because in December\u2019s Appropriations Act, there was no additional funding for State & Local. So, State & Local tended to pause kind of step back and say, what\u2019s going to happen in the next round. Well, in the next round, which is this March, there were dollars allocated to State & Local. So, we have now seen the use of those funds pick up. I would tell you that the first couple of months in this quarter was a lot of assessing, understanding, again, working with our customers to help them understand how to tap the funds and where we get the money, how to get the money, etcetera. But we did see a nice pickup in the last part of second quarter in terms of using the stimulus dollars. So, that\u2019s another area where we are seeing strength in stimulus. In terms of the packages coming forward, the new ones coming out yet to be seen, we will review those. And to the extent that there is opportunity to help our customers, certainly, we will take advantage of those. Clearly, the focus of the administration on things like technology, infrastructure or technology as infrastructure and cyber security are high on the list of priorities for our customers, and we have capabilities that can help them to both implement solutions around those, but more importantly, navigate the stimulus funds. So, we will \u2013 I think we will be very effective in doing that. Shannon Cross : Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up, in terms of cash flow, is there anything we should think about \u2013 just the demand is so strong in so many areas you have backlog. And that \u2013 I mean, how should we think about cash flow dynamics from a working capital perspective in coming quarters, because I would assume it\u2019s somewhat of a fluid situation. Thank you. Collin Kebo : Yes. Shannon, from a cash flow perspective, obviously, as the business experiences rapid growth, we do make an investment in working capital, and you saw some of that in the quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have intentionally been carrying higher inventory levels, specifically customer-specific inventory to help them work through rollouts of their projects. So, I think as long as we are in this choppy supply environment, I would expect inventory to be running higher than typical levels. As it relates to our total free cash flow, we were down in the first half of the year relative to a normal first half of the year. I would attribute that, though, mostly to the strong timing and things we benefit from in the prior year and not indicative of any type of change in the future free cash flow generation capability of the business. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, can you give us your thoughts on the Federal business, I mean, you are facing tough comps from the U.S. Census project. But just wondering when that business can turnaround and grow year-on-year. Are there projects that you are seeing where some government agencies probably have PCs that are coming up that are \u2013 10 PCs even that are coming up for replacement. So, just your thoughts on the opportunity set that you have in Federal and when that business can turn around from a year-on-year growth standpoint? Chris Leahy : Sure. Good morning, Ruplu. What I would say about the Fed business is we had a number of large opportunities that are going to be rolling out in the second half of the year and others that we are pursuing. Overlapping expenses projects, we knew we had that and we had another \u2013 a number of other very large client device projects last year. So, what we have been putting in the back half of the year is not going to be enough likely to overcome that. But look, the beauty of our model is the diversity of our customer end markets. So, we said having such strength last year in the sense of \u2013 and kind of coming back to the year, if you will, with I would say, next year, 2022, picking up from a growth perspective, we have got all of our other customer end markets that are going to be constrained. The other thing I would just say is a reminder of the Federal space. The Census deal and some other deals that we are doing there are, frankly, that we are working on that are fairly similar, really reflects the positioning that we have with our customers in that customer end market, which is a real thought leader, a real solutions provider and a services first player. So kudos to the team for continuing to grow our reputation and capabilities and we can see it paying off in the opportunities that we have got in the pipeline. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Got it. Thanks for the details on that, Chris. And just for my follow-up, Collin, can I ask, of the 50 basis points improvement sequentially that you saw in operating margin, is there a way to quantify how much of that was mix versus higher volumes or FX? And is there anything in that that is not sustainable going forward? Thanks. Collin Kebo : Yes. Ruplu, if you think about it, the gross margin improved sequentially. We went from a 16.4% to 17.2%. So, that was 80 basis points. Now we have a variable cost structure, so, not all of that passes to the operating margin. I would say that there are some elements of seasonality in that. When you think about \u2013 there is a software vendor, a big partner of ours who has a fiscal year end in June. And as we mentioned in our comments, we had very strong software results and very strong cloud and Software as a Service results. So, we did benefit seasonally from mixing into some netted down items there that I wouldn\u2019t expect to recur at necessarily the same pace in the second half of the year. And then also our partner funding improved a bit sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Our partners reimburse some of our advertising. And as we increased our advertising investment sequentially, you saw part of that sitting in the gross margin. So, I think most of the increase then is primarily explained by the gross margin. And then in terms of how you think about the back half of the year, I just \u2013 the comment I made to Matt earlier in the call around we are continuing to invest in the business, and that co-worker count gets layered in and you will have full quarter\u2019s worth of that expense coming up in subsequent quarters. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for all the details. I appreciate it. Collin Kebo : Thanks Ruplu. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. I wanted to ask, again, regarding the strength that you are seeing on the corporate side, reacceleration there. And you did talk about on-prem infrastructure spending. Is that just based on pent-up demand? Are you seeing companies reinvest as they are getting back to the office? And in terms of the areas you talked about, networking, you have talked about servers, could you just give more color on what you are seeing there? Chris Leahy : Yes. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a little bit of everything you mentioned there. We certainly are seeing this driven by folks getting back to the office. We are seeing it pent-up demand. I think one of \u2013 our leader in the solutions area for our partner relationships kind of refer to 2020 as a range away in terms of as we think about refresh. And that\u2019s not a bad way to think about it. Last year was a pause on a lot of things. So, now we are seeing servers growing double digits. Certainly, what our customers are focusing on is things like workload optimization and application performance. And so that\u2019s where they are focusing to invest in infrastructure. And ultimately, frankly, this is tied to supporting digital transformation, which is at the forefront of every customer\u2019s mind. So I think if we look forward, hybrid work is driving assessment on what customers are going to need, so supporting the office. As we get new next-gen releases in computer technologies, given the analytic heavy nature of the future and the analytics that customers are needing to really win and keep in the marketplace, I think we are going to continue to see some upgrades in the needs there. And then in the other areas like storage, what we are seeing now is a real enhanced focus on data center observability. So, customers are looking at costs and optimizing operations. And so there is a growing and leading system, modest churn and automation. And so our Digital Velocity and ServiceNow businesses are really on fire. And we are just continuing to scrutinize the spend. Now that said, where our customers are ending up, I think, and is proved out by how customers are in-house in the future is a multi-cloud world, which includes on-prem, on-subject cloud-like capabilities, which is growing in terms of \u2013 assets as well as multiple clouds that they are using. Last year, I think we talked about, and earlier this year, about customers really taking a step back and reassess how to optimize their infrastructure, and that\u2019s what we are seeing. The good news is whether they are refreshing and updating, whether they are moving to a meter consumption model on time, whether they are going to colo or whether they are moving workloads to various clouds, public clouds, we are helping them at the front end to play in that, then to implement the plan. So, it keeps us right front and center of helping them to deploy their infrastructure strategy. Matt Sheerin : Got it. Thanks very much for that. And my second question regarding the education market. Obviously, it\u2019s been a huge growth area for you now running roughly 20% of revenue versus low to mid-teens 18, 19. So \u2013 and you talked about some of the continued strong drivers, including funding. At some point, though, I would expect a lot of that spending to wind down. So, what should we expect in terms of the base case for that market? It should be higher because you have got a lot more school districts using devices, maintenance, etcetera. But how should we think about that business long-term for you? Chris Leahy : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, and we continue to see it as a growth opportunity. If we just think about the various cycles we have been through in K-12, you can go back 10 years, where Chromebooks were introduced and we created this with good service, and then we help to see modernization of the classroom. And every cycle that education has been through, CDW has been at the forefront of helping educators, administrators, technology to figure out the best way to teach kids, to educate in the classroom and now outside the classroom in different ways, in the learning \u2013 in the typical facility, at home, in the classroom. So, we continue to see it as a growth opportunity because of the natural evolution of education in this country and in our other markets. I think, certainly, given how strong last year was, in particular, Q4, I don\u2019t think we are going to see the kind of equity and access, the classroom experience opportunities that we are selling into. We are not going to see ourselves overlap or overcome how well we did last quarter. But over the long-term, Matt, I would say it\u2019s a great market. We have fantastic expertise, especially when you think about Amplified IT, the acquisition we did last quarter. And we are seeing traction in the market incredibly strong. So, we are very bullish on K-12. Matt Sheerin : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Keith Housum : Good morning guys. Just a quick question here on the latest acquisition of Focal Point Data, can you give us a little bit of color in terms of like the margin profile? And I guess what I am trying to look at here is how quick or what\u2019s going to be the impact on the overall operating margins of CDW over the next year or 2 years. I mean I am assuming we would expect that to go higher because of these acquisitions. But hopefully, you could provide some color and some idea of the context. Collin Kebo : Hi. Good morning, Keith. We typically would not provide that level of granularity with our acquisitions. I guess it\u2019s \u2013 while strategically important and of high value to our customers and sellers, it is a services business. So, in terms of just absolute magnitude of contribution to CDW, I would say the impact will be relatively small. And as we stated in the press release on Monday, I expect it not to have a material impact to earnings for the full year. I guess what I would say, though, is, I mean, if you look at the investments we have been making over the past couple of quarters, we have been picking up the services businesses that are of high value to our customers. And I think collectively, they are contributing to some of the gross margin strength, and you saw that in the second quarter, and we commented on it. So, I wouldn\u2019t call out anything specifically, but would just say, in aggregate, the investments we are making behind the services businesses in the high-growth areas that our value to our customers are helping the margin. Keith Housum : Great. I appreciate it. And then looking at the overall environment now, obviously, raw materials are a significant cost for the complete increases that we are seeing in technology. Is there a way to kind of like provide an average of what you are seeing in terms of price increases within your biggest sellers? I mean are we seeing 4% to 5% increases right now? And is that going to contribute to growth here not only in the second half of the year, but into next year as well? Collin Kebo : In terms of contribution to our sales growth, Keith? Keith Housum : Yes. Collin Kebo : Yes. That\u2019s a difficult question to answer at a portfolio level, because much of what we sell doesn\u2019t have a hardware unit associated with it, right, when you think about software, services, cloud and then you see things like value shifting to the software for integrated solutions. But maybe one way to think about it is if I pick a big category like client devices, which were up high teens in the quarter, we saw balanced growth in terms of both units and ASPs, average selling price, and that was true for most customer end markets. So, it\u2019s a combination of both unit growth and pricing. Keith Housum : It\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess in your prepared remarks and through the call, you have talked about investments and this being the right time to invest back in the business. Just wondering how should we think about that and interpret that from a model perspective. Like are we entering a period of time when your OpEx increases will be more in line with revenue growth or does the longer term model still remain kind of for OpEx to be below \u2013 OpEx increases to be below revenue growth? And just trying to figure out where we are in terms of time period of investment? And I have a follow-up as well. Thank you. Collin Kebo : Yes. Samik, thanks for joining the call and welcome. We haven\u2019t provided multiyear thoughts \u2013 just a view for the year. And you can see for the full year, we continue to believe we will deliver a mid-7 operating margin. So, you can then think about those investments being funded within the context of that, those thoughts around the operating margin. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Just a quick follow-up, I think from \u2013 you mentioned for 3Q, you are expecting it to be very in line with seasonality that you have seen historically. If I walk through the numbers and try to get an implied 4Q here, it does look like your \u2013 and if I am doing the math right, it looks like you are guiding something very in line again with seasonality. Just thinking with all the backlog that you have and the demand backdrop that we are in, where things are pretty strong, is that the right way to look at it given that expecting a seasonal moderation in December or should we be expecting something better? Collin Kebo : Yes. I think you can do the math, given the thoughts on the guide for the third quarter and then what\u2019s left over for the fourth quarter. I would just be careful about your thoughts on the backlog. As we said, we don\u2019t assume an improvement in the backlog at our full year modeling thoughts. So, that\u2019s not captured. And if the backlog were to get worked down, that would be upside to the outlook. And I think when you run the math, on what the implied Q4 growth rate is year-over-year, that\u2019s again just a reflection of some of the big overlaps that we have been talking about, specifically within education in the fourth quarter. Last year, we had the large Mississippi Department of Education deal, and obviously, a big contribution from the census that the devices came back. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Collin Kebo : Okay. Thank you, Samik. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Chris Leahy for closing remarks. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Tania. And let me close by saying I would like to acknowledge first, the incredible dedication of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, partners and all of our CDW stakeholders, particularly this quarter, our first quarter delivering over $5 billion in sales, an extraordinary quarter, supporting our customers. Thank you all. Thank you also to our customers for the great privilege and opportunity to serve you. And to our investors and analysts participating in the call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

In addition, all references to growth rates for hardware, software, and services today represent U.S. net sales only and do not include the results from CDW UK, or Canada. Replay of this webcast will be posted to our website later today. I also want to remind you that the conference call is property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the Company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with an overview of third quarter results and drivers of performance. Al will take you then through a more detailed look at our financials, as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as we always try to do to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. But before I get started, I do want to pause for a moment to honor the life and legacy of our former CEO, Tom Richards, who passed away last week after a valiant fight with cancer. I suspect most of you on this call have likely met Tom in-person. I'm certain that everyone on this call has been impacted by Tom. He was a fierce competitor and equally a kind human being. Tom had a lot of what we like to call it CDW Tomism. Simple ways of getting to the essence of something in a way that it stuck. One of my personal favorites is when Tom used to say, At CDW, we take what we do seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. That's the essence of who we are. That is our CDW culture. Captured those simply and amplified those strongly, by Tom Richards. Tom also had an unexpected way of signing off on our earnings calls, usually with a right comment about an upcoming holiday, like Halloween or Mother's Day, or even Valentine's Day. As a result, we always ended these calls on a high note and with a chuckle. Tom knew his audience well. In honor of Tom, I'd like to kick off this earnings call with the tagline he penned on every communication to a co-worker. Tom always signed off with \"you make a difference. \" Literally injecting into each co-worker Tom's personal belief in them, and their important impact. On behalf of all of our coworkers around the globe, our customers and our partners, our communities and our investors, I would like to say thank you to Tom. You made a difference. Let me turn now to Q3 performance. Once again, CDW posted strong top-line growth and profitability. Overall, demand was strong and the teams did a great job addressing customer needs.  For the quarter we delivered record net sales of $5.311 billion, 0.4% higher than last year, and up 10.7% in constant-currency, non-GAAP operating income of $435 million up 12.6% and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.13, 13.4% higher than last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant-currency. Our ability to deliver this strong top line and profitability was the result of 3 key drivers; our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio, and our ongoing execution against our three-part strategy, which is focused on taking share and investing in solutions and capabilities our customers need and want. Let me walk through each one of these and share some detail about how they contributed to our performance.  First, our balanced portfolio of customer and markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels : corporate, small business, healthcare, government, which includes federal and state and local customers, and education with K-12 and higher ed. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own way. Often, different factors impact these diverse customer end markets. And this quarter we saw that play out as our commercial business in the U.S. are small on corporate channels. And our international operations posted significant double-digit increases, while our U.S. public business posted a mid-single-digit decline. From a macro perspective, supply remained under pressure this quarter. Demand outpaced supply and lead times extended particularly in several solutions areas. The team continued to leverage our distribution centers, expensive logistics capabilities, keep vendor partner relationships, and strong Balance Sheet, and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. They did an exceptional job working with our partners to stay on top of availability status. Our sellers and technical specialists also worked with customers and whenever possible, found alternative available product and built alternative solutions. These efforts helped mitigate some of the pressure and our backlog increase was consistent with last quarter. The tight supply environment continued to impact prices, which our teams were generally able to pass along. Let's take a deeper look at third quarter customer and market performance. Commercial customer priorities remain the same as in the second quarter, digital transformation, security, and hybrid and cloud solutions. Customers continue to prioritize investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure platform and endpoints. Within this backdrop, corporate increased 25% and customer demand remained strong. While many customers delayed return to office, they continued to prepare as well as invest to facilitate hybrid work.  This drove ongoing strong double-digit increases in transactions propelled by notebooks, audio visual, and desktop. At the same time, digital transformation remains a top priority. While buying sentiment was clearly there, in many cases, the product was not. Writings were strong, but with extended lead time, backlog built during the quarter. Lack of product availability, particularly in Netcom and storage, muted corporate solutions growth. Small business also delivered another exceptional quarter of growth, increasing almost 40%. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement, security, and video, driving strong growth across both transactional and solutions categories. As we have shared previously, small business customers tend to be more flexible in their technology requirements. So while they did see some impact from supply constraints, small business did not experience as much at corporate. A great example of the power of diverse end markets.  You also see the power of our diverse end markets in our public performance. Net sales for our government channels decreased 33%. federal declines double-digit in large part due to the overlapping of our devices in Service Solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other clients advice programs that were particularly strong last year. Security remains robust with net sales up more than 30%. The gears of Washington were slower than typical at federal year-end, and we had contracting delays in several large contracts. This is not unusual, given the magnitude of federal contracts, timing can influence performance. You've heard us talk about federal lumpy nature in the past. This will unwind and we expect to see a reversal back to growth in the first half of 2022. State and local posted a mid-single-digit decline. Stimulus funding remained largely unallocated to the local level. This is because access to multi-year American Rescue Plan Act funding with deadlines in 2024, lead to greater focus on multi-year budget planning. At the same time, state and local customers were focused on digesting last year's meaningful stimulus funded IT investments. We continue to work with our customers, but given the complexity of the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing, we do not expect to see projects moving ahead meaningfully until early 2022. Education increased by 2%. Higher Ed delivered high single-digit growth driven by ongoing focus on campus connectivity, and enhancing the dorm room experience with double-digit growth in both security software and servers. The K-12 team did an excellent job and matched last year's record net sales, coming in flat on top of last year's 30% plus growth.  This was consistent with the expectations we shared on our year-end 2020 call, where we looked for strong non-seasonal first-half performance to be followed by a deceleration in the second half. Chromebook availability continued to improve during the quarter, and client devices increased low single-digits on top of last year's stimulant equity and access driven growth. Overall, transactions increased low single-digits on top of last year's strong double-digit growth. Solutions declined driven by a double-digit decline in Netcom largely reflecting supply challenges. We continue to expect above historical net sales against some very tough unseasonal fourth quarter compares. Healthcare posted a 31% increase. By the second wave of COVID, staff shortages and limited ICU bed availability during the quarter, some projects that had been sidelined did resume.  This was particularly the case in security as healthcare remains a target for cybercrime. Our security experts continue to guide hospital systems to find the best solutions that protect their sensitive data and security sales increased strong double-digits. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations increased over 30% on a reported basis. Both the UK and Canada delivered mid-20% growth in local currency. Customer priorities in both markets remain the same as the U.S. Digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions, as do their investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations. Both operations experienced increased back-orders. Clearly, the 11% plus sales growth we delivered, demonstrates the power of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. It also demonstrates the power of the second driver of our performance [Indiscernible] this quarter, the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio, which you can see in our major category performance.  Transactions increased low double-digits driven by client device growth in video. Solutions were flat with double-digit increases in servers and collaboration. Once again, increased [Indiscernible] from double-digit. We saw robust growth across all 3 top cloud workloads, security, infrastructure as-a-service, and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. And once again, given [Indiscernible] importance to our customers, our security practice delivered at first [Indiscernible] was up strong double-digits. Our teams continue to guide customers on their security posture. Assess the environment, design the best approach, and deploy and manage the solutions throughout its lifecycle. Overall, for the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in hardware, low-single-digit growth in software, and strong double-digit growth in services. Software net sales increased low-single-digit, strong double-digit increase in security software, database software, and backup, and recovery were partially offset by declines in network management, software storage, and telephony related software. As I have shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. This [Indiscernible] contribution and was driven by both professional and managed services. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making in our three-part strategy for growth. As you know, in October, we announced our planned acquisition of Sirius Computer Solutions. When we announced the acquisition, I shared how it deepens and adds scale to our services capabilities. Capabilities that will ensure we remain the trusted technology advisor to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation. Notice EBITDA deepens, Sirius is additive to our existing capabilities.  Capabilities we have built for both organic and inorganic investments. Capabilities that enable us to serve customers as their trusted advisor, whether in a physical, digital, or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally. Why so many investments in services capabilities? Simply put, services are becoming an increasingly larger component of total customer IT spend. For CDW services position us to enable the whole solution, increase our engagement with customers and stickiness, and provide insight into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IP life cycle. Today, IT leaders are accountable for both running -- to both run the business and transform it, leaders need to invest resources where they can have the greatest impact. And do so with the greatest speed. Services are critical to making this happen. To address this full-stack and full lifecycle, our technical organization has grown to more than 3,700 pre -sale specialists and engineers.  Today, we can deliver complex digital [Indiscernible] let me share an example of how our services team is helping the global online home retailer transform their business for their next wave of growth. Experience from [Indiscernible] customer opt is for a combination of [Indiscernible] public cloud technologies and new cloud-native plant -- pattern. This would create the agility they needed [Indiscernible] environment. A great idea, but accelerating cloud technology requires specialized expertise that is inefficient to keep on staff, and that is for CDW payment. First we leveraged our cloud managed services and offloaded some of the cloud projects from the customer to CDW. Then we pulled in our digital velocity talents orchestration services for DVT. DVT orchestration supplies customers with talent to work inside the customer's existing team, Talent that is becoming more and more vital in today's environment. Digital velocity, talent, orchestration delivers highly vetted resources, whether already employed by CDW or sourced by us.  CDW services, enabled the solution. But it did so much more. As you can imagine, this level of high touch integration creates customer loyalty with ongoing relationships on the ground, and continued exchange between CDW and the customer, ultimately leading to more business. Great for the customer, and great for CDW. This is an excellent example of our three-part strategy in action and how M&A enhances our organic investments to ensure we remain our customer's number one choice as a trusted advisor. Solving key business problems for our customer in today's environment requires strong service and solutions capabilities. Capabilities that when combined with our great relationships and competitive advantages of skill, scope, and disciplined execution, enable us to win in the marketplace and deliver sustainable, profitable growth today and in the future.  And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. We continue to look for growth in 2021 to come in between 9 and 1/4% and 10% in [Indiscernible] report currency. Split roughly between 5% IT market growth and 425 to 500 basis points to CDW market outperformance. This reflects our expectation that supply constraints do not mitigate anytime in the near future, but do not get materially worse. Remember these constraints don't just reflect component shortages, but also labor and logistics challenges, challenges we do not expect to reverse in the near-term, and challenges that we do not expect to resolve at the flush, but rather gradually. As far as wildcards, in addition to the fluid supply situation and the potential for another wave of COVID, given the slowdown in the third quarter GDP growth, we will keep a watchful eye out for any slowdown in the economy. As we do, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out execute our competition. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place. A strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro or customer-specific challenges and positions us for sustainable growth. A strategy designed to continue our evolution as the leading IT solutions provider. And most importantly, a strategy that delivers profitable growth and returns to shareholders.  This confidence underpins today's action by our board to increase our quarterly cash dividend by 25%. I know many of you may be wondering what we expect for next year. We're in the middle of our planning process, and as we always do, we'll provide our outlook for 2022 on our year-end conference call. And with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al. Al Miralles : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with more detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with the 2021 outlook. Turning to our third quarter P&L on slide 8, consolidated net sales were $5.3 billion, up 11.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7% Net sales and channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year, corporate, small business, and international continue to rebound. Posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels. This quarter's growth also benefited from strong double-digit performance in healthcare, but was tempered by a slowdown in education and declining government. On the supply side, overall backlog increased several $100 million in the quarter and continues to be elevated year-over-year. The team did a great job leveraging CDW 's competitive advantages so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $915 million, an increase of 10.8% on a reported basis. Gross margin was 17.3%, down approximately 10 basis points versus last year. This is primarily driven by lower product margin, partially offset by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily in softwares and service, in addition to strong professional and managed services performance. Turning to SG&A on slide 9, non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. increases primarily driven by payroll costs, including sales compensation, which moves with gross profit growth, and performance-based compensation, consistent with higher attainment against financial goals. Finally, it reflects investments in the business, including increased co-worker counts, focused on execution of our strategy.  Co-worker count at the end of the third quarter was 11,098, up 432 from the second quarter, and 1118 over prior year. The increase in co-worker count reflects organic and organic -- inorganic investments to support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. GAAP operating income was $386 million, up 21.6%. non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $435 million up 12.6% And non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.2%. Moving to slide 10, interest expense was $36 million down 9.4%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year's refinancing. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 23.9%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we just taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs as shown on Slide 12.  For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.3% up 200 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to a onetime impact of state and foreign tax benefits recognized in the prior year. As you can see on slide 13, the second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of a $139 million, GAAP net income per share was a $1.91, up 43.2%. Our non-GAAP net income was $298 million in the quarter up 12.3%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.13, up 16.4% from last year. Turning to year-to-date results in slides 14 through 19, net sales were $15 billion, an increase of 13.1% on a reported basis, and 13.7% on an average daily sales basis. We had one fewer selling day year-to-date in 2021, which will be made up in Q4, we have one extra selling day compared to the prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, year-to-date consolidated net sales were 12.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $2.6 billion up 11.3% and gross profit margin was 17% down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was roughly $1.1 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion up 18.7%. Net income was $773 million and non-GAAP net income was $834 million up 20.7%. non-GAAP net income per share was $5.89, up 23.5%. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 20, at September 30th, cash and cash equivalents were $245 million, and net debt was $3.8 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion.  Year-to-date free cash flow was $341 million as shown on slide 21. This is lighter than last year's record, $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and one time items. Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. Additionally, working capital increased to support our strong year-to-date growth, and we continue to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers through this choppy supply environment. Moving to slide 22, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 9 days from last year's third quarter. Increase was primarily driven by mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles, in addition to holding customer-driven stocking positions, and the timing of receipts and shipments. Turning to capital allocation on slide 23, our 2021 priorities remain the same. First, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP Net Income, including today's 25% increase to the dividend.  The increased annual dividend of $2 is approximately 25% of trailing 12-month non-GAAP Net Income through September. The Q4 2021 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power, and cash flow generation of the business. It marks the 8th consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013. Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 36% from its initial level. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio going forward, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, we ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the third quarter at 2.3 times. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Sirius, which we announced on October 18th, and our recent Focal Point and Amplified IT acquisitions are great examples. And fourth, we return excess cash after dividends and M&A, to shareholders through share repurchases. During the quarter, we continued to deploy cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $505 million to shareholders, including $55 million in dividends and $450 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $188 per share. We continue to expect to return approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders for the full-year of 2021, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Going forward, we continue to execute against our capital allocation priorities as we have done since 2014. In 2022, post closing of the Sirius acquisition, we expect to have an initial net leverage ratio of approximately 3.3 times. While our capital allocation priorities will remain the same, we will shift our objectives to focus on paying the dividend and reducing debt. As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on M&A and share repurchases until our net leverage is in our target range of 2.5 to 3 times, which we expect to achieve by the end of 2022. We continue to expect to close the Sirius acquisition in December, and we intend to share additional thoughts on the financial impacts of consolidating Sirius into CDW on our fourth quarter call. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on slide 24. Supply and product lead times remain fluid, making it challenging to comprehensively forecast the high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with both U.S. and international commercial customers. On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Constraints continue to notebooks, desktops, video, Netcom, and data center categories, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call. We do not expect it to improve in the near future. With that context for full-year 2021, we continue to expect the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5% and our net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market in constant currency. This assumes a consistent supply chain environment and impact to our backlog. We feel good about the health of the business, and we continue to navigate the fluid supply environment. We continue to expect currency to contribute in an approximately 80 basis points the full-year net sales growth, assuming exchange rates of a $1.38, the British pound and $0.80 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we now expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the high 7% range for full-year 2021, as you've heard us say, we believe now is the time to invest in the business and expect investments made in the fourth quarter to drive an operating margin which will deliver our full-year outlook. Putting it all together, we now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the high teens, call it 18% plus or minus 25 basis points. Currency is expected to contribute an additional 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. For free cash flow, our long-term rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.5% of net sales, assuming current tax rates.  However, given the timing impacts that contributed 2020's significant over delivery and ongoing customer-driven stocking positions, as well as the time of receipts and shipments, we expect 2021 free cash flow to come in slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts and the components of free cash flow, including capital expenditures, and the cash conversion cycle, can also be found on slide 25. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator open up for questions, and we would just please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. If you would like to register a question, [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Tindle at Raymond James. Adam your line is open. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thank you, and good morning. Chris, I wanted to start on Sirius to see if you had some early feedback from customers now that the announcement has been out and specifically wondering if those Sirius enterprise customers are perhaps willing to breach the conversation on utilizing CDW's transactional portfolio that Sirius didn't have? And conversely, the CDW mid-market customers more interested in Sirius' services portfolio? So a qualitative view from the customer perspective on potential revenue synergies in this deal. Chris Leahy : Good morning, Adam. Thanks for the question. And you know, we're in a little bit of a quiet period here as we go through the various regulatory approvals. That said, one of the areas that we focused very quickly was feedback, and I would just tell you, it's been really, really positive on both fronts. So our customers at CDW are delighted about the acquisition, and really looking forward to the combined entity and the capabilities that they helped bolster CDW, given their reputation in the market and the quality of their services and the reciprocal is true as well. I talked to Joe Martin late in the day of the announcement, and he had made his way through a lot of customers as had their front-line sellers, and it was for the most part all positive. So again, we think that -- I said the word before, a home-run deal and we're going to make it work really well, and our customers seem to be excited, our partners equally are thrilled. It 's exactly what they were looking for us to do and they are thrilled. Adam Tindle : Right. And I think that aspect of home-run deal has some investors wondering a little bit more on Sirius recent performance. The purchase price was very attractive, all cash in nature, and there's some skepticism on what's been going on with the business in 2021. I know you gave us color based on 2020, but maybe you could help to spell any of that concern by talking about what you've seen out of Sirius ' performance in 2021? Chris Leahy : Well, you know, look, they're doing just fine and there are customers like us in areas like Federal, which we talked about today, or enterprise customers. And as you know, that can be a lumpy business. So when we did our diligence and looked at the pipeline and the types of programs they're running with customers they were having a similar impact that we were having with regard to our larger customers. Some things being delayed, some things being planned yet not -- not yet rolled out necessarily, particularly in terms of delays in going back to the office, etc. But I would tell you that we feel very confident, Adam, in the health of the business, in the prospects of the business in the pipeline for the business and in the opportunities for Sirius and CDW, the combined entity. Adam Tindle : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Chris Leahy : Thanks, Adam. Operator : The next question comes from Shannon Cross at Cross Research. Shannon, your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to take a bit more into backlog composition, if you're seeing any order cancellations or how it -- how it developed over the quarter, maybe linearity just to get an idea of how sustainable and sticky do you think the backlog will be? Al Miralles : Yeah. Good morning Shannon. This is Al. So a couple of things that I would note. So going in in the quarter, we maybe would have expected that there would be a bit of a kind of a modest view of backlog. I'd say overall for the quarter was a bit more than modest. And let's call it, in terms of just all characteristics, similar to Q2. A couple of variants or components that maybe looked a little different, and I think Chris touched on this in your prepared remarks, is that we saw a bit more of an effect from a solutions perspective and that would have included notably Netcom and storage. Notwithstanding that similar to Q2. And look, I would just note the -- all things considered, the team did an exceptional job navigating through that and delivering on the results. Shannon Cross : Okay, so you -- but you don't -- you're not seeing double orders? You're not worried about any kind of loss of backlog? Al Miralles : We are not. I would just note the look. I think there's component in the backlog that there's likely some pull-forward, right? It's been a tenuous environment and so there are customers that I think probably have a perspective that knowing that this doesn't have an clear end date. [Indiscernible] maybe get in front of some of their projects, and so there's probably component that's pulled forward. We're not feeling the effects, or seeing the effects of either double bookings. Shannon Cross : Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick question on -- Chris, maybe, how are you thinking about inflation? And clearly you can pass through higher product costs. But I just sort of in general, as you go through your budgeting and planning for 2022, you know, are you thinking more transitory or are you sort of planning for some of these cost increases to be here for the long term. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah, I understand. And we'll share more with our -- about our planning next year as we think about it. Look, it feels like the perspective out there is maybe a little worse than transitory. And so we will just keep our eye on the economy and how this could impact in particular different segments of our business. For example, when you think about small business, they are really doing a terrific job right now, but we're keeping a very close eye on that segment of the market to understand how the economy might be impacting them, where their optimism is, their ability to hire, etc. So as we always do, we'll keep an eye on it. It feels a little worse than transitory but again, we think that technology is an A1 priority, and our customers will continue to invest in technology if in fact, it becomes a little more extent that we think they'll keep the priority there. And look, if we can keep the economy coming out of the pandemic with the momentum we seem to be building and positive nature in the economy, we're feeling pretty good. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya of [Indiscernible]. Rupplu Bhattacharya : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Chris, I wanted to ask about the education market. In 3Q '20, 4Q '20, you had two billion dollar quarters. And again, this year in June and September, you've again had two billion quarters. So there's a year-on-year headwind from the Mississippi Department of Education project that you had in December and your headwinds, you've had from a stronger year-ago quarter. Chris Leahy : Good morning Rupplu and thanks for reminding the team of the great performance, they will appreciate that. Look, you know, we called this out earlier in the year and I mentioned it again, in our prepared -- my prepared remarks. But it's really been unseasonal and we expected to see the first half of this year be quite [Indiscernible] we're lapping a big back half of the year, that we would expect to still continue to see, I'll call it solid performance, and it's a bit unseasonal because it's the end of the year. But if we need to [Indiscernible] in our view, and it's going to be -- it'll be difficult to overcome the level of growth that we saw last year. That said Rupplu, if the stimulus funding, for example the emergency connectivity [Indiscernible] is yet another source of funds for education institutions to be able to fortify their classrooms since hybrid environment. The one thing with that funding is schools are able to use it for orders that are placed that we're working our way through.  What of that money relates to orders that have been placed? We're confident that there is a large portion that are additive to the base. And again, the team, as they always do, has done a phenomenal job helping our k-12 customers work through that funding. So as you've heard me say before, I feel very confident in education over the long term. It is a growth area. The education market has inflection points and we have always been ahead of those inflection points. Whether it's how the classroom itself changes, whether it's going to hybrid, whatever those are, we are usually there and I'll tell you, Amplified IT, which we just added is taking us to yet another [Indiscernible] level with their cloud-enabled capabilities and their IT developed technology that they offer for classrooms. So I'll pass you [Indiscernible] here, but the team is doing very well, a long-term growth area. Rupplu Bhattacharya : Thanks for all the details there, Chris. Maybe for my follow-up, if I can ask Al about operating margins. So you had another good quarter, another quarter of above 8% operating margin and you're guiding, and an increase for the full-year to high 7s. If we just look at core CDW and not consider Sirius right now, which is accretive to the Company. But if we just look at core CDW, do you think that having a high 7s operating margin is a sustainable level going forward, what are the puts and takes that we need to keep in mind? Al Miralles : Yes. Sure. And thanks for the question, Rupplu. So I think you just hit it at the end there. Look, there are -- there are lots of puts and takes in any given quarter, and I will just start, if you just put aside the supply chain environment, right? Mix does really matter. So if we think about components, what's transactional, what solutional from a mix perspective that matters, channel mix matters, all those things have an impact, I'll say to start on your gross margin and obviously then the kinda, the dropdown from an operating margin perspective. So let's just keep that in mind. And again, kind of supply chain will matter as well. In the case of this particular quarter and maybe as an example.  So there -- in terms of mix there, that is a little bit less public mix from a channel perspective. And then you have got -- you've got transactional solution [Indiscernible]. And then very notably Rupplu, I will just note the fact that your 100% gross margin items will have an impact in this quarter. Our 100% gross margin items grew faster than our net sales. So that's going to have an impact as well. And so again, all of that steeped in focus on gross margin. Then finally, if we walk that down operating margin, it 's been just a matter of the -- at what pace are -- is our non-GAAP [Indiscernible] SG&A spend happening. In the case of this quarter, I would say our non-GAAP SG&A spend lagged some of that growth in gross profit, and so we dropped more to the operating margin for the quarter. And when you look to our outlook relative to what that operating margin was for this quarter, we're up and it's going to balance this back up to a high 7s on the operating margin. As you look forward, look, I think you've got a good sense for this strategy and the movement in where we're going longer-term in terms of mixing into services and mixing in on a 100% gross margin. But all those mix components will manner as we go forward. Rupplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question on the line comes from Jim Suva at Citi group. Jim, your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. Probably a question for [Indiscernible] Chris, but when we think about stimulus, you know, the timing of it, the political nature of it is a little bit hard to pinpoint. But then when we layer in the supply chain challenges and deal with schools, and local governments, and smaller size governments and municipalities who may not be as tech savvy as the Fortune 50 or 500. Can you talk a little bit about the visibility? Are they starting to place smart orders or starting to say, hey, if this gets approved and if we get this amount, here's what I want because it seems like with the long lead times, if they say they want to implement something in the summer for education, we're getting to a point of window where you won't be able to procure the items so you need talk. Chris Leahy : There's many different segments so let me start. I think where -- you were going there. Yeah, It's complicated, right. We've got the supply ecosystem that is -- it has some impact to it right now so we're trying to manage through all of that. Here's what I'd say about K-through-12. You know, we have a lot of experience understanding funding, stimulus funding, and other types of funding for educational institutions. So we sit side-by-side with our customers to make sure they understand both where the dollars can be used, for what products in particular, or for what outcomes, because sometimes it's outcome-based? And what the deadlines are, and what those deadlines mean? Do you have to have the product in-house, do you have to have the product order placed? So there's a lot of navigating that's going on, and I feel highly confident that the team is doing a phenomenal job with our customers and that our K-12 customers are not going to lose out on any funding.  That's really clear. in the state and local space where we've got stimulus funding coming down. It's been a bit complicated because the funding packages, there were 3 of them as we've talked about before, the CARES Act package, for example, had a deadline at the end of this coming year, that was for March of last year. The end of last year, it was -- there was nothing for state and locals in the stimulus package. And then this March, there was a hefty amount. But as we all know when it comes to state and local, it's about budget cycles and it's about funding deadline. So the spending that's taken place in 2021, is primarily from the CARES package with a deadline this year. What we're seeing now is -- I don't want to call it slowing down, but I'm going to say a moderating and planning, and state and local governments now have that funding where they don't have to spend it till the end of 2024.  And so they are now looking at a multiyear approach. Pretty unusual, this multiyear approach but that's what they're doing. And we're helping them with it, there's a lot of complexity. It's very solutions based in my view in terms of what customers are trying to do, but we don't really expect that to meaningfully come to fruition until early next year. But there's just a lot of tentacles and they're all different based on the stimulus package, and on the actual market that we're talking to. But again, I would just reiterate that this is something we do. It's frankly a core capability like working with partners. It's a core capability to understand in the federal, state and local, education, healthcare spaces where the funding is, what it means, what the deadlines are, and how to use it and then to basically walk our customers through it. But I know that was a long answer. I hope it was helpful. Jim Suva : That was exactly where I was looking for. Thank you so much. Chris Leahy : You're welcome. Operator : The next question on the line comes from Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley. Katy, your line is open. Katy Huberty : [Indiscernible] backlog commentary. Can you talk about the gap between net sales growth and orders or writing growth in 3Q and maybe how that compared to the second quarter? Then I have a follow-up. Al Miralles : Sure. Hi, Katie. Good morning. This is Al. Look, we won't quote the exact delta there, but I think it's safe to say that we continue to see strong written demand and that continues to show up and that's part of what bolsters our confidence. Certainly shipments have lagged that. And again, I'll go back to my comment. I would say the mix looks like second quarter did, and that would be consistent across products with the one caveat. That, as we mentioned, Solutions was a little bit stronger, a little worse than it was in Q2. Katy Huberty : Okay. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up for you. The ending cash balance of $245 million is lower than your typical buffer. Can you just talk about your term to rebuild that buffer and also defund the Sirius acquisition? Thank you. Al Miralles : Sure. So first on the Sirius acquisition, I think we mentioned on the previous call, we have committed financing in place. So we expect that we are going to finance the acquisitions fully. From a cash balance perspective, I think Katy, if you compare it to where we were at the end of the year and maybe a year ago, certainly we would look lower. And a couple of things there. 1. We had debt refinancing or financing, I should say, in 2021. So that bolstered that cash position. And then notably for 2021, we've used a fair amount of cash for the existing acquisitions we've had, as well as share repurchases. So I think the combination of where we sit from a cash balance and our revolver availability perspective, we feel quite good with where we stand. And then we feel quite good about our ability to create and generate free cash flow in 2022. Katy Huberty : That's great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Sheerin, Stifel. Matthew please go ahead. Matthew Sheerin : Yes. Thanks and good morning. Chris I wanted to ask about the strong cloud growth that you're seeing, particularly infrastructure as a service. And I'm wondering if some of that is positively impacted by the fact that customers maybe moving or accelerating towards the cloud because of the product in -- and infrastructure, you know, on - prem product shortages. Are you seeing any of that in terms of customers saying maybe now is the time to move because we don't want to wait? Chris Leahy : Yeah Matt. Great question. We've been asking ourselves that as well and talking to customers about it, given the kind of pervasive and persistent nature of the supply chain and the fact that It continues to extend. I would say -- I would characterize it this way, customers are rethinking and considering accelerating some movements to cloud and potentially re - architecting some of their solutions and more -- in a public cloud like environment versus, for example, on prem cloud. But what I wouldn't -- what I wouldn't characterize it as is just a wholesale shift. Customers are still very strategic in how they think about both flexibility obviously and scalability but also cost. And if you combine all of those things together, they're still looking for the absolute best solution and therefore, not just doing the wholesale shift. So I guess the answer would be, we are having this conversations. We're seeing some decisions made around accelerating to public cloud, but I wouldn't say that it's [Indiscernible] and wholesale, if that helps. Matthew Sheerin : I got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the PC shortages, particularly on the commercial side. What are your thoughts there in terms of the PC cycle? Are you seeing any early signs of adoption of Win 10, and do you see that as a driver going forward? Chris Leahy : Well, look, I wouldn't say that, I've seen necessarily early adoption just yet, but as is always the case, there will be early adopters and there will be later adopters. And they will be our customers, so we'll help them through that. You all are familiar with the end of life for Win 10 and then the timing for Win 11 around the 2024, 20-25 time period. So it will be a driver, it's not been a driver yet. I think PCs generally, you've heard me say, I continue to believe in PC s. I think that we have more PC density now we're going to see sort of replacement cycles of PCs for a couple of reasons. Wear and tear, but also the technology improves at a faster pace and client devices are more and more important to the productivity of the people using them. You also have used cases that are expanding. And the hybrid work model obviously is really driving PCs. And so we will -- we feel good about PC growth and win 11 will certainly be a driver of that at some point over probably a couple of year period. Matthew Sheerin : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And the next question comes from Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan. Samik, your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Great. Thank you. Chris, I just wanted to start off and go back to your comments. You mentioned this a couple of times now about monitoring the SMB segment for economic activity just given the increase in cases, etc. and you mentioned you haven't seen any sizable impact yet. But is there something more on a regional basis when you look at -- across the U.S. or maybe in some international markets on a more regional, specific places you're seeing any changes in activity from your customers where maybe there is a stronger correlation to how cases are trending. Any insights on that, and I have a follow-up, please. Chris Leahy : Yeah, sure. Here's what I would say about the current environment. We're watching it, as is everybody, and we're cautious about it. And we put it in the category of wildcard because I don't know that anybody knows what's going to happen, but we all also know there has been more momentum around that vaccination availability at lower ages, antivirals, the rate of vaccine, particularly when we think of our location [Indiscernible]. We're thinking and investing for getting back to a robust environment and economy, and we're thinking forward. So I think a little bit unlike going into last year's winter months where there -- the cautiousness I would say was on a really high level. We're just feeling customers saying, we've got to invest. And so until early next year or work from [Indiscernible] that is I would say ubiquitous. So we -- in 2020, we talked about the uneven [Indiscernible] certain industries, etc. I just feel like the tone has really changed to the platform of \"We got to get back. We got to get back. We got to build for the future. \" So that's what we're seeing. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. A quick follow-up for that. I think you're indicating that the operating margin 3Q doesn't repeat in 4Q any incremental spend coming through. How much of [Indiscernible] mentioned some of the catch-up on SG&A versus [Indiscernible] what you outlined as is the right time to spend, and I'm just trying to think of what portion of that incremental spend should I be annualizing for the next year? Thank you. Al Miralles : So look, in fourth-quarter, we'll get more guidance with respect to what that looks like for 2022 and reflective of our combination with Sirius, right? So but let me focus my comments on fourth quarter. I would say the non-GAAP SG&A spend is just an unevenness or a timing effect of that spend. in Q3. That probably lagged a bit in Q4. We'd expect that to pick up. There's probably a component there, as we think about the Sirius combination, we're thinking more broadly about what that combination looks like, and how does that ultimately impact our investment spend. That being said, we're going to continue forward in Q4 with the efforts that we've been focused on, notably our own digital transformation, as well as to continue invest in the high-growth Solutions and Services areas. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Al Miralles : Welcome. Operator : The final question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, your line is open. Keith Housum : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hey, Chris, I'm just kind of thinking here through the investments that companies make -- are making in technology based on the supply chain insurers that they are, is there a willingness of your customers to move to another solutions that are hardware solution that can be fulfilled by the end of the year? Because the thinking is, a lot of these companies have IT budgets they want to spend anyways. So there's always a project wish that they want to do. Are people willing to convert to other projects in order to spend that money? Or are they holding onto the products available? Chris Leahy : Yeah. Good morning, a great question and I think it really depends frequently on the customer set. Small businesses have always been more nimble and less tied to particular requirements, and we have seen success there. And I think in my prepared remarks, supply chain constraints didn't impact them as much as in corporate because we could help them find alternatives. When you really don't want to shift off of them, it creates more work, frankly, within the organization. What we've [Indiscernible] We have worked with our customers to get in-line earlier. So a lot of customers are -- have been working very hard [Indiscernible] you typically would in hope s that they will get the product by year end. All that said, anywhere that there are I'll say mission less than mission-critical, by technologies that we can help them find alternatives. Whether it's a brand, whether it is the Cloud, whether it's something else that they can be using, you can bet we're doing it. But you're absolutely right, there's going to be a lot of pressure as we go into the back end of the year to get that product out. And we expect we'll be able to help them do it. Keith Housum : Got you. There is a follow-up here. In terms of the shortages that you're experiencing, are you finding that those shortages over this quarter, I guess sort of previous solution sets or is it really kind of game of whack-a-mole where it gets fixed in one area but a new [Indiscernible]? Chris Leahy : Well, here's -- I said this before, you get this kind of supply chain ecosystem. And so you've got -- you have capacity, you got components, you got logistics, you got labor, you've got all of this impacting the ability to get product. And it has kind of shifted through the course of the year. What we've had on the transactional side, notebook and video and monitors and things like that, that have been constrained. Chromebook have started to ease up a little. That's planning a good 13 months ago to get -- get to that point by the OEM. What we saw [Indiscernible] this year in the past quarter and a little before was solutions product now being more constrained. And we mentioned Netcom in particular and storage in particular. So that is a problem when things are moving around, particularly when what customers need are comprehensive and holistic solutions, not just piece [Indiscernible]. So whack-a-mole is a good word for -- or a good term for it. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions registered on the lines. We'll hand the call back to Chris Leahy to conclude the call. Chris Leahy : Bethany, Thank you. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our co-workers around the globe and [Indiscernible] all of CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. And to our investors and analysts [Indiscernible] attending this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll begin our call with an overview of our full year and fourth quarter performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2022. Then I'll hand the call over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.  2021 was a year of both strong financial performance and strategic progress. The teams delivered $21 billion in net sales with excellent profitability. Margins improved and our 13% increase in sales translated to a 17% increase in both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases amplified this growth and non GAAP net income per share increased 21% to $7.97.  These exceptional results demonstrate the power of our resilient business model, a model that has enabled us to deliver industry-leading performance year after year, including through the past two years of a global health crisis, unprecedented supply interruptions and evolving customer priorities.  You see the power of our model and the performance across our balanced portfolio of customer end markets over the past two years. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels :\u2013 corporate; small business; health care; government, which includes federal and state and local customers; and education with K-12 and higher ed.  We also have our UK and Canadian operations each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own right. Often different factors impact customer end markets, sometimes macro and sometimes industry specific. This was the case over the past two years as customers across our diverse end markets experienced the impact of the pandemic very differently. In 2020, public customer spend, fueled by education and government, offset commercial and international declines and net sales increased 2%. In 2021, our 13% sales increase was powered by strong commercial and international customer spend, which more than offset flat public sales.  The past two years also highlighted the power of our business model in our product and solutions performance, with more than 100,000 products and solutions from over 1,000 leading and emerging brands. We are well positioned to meet our customers' needs, whether transactional or highly complex.  In 2020, customers prioritized remote enablement and continuity. Transactions increased driven by the ability to deliver endpoint solutions to meet unprecedented work from home and learn from home needs. At the same time, solutions declined as customers focus their spend on addressing critical endpoint projects. In 2021, while work from home and learn from home enablement remained key priorities, customers reprioritized investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure, platforms and endpoints. Both transactions and solutions increased.  Our ability to help customers address their priorities during two years of unprecedented supply challenge is another example of the power of our business model. We leveraged our competitive advantages, our distribution centers, our extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the environment. And our sellers and technical coworkers helped customers find alternative solutions from our deep portfolio whenever possible.  In 2020, we were able to deliver more than 11 million client devices despite meaningful supply shortages in endpoint devices. In 2021, while facing extended lead times for transactions and solutions, we delivered solid growth in both categories.  As you can see, our resilient business model had a significant impact on our ability to profitably grow during an unprecedented period. Looking at performance over the past two years, net sales are up 15% since 2019 and our annual net sales compound growth rate was 7.5%. Profitability improved at a faster rate with compound annual growth rates for gross profit and non-GAAP operating income of 8% and 10%, respectively.  Of course, our business model is not the only component of our formula to profitably outgrow the U.S. market. Our success would not be possible without the dedication of our talented team of 14,000 coworkers, including the more than 2,600 new Sirius coworkers who joined us in December. During the past two years, time and again, CDW coworkers demonstrated why they are so vital to our ability to successfully deliver industry-leading performance year after year.  Let's take a closer look at what the teams delivered for the fourth quarter. For the quarter, net sales were $5.5 billion, including $197 million of results from Sirius, which closed on December 1. On an average daily sales and constant currency basis, net sales increased 9.6%.  Non-GAAP net income was $285 million in the quarter, up 8.2%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.08, up 14% from last year. The teams leveraged the combination of our broad and deep portfolio, extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate full outcomes to address customers' priorities across all of our customer end markets. Outcomes that deliver five key organizational benefits \u2013 innovation, lower cost, agility, risk mitigation and enhanced experiences for customers and coworkers.  Let's take a look. Corporate delivered a 33% increase with excellent performance across both transactions and solutions. Digital transformation, agility and security remained top priorities. Endpoint solutions remained a key focus area and the team delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth in client devices. Small business delivered another exceptional quarter, up 31%, with strong growth across both transactions and solutions. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement. Security performance was up mid-teens as the team helped customers address risk mitigation needs, delivering penetration testing and incident response as well as backup and recovery solutions.  On the public side of the business, excellent performance in both healthcare and higher ed was not enough to offset expected declines in government and K-12, and total public net sales declined to 13%. Healthcare's 20% increase continued to reflect return to projects that had been put on hold.  Security remained a top priority. Cloud adoption was strong, in part driven by efficiency needs as customers dealt with COVID-19 and acute care. The expected decline in federal reflected the lumpy nature of government contracts as the teams faced two meaningful overlaps in the fourth quarter of 2020, the wind down of our devices and service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and a large client device program. Results also reflected the impact of slowness in contracting practices we shared last quarter. We are beginning to see greenshoots and there's no change to our expectation that trends will reverse later in 2022.  State and local posted a high-single digit decline. The team delivered a high-single digit increase in solutions, driven by helping customers upgrade security. This could not overcome the team's 2020 strong fourth quarter performance when they helped customers take advantage of the year-end use-it-or-lose-it CARE funds. As we shared last quarter, we continue to help our customers work through the planning required to evaluate multiple funding opportunities and multi-year phasing and expect funded projects to begin implementation as we move through 2022.  Higher ed strong double-digit performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12, and overall education sales increased 9% on top of 2020 fourth quarter remarkable 142% growth. Higher ed growth reflected our ability to meet growing demand for student success programs. These programs use technology to give institutions an edge, including comprehensive endpoint solutions, improved security, campus connectivity as well as enhancing the dorm room experience.  The K-12 team delivered excellent net sales performance against very tough unseasonal fourth quarter 2022 compares. Consistent with expectations we've previously shared, net sales declined. Although down year over year, fourth quarter client device sales were more than double a typical pre-COVID fourth quarter.  Both the UK and Canada delivered high teens local market growth. Combined in our other results, average daily sales for these two markets increased 20% in US dollars. Customer priorities in both markets were similar to those in the US. Our success addressing customer priorities is evident in our fourth quarter portfolio performance where we delivered balanced growth across transactions and solutions both increasing mid-single digits.  On the transaction side, client devices increased mid-single digits. While client device supply improved in some areas and we were able to help more customers adopt alternative providers, overall supply remained constrained and we exited the year with an elevated backlog. Tight supply continued to impact prices which our teams were generally able to pass along. Video and audio delivered another impressive quarter. Solutions growth was driven by strong software and servers performance. Writings remain strong as customers turn to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and entire lifecycle. Lead times extended in several key solutions areas, notably netcom, enterprise storage and servers. Remaining solutions orders increased at year-end.  Once again, the team delivered strong double-digit growth in cloud, driven by robust growth in security, infrastructure as a service, and productivity. Security cloud growth was driven by the success of our comprehensive strategy of security assessments, data protection and threat mitigation with many solutions delivered via cloud and software. Overall security spend in the quarter increased mid-teens.  Our ability to meet customer needs in the quarter across the IT continuum translated into a mid-single digit US hardware sales, 20% increase in software and more than 50% increase in services. Services growth reflected the ongoing success of our strategy and was balanced across professional and managed services. Recent acquisitions are paying off, contributing meaningfully to this quarter's growth. So, as you can see, our fourth quarter delivered a strong finish to an excellent year of financial performance. 2021 was also a year of excellent strategic progress against our three-part strategy for growth, which is to first acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, extend our services capabilities. In 2021, we made excellent progress against all three of these pillars. Acquisitions made during the year, Focal Point, Amplified IT and Sirius, as well as integration progress for our 2020 acquisitions at IGNW and Aptris furthered our strategy to bolster our services capabilities.  Deep services capabilities are critical to our ability to deliver full organizational outcomes across the full stack and the entire lifecycle. This is an important source of differentiation in the marketplace.  Let me share a quick example of how this is showing up in our performance. Our acquisition of Amplified IT in August deepened our already strong offering in the education space, particularly in the Google ecosystem, which is the largest education platform in the US.  Amplified IT's expertise as a systems integrator enables us to facilitate end-to-end solutions for education customers. This leads to greater customer engagement and stickiness and provides insights into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IT lifecycle. During the fourth quarter, the CDW Amplified for Education team worked closely with Google and Internet2 team to make it easier for institutions to adopt Google Workspace for education plus. In addition to ease of procurement, with the Amplified IT team on board, we were able to deliver additional value to customers through much needed deep technical expertise and services, expertise and services that deliver organizational outcomes, enhance collaboration, streamlined instruction, and a secure learning environment.  This joint campaign generated more than 30 net new awards in the fourth quarter with more than $11 million in total contract value over the next several years. This is a great example of how we leverage our powerful business model to quickly deliver customer benefits from newly acquired capabilities. It is also a great example of how our acquisitions enhance our ability to deliver full outcomes across the full stack and the entire IT lifecycle. Internal investments made in 2021 also enhanced our ability to deliver on this strategy. These included digital investments in proprietary portals to drive customer and seller productivity. We also added 1000 new coworkers in addition to the nearly 3,000 coworkers who joined us via acquisition. Just over half of all new coworkers in 2021 are in technical roles. Whether acquired or homegrown, investments in our three-part growth strategy are integral to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the US IT market. That brings me to our thoughts about 2022. In 2022, we will continue to execute against our three-part strategy with a focus on the recent integrations. A top priority in this area is the disciplined integration of Sirius. Work is moving apace led by a dedicated seasoned executive.  The team's mission is, just as it's been with all of our acquisitions, to ensure our customers are able to quickly reap the benefits of our combination. And we are making excellent and swift progress in that area. For example, I'm pleased to share that our new Sirius coworkers had a CDW email address on day one, a seemingly small accomplishment, but with really big impact.  Turning to 2022 financial performance, our outlook is built off a combined 2021 CDW and Sirius net sales figure of $23 billion, which includes $2.2 billion of full-year Sirius results. Top line performance for Sirius was relatively flat compared to 2020 as they overcame a number of large projects and the impact of supply interruptions. Managed services, an area of focus for Sirius, delivered double-digit growth. In 2022, as Sirius is integrated into the fabric of CDW, we expect its operations to grow in line with total CDW. Given current market dynamics, our 2022 baseline outlook calls for US IT market growth of 3.5%, plus 200 basis points to 300 basis points in constant currency of CDW outperformance.  This outlook reflects our view on three key drivers. First, we expect a moderation in US GDP growth. Second, we expect the impact of supply on our results in 2022 to remain fairly consistent with its impact at year-end 2021. And third, we expect customer priorities in 2022 will increasingly require integrated solutions that leverage our services, cloud and hybrid expertise. Wildcards remain ongoing supply and macro impacts, particularly in small business.  Of course, as we always do, we will update you on our thoughts as we move through the year. I'm extremely proud of the excellent financial performance and strategic progress we've made during the past two years.  In 2022, we will continue to do what we do best leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute the competition. If the pandemic has shown us anything, it is that technology is essential to all sectors of our economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. That means our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. And I remain confident that we have the right strategy in place.  And with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al? Al Miralles : Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the fourth quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2022 outlook.  Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.5 billion, including one-month contribution from Sirius of $197 million. Consolidated net sales were up 11.7% on a reported basis and 9.9% on an average daily sales basis, as we add one extra selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales was 9.6%, including 3.9 points of contribution from Sirius.  Consistent with the last quarter, net sales in channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year \u2013 corporate, small business and international \u2013 continued to rebound, posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels. This quarter's growth also benefit from strong double-digit performance in health care that was tempered by the expected declines in government and education.  On the supply side, our overall backlog increased a few hundred million dollars in the quarter, reflecting constraints similar to last year. Backlog remained elevated year-over-year. We continue to make strategic investments in inventory, support our customers through this constrained supply environment, and the team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages, so the backlog did not increase even more.  Gross profit for the quarter was $976 million, an increase of 10.8% on a reported basis and resulted in a strong gross margin of 17.6%. Gross margin was positively impacted by the increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily software as a service, in addition to strong professional services performance. This was more than offset by lower product margin and overlapping high margin configurations in the prior year. Sirius' gross profit margin was consistent with their historical performance, and was modestly accretive to the overall gross margin for the quarter. Turning to SG&A on slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. This reflected the impact of consolidating one month of incremental Sirius expenses. Sirius' sales compensation as a percentage of net sales was higher than our core operations, given the higher mix of solutions and services revenues. The overall increase also reflected higher performance-based compensation, consistent with higher attainment against financial goals and investments in the business, including increased coworker counts. Coworker counts at the end of the quarter were 13,924, up 2,826 from the third quarter and 3,942 over prior year. Increasing coworker counts during the quarter reflects the addition of over 2,600 Sirius coworkers and other organic and inorganic coworker investments to support high growth solution areas and our own digital transformation.  GAAP operating income was $339 million, up 2.1%. Non-GAAP operating income which better reflects operating performance is $425 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%. As we shared on last quarter's call, investments made in the fourth quarter drove an operating margin which delivered our full-year outlook. Sirius' non-GAAP operating margin was consistent with their historic performance and was marginally accretive for the quarter.  Moving to slide 10. Interest expense was $43 million, up 16.9%. The increase reflected the incremental expense on the $2.5 billion of notes issued in December to finance the Sirius acquisition. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 11 was 25.1%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs as shown on slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.5%, up 230 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to one-time tax benefits recognized in the prior year.  As you can see on slide 13, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 138 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.57, down 4.5%. Our non-GAAP net income was $285 million in the quarter, up 8.2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.08, up 14% from last year and reflects the impact of share repurchases.  Turning to full year results on slides 14 through 19. As Chris mentioned, 2021 performance reflected exceptional execution against an effective strategy along with the power of our business model and balanced portfolio.  Net sales were $20.8 billion, an increase of 12.7% on a reported basis and average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, full-year consolidated net sales grew 11.9%, including 110 basis point contribution from Sirius. Gross profit was $3.6 billion, up 11.2%, and gross profit margin was 17.1%, down approximately 30 basis points year-over-year. In 2021, software and services accounted for approximately 41% of total gross profit, up 100 basis points from last year. The increase reflects investment in our services and solution capabilities and a continued shift into netted down revenues like software as a service.  Before moving down the rest of the full-year P&L, I want to take a moment to put netted down revenues into perspective. Netted down revenues results from software as a service, software assurance and warranty solutions as well as agent commission fees. We're not the primary obligor for these solutions, and thus record gross profit as our revenue and why you sometimes hear us refer to these as 100% gross margin items.  In the past, we shared examples of how this accounting treatment has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars, but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins all else equal. Over the last five years, our netted down revenue strength as a percentage of total gross revenues or customer spend has increased 10 percentage points. The greater mix reflects increased customer spend on fast growing netted down revenue streams, like cloud and security.  Long term, as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and invest in the capabilities necessary to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers, we expect a mix further in the high growth netted down revenue streams. This mix dynamics will pressure net sales while remaining neutral to gross profit and expanding gross margin. This, of course, is subject to hardware refresh cycles and other mix components of the business.  While much of what I've described is tied to the accounting treatment, it is also a reflection of our success in the execution of our strategy to capture share, enhance capabilities in high growth solution and expand services.  Returning to the full-year P&L. Operating income was $1.4 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.6 billion, up 17.1%. Net income was $989 million. Non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion, up 17.2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $7.97, up 20.9%.  Turning to the balance sheet on slide 20. On December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $258 million and net debt was $6.6 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.2 billion.  Moving to slide 21, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 24 days, up 7 days from last year's fourth quarter. In addition to our strategy of holding customer-driven stocking positions, the increase reflected mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles and the timing of customer receipts. This is partially offset by the timing of payments at the end of the year.  Full-year free cash flow was $477 million, as shown on slide 22. This is lighter than last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing, one-time items, and advantageous vendor payment terms. In 2021, our free cash flow was also impacted by increased working capital to support our strong full-year growth.  We also leveraged our strong balance sheet and distribution capabilities to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers in this unprecedented supply environment. As a result, 2021 free cash flow was below a rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. Timing differences, one-time items and noted investments resulted in asymmetrical free cash flows across 2020 and 2021. In aggregate, 2020 and 2021 free cash flows balanced out and equated to 4.3% of net sales, slightly above the high end of our free cash flow rule of thumb.  In 2021, we delivered on our capital allocation objectives and deployed more than $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $235 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to share repurchases at an average price of approximately $172 per share.  Turning to 2022 capital allocation priorities on slide 23. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target a dividend of approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings.  Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended this year at 3.4 times above our range due to the financing of the Sirius acquisition. We intend to optimize the use of cash flow after paying dividends to focus on reducing debt until we return to our net leverage range. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022.  As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases, and so net leverage is in our target range.  Moving to the outlook for 2022 on slide 24. As Chris mentioned, our outlook is built off the combined 2021 CDW and Sirius results, which presents these numbers as if we own Sirius at the start of 2021. Let me walk you through how this looks. Starting with sales, given what we're seeing in the market now, our baseline outlook assumes US market growth 3.5%. We currently expect combined net sales to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. On a combined basis. CDW's net sales would have been $22.9 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius. We expect Sirius to grow in line with total CDW. Right now, 2022 feels like a normal demand environment and expect it will reflect a greater mix in the netted down revenues as we overlap strong client device sales. Our baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we've been experiencing. We would expect it to be to be at the lower end of our premium range if we've mixed more into netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experienced elevated levels of supply constraints. We would be at the higher end if hardware growth is strong and supply improves.  Currency is expected to be neutral for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.37 to the British pound and $0.80 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. Our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $8.49 in 2021 on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97, which included one month of Sirius. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow high-single digits in 2022, call it 9.25%, plus or minus 50 basis points in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to approximately 16% to 17% growth in constant currency on a reported basis.  As Chris mentioned, the integration work with Sirius is progressing. And given the nature of the integrated sales, we will not be breaking out Sirius results going forward. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our combined financial outlook on an annual constant currency basis.  Slide 24 provides our expected net sales split for the year. We expect net sales in the first half of the year to be in line with our historic norm of 48% to 49%. Sirius' sales split is slightly higher in the second half than historic CDW. Historically, we see a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1.  This year, on a reported basis, we expect first quarter sequential growth in the low-single digits, reflecting three months of contribution from Sirius versus one month in Q4. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth relative to Q1 2021 to be in the low mid-teens, reflecting seasonality and channel mix.  Modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can also be found on slide 25.  In addition, you can see our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. We expect CapEx to run approximately 70 basis points to 75 basis points as a percentage of net sales, reflecting our continued view that now is the time to continue to accelerate investment in our own digital transformation, enabling us to further fortify our competitive position, make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers, and vendor partners.  That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macroenvironment and our business on future earnings calls.  And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. And can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit, please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : My first question is really around this EPS guide for 2022. I think you talked about 16%, 17% EPS growth for 2022. Can you just talk about what are you really assuming out of the Sirius acquisition in that EPS number? And really, the two parts I'd love to kind of get some clarity on is, a, do you have any cost synergies from the transactions embedded in that number? And then secondly, Chris, I'd love to understand how you think about the scaled synergies narrative from Sirius as we go forward? Al Miralles : So just a couple of things to note. So, I think we've given you some component parts to get a sense for EPS. So number one, obviously, our reported EPS for 2021 was $7.97. That includes one month of contribution for Sirius. We've also provided you what would be a combined CDW and Sirius result for 2021 as if they were together for the full year. That's $8.49. So, the way you should think about it is if you walk forward from that $8.49 to our outlook there of 9.25% growth, you get a sense for the combined entities and what they contribute.  The other data point I would just give you is that we noted that, from a top line perspective, we'd expect that Sirius would grow at the same rate as we provided in that top line outlook.  To your question on synergies. So, here's what I would say. Look, we're very focused on the integration of the combined entities. And we expect through that, we're going to find value in terms of synergies on the revenue front. We're certainly looking hard at procurement efficiencies, systems consolidations, facilities consolidation, all of those components, and we expect we're going to get value.  But, Amit, I would just mention that it's critically important as we talk about our strategy that we continue to invest in our strategy. And I would say as it pertains to synergies, reinvest. And so, while we expect we're going to see value, we expect that a lot of those values we get from the synergy be reinvested in 2022. Amit Daryanani : As I think about the balance between transactional versus solution, how do you think that stacks up in calendar 2022? And do you think the supply environment maybe starts getting worse at least through 2022? How do you kind of think of that narrative? I would love to get a sense of the mix and then supply environment? Al Miralles : Look, I would say, comments on the supply environment, Q4 looked very similar to the prior quarters in terms of the supply environment. Our backlog increased consistent with those previous quarters, call it a couple hundred million of backlog increase.  Look, there are some puts and takes in terms of what supply chain would look like in Q4 and I would say probably a bit more challenged on the solution side of the business. And I think that's natural as these efforts evolve over time. As we look forward into 2022, we don't really see any meaningful end in sight. I would say, as we think about kind of our interactions and what we hear and observe from a partner and product perspective, maybe there's silver lining there that some of the transparency has improved. So, there's a better line of sight of lead times and where things stand, but I'm not sure that we would translate that into any indication of things are going to get better in the near term. And so, really, we're hunkered down on consistent similar outlook with respect to this supply chain environment and we'll continue to execute as we have during this time. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam Tindle : Al, I just wanted to start on 2022 guidance. And the revenue buildup implies around 6% growth for the full year, but looks like you're going to be starting at about half that level based on the Q1 guidance. And as we think about compares getting tougher as the year progresses, there's questions around how long the device ecosystem tailwinds are going to last as the year progresses. Maybe you can double click on those fears and why you have built in acceleration in year-over-year growth as the year progresses to start with? Thanks. Al Miralles : I think you hit a lot of the right points. So, look, on the full year, we're confident in our growth expectations. There certainly is a timing and effect. And there are a few puts and takes in that regard. So, number one, in terms of sequentially from Q4 to Q1, we've got the positive that we'll have three months of contribution from Sirius. So that certainly helps from a top line perspective.  You will recall we have some tough comps, otherwise, and particularly in education, with Q1, so that has a bit of an offsetting effect. So, when we add up that, along with our typical seasonality, we would be back to kind of our 48/52 split in terms of seasonality.  Now, look, there's the wildcards. And those wildcards include what type of product throughput are we seeing and will it be more hardware focused versus services and solution? And I would just say the obvious wildcard is supply and that will certainly change the shape and direction of timing by quarter. Adam Tindle : Maybe just as a follow-up, you onboarded over 2,500 employees from Sirius and I just had a question on integration, Chris. You talked about the CDW culture, how it permeates customer-facing coworkers, compensation metrics are generally aligned with key metrics like gross profit dollar growth and returns on capital. As you think about the Sirius employees that you're taking on, maybe you can touch on their comp metrics and any potential planned changes to that. And, Al, if you could touch on the systems integration piece of this, that would be helpful. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Integration is going really quite well. And it's I'd say moving with smart speed. We're very disciplined as you know, but we also understand moving with the appropriate amount of speed to make sure that our customers are benefiting from the combined organizations is critically important.  You also know the lens that we look through when we assess potential acquisitions and culture is right up there on the list. It is so important to us. And the Sirius coworkers, now CDW coworkers are fully aligned with our culture, customer-first, coworker-first and collaborative, I would say, and we're already seeing benefits of us coming together, winning deals together, going to meet customers together.  In terms of the comp schemes, this is what I will tell you, Adam. They're similarly performance-based with similar metrics. From an integration perspective, we are taking the 2022 year very methodically because we, of course, want to get compensation right. But from a cost and incentive lens, very similar to CDW. And again, the teams are already coming together collaborating with each other on deals, sending referrals across to each other. And I'm really pleased with how it's going. Al Miralles : I'll just add a couple of things. So number one, just from a compensation perspective, Chris hit the key points there in terms of alignment. Just keep in mind, because their business has a higher proportion of services solutions, that variable fixed component of the business looks a little different. They have a higher cost to serve with their technical staff. And so, that will shift. I don't think that's a diametrical shift immediately. We'll see that over time as we integrate.  On your question on systems consolidation, look, it's a little early days. I think we've laid down the foundation of kind of the initial evaluation of systems. And I think we're pleased to see that there's really strong infrastructure from a Sirius perspective. And so, we're really lining up for an approach of best in breed from a systems perspective, and we think there's going to be opportunities to take on some of the technology tools they have, as well as vice versa. So, we'll share more as we have that, but we're making good progress on that front. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Matthew Sheerin : Chris, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on your outlook for the year in terms of end market. What should we be thinking about on the commercial side of the business, which has been accelerating, versus the public sector, which you've talked about, tough comps in education and government? Christine Leahy : As we look at 2022, let me try to simplify by segment. What we've seen in the commercial space, both corporate and small business, has been, I would say, very positive signs of recovery. And our expectations are for continued solid growth, but at a decelerated rate from 2021.  We talked about education and the unseasonality there. The one thing I would say about education, the emergency connectivity funds availability goes through the middle of the summer, so the end of Q2. So, we're going to see, one would expect, some nice uplift there. But then growth will be a little muted for the rest of the year. Higher ed, doing great work in higher ed and expect to continue to see solid growth throughout the year.  Health care, I would tell you, is recovering very nicely. And we would expect it to recover above the 2019 levels, if we go back two years. So solid growth there.  Government, we are not changing our expectation that we're going to expect to see turnaround there in the federal space and in state and local, frankly, as we see funds start to flow a little bit more into the state and local, but certainly going to see a return to growth in government in our view.  And then international, that'll continue to be solid again, but at a decelerated rate. Very similar to what I said about the commercial space. Now, of course, the key wildcards are supply. And that obviously can be a plus or a minus. And then, the macroenvironment and what we see happen both with the virus, but equally inflation, employment and all of that. But right now, we feel like there's very good momentum going into the year. There's strong demand and we're feeling very positive about where we're positioned to meet that demand. Matthew Sheerin : Just regarding your commentary just about the product and component constraints, we're hearing from other resellers that some customers are moving or accelerating the move toward off-prem, cloud-based computing storage, et cetera, because of those constraints. Are you seeing that at all from your customers? Christine Leahy : Not what I would say is \u2013 it's part of the conversation. And we are seeing acceleration to the cloud. But we've said this before, our clients are being very thoughtful about the strategy and what technology best serves their organizational needs. Whether it is agility, whether it is risk mitigation, cloud versus on-prem. So we are certainly having the conversations. And the great news is, with the breadth of our expertise, our customers are really appreciating that we can sit down and explore all options with them. That's really unique in the marketplace. But they're making the decisions, I would say, with the right amount of discipline, and not just wholesale lift and shift because they can't get the product. They are being patient. Frustrated, but patient.  So, I think that's the way I'd answer the question. Certainly, acceleration to the cloud, but thoughtful as they go and on-prem is also \u2013 I think we're going to see some strength in on-prem this year as customers return to the office and infrastructure refresh continues to happen. Operator : The next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu Bhattacharya : I wanted to ask a couple of more questions on the revenue growth guide for both the fiscal 2022 as well as for the first quarter. Al, is there a way to quantify what you've baked in in terms of headwind from supply shortages in the full-year guide, so either on a dollar basis or on a year-over-year growth headwind basis? And are you assuming that PC demand sustains throughout the full year? Al Miralles : Let me start with that. And Chris may have something to add there. So, we are assuming no change in the supply environment relative to what we experienced in 2021. So, just recall, if look back the last three quarters, we've quoted that our backlog has increased several hundred million dollars through 2021. That's notwithstanding that written demand continue to be extremely strong. So, if you look at our actual printed results, there are times we look at it and say, you can't really see the effect of the significant backlog. So, I think our expectation would be that supply chain will continue to work as it has. And I think you may have some pluses and minuses through that in terms of solutions versus transactions and byproducts. But lo and behold, I think that supply assumptions are very consistent with what we've seen in 2021. Ruplu Bhattacharya : And on PC demand, any thoughts on how that sustains throughout the year? Christine Leahy : On PC demand, look, I think we will see Q1 is going to be a tough quarter because of the overlaps, for sure. And as we move through the year, we expect to continue to see corporate, commercial, small business, international, continued strength there, provided that the recovery that we're seeing continues and provided the macroenvironment continues.  When you think about the puts and takes across 2022, supply can be a plus or minus. I mentioned the emergency connectivity funds for K-12. That'll be a plus. Macro can be a plus or a minus. But generally speaking, here's what I'd say about PCs and it's consistent with our commentary of the past. We really do see client devices as a tool for employees, as a tool for people generally and expectations of using them for productivity have increased. And the demand for client devices for remote and then as people frankly come back to the office and are working in the office and remotely and anywhere, also add demand to the market.  The other thing we've talked about is technology cycles and technology innovation and upgrades happening more quickly than we've typically seen in the past. And when you think about remote and virtual, think about breakage. And so, you've got a couple of pressure points putting cycle times \u2013 compressing cycle times. The last thing I would say is new use cases. We continue to see endpoint devices and new use cases in the digital transformation. So, I guess, think about PCs this year as still solid performance, moderating growth especially compared to last year. And by the time we get to the end of the year, when you look at where we are, and you think about the refresh opportunities from 2017 and 2018, those are going to be opening up and then we've got Win 10 end of life coming. So, people are buying PCs, we are in a very good position to make sure that we get our fair share of inventory to supply them. And while we see moderating growth, we just see it as a positive contribution to our overall performance. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Can I just ask a follow-up on the first quarter revenue guide? I think you're guiding low-single digit year-on-year growth. To me, it seems a little bit lower than normal seasonality on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And that's with the fact that you have the Sirius acquisition layered in as well for three months. So, how much of that would you say is because you have more netted down items, which are impacting the sales growth versus other year-on-year headwinds. So, any way to quantify that sequential decline in revenues on a daily basis between 4Q and 1Q? Al Miralles : Let me address it. So, first, just on a year-over-year basis, the growth is not muted. It's in the teens in terms of growth. I think just on the \u2013 comment on the sequential is the one obviously coming off of a very strong Q4, but the comps for education, much more significant in Q1 relative to Q4 there, and so that mutes the impact. You get a bit of a kind of contra going the other way with, again, Sirius, but there's some of the puts and takes. If you just focus on that year-over-year, that was very strong. Christine Leahy : It's Chris here. I would just add that, as we think about 2022 and 2021, generally, I think we would call 2022 a more normalized, I'll call it, buying environment. We had tremendous hardware sales in 2021 and client demand. And we've said that \u2013 and our strategy is around building our services and cloud capabilities. And we do expect that 2022 is going to require additional services and cloud capabilities, which net down. So, I think we'll see more normalized netting down for 2022. Operator : The next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Just given your commentary around supply chain headwinds. Just curious to get your take on how you think inventory will trend in 2022. And if you need to continue kind of growing your strategic pre purchases or if that can become a tailwind for you in 2022. And then I have a follow up. Al Miralles : First, again, just [Technical Difficulty], supply chain would look similar to 2021. I think we've mentioned before, there is a component of backlog in supply chain, and includes pull forward of business. And I think as our partners became more and more clued into and kind of have gotten clarity of lead times and so forth, they've encouraged us and encouraged customers to get in line. And I think through 2021, that has happened. And we would expect that will continue to happen. In terms of how that plays out and what that might look like, I think that now \u2013 I think we could look at our backlog and say we've got a pretty balanced portfolio there of pull forward business as well as current business. And so, for those very reasons, we don't believe that the backlog will ultimately result or play out as a full flush or a big bang, if you will. It's going to feather in over time. So, I think it's going to be probably a bit episodic in terms of continue to progress from individual partners and products in terms of how that plays out and how fast it moves. But again, as we sit here now, we would say we would not expect that to be anything that happens near term. And our hope is that, later 2022, we start to see that feather out. Erik Woodring : Maybe just a quick look back, organic growth of, call it, 8 points in 4Q. It was pretty strong and ahead of, I think, what your annual guidance sort of implied. So, just as you look across segments, maybe some commentary on where you believe you've outperformed your expectations versus three months ago. And then maybe is that a product of share gains? Is that product of stronger market growth, just anyway to decipher some of the outperformance in 4Q? Christine Leahy : As we look at Q4 and the strength across the segments, the nice thing is it was balanced across transactions and solutions. And I do think \u2013 I'm not going to go back into supply chain, but I do think supply chain ended up impacting growth on some categories across each.  But that said, look, I think in every element, whether it was client devices or infrastructure or cloud, I feel confident that the team has really been outperforming the market in a very balanced way. When you think about the acquisitions we've made and our ability to integrate them very quickly into the organization as practice groups and as part of the larger CDW, areas like security in Focal Point and what we bring to market there and the speed that we're growing there or our Digital Velocity practice and our ServiceNow automation practice and how that is flowing into 54% growth in our services category. So, I feel very good that we are outperforming taking share, and in particular, in those high growth areas where we are investing. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim Suva : I only have one question. It's probably directed towards Chris. In your prepared comments, you talked about, in 2020, a big strength year in K-12. And then, in 2021, more of a pivot to enterprise. So, Chris, I'm just kind of asking, as you look into, say, 2022, the end markets, what strength \u2013 or maybe is it cloud? Is it services or type of products that you see maybe being stronger in, say, 2022 versus 2021? Christine Leahy : Customers are still \u2013 across all of the segments, customers are still prioritizing, whether it's remote, work from home, learn from home, just remote work, work from anywhere, and virtual settings. So, solutions that address those needs are going to continue to drive a solid performance. At the same time, I think the pandemic is really likely going to impact our customers in a slightly different way as we think about 2022 because we're all more prepared to deal with it. So, we are seeing customers absolutely pivot or enhance their investment portfolio and focus on infrastructure, both on-prem refresh, on-prem new technology, particularly software driven, as well as cloud options, to drive resiliency, to drive agility, to drive securing platforms and endpoint devices.  So, 2022, as we think about the products, what we're seeing from customers suggests a very balanced year across the portfolio. That's really how I describe it going into 2022. Operator : The next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Chris, can you talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers in terms of their willingness to absorb price increases? Just sort of in general, what you're hearing with relation to the inflationary environment because, obviously, that's going to be something key to the industry, frankly, being able to offset some of the other pressures. Christine Leahy : Here's what I am hearing. Nobody likes price increases, but virtually all commercial customers, technology is the number one investment. People and technology. So, if there's a budget to spend, they're not cutting back on budgets at all. In fact, they might be expanding them. But having to be very disciplined about cost containment. So, again, our expertise across the full spectrum allows us, with our customers, to have conversations that can drive cost reduction, cost management in a way that makes us even more valuable. But we're not finding commercial customers or other customers, for that matter, who are reducing technology investments at all. So, that's the good news. And again, technology is essential to being competitive, to winning, to educating, to doing all the things that companies are trying to do and organizations are trying to do. So, we're not seeing any material impact at this point. And, obviously, we're passing prices along.  Al, I don't know if you'd add anything. Al Miralles : Yeah, just a couple of comments, Shannon. So, obviously, ASPs have varied quite a bit by product. And it is partially a function of availability and just supply chain environment. I would say that, in pockets, customers are getting more creative. They're willing to accept substitutes in terms of different products, and they're willing to kind of think about solutions in different ways. And that's certainly helped to free up some capacity. I'd say our partners have done an exceptional job doing the same. So there definitely is price pressure. I would say that largely customers are getting through that. Written demand continues to be extremely strong. Written  And then, just for us, right, our job is and what we're focused on is how do we serve our customers best and bring in the best solutions. And as it pertains to financial impacts, obviously, I think we've done a really nice job, making sure that we can pass through these price increases where they happen and insulate ourselves from a gross profit perspective. Shannon Cross : You've guided to low 8% for operating margin, which, obviously, is higher than you've done in the past. Is that absolutely all from the acquisition? Or are there any mix issues or benefits actually we should take into account as we think about the core business? And then, again, I know you talked a little bit about synergies, but I'm just kind of curious if you could bucket what's really driving the margin improvement? Al Miralles : First, notwithstanding Sirius, we would expect that we would have made progress on our gross margins and our NGOI margins. You add Sirius and that's obviously accretive as well. And we actually think the power of the organizations coming together, that's going to make that really meaningful.  Just keep in mind, so we are providing outlook to that low 8, and it's the combination of that inorganic and organic. Just keep in mind, there are wildcards, right, that will be influenced by things like supply chain, it will be influenced by how much the business is transactional versus solutions. But again, as we sit here today, we feel really good about our prospects to continue to make progress on our margins. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess a couple of quick ones for Al, really. I think if I go back to the time that you announced the Sirius acquisition, the pro forma gross profit margin was expected to do 18.5%. So, I was just looking if you can give me some color on how gross margin strength through 2022 and how should I think about the exit rate for the gross margins relative to the pro forma number that you had talked about? Al Miralles : Yes, really pointing back to what we've provided on the investor meeting for Sirius, we noted that their gross margins are higher than ours. And so, we would certainly expect that that accretive effect is going to come through. And again, in addition to our progress, otherwise. Now, look, we don't provide outlook. So I'm not going to quote for you specifically what our gross margins would be. But I think if you apply the math on where we're coming out, from an NGOI margin outlook perspective, you get a good sense of the progress we expect we're going to make. Samik Chatterjee : Follow up on Sirius again, which is \u2013 I think you talked about flat revenue in 2021. You're expecting growth in 2022 to look more in line with the rest of CDW. And you talked about reinvestments in that business as well. So, how should we think about this? Is this more of a reinvestment into accelerating growth in Sirius, which would then contribute more towards your content outperformance relative to the industry? Is that the purpose of driving the reinvestment? How should we think about acceleration in the growth from here on? Christine Leahy : Let me start with that one. I think as a starting place, a reminder that with Sirius, we are actively and swiftly bringing them together. So, when you think of some of the other acquisitions we've recently done, they've really been practice areas that can tuck into our technology groups in a holistic way. Sirius, we are going to bring the organization into CDW and literally integrate it. So, as we think about growth in the future, when we say we expect Sirius to drive, at least 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market, what we mean is we expect the teams to perform as CDW has always performed with the benefit of our competitive advantages and outperforming the market. So, we think about it on a combined basis as opposed to a standalone Sirius contribution. Al Miralles : And maybe just one thing I would add there in terms of your comments about value we add and the synergies. So, look, I think we've talked about the more immediate impacts that can be made from an accretive perspective on margin. And we do fully believe that putting the combined entities together will be powerful and will lead to value. Look, if we think long run, certainly short run, that's going to provide benefits. And we think long run, taking those synergies and those values and saying let's continue to put them back into the business, from a long run perspective, that's where the real upside is. So, we think that 2022 will show great progress in terms of our accretion on margin on our progress, on our strategy and those investments and reinvestments will further reinforce that build for the future. Operator : Our final question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : In terms of the price increases in the industry, I guess I was hoping a little bit color in terms of how you guys are thinking about how price increases are impacting, I guess, the US GDP growth that you guys expect, as well as the contribution to your top line? Al Miralles : Look, I don't know if I have one single answer in terms of the impact. I will say that and reiterate the written demand continues to be super strong. So, as we think about the growth of prices, which have been meaningful in different pockets across our product set, it has not stopped demand. And I think that is, like Chris said, a testament to the power of technology and the importance of technology and the fact that our vast customer base is looking to go forward and continuing to invest in their own efforts in digital transformation. And so, really, if you look from a top line perspective, in terms of revenue, we don't think it's had a meaningful impact. [indiscernible] demand is definitely still there. And our belief is that will largely continue. Keith Housum : I guess the point I'm trying to unpack a little bit further is that it's consistent across a lot of the people that we've talked to, there's a lot of demand out there, prices have increased, but yet it seems like US IT forecasts are in the 3.5% and 5.5% growth. I'm just kind of questioning why the number is not perhaps higher. Christine Leahy : Well, let me just add. We will, obviously, as we always do, update as we go through the course of the year, but right now, what we're seeing is a moderation in estimates for GDP. Inflationary trends, uncertain where those will be. And the wildcards in the macro environment, labor shortages, et cetera, I think you're hearing people at the beginning of the year taking a clear eyed view of what to expect in 2020. Look, ASPs could drive it up, but we'll know more as we start to move through the year on all of these things. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I'll pass the conference over to Chris Leahy, CEO and President. Chris, please go ahead. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Bailey. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the absolute privilege and opportunity to serve you. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes the CDW fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect your line.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I will begin today\u2019s call with a brief overview of our results, strategic progress and outlook and Al will run through the financials and our capital allocation priorities. And then we\u2019ll move right to your questions. We had an outstanding start to the year. The team\u2019s continued to execute well in a challenging supply environment and delivered exceptional top line growth and profitability. For the first quarter net sales were $5.9 billion, 23% higher than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $462 million up 26% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.20 up 26% on a reported basis. These exceptional results reflect our ability to address customer priorities with solutions across the full spectrum of IT and the inclusion of Sirius. Customers continue to evolve as we move ahead into the new normal. Digital transformation, agility and security remained top concerns with return to office driving collaboration, networking and endpoint solutions. Customers want to manage costs while meeting or exceeding coworker and customer service level requirements. At the same time, customers across our diverse and markets are seeking ways to supplement technology resources in today\u2019s war for talent environment. Our ability to meet all these needs led to a broad based and balanced performance. There were three drivers of our performance during the quarter. The first driver with our broad and diverse portfolio of customer end markets, as you know we have five U.S. sales channels; corporate small business, health care, government and education. Each of these channels is a meaningful business on its own, with 2021 annual sales ranging from $1.8 billion to over $6 billion. Within each channel teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together deliver $2.6 billion U.S. in 2021 sales. This scale and balance across customer and markets positions us to perform when external factors impact certain sectors or geographies. This quarter our commercial markets, corporate and small business, along with our healthcare and international markets all delivered strong double digit growth. As expected education and government growth was depressed as they left strong prior year stimulus and large deal driven results. Our corporate team delivered a 46% increase. Growth was strong and balanced across transactions and solutions. The team did an excellent job addressing customer demand for return to Work solutions, digital transformation and the need for agility and security. Unit growth coupled with ASP increases resulted in another quarter of strong double digit growth in client devices and cloud spend was excellent. Small business posted a 21% increase performance was broad based across both transactions and solutions. Return to office strategy and modernizing workspaces drove strong collaboration, networking and security growth for hybrid work environments. Remote enablement drove another strong quarter of client device growth up double digits both in unit and ASPs. Security performance was up mid teens and cloud spend was robust. Public posted a 6% increase on top of last year\u2019s exceptional 20% plus growth. Healthcare increased 27%. Ongoing focus on driving productivity to offset higher costs from staffing shortages and other acute care needs lead to double digit solutions growth. Cloud adoption was strong driven by the speed and efficiency cloud solutions can deliver. Government posted a mid single digit increase. State and local delivered a high single digit increase driven by client devices and security. As we shared last quarter, we continue to help our customers as they work through the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing and expect projects to continue to be implemented as we move through 2022. Federal performance played out as expected and was balanced across both the department of defense and civilian while lapping tough compares. As we shared last quarter, we continue to experience the lumpy nature of government contracts and contracting changes. There is no change to our expectation that growth will return later in the year.  Higher ed strong double digit performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall education sales decreased 4% off the first quarter of 2021 remarkable 101% growth. The higher ed team continues to help customers implement student success programs using technology to give an institution an edge with comprehensive endpoint solutions, improve security, campus connectivity and enhanced dorm room experiences. The team delivered excellent client device growth and school systems tapped our capabilities to address the war for technology talent which drove increased usage of CDW services to fill the gap in staffing needs. While K-12 delivered strong non-seasonal results they posted a year-over-year decline on top of last year\u2019s exceptional 100% growth. Emergency connectivity funding which was expected to end during the first half of 2022 was extended and a third wave was announced adding complexity to an already challenging process. Many school systems are leveraging the extended funding window to digest better options and plans for their IT spend. Other our combined UK and Canada results increased 13% on a reported basis. UK grew double digits in local currency and Canada increased high single digits in local currency. Each market saw balanced strength across both commercial and public customers. Customer priorities remain similar to those in the U.S. The second driver of first quarter performance with our broad and deep product and solutions portfolio. Our ability to address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum drove excellent performance across both our solutions and transactions portfolios. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages including our distribution centers, extensive logistic capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate an ongoing supply challenge. U.S. hardware increased high teens. Growth was broad based and included double digit increases in net cash on servers and server management, client devices, and video/audio. This exceptional performance was on top of 2020 one\u2019s first quarter double digit high hardware growth. Demand continued to outpace supply in several key areas, notably in the networking space, and remaining orders built during the quarter. Customers once again placed orders to get in line for second half 2022 projects, especially in Netcom. U.S. software posted a 40% increase driven by success helping customers upgrade their edge and secure their IT environments with double digit increases network management software and security software. Cloud was a meaningful contributor to this quarter strong performance with significant double digit increases in customer spend and gross profit led by productivity, platform, security and collaboration workloads. U.S. services sales doubled. Growth was broad based and balanced, driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. As you can see excellent, broad and balanced performance across the business. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter; our customer and coworker centric strategy. Over the past three years, we have executed against our strategy to enhance our high relevant and high growth solutions and services with both organic and inorganic investments. Eight acquisitions have deepened and advanced our services capabilities including automation, cloud native and DevOps, cyber security, and our services scale and reach. We welcomed nearly 3,000 new coworkers from these eight acquisitions with more than half and technical rules. Since year end 2018 our technical team has doubled in size, and at the end of this first quarter was more than 5,000 strong. Today, technical coworkers comprise more than half of all customer facing coworkers. Together with their other CDW colleagues, they form an amazing high performing team; a high performing team that is a key competitive advantage for CDW, a team that is the most engaged enabled and energize team in the industry. All our investments whether homegrown or inorganic, are intended to maximize our key point of differentiation in the marketplace. We are a one stop trusted partner with capabilities across the entire continuum of IT. Capabilities that help customers achieve the outcomes they need from technology so they can do great things. Let me share a couple of recent customer examples that demonstrate how our investments help customers achieve outcomes. A soft drink manufacturer wanted to upgrade their on-premise voice system. The customer had two desired outcomes for the solution. Number one flexibility to expand as their business grew. And number two an excellent user experience. Since IT staff was focused on other priorities, the solution needed to be managed off-premise. Leveraging CDW is world class unified communications as a service capability and ServiceNow capabilities the team designed a flexible and cost competitive, integrated full stack managed collaboration anywhere solution. The solution included CDW professional services for upfront design, planning, configuration and deployment and CDW managed services to provide ongoing MCA support and integration with our ServiceNow ticketing platform. A great outcome for the customer and for the team who bested large telecom providers to win the deal. They also deepen their relationship with the customer and delivered more than 3 million in licensing and services revenues. The second example of how our investments enable customers to achieve the outcomes they need is the recent adoption of Focal Point Academy by a major technology company. Focal Point Academy is a bespoke training program that delivers workforce development programs that solve today\u2019s greatest cyber security problems; finding training and retaining skilled cyber professionals. Focal Point Academy operationally focused portfolio which covers high demand topics like threat hunting and application security, coupled with its ability to train and develop both senior and junior technical professionals was exactly what the customer needed to achieve its desired outcome of mitigating risk. Prior to our acquisition of focal point, we would not have been able to deliver this important global solution and further deepen our relationship with the customer. Investments in our customer and coworker centric growth strategy are integral to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that leads to our expectations for the rest of the year. During the balance of 2022, we will continue to execute against our strategy to deepen our services and solutions capabilities. We are making excellent integration progress with Sirius and that will remain a key focus area for the balance of 2022 as will investments in our coworkers and our own digital transformation. We will continue to balance investments with our growth and profitability expectations which are now higher than previously shared at year end. Given our excellent momentum coming into the second quarter and first quarter performance, we now expect to outperform the U.S. IT market by 325 to 425 basis points, 125 basis points higher than our view at year end 2021. Our view of U.S. IT market growth has also increased and we now look for 2022 growth of 4% which is 50 basis points above our prior view. Taken together this equates to constant certain constant currency growth of seven and a quarter to eight and a quarter percent above 2021 combined CDW revenues of $22.8 billion. Recall 2021 combined CDW is calculated as those Sirius had been acquired on January 1, 2021 instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1 since our outlook represents a 17.5% to 18.5% increase over 2021 results. This outlook reflects our baseline expectations that given 2021 second half strong hardware performance, we will mix into more cloud and security in the back half of this year. It also reflects our expectation that supply constraints remain relatively consistent with the first half of the year. As always, we remain mindful of our wildcards, the potential for further disruption to the supply chain, changes in COVID, or macro economic performance and we will keep a watchful eye on these and other potential issues. As we always do, we will provide an update on our view on our next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best which is leverage our competitive advantages and out execute the competition. We will also continue to invest to ensure we remain our customers trusted partner who delivers the outcomes they need whether for innovation, cost management, agility, risk mitigation or user experience. If the past two years have shown us anything it is that our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. Let me turn it over to Al now who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Al Miralles : Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with their 2022 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on slide 8 consolidated net sales are $5.9 billion up 23% on a reported and average daily sales basis in constant currency. On an average daily sales basis sequential sales increased 7.4% versus the fourth quarter which is well above historical average sequential decline of 5%. This reflected two primary factors; first demand for return to work and remote enablement solutions remain strong and drove sequential growth in our commercial channels, and international. As Chris mentioned, corporate and small business had broad based and balanced growth across both transactions and solutions. Second, Q1 reported results reflected three months of contribution from Sirius versus one month in Q4. Notwithstanding that Sirius is first quarter has historically been the lowest quarter of absolute sales and gross profit dollars for the business. On the supply side, our overall backlog increased in Q1 at a similar level to the fourth quarter remain elevated year-over-year in both transactional and solution categories. We continue to make strategic investments and inventory to support our customers through this constrained supply environment and the team once again did a great job leveraging CDW\u2019s competitive advantage to ensure strong returns on working capital. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 million a year-over-year increase of 38.8%. Netted down revenues grew faster than the underlying business represented nearly 31% of total gross profit more than three points over the last year. A higher mix of net service contract revenue, primarily within Software as a Service, favorable product mix and rate and increase net sales and margin on professional services combined to deliver a record gross margin of 18.6% up 220 basis points versus last year. Turning to SG&A on slide 9 non-GAAP SG&A totaled $642 million for the quarter. Year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll as a result of the increase coworkers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 14,005 up over 3800 from prior year quarter reflecting organic and inorganic investments in coworkers that support high growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. Recall that Sirius as payroll as a percentage of net sales is higher than our core operations given their higher mix of solutions and services revenues. And this ratio is historically highest in the first quarter due to sale seasonality. The higher level of SG&A also reflects continued investments in the training and development of coworkers, return to office efforts and investment in our own digital transformation and technology strategy. As Chris mentioned, we will continue to balance investment with their growth and profitability expectations. Investments in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. GAAP operating income was $387 million up 19.6%. Non-GAAP operating income was $462 million up 25.7% and non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.8% up 20 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points from Q4. Moving to slide 10, interest expense was $56 million. Higher interest expense is primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 11 was 24.3%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $80 million. To get our non-GAAP effective tax rate we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, as shown on slide 12. For the for quarter our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.7% up 50 basis points versus last year\u2019s rate primarily driven by higher state taxes as well as taxes on foreign earnings. As you can see on slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 137 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.83. Our non-GAAP net income was $302 million in the quarter up 21%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.20 up 27% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 14, at March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $387 million and net debt was $6.2 billion. Liquidity remain strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to slide 15, a three month average cash conversion cycle is 20 days down two days from last year\u2019s first quarter, reflecting the impact of the Sirius acquisition. Free cash flow for the quarter was $466 million, as shown on slide 16. This is higher than a typical first quarter reflecting strong growth in the business and effective working capital management. For the quarter we deployed cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives of paying dividends and paying down debt including $67 million of dividends and $260 million in debt repayments. Turning to capital allocation on slide 17, our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases we will continue to target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 3.1 times down from 3.4 times at the end of 2021 demonstrating strong cash generation and progress towards returning to our targeted net leverage ratio. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022. While we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases until net leverage is in our target range we are on a path to delivering on these priorities. Moving to the outlook for 2022 on slide 18, starting with sales. As Chris mentioned, the first quarter was a great start to the year. We have excellent momentum entering Q2. We are cognizant of potential market variables as we look further out. Recall that on a combined basis, CDW\u2019s net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021 from Sirius. With that in mind our updated outlook for the full year 2022 is now us it market growth of 4% plus 325 to 425 basis points of CDW outperformance in constant currency on a combined basis. On a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 17.5% to 18.5% growth in constant currency. A baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we\u2019ve been experiencing. We would expect to be at the lower end of our premium range, we mix more in the netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experienced elevated levels of supply constraints. We bet the higher end of hardware growth is stronger and supply improves. Our outlook also assumes neutral currency impact for the full year. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. Our non-GAAP earnings per share recall that 2021 would have been $8.49 per share on a full year combined basis compared to a reported $7.97 per share, which includes only one month of Sirius. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be approximately 13% plus or minus 50 basis points in constant currency and on a combined basis. This equates to low 20% full year growth in constant currency on a reported basis. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on an annual constant currency basis. Slide 19 provides additional modeling thoughts, including our updated net sales split for the year. We now expect the first half of the year to be approximately 25 basis points above the high end of our historic norm of 48% to 49%. This reflects our over performance in the first quarter and strong momentum coming into Q2. It also reflects that it\u2019s too early to update our expectations for the second half of the year. We continue to expect the back half of the year reflecting greater mix and netted down revenues as we overlap 2021 strong client device sales. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted down revenues has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins all else equal. Our expectations for the first half split, a low single digit sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis, this equates to close to 20% year-over-year reported net sales growth in the second quarter, which is roughly 230 basis points above our Q2 implied growth rate expectations from last quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with the second quarter reported sales. Finally, as you know timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow. It may ebb and flow by quarter, but over the content continuum. We continue to expect to be within our long term free cash flow rule of thumb of three and three quarters to four and a quarter percent of net sales, assuming current tax rates. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open up for questions. And can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we will take is from Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Matt your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question. Matthew Sheerin : Yes, thank you and good morning. My first question is just regarding the strength you\u2019re seeing across corporate and SMB customers in terms of the remote enablement as it seems like there is a second wave of work from home trends and can you elaborate on that and also, just in terms of the back to office trends. How long do you see that playing out and due to the backlog and the supply constraints do you see this playing out through the year? Christine Leahy : Yes. Good morning Matt. It\u2019s Chris. Yes what we are seeing is customers across our commercial segments, kind of as we mentioned last time getting on with it meaning living within the current environment and making decisions about their back to work strategy, which means they\u2019re bolstering their capabilities in offices. They are bolstering their capability in home environments, because they\u2019re really focused on their co-workers ability to be productive, and deliver seamlessly moving from remote to in office. And as we expected, we continue to see very strong endpoint solution performance this quarter. And we\u2019re also seeing what usually, typically follows that and what was delayed a bit over the last couple of years which is an investment in the hybrid infrastructure to support all the needs of the coworkers and the expectations both at the workload and application level and everything required to create a stronger and more robust infrastructure for those devices. So we will continue to see those two dynamics play out through the course of the year would be our views. It\u2019s different in different segments, but in the current commercial segment, for sure, we\u2019ll continue to see that. Matthew Sheerin : Okay, thank you for that. And the education market seems to be holding up better than most expect. You talked about some of the dynamics there, higher ed spending, offset by weakness in K through 12. Although it seems like that next round of or the extended funding period at least helps that market near term. Should we expect a fall off there? You\u2019re following that funding period, or just general expectations for the K through 12 market? Christine Leahy : Yes, Matt so I think about it, the extension in the new, the little bit of an added round of funding for ECF just is timing. So it gave the schools a little bit of a breather to reflect on their planning and not be rushed to buy. So that\u2019s just an extension. So we\u2019ll see that play out over the next 18 months. At the same time schools are working very hard on ensuring that they don\u2019t lose ground in what they\u2019re trying to do which is teach students and learn. And so when you think about the dynamics of the classroom and the infrastructure needs to support the classroom including audio, visual, interactive monitors, and kind of the new generation of the classroom, we\u2019re starting to already help our customers with that. So look, we look at this as a kind of steady ed long term growth opportunity for CDW at every time there\u2019s been an inflection point in K through 12, in the classroom learning space, CDW has been at the absolute tip of the spear and helping customers get there. And we\u2019ve seen growth as a result. Matthew Sheerin : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Erik, your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Erik Woodring : Great, thank you very much. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the results. Maybe as we sit here 90 days, since you last reported or roughly 90 days, maybe can you just help us understand where some of the supply challenges you\u2019ve been facing? How have you either worsened or where some have improved? And then I have a follow up from there? Christine Leahy : Yes, I guess, what word would I use? I think I\u2019d say kind of unchanged. Meaning we\u2019re not seeing a lot of change in the challenges that we\u2019re all facing. When we think about the supply chain environment, I\u2019d say two things. Number one, it\u2019s an opportunity. But it\u2019s also frustrating. It\u2019s an opportunity for CDW because we know what\u2019s happening, we have more visibility with our partners, I think, than anybody. When you think about our competitive advantages, our ability to take on inventory to support our customers with our balance sheet, having the distribution logistics capabilities, that\u2019s put us in a great position to manage the supply chain issues, I think, again, better than anybody in the market. But it\u2019s frustrating for customers. And we\u2019re helping customers get through that, because we can help them choose alternatives, which they\u2019re a little more open minded now to which we have a pretty good path to get to. But the short answer is supply chain is what it is. And it\u2019s not getting better. It\u2019s not getting worse, some pockets are getting better, some pockets are getting more difficult. But net-net, we\u2019re going to be living with this through 2022 if not into 2023. And again, it\u2019s a matter of who manages it the best and I think we\u2019re doing a really good job of that. Erik Woodring : Great, super helpful and then maybe my follow up would just be you\u2019d beat the first quarter by a healthy amount, call it 280 million, 290 million, you raise the full year guide by 400 million. And then your guide implies 2Q needs to come up by let\u2019s call it $115 million. So most of the raise comes from 1Q and 2Q, is that just you guys taking the view here that perhaps visibility into the back half might not be as clear as perhaps any other year given the supply challenges and what\u2019s going on the market? Or is there anything else that we should be thinking about just as we think about the second half mixing netted down revenue those types of factors? Christine Leahy : Yes, no, Erik, it\u2019s a fair question. Look, its CDW\u2019s typical approach, which is we\u2019ll call it when we\u2019re ready to call it and when we think we have a good visibility. And it\u2019s just too early to call that in the back half of the year right now. But that said outstanding start to the year as you know, and we see absolutely excellent momentum going into Q2 and expect what a robust 20% profit growth in the second half of 2022. So we look at this and see a really aggressive but achievable goal in front of us. So we\u2019re feeling very optimistic about the year and what we\u2019ll call the back half of the year when we get a little closer in the back half of the year. Erik Woodring : Great. Thank you so much. Congrats again. Christine Leahy : Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan. Samik your line is now open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, yes, this is Joe on for Samik Chatterjee. So my first question is a follow up on the full year guide. Question prior can we dissect that a little bit particularly as it relates to the rate outlook for the underlying it market and CDW has outperformance to it? What are you seeing as the main drivers or contributors to the rate outlook for both? And then I guess how much of that rate outlook is being driven by recent acquisitions like Sirius tracking better than expected, as opposed to kind of the traditional CDW business? And then I have a follow up. Christine Leahy : Yes, so let me start with the last past part first, which is our premium to market. And we when we look at the areas that we\u2019ve outperformed in Q1 let\u2019s take notebook overall solutions. Several areas where we just our view is look, we\u2019re really outperforming the market, it\u2019s pretty clear. So that goes into the premium. In terms of whether or not Sirius is contributing, here\u2019s how I think about it on a combined basis we\u2019re responding to customer needs in the current environment and seeing healthy business across both the underlying and Sirius segments. In terms of the underlying IT industry, yes, we brought that up, because we\u2019re starting to feel real momentum in the business, the demand is there, the writings there. So it just feels to us, like the market is growing a little faster than we would have thought at the beginning of the year. So the IT market generally is kind of the written in demand that we\u2019re seeing. The premium is the categories that we\u2019re delivering in and looking at what we triangulate the growth rates to be in the market, we just think we\u2019re outperforming by a wide margin. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then just quickly for my follow up, can you help me understand what you guys are seeing from a pricing perspective versus 90 days goes, and whether that\u2019s translating into a tailwind or headwind for CDW? Christine Leahy : Yes we are, look, pricing continues to be fairly dynamic and fluid, I guess I\u2019d say. And we are continuing to see pricing increases, given what\u2019s happening out in the macro environment that said we are a cost plus model, as you know, and we are not seeing constraints in IT budgets, our customers are still buying, they\u2019re not cutting it budgets because of pricing. And as I think I mentioned our prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing some of the growth kind of split between unit increases and ASP increases. So they\u2019re both contributing to growth across the board, really. Al Miralles : Two things I would just add in and I am more, one thing we see in the supply environment is more creativity and agility, both ourselves and with our partners in terms of where do we pivot to different products, where do we pivot to different solutions and finding customers are accommodating that working with us to try to get to their solutions sooner than later. So that certainly had a bit of an impact from a mix and rate perspective. So just I would note that. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks. Appreciate the colors. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Chris, for my first question, I\u2019d like to add something which is a high level question. Some investors are concerned that we may be going into a recession in the U.S. because the rates are going up or we might see a slowdown in Europe because of the war there. So can you maybe talk to us about how CDW as a company is different from what it was in the 08, 09 timeframe? And do you think the company is better prepared now to face a downturn and in the same way, and you raise your guidance for the full year. Can you talk about what are some of the things that are giving you confidence to do that, given all of the macro and supply chain headwinds that are continuing? Thanks. Christine Leahy : Yes, good morning Ruplu and thanks for the comment. Let me start with the second part first with raising our, with feeding our confidence is what we\u2019re seeing with our customers. It\u2019s the demand. It\u2019s the momentum. It\u2019s the criticality of IT in every walk of every industry to drive competitive advantage, experience, etc. So we just see technology as absolutely central. And really it\u2019s an investment in innovation. It\u2019s no longer viewed as a cost to the business as much as an asset of innovation. And we\u2019re seeing that and feel very confident that that will continue, possibly at the expense of some other investments that organizations make. But technology is top of the list. As far as the macro environment, what might happen here\u2019s what I would tell you. First of all, we have our broad and deep portfolio is the best it\u2019s ever been at any point in time. Secondly, our flexible business model has allowed us, in any challenging time has allowed us to outperform the market and deliver results. And if you look actually at the Great Recession, we did outperform the market. And if you think about the last three years, significant delivery of great performance versus the market. So and in those cases, we also emerge stronger. So you\u2019ve got our portfolio which is better than it\u2019s ever been. You\u2019ve got our flexible business model which has a track record of working and having us deliver performance in downtime. And when you think about our value propositions the third thing, I would say the value proposition for our customers and our partners becomes even more important to them. They become even more reliant on our stability, on our scale on all the things that we deliver. And at the end of the day, that allows us to be opportunistic and helping them and gaining share in the market. So I point you to our track record and our model and our portfolio and our value proposition which has over 35 years, reflected the fact that CDW is a different company performs in tough times and in good times. And typically in tough times, we come out even stronger than when we enter them. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay, thanks for all the details there Chris. Maybe for my follow up. If you can talk a little bit about the government segment. It was good to see revenues grow 5% year-on-year after several you\u2019ve been facing tough comps and several quarters of year-on declines. Last year, you talked about some projects that were delayed. You think those come back in the first half and you think government revenues can continue to grow year-on-year over the next couple of quarters? Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes. No problem on the government side, the federal side we\u2019ve been saying now for a couple of quarters that we expect growth to see growth in the second half of the year and that expectation has not changed. So the projects, we\u2019ve talked about the green shoots we\u2019ve talked about, we expect to be taking hold in the second half of this year as expected. As far as state and local that\u2019s playing out as we thought it would as well, if you remember, the funding was coming in a multiyear fashion. The federal funding and that was extending customer\u2019s buying patterns a bit. And we\u2019ve been really helping them on the planning phase of spending that those that funding federal funding and we\u2019re starting to see that come to fruition. And you see that in the results this quarter which is those projects starting to flow out now which is a very positive thing and reflective of what we expected to happen. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Congrats again on the quarter and on the strong guide. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks. Good morning. I thought I would just maybe start with a question on margins. If I remember right, when you close the Sirius acquisition, you talked about it adding just over 100 basis points to gross margin and about 20 basis points to operating margin based on 2020 numbers with no synergy assumption. We look at this quarter gross margin was up over 200 basis points. So double of that. But operating margin still up just about 20 basis points year-over-year. Maybe you could give it some color on the better mix on gross margin, the growth metrics being healthy overall, but seeing minimal leverage on the operating line. And I imagine you\u2019re going to talk about investments. So more specifics on the nature of those investments and expectation for return would be helpful? Thank you. Al Miralles : Sure, Adam and good morning. This is Al. So on gross margins for the quarter I would comment on two things certainly you had the impact from Sirius for the quarter and I would say that benefit was as expected. We had a couple of the things that benefited our gross margin for the quarter. Number one stronger netted down revenues actually grew two times the level of our sales, product margin mix and rate were strong. And so they were important components on the gross margin front. So down to your NGOI margin question. So yes, NGOI margin 20 basis points better than prior year and basis points better than prior quarter certainly had the benefit of Sirius. Just the one call out I would give you in terms of the accrued and benefits there for Sirius is that, given the seasonality of their business, Q1 is typically lower on the scale of the full year. And therefore some of the fixed cost leverage we get from Sirius is more on the latter half of the year. So that has a bit of a dilute effect for the quarter. But still we were able to turn in really strong 7.8 for the quarter. Adam Tindle : Understood and maybe as a follow up for Chris on backlog. You\u2019ve previously talked about feathering in over multiple quarters versus a big bang and one quarter. Just wondering if you could maybe revisit this since we saw such a strong quarter here on growth metrics. I think you did say remaining orders built in the quarter. So I just wanted to clarify that. And certainly any color on the size and composition of backlog today versus 90 days ago would be super helpful. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes, morning, Adam. I\u2019d say look in terms of backlog building it was in line with what we saw in Q4. So that would give you kind of characterizes the size. In terms of what we\u2019re seeing is a feathering out. So I think I said we were seeing pockets of improvement yet new pockets of pressure. So we\u2019ve seen notebooks free up a little bit. Chrome books free up a little bit over the course of time, but solutions, products really more constrained now than they were before in particular Netcom. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hearing that a lot. So look, we\u2019re in it. We still expect it feathering out. We\u2019re not seeing anything in our results, frankly, or in our conversations with partners that suggest anything than the way we\u2019ve already described it to you. Adam Tindle : Understood, thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI. Amit your line is now open. Please ask your question. Amit Daryanani : Thanks. It\u2019s Amit Daryanani, just to be clear. Chris, I\u2019m hoping you could talk about the increased complexity of IT operation that especially with return to work. And this seems to be a sustained and acute labor shortage, especially in the skilled worker side. I\u2019m wondering if that combination of those two practices is resulting in fewer than seen that can stand expand and you suddenly see that you\u2019re engaging with more mid and even larger enterprises switching typically would in your industry as the AI using this enabled the PAM expansion? And what could that do to your growth rate is your forward? Christine Leahy : Yes, good morning Amit. In terms of the tech now, I want to make sure I could having trouble hearing you a little bit. But you were asking about PAM expansion due to servicing enterprise size customers and in particular technology talent supply shortages. Did I get that right? Amit Daryanani : Yes. Essentially, yes. Given the labor shortages, IT is getting more complex. Are you getting pulled in by bigger enterprises that you typically wouldn\u2019t and does that span your time? Does that alter your growth rate? Christine Leahy : Yes, okay. I got. Fair question. Yes. Well, when you look at the couple of things you look at Sirius\u2019s customer segment. And it\u2019s heavily enterprise oriented. So yes, we are focusing on the enterprise. If you look at CDW\u2019s customers well, we have typically said our sweet spot is customers up to 5000 end users, we have a very large number of enterprise customers that we service and that service extremely well in the past five years, given the increase in complexity. So yes, we are in the enterprise space. We\u2019re continuing to grow in the enterprise space. We have not done the calculation regarding the TAM. But we certainly expect to be able to continue to be successful in that space now more than ever. It used to be you think about enterprise and one of the reasons they might not have turned to CDW was because they would have and could afford the technology talent within their organization to handle everything that they needed. But now given the speed and complexity, even the larger organizations can\u2019t keep up with the changing nature of technology and our ability to supplement and address that problem is really become a very interesting value proposition for those organizations. And boy, did we see it play out in the during the pandemic. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. And then Al you talked about gross margins and some of the levers that lead to better performance in March. Can you start with the durability of these gross margins? Because I think you talked about mix getting better in the back of the year with more cloud and security. So could you run in the mid 18% to 19% gross margins for the remainder of the year, or what are the puts and takes moving forward? Al Miralles : Sure Amit. First, let\u2019s just start with our expectation or outlook of low 8% on NGOI margin. So that is what we guide on in that regard. But just back to your comment, your question on gross margin. Look, if we look at our strategy and the execution, I think that that has played out over time, in terms of expansion of our gross margin. I think this quarter is a great example of that really bring the power, all of that; strong net it down revenues, product margin was a factor, Sirius coming online. So a lot of those variables are playing out. We would anticipate that that would continue and particularly talked about the second half, we expect higher level of netted down revenues which certainly is the theme. So if you get back to that NGOI margin, we believe that execution of the strategy and follow through on that will deliver the outcomes we\u2019re expecting. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim, your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question. Jim Suva : Thank you. And congratulations, Chris earlier in the call, you had mentioned that the supply situation largely hasn\u2019t changed from say 90 days ago when the investors last spoke to you on such a call. I wanted to ask though, if you dissect the end markets though, or I\u2019m sorry, not end markets, but end products, whether it be PCs or servers or computer devices. Have you seen some shifts there? Because there\u2019s been indications of things like Chrome books seeing actually a big deterioration, while maybe others seen higher demand? So I\u2019m wondering if you take it to the device level? Have you seen some material puts and takes and shifts? Christine Leahy : Yes Jim here is what I would say. I would characterize the supply environment as pockets of improvement and pockets of pressure. The pockets of improvement over the past several months has been in the notebook and Chrome book. The transactional side of our business. And the pockets of pressure have really showed up in the solution side. So we did see a shift, if you will. So we saw some feathering out on the client devices. And but we\u2019ve seen by backlog grow in the solution side of the business. And it\u2019s complex because the solution side what happens is if you\u2019re using an integrated solution, if you\u2019re missing one part of that, you can\u2019t get the software out if you don\u2019t have the hardware. So it gets pretty complex. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. And I think I mentioned also netcom was a particular networking is a particular area, a pressure area, I guess I would say within the solutions categories. Jim Suva : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then as my follow up probably more appropriate for Al. Al when we think about cash flow and uses am I correct to kind of 2022 should be kind of a debt pay down here? Or is there sufficient cash flow, because component costs are going higher and high growth, that inventory will need to be cash flow consumed to support the inventory, or you guys looking at actually strategically adding in more software services, security skill sets to your portfolio. Thank you. Al Miralles : Sure. Thanks, Jim. So first, just on the quarter free cash flow, we had a strong free cash flow quarter and above our rule of thumb. You\u2019ll recall prior quarter we were somewhat below that rule of thumb. And so I would just note to you, we\u2019re seeing some variability in environment. And some of that Jim is a function of us making those investments and really leveraging our working capital. For the full year we still expect to be within our rule of thumb for free cash flow, albeit there may be some variability quarter-to-quarter. All of that intended really to go to number one, our capital priority of dividend payment and then two debt repayment. And I will note that for the quarter, we had pretty meaningful repayment of our debt. And we got our net leverage down from 3.4 to 3.1. And our expectation is we\u2019ll continue to make that a priority. And our goal is to get back in our net leverage range for the full year by the end of the year. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details Chris and Al. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith your line is now open. Please go ahead. Keith Housum : Good morning, guys. Al hopefully, we\u2019ll have more color on the 23% growth, I understand was a good, very good quarter for demand. But can you provide a bit more breakdown between the three different elements, which I think I\u2019m hearing is this Sirius growth in the volume and growth in price increases. Can you provide a context about the contributions of each? Al Miralles : Yes. Sure, Keith. Happy to weigh in, Chris may have something on the back end of that. So 23% is the all in as we mentioned, prior quarter focuses on integrating the companies and just the nature of integrating our sales. We\u2019re looking at it on combined basis, so that 23% is inclusive of Sirius. And I would just note, notwithstanding my comment about seasonality of Sirius business is operating as expected, and things are moving a pace on the integration. Otherwise, I would just point back to our comments about in channels and contribution as well as product portfolio. And I\u2019d say, for the quarter, we fired on all cylinders, and really contributions came from many of the key spots in the investment areas that we\u2019ve been focused on. Christine Leahy : Hi Keith, and its Chris just to add on to what Al said I think he really coined it with hitting on all cylinders. So the business is hitting on all cylinders, the customer end markets, the portfolio and the integration. I know you have to question about integration. I guess, what I would say is number one, serious, the integration is going outstanding. I could not be more pleased with the pace and with the results. And also with the execution in the marketplace. As we said last quarter, we\u2019re really, really focused on integrating the businesses and bringing them together and going to market as one CDW and not really parsing out dollars and assigning creditors, as we\u2019d like to say. So I would just tell you that it\u2019s going great. Our focus, this first quarter has been all about our customers and our partners and our coworkers in particular, and creating the roadmaps and the support and the tools they need to be successful. And at the end of the day I think we said a couple quarters ago, we expect one plus one equal more than two, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing that is making us doubt that. We\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re bringing to the market, and in particular excited about how our customers are responding to the value add in the combined entity. Keith Housum : Okay. I appreciate that. It is a follow up to that in terms of like the turnover of the coworkers and I guess the inflationary environment. Can you guys provide a little bit of color in terms of how is the turnover of the coworker right now and in terms of compared to prior years? And then in terms of what you guys are forced to do in terms of salary adjustments perhaps the impact that will have on operating expenses? Christine Leahy : Yes. Keith a great question. And we\u2019re facing the same tight labor market that everybody does. The good news is we\u2019ve been an employer of choice for a very long time. And we\u2019ve focused on investing in our coworkers since our founding, and so the unique environment, the unique culture is a real draw for coworkers, the ability to grow one\u2019s career, the interesting work we do, that all is important, as important as compensation to coworkers staying with CDW. We\u2019ve seen some tick up a little bit of a hiccup in attrition in certain pockets of the CDW, but nothing that I would say is kind of worth noting. We\u2019re working harder to bring in the talent. It takes a little longer to get new talent in. But we\u2019re, of course very focused on keeping our talent and that potential for attrition. In terms of the costs and adjustments to our compensation. Look, again, we think about total rewards to coworkers and that includes the work. the people, the benefits, everything combined, and not just the compensation, per se. So we haven\u2019t had to make major adjustments. And then don\u2019t forget that the largest section of our organization is variable comp. And so it\u2019s all about driving growth and the more growth they drive the more they make, and as you can see from our results, we should have a pretty happy team. Keith Housum : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. We have no further questions. [Operator Instructions] Yes. And there\u2019s no further question. So I\u2019d like to hand back to Chris, the CEO for closing remarks. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Daniel. I appreciate it and appreciate your time today. I just want to emphasize that CDW has never been more well positioned to support our customers in a fast paced and changing technology environment. We\u2019re very excited about the future. So I want to close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our more than 14,000 coworkers around the globe. It is their ongoing dedication to serving our customers, which is key and will continue to be key to profitably outperforming the IT market going forward. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for the time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you all next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results, strategic progress and outlook, and then Al will run through the financials and our capital allocation priorities. And then we will move right to your questions. We had an exceptional second quarter. The teams continued to execute well in a challenging supply environment and delivered all time record sales, margins and profits. For the second quarter, net sales were $6.1 billion, 19% higher than last year and our first $6 billion quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $516 million, up 23% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.49 also up 23% year-over-year. These exceptional results reflect our ability to address customers' priorities across a broad array of end markets with solutions across the full spectrum of IT. Digital transformation, agility and security remain top priorities with ongoing focus on hybrid work and return to office driving collaboration, networking and endpoint solutions. Customers also continue to seek ways to manage costs while meeting or exceeding coworker and customer service level requirements. Our ability to meet all of these needs led to a broad-based and balanced performance and was a result of three key drivers. Number one, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets; number two, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio; and number three, our ongoing execution against our customer-centric strategy. Let's take a look at how each contributed to our growth this quarter. First, the breadth and diversity of our customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels : corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $8 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of US$2.6 billion. This portfolio approach enables us to toggle to the best pockets of opportunity. Each team did an exceptional job this quarter. Our corporate team delivered another record quarter with a 34% net sales increase. Results were balanced and broad-based. Customers continue to invest to stay ahead of the curve, to either begin or advance their efforts to address the accelerating pace of change. Digital transformation drove excellent solutions growth with strong double-digit increases in NetComm, servers, collaboration, cloud and software. Customers are increasingly seeking our advice and expertise in navigating their IT journeys, and this drove strong performance in professional and managed services and warranties. At the same time, corporate customers continue to turn to us to meet their needs for hybrid and return to office solutions. And the team delivered another quarter of double-digit client device growth, reflecting both unit and ASP increases. Small business performance was in line with our expectations and the team delivered a 4% increase on top of last year's 60% growth. This net sales growth understates demand as customers prioritize cloud and software solutions, which are accounted for on a netted down basis. A better barometer of customer demand in the quarter is the gross profit performance of small business, which increased at more than twice the rate of sales growth. During the quarter, customer spend increased more than 20% for both security and cloud as customers modernize, optimize and secure the applications running on their endpoint devices. Infrastructure spending is the natural follow-on from remote enablement and return to office demand. Remote enablement remains strong and the team produced another quarter of double-digit collaboration and client device growth. Public posted an 8% increase this quarter. The healthcare team delivered another excellent quarter, up 30%. We continue to help our hospital systems and healthcare organizations leverage technology to mitigate staffing shortages and wage and cost inflation. A great example of this is seamless patient intake and record keeping solutions that use biometric security to improve emergency department throughput. And while healthcare has taken a more cautious view toward cloud in the past, the benefits of flexibility and reduced IT support burden are compelling more customers to adopt cloud-based solutions, driving a double-digit increase in cloud customer spend. Government posted 19% growth. State and local performance reflected continued success helping customers maximize the value of their IT investments, leveraging our expertise in professional and managed services. At the same time, the team is helping customers navigate through the complexities of funding programs and the impact on their long-term planning efforts. While customers generally have until 2024 to 2025 to spend stimulus, data continues to proliferate and we delivered excellent cloud and storage performance. Remote collaboration continues to be a priority driving double-digit growth in devices and audio/video. As we expected, federal return to growth in the quarter. Federal customers prioritized services tied to solution inception and ongoing management. Similar to state and local, remote collaboration led to double-digit transactions growth. After the past two years of unusual spending patterns, we anticipate a return to more normal season patterns for federal, including fiscal year-end September budget activity. Higher ed's strong performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall education sales decreased 6% off of last year's excellent second quarter performance. The higher ed team continues to help universities enable student success and student access programs using technology to give institutions an enrollment edge. This includes deploying comprehensive endpoint solutions, security and campus connectivity to deliver enhanced dorm room experience. K-12 posted a healthy seasonal increase, but remained below last year's exceptional stimulus-driven results. During the quarter, a third wave of Emergency Connectivity Funding, ECF was announced, which opened July 1 and extends through December 2023, adding complexity to an already broader way of funding. We continue to work with school systems to help identify how to maximize available funding to maintain equity and access IT advancements into the future. In the near-term, the team also continues to help educators implement connected learning spaces and to enhance security. Other our combined UK and Canada results increased 24% on a reported basis. Both regions delivered excellent growth. UK was up significantly in local currency and delivered balance growth across both public and commercial with excellent remote enablement activity. Canada increased double digits in local currency, primarily driven by commercial customers with excellent solutions growth. The second driver of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio. Our ability to address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum resulted in excellent performance across our solutions and transactions portfolios. Solutions grew twice as fast as transactions. U.S. hardware increased low-double digits. Growth was broad-based and included double-digit increases in server and server management and video/audio. We also continue to see underlying strength in notebooks across our commercial business. Client devices, NetComm, enterprise storage and printing and scanning increased at a healthy single-digit rate. This exceptional performance was on top of 2021 second quarter double-digit hardware growth. Demand continued to outpace supply in several key areas, notably in networking and enterprise storage. Customers, once again, placed orders to get in line for second half 2022 projects, especially in NetComm. While overall backlog ticked down slightly from last quarter, we exited the quarter with backlog at nearly twice last year's second quarter level and once again, we leveraged our competitive advantages, including our distribution centers, our extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and our strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate an ongoing supply challenge. U.S. software increased nearly 40% compared to the prior year. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environments with strong double-digit increases in storage and network management software, application suites and security software. Cloud was an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to profitability with customer spend and gross profit increasing by double digits. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, productivity, security, application delivery and connectivity were key growth workloads during the period. U.S. services performance was excellent this quarter. Growth was broad-based and balanced, driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. Services net sales were roughly twice last year's level and represented 8% of total sales up from 5% in 2021 and 2020. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, our customer and coworker-centric strategy. Over the past three years, we have relentlessly focused on executing our strategy to enhance our high relevance and high growth solutions and services fueled by organic and inorganic investments. Eight acquisitions have deepened and advanced our services capabilities, including automation, cloud-native and DevOps and cybersecurity. Capabilities necessary to ensure, we remain the trusted advisor to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers, whether in a physical, digital or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally. Through our acquisitions, we welcomed nearly 3,000 new coworkers with more than half in technical roles. Since year-end 2018, our technical team has doubled in size. Today, more than 5,400 presales specialists and engineers work alongside our world-class sellers to deliver the complex digital transformation solutions from code to cloud and data center to database that our customers want and need. All of our investments, whether homegrown or acquired are designed to maximize our key points of differentiation in the marketplace and ensure we continue to help customers achieve the outcomes they need from technology, so they can do great things. Let me share a couple of recent examples that demonstrate how our investments are making a difference for customers. In the federal space, the power of bringing three winning teams from CDW, Sirius and Focal Point together is evident in the cybersecurity solutions we are delivering to the intelligence community. Together, the focus is on enhancing our scope across the Department of Defense and civilian agencies. To gain traction in this space, you must deliver proof-of-concept, which we do with our dedicated advanced solutions lab. You must provide training and support and you need agency to agency endorsement. While the CDW government team already had both expertise and scale, Sirius federal team brings a track record of success and solution configuration, technical integration and managed services. And our cyber experts at Focal Point Academy deliver the professional training these agencies need. Our relevance to federal customers has never been greater. The second example of how our investments enable customers to achieve great outcomes comes from our small business team. A provider of software-as-a-service solutions to pharmaceutical and life sciences companies needed to address their aging data center infrastructure. Their customers' workloads and data were being run on servers that were well beyond end of life. The servers clearly were not capable of supporting their existing business, let alone growing their SaaS offerings. The CTO initiated a competitive bidding process for a very small scale professional services contract to provide proof-of-concept on cloud migrations starting with a couple dozen servers. CDW and our competitors all utilize the same public cloud provider, but CDW1 based on our experience with migrations are proven post-migration support and our longstanding trusted relationship with the customer serving their transactional product needs. The CDW team bolstered by technical support from our IGNW, Digital Velocity Professional Services team built a secure landing zone in the public cloud and the proof-of-concept proved so successful. The customer is now migrating hundreds of servers. Seeing the huge burden, CDW lifted off the customer's engineering team who are having trouble balancing their day-to-day operations while trying to expand their cloud footprint. The customer contracted CDW for ongoing managed services of their rapidly growing cloud environment. The current annual services opportunity is at $750,000 run rate and is on a path to $1.5 million. By staying close to the customer, CDW, once again, had the opportunity to help make IT work, allowing the customer to improve the scalability and performance of their software offering. Investments in our customer and coworker-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our team's terrific execution and relentless focus on the customer, delivered significant outperformance to our baseline outlook in the first half of 2022. Given this excellent performance, we continue to expect to outperform the U.S. IT market by 325 basis points to 425 basis points, 125 basis points higher than both our long-term average level of outperformance and our original view at the end of year 2021. Our estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2022 remains 4%. Taken together, this equates to constant currency growth of 7.25% to 8.25% above 2021 combined CDW revenues of $22.8 billion. Recall, 2021 combined CDW is calculated as though Sirius was acquired on January 1, 2021 instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1. On a reported basis, our outlook represents a 17.5% to 18.5% increase over 2021 results on a constant currency basis. Our outlook continues to reflect our baseline expectations that we will mix into more sales of solutions in the back half of the year, notably cloud and security. Given this expected change in second half mix, we also expect to deliver profit growth faster than sales growth even as we continue to invest in our future. Our outlook also continues to reflect our expectations that supply constraints remain relatively consistent with the first half of the year. While we are cognizant of economic headlines, to-date, we have not seen a change in behavior that would impact our view on the second half of the year. Of course, we remain mindful of economic risks as well as other wild cards, including the potential for further disruption to supply and changes resulting from COVID incidence rates. We will keep a watchful eye as always on these and other potential issues. And as we always do, we will provide an updated view on customer activity and our annual outlook on the next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out execute competition. We will also continue to invest to ensure we are remaining our customers trusted technology partner of choice, helping them deliver the business outcomes they need. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more details on our financials and outlook. Al? Albert Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2022 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $6.1 billion, up 19.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 20.5%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 1.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were in line with our expectations, reflecting broad-based and balanced growth across our portfolio. On the supply side, consistent with last quarter, we saw pockets of improvement and pockets of pressure. The change in our overall backlog compared to the first quarter was insignificant. Year-over-year, our backlog remains elevated in both transactional and solution categories, and we continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers through this uncertain supply environment. The team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages to ensure strong returns on working capital. We had excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 32.3%. Gross profit margin was a record 19%, up 180 basis points versus last year. The expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, increased netted down revenues, primarily within Software-as-a-Service as the category continued to grow faster than overall net sales. Netted down revenues represented 28% of total gross profit; second, product margins were strong, driven by both mix and resilient demand for certain hardware products; and third, net sales and high-margin professional service business nearly doubled as a result of our recent acquisition. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $652 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consistent with higher gross profit and higher coworker count. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was nearly 14,600, up roughly 3,900 from the prior year quarter, reflecting organic and inorganic investments in coworkers that support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. Investment in our coworkers and in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are seeing our disciplined and balanced investments pay dividends as evidenced by record sales and profitability in the period. GAAP operating income was $435 million, up 17.7%. Non-GAAP operating income was $516 million, up 23.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 8.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and 60 basis points from Q1. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $58 million. Higher interest expense is primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius as well as higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $98 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 50 basis points versus last year as a result of an increase in nondeductible expenses. As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per share was $2.04. Our non-GAAP net income was $340 million in the quarter, up 19%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.49, up 23% from last year. Year-to-date results can be found on Slides 14 through 19. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $542 million and net debt was $6 billion. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Moving to Slide 20. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down two days from last year's second quarter and reflecting a tighter spread between DSO and DPO. Year-to-date free cash flow was $717 million, as shown on Slide 21. This is higher than a typical first half, reflecting strong growth in the business and effective working capital management. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives, including returning $68 million to shareholders through dividends and further reducing our net leverage ratio, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 22. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the quarter at 2.9x, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash generation. And while we are at the top of our targeted net leverage range, we are balancing rating agency capital expectations, which would call for us to be towards the bottom of our range. As such, we will continue to prioritize delevering until we are more firmly in our targeted net leverage range and can satisfy the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022. And while we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priority of M&A and share repurchases, we are firmly on a path to getting back to delivering on these priorities. Moving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 23, starting with sales. Our outlook remains unchanged from last quarter on a constant currency basis, including holding our second half outlook at our initial aggressive baseline. While we are cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we are confident in our ability to execute, pivot to where the growth opportunities are and outperform the broader market. We continue to expect the back half of the year will reflect a greater mix in a netted down revenues as we overlap 2021's strong client device sales. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted down revenues has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars, but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margin, all else equal. With that in mind, our outlook for full-year 2022 continues to be U.S. IT market growth of 4% plus 325 basis points to 425 basis points of CDW outperformance in constant currency on a combined basis. Recall that, on a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius. On a reported basis, our full-year net sales outlook equates to approximately 17.5% to 18.5% growth in constant currency. Currency is expected to be a headwind of approximately $120 million to net sales in the second half of the year. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.22 to the British pound and $0.78 for the Canadian dollar in the second half. Our baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we have been experiencing. We would expect to be at the lower end of our premium range if we mix more into netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experience elevated levels of supply constraints. We would be at the higher end if hardware growth is stronger or if supply improves. Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. For non-GAAP earnings per share, recall that 2021 would have been $8.49 on a full-year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97, which included only one month of Sirius. We now expect full-year non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid-teens, call it 14% to 15% in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to a low 20% full-year growth rate in constant currency on a reported basis. Currency is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.04 to earnings per share in the second half of the year based on the reference exchange rates. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. We expect a low single-digit increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis. This equates to a roughly 17% year-over-year reported net sales growth rate for the third quarter. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than reported net sales. Finally, we now expect to be towards the top-end of our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales in 2022, assuming current tax rates. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik, please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Chris, you mentioned you haven't really seen any impact of the macro on your business yet and you continue to monitor it closely. Maybe if I can ask it another way, when you sort of interact with your customers, and we know a lot of the enterprises are starting to slow down their own hiring plans. Are you seeing a greater sort of intent in relying on CDW and your service capabilities as we head into sort of the next year just on account of them slowing down their plans in terms of hiring engineering resources, et cetera? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Good morning, Samik. Thanks for the question. And I would say just the short answer is yes. We are seeing our customers rely more heavily on us in the labor shortage world we're in. We've said often that technology has become just absolutely essential, more integral to our customers' success and more vital to their businesses, whether it is delivering experience, whether it is profitability, whether it's teaching kids, whether it's providing health care. It is just essential to what organizations do, and CDW is their trusted adviser. And we are continuing to see our customers lean into us more for some of the things that we referenced in our prepared remarks, for example, advisory services on the front-end professional services as they're going through their disciplined planning, et cetera. But equally, relieving their staffs of important management, like data center security and things like that. So it's been a very positive move for us and is driving some of our growth. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. And for my follow-up, if I can just ask you on the supply chain. I know your guidance or outperformance is based on certain sort of improvements in supply chain that could potentially happen. But as we talk to a lot of the OEMs, clearly, we're seeing signs of them expecting more availability of components. Where are things in relation to lead times that are communicated to you? Or sort of what are you seeing in terms of lead times? And are you expecting things to get better? Or are you sort of not really seeing much change yet in communication from the OEMs themselves? Christine Leahy : Yes, I'll start with that. Al can add, if you'd like. I would tell you that \u2013 look, we don't expect supply constraints to meaningfully change beyond what we've experienced in the first half of the year as we look to the back half of the year. I mean it's still, I'd call it, what's the best word, choppy. We're seeing pockets of pressure and pockets of improvement. As I mentioned in my remarks, I'd tell you, we kind of a tick down, which is barely negligible. So not expecting any necessarily meaningful change in the back half of the year. But for us, that means we just continue to navigate and press our competitive advantages and navigate as we have been through these past several years. And that's what I say about the supply chain. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim, please go ahead. James Suva : Thank you. Chris, now with the rising interest rate environment, can you talk about have customers changed their behavior at all, asked for some better funding, or talked to you about that at all? And how should we think about that interest rate environment also on the financials of CDW? So that's kind of both my questions on the same topic on your customers and then on your own self company. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes, Jim, good to hear from you. Let me start with the customers. And what I would say, and this is more of a general answer to the current environment and uncertainties out there. Interest rates going up, labor shortages, inflation, everything that we hear about in the headlines. What I would say is customers are being disciplined around their investments, and that is good for CDW in so far as they look to a trusted adviser with the depth of experience we have to be able to work with them towards the best solutions. So the environment, frankly, is playing into our competitive advantages. And we're not seeing that type of macro environment impact. Our sales opportunities, our profit opportunities, on the contrary, is actually being something that pulls us in more closely with our customers. So I'll just answer that part of it, and I'll turn it to Al for interest expense vis-a-vis CDW? Albert Miralles : Yes, sure, Jim. So first on your question, on any change in attitude or direction with customers with respect to financing, et cetera. I would say no, nothing material there. As we typically would, with every customer, we're looking at the avenues of whether they would like financing solutions or otherwise. But nothing's changed materially there. With respect to the impact to us from a financing perspective and interest expense, based on my prepared remarks, we do have a component of our debt that's floating rate. We did see in the quarter a bit of a tick up in the interest expense commensurate with that. And we've got that baked into our outlook. We do have interest rate caps in place, we just haven't quite hit those yet. We do feel like that's kept out, and it's certainly manageable. James Suva : Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. It's greatly appreciated. Christine Leahy : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Erik, please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Thank you so much. And thanks for taking my questions this morning, guys. Maybe, Chris, if I start with you, if we take a step back, you've obviously \u2013 CDW has obviously consistently outperformed IT market growth from anywhere between 200 to 500 basis points in any given year. How do you think about kind of \u2013 in the potential that this market gets more challenging, how do you think about the potential to increase those share gains? And kind of what I'm getting at is maybe the implication would be slower IT market growth in that type of scenario, but given your scale, you reach the broad breadth of products that you have, do you see a more recessionary type of environment as an opportunity for CDW to gain share perhaps in excess of your average annual outperformance versus the IT market? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Christine Leahy : Yes, sure, Erik. Again, the answer is yes, some of these short answers. The answer is yes. We certainly perceive and \u2013 look, we have historically been well positioned and outperformed the market and our peers in challenging macro environments. And we would expect that to be similar going forward. In fact, I would say that we are better positioned now than ever to be opportunistic in down markets given the full spectrum of our technology solutions. For our customers now needing a trusted adviser that can \u2013 that brings the comprehensive suite of solutions in the complete end-to-end services is required has become more integral and more essential to how they do business. And so the answer is yes, we would intend to press our competitive advantages and we see great opportunity. And that's been part of what we've been really focused on building over the past couple of years through executing our strategy and ensuring that our portfolio is fulsome and has the services that are relevant to delivering on the solutions our customers need. Erik Woodring : Okay. Super. And then maybe, Al, one for you. Obviously, 19% gross margin. I think that's an all-time high, obviously, very strong. You kind of went through the three different drivers earlier in your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering if there's any way you can kind of quantify or help us better understand the significant of those three factors relative to each other, meaning how significant was the mix of netted down revenue to gross margins perhaps versus the inclusion of Sirius versus perhaps mix on the non-netted down revenue side? Would just love to get a better understanding there, and that's it for me. Albert Miralles : Sure, Erik. So first, I didn't mention Sirius, right, because we would think of Sirius more kind of macro level. But I would just note that the contribution from Sirius and really the power of putting the teams together, we are seeing exactly what we would have expected in terms of accretive effect on gross margin. On the netted down revenues, I mentioned grew 30% year-over-year, 28% of gross profit. That was a solid contribution there, absolute dollar amount consistent with Q1. But what was the different for this quarter is we had even stronger contributions from professional services, right, which is coming online and accelerating. And then firm margins on product. And so multiple variables there. In terms \u2013 as we look forward and we think about durability, look, there's always going to be puts and takes, and that's why our outlook focuses on in July margin because it's just a little bit more balanced, a little bit more stable. But certainly, this quarter, you saw all those contributions on the gross margin front come to four. Erik Woodring : Great. Thank you, Al. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Matthew, please go ahead. Matthew Sheerin : Yes. Thank You. Good morning. I wanted to ask another question regarding the PC market and your outlook there. You talked about double-digit growth on the commercial side and very strong backlog still. But you also talked about solutions growing faster in the back half as it did last quarter. So could you give us an outlook there in terms of backlog and supply improving there? And is that enabling you to fill that backlog? And do you see that falling off in the second half? Christine Leahy : Hi. Matt, let me start on this, and then we can dive into the backlog a little more specifically. The way I would characterize it is we do continue to expect resilient commercial demand. As we've said a number of times, end client devices, endpoint devices are low-cost productivity enhancing investment. And given the changing dynamics of delivering goods, digital curbside, et cetera, they've just become part and parcel of the solutions for every commercial business. In terms of the total client device sales and backlog, we had healthy \u2013 I think it was low single-digit client device growth this year, which compared to anything out there, I think, has been really solid. In terms of the backlog, we have had some backlog open up a little bit over the last six months or so, I think. But Al, did you want to add more about the backlog specifically? Albert Miralles : Yes. Matt, I would say, as we mentioned, no significant changes thematically in the backlog in terms of the pressure points versus relief. To Chris' point on client device, it's just more fluid, right. So we see a bit more flow. And we've mentioned this before, but if nothing else, we have a bit more read into transparency of what to expect on lead times. But look, the friction is still there on the solutions space, and we wouldn't expect that, that's going to change. Our job is to continue to navigate it and be there for the customers to get some stuff as quick as we can and most effectively. Matthew Sheerin : Okay. Thanks very much for that. And then just turning to your outlook on the solutions side and specifically, investments from customers in infrastructure. We're picking up from our VAR survey that customers are taking longer to close larger deals, being a little bit more scrutinous on deals requiring more sign-offs. Are you seeing that at all in terms of hesitation or a little bit more scrutiny from customers on deals? Christine Leahy : Yes, I guess here's how I characterize it. With the context of the last couple of years, where I'd say your normal purchasing process kind of was put aside a little bit, I would just say that we're kind of back to a normalized disciplined buying process. And I wouldn't characterize it beyond that. And as I said earlier, that's actually good for CDW because we're a trusted adviser and can help our customers make the best, most cost-effective, most effective decisions in the process. Matthew Sheerin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu, please go ahead. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, in the past, you've talked about the SMB or small medium business segment as a bellwether for the macro environment, as they react fast to the macro changes. This quarter looks like revenue growth slowed to 4% year-on-year albeit on tough compares. And you've kept the full year guidance changed and you had a strong fiscal 2Q. So first, can you give us your thoughts on what the SMB segment is indicating to you? And then second, on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, you talked several times about continuing to invest in the business. It looks like CapEx as a percent of sales declined slightly to 0.6%. So just give us your thoughts on what areas of investment you would like to make in this environment? And how would you just judge the success of those investments? Christine Leahy : Good morning, Ruplu. Let me start with small business. And look, we're pleased with small business results. We're just \u2013 we're not seeing weakness to date. And I just would say investors and analysts should not extrapolate from the decelerating growth rates. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, small business customer spend was up, but it was in the categories of areas that net down. So a more appropriate barometer of the health of demand in small business, we think, is gross profit performance, which increased at more than twice the rate of sales growth. So I would just keep focused on that. Cloud and Software Solutions were really, really well \u2013 delivered really, really well this quarter. We also, just to be clear, continue to see strong momentum in the strategic execution and small business across a wide variety of solutions that customers are investing in. So whether it's solutions to modernize and optimize their infrastructure, whether it's continued remote enablement, which we're still seeing resilience in. But we're not looking at small businesses softening at this point. It's really been resilient and momentum is strong. In terms of investments, what I would tell you is we're a people business. So when you think about investments that are maybe noncapital-intensive related, that's all about people. If you look at the acquisitions and the number of folks in our technology organization that we've brought to CDW, the number that we've hired over the year, they're organically brought in. But then think about things like our CRM program and modernizing our CRM program using Salesforce. If you think about our unique training programs that are very specific to CDW, our training programs are best in the business. When you think about leadership development. When you think about all of the things that we're doing that drive efficiency and effectively and productivity for our sales organization, and the ability for our technical organization and sales organization to go to market as a one CDW company, as one team, all those investments are the kinds of things that we're doing to continue to execute our strategy. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay, thanks for the clarification and the details there. For my follow-up, if I can just ask, it was great to see the federal business grew year-on-year. Do you think that strength continues? And within Government, how should we think about the relative growth from federal versus state and local in the second half of this year? Thanks, again. Christine Leahy : Yes, I'll start with that one. Yes, so we've said that we would expect Fed to continue growth, start growth in the second half of the year and continuing \u2013 it will \u2013 I would expect it to look more seasonal. I think we're kind of back into more of a seasonal rhythm with federal. And state and local has been interesting because, as you know, the budget \u2013 the funding that they've received has allowed them to make investment decisions over a more extended period of time versus the one year that they typically do. And we've been supporting customers with that. All that said, given things like data proliferation, et cetera, they're still investing now. So you can expect to see solid growth across both of those sales channels in the second half of the year. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Thanks for all the details and congrats on the strong execution. Christine Leahy : Thank you really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith, please go ahead. Keith Housum : Good morning. Chris, maybe perhaps talk about CDW's own hiring plans for the rest of the year and how you're seeing that growth? Christine Leahy : Hi, Keith. Our hiring plans for the rest of the year? Keith Housum : Yes. I'm just trying to understand \u2013 yes, please. Christine Leahy : Yes, we're still investing in people. Obviously, we've got our eyes on the headlines. We're being prudent in how we run our business, but we're continuing to invest in those areas that support the important capabilities that our customer needs from us. And we're investing in areas to drive efficiency. So we have not slowed down our investment in people at this point, and we feel very confident with that. Keith Housum : Great. I appreciate it. And then maybe talk to investors in terms of the concerns about the chip manufacturers and concerns that PCs will be slowing down. How would you address that question? And is this soon the chips, is that perhaps a canary of the coal mine for the entire tech industry? Christine Leahy : I had a hard time hearing the beginning. Can you just repeat the question, please? Keith Housum : Yes, absolutely. So the question from investors that we're getting oftentimes is looking at the sales of PCs and with the chip manufacturers now believing that the chips will be down to personal computers by, say, 10% to 15% for the rest of the year, there's concerns that, that might be a canary in the coal mine for technology spending. How will you respond to that question? Christine Leahy : Yes. What I would say is I think technology spending is going to be even more resilient in the face of all kinds of challenges going forward because it's so essential to businesses, whether it is challenges around chips, challenges around the macro environment, et cetera, businesses can't win in the marketplace without utilizing technology to drive efficiency, effectiveness, experience, all the things we talk about. So we aren't concerned about some of that talk track. We feel very confident that our customers and we see the momentum. Our customers are continuing to invest in technology across the spectrum from endpoint solutions to hybrid infrastructure. And we feel very confident that we'll be able to press our competitive advantages and have access to the technology needed for our customers given our size and scale. Keith Housum : Great. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Lauren Lucas from Evercore. Lauren, please go ahead. Lauren Lucas : Hi. This is Lauren on for Amit. Thanks for taking the question. Could you guys provide some more color on the change in expectations to netted down revenues for the second half? So I know you guys talked about SMB shifting spend this way. But I mean, how should we be thinking about this kind of in terms of where gross margins could reach? Thank you. Albert Miralles : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. This is Al. I think look, previous to today, we talked about we expected a higher level of netted down revenues in the second half, and that still holds true. If we look at Q2 and the contributors to our gross margin, otherwise, I talked about professional services, obviously, at a macro level the accretive effect of Sirius and product margins were firm. But the theme kind of as we look at the second half as well as really ongoing with netted down revenues, which makes up just for clarity, SaaS software assurance, warranty and commissions, those themes continue. And we continue to expect that they will outpace our net sales overall. Lauren Lucas : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That is the end of the Q&A session today. So I will now hand you back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks. Christine Leahy : Thank you very much, Lauren. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our over 14,600 coworkers around the globe. Their dedication to serving our customers is what makes us successful and in particular, embracing a better together approach and philosophy as we've brought together many amazing companies over these last few years. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results and then provide an update on our strategic progress and a summary of our outlook. Al will provide additional details on the financials and outlook as well as our capital-allocation priorities. And then we'll move right to your questions.  We had an outstanding third quarter. Once again, we delivered all-time record sales, profits and margins. Net sales were $6.2 billion, 17% higher than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $449 million, up 26%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.60, up 22% year-over-year. This exceptional performance is a result of our relentless execution and disciplined investment in our customer-centric strategy, a strategy that underpins our ability to address customer priorities across a broad array of end markets with solutions across the full stack and full life cycle of IT.  The vital need for interconnected and integrated solutions has created levels of complexity never seen before. We cut through the complexity and help customers maximize the impact of technology, technology that delivers mission-critical outcomes. In today's environment of persistent uncertainty, our customers are increasingly leaning on CDW as a trusted partner, and they look to us to provide unbiased expert advice across the entire spectrum of IT. A trusted partner who helps them tackle their most pressing priorities, pressing priorities like advancing their digital transformation, driving innovation and delivering exceptional stakeholder experiences, along with enhancing security and supporting collaboration in today's distributed environment of work, learn and live everywhere. Priorities that deliver operating efficiency and expense elasticity like burstable billing and modern hybrid and multi-cloud environments and infrastructure and new technology investments to optimize flexibility and agility. Our ability to enable solutions in support of all these diverse priorities drove broad-based and balanced performance.  There were 3 main drivers of our results : our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio and the relentless execution of our 3-part strategy. First, the breadth and diversity of our customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels : corporate; small business; health care; government; and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $2 billion to over $10 billion over the last 12 months. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of USD 2.9 billion. Our portfolio approach enables us to toggle to the best pockets of opportunity and to be there for our customers along every step of their IT journeys. Our collective team did an exceptional job this quarter. Our corporate team delivered another stellar quarter with a 25% net sales increase. Results were balanced and broad-based. Customers continued to focus on digital transformation through infrastructure modernization and process automation. The team's ability to deliver these outcomes translated to excellent solutions growth led by NetComm, Enterprise Storage and Cloud.  Both professional and managed services posted double-digit increases as the team helped customers achieve their IT priorities by augmenting their technology capabilities with dedicated technologists. The hybrid work environment continues to thrive with continued customer focus on collaboration across workspaces and continued need to modernize their employee experience. Small business delivered growth for the seventh straight quarter, a 5% increase on top of last year's 39% growth. The team continued to help small business customers navigate the impact of technology across all aspects of their business into today's cautious environment and accomplish critical projects that enhance and sustain mission and business outcomes. This drove double-digit performance across software, security and cloud. Our full stack, full life cycle support for customers, which enables us to nimbly shift towards solutions that maximize prior investments led to double-digit performance in services.  Public posted a strong 13% increase this quarter. The health care team delivered another excellent quarter of robust growth, up 28%. Once again, results were driven by the team's ability to help health care organizations harness technology to drive productivity in an environment of rising costs. Our health care customers are increasingly relying on CDW for talent orchestration and to guide their implementations of cloud resources. Health care organizations face complex business dynamics, but they are committed to mission-critical projects and data center and collaboration modernization continues to move forward.  Government posted 38% growth. Within government, state and local posted a substantial double-digit increase. Our collaboration with customers to identify and capture various funding opportunities is bearing fruit with data center and software projects beginning to advance under multiyear phrasing. The team delivered excellent security results as they help state and local municipalities enhance their defenses against emerging and evolving cyber threats. Remote collaboration continues as a top priority, driving excellent performance across transactional product categories.  As expected, federal activity resumed in earnest. Seasonal spending patterns normalized with the September fiscal year-end spending uptick. The team helps customers address their top priorities, including upgrades to collaboration and data management infrastructure. This drove strong growth in nearly all categories compared to last year.  For education, higher ed growth was more than offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall sales decreased 7.5%. The higher-ed team continued to deliver student success programs to institutions. These programs promote enrollment through comprehensive endpoint solutions and improved campus connectivity and safety and drive client devices sales and NetComm growth.  Security remains very -- security demands were high, driven by solutions that addressed ransomware and hacking threats through CDW-delivered security enhancements. K-12 performance remains strong on an absolute basis, but was obscured by the team's exceptional client device driven success in 2021. Today, the team is helping school systems determine how to sustain prior IT investments and maintain the learning opportunities provided by digital equity initiatives. At the same time, the team continues to help customers implement industry-leading innovative connective learning spaces as well as enhanced campus safety. And this drove strong security and audio-visual performance during the quarter.  Other, our combined U.K. and Canada results increased 18% on a reported basis. Both regions delivered excellent local market growth. The U.K.'s performance was broad-based and balanced as our team showed resolved and resiliency in a complex environment. Canada's performance was also broad-based and balanced with customer priorities similar to the U.S. amid a continued shift into solutions and services.  All in, the teams delivered another excellent quarter of end-market performance. Our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and a driver of our differentiated performance.  The second driver of our portfolio -- of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio. As technology has become a more vital part of their strategies, customers require comprehensive, integrated and interconnected solutions and services. Our ability to address these priorities across the entire IT continuum delivered double-digit growth across our solutions portfolio.  U.S. hardware increased 13%. This steady performance was on top of 2021 [Technical Difficulty] quarter double-digit hardware growth. Network modernization and upgrades drove double-digit increases in Enterprise Storage and NetComm. Video and audio and servers increased healthy single-digit rates.  Commercial PC performance was strong on a relative basis and even more so when we exclude the year-over-year impact of growth from the K-12 market. Relative to the supply environment, conditions improved across several transactional areas. Despite these improvements during the quarter, our overall backlog remains elevated. We expect the backlog to continue to feather out over the coming quarters. U.S. software increased double digits. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment with strong double-digit increases in storage management, application suites and database management. Cloud was an important driver of performance across the business. Complexity surrounding cloud has not changed and navigating between multiple options remains a major area of customer focus. Once again, cloud was a meaningful contributor to profitability with both customer spend and gross profit up by double digits.  Infrastructure as a Service, productivity, security, application delivery and connectivity were key cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase. Our teams continue to guide customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation to improve their security frameworks and respond to increasing threats. This drove strong double-digit growth in customer spend.  U.S. services performance continued to advance this quarter. Customers are leaning into CDW as extensions of their own teams and leveraging CDW services as part of their strategies. This produced broad-based and balanced growth driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. Services net sales were roughly twice last year's levels and represented 8% of total sales, up from 5% in 2021. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and are a key enabler of our value proposition.  To support this, we have been making organic and inorganic investments in services over the past several years and those investments quickly gained traction in the market.  And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our 3-part growth strategy. Our targeted investments are guided by our 3-part strategy, which is : one, to capture share and acquire new customers; two, to enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions areas; and three, to expand services capabilities. This strategy delivers on our commitments to our customers and drives both our top line and bottom-line performance. Over the past 3 years, we have enhanced our relevance to customers by broadening and deepening our capabilities, including in automation, cloud-native and DevOps and cybersecurity. Capabilities necessary to ensure we remain the trusted adviser to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformations. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers across physical, digital and cloud-based environments in the U.S. and internationally. A great example of how our services investments deepen relationships and strengthen the value we deliver to customers is a solution we are delivering to a medium-sized hospital system. With 3 primary hospitals and approximately 70 regional clinics and urgent care facilities, the system was challenged to find, retain and train a sustainable level of technical staff. Having previously worked with them, providing both hardware solutions and professional services to re-architect their disaster-recovery solution, we had a deep understanding of our customers' environment.  We coupled with the breadth and depth of our services offering, this enabled us to construct a new design, build, run end-to-end services solution that leverages CDW managed services and talent orchestration capabilities. A solution made possible by the services investments we have made and the technical mastery we've accelerated over recent years, mastery over the broad spectrum of technologies the customer needed for support, including Windows and Linux servers, virtualization, storage, backup and recovery, databases, switching, routing, network access and cloud-based productivity and identity-management tools, our full portfolio of services enabled us to become an extension of the customer's team. We recently went live under a 5-year contract with monthly recurring revenue in the hundreds of thousands and a total contract value over $10 million. A great example of how our investment and services deliver value to our customers and cause them to lean further into CDW.  Investments in our customer-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our team's terrific execution and relentless focus on our customers delivered significant out-performance to our baseline 2022 outlook. When combined with our current expectations for fourth quarter performance, we now expect to outperform the U.S. IT market at the high end of the 325 to 425 basis points range. Our estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2022 remains 4%. Taken together, this equates to year-over-year constant-currency growth at the high end of the 7.25% to 8.25% range. The high end of the range is applied to the combined CDW 2021 revenues of $22.8 billion, calculated as though Sirius was acquired on January 1, 2021, instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1. On a reported basis, this equates to a constant-currency increase of 18.5% over 2020 results.  Our outlook continues to reflect our baseline expectations that our mix will remain weighted more heavily to netted-down items. We expect this to drive profit growth faster than sales growth, while we continue to thoughtfully invest in our future. We are cognizant of the current environment, but to date, customer urgency to innovate for the future and the internal and external stakeholder demand has not diminished. Of course, we remain mindful of wildcards, including economic, geopolitical and the variable nature of the supply chain, and we will keep a watchful eye on these and other potential factors. As we always do, we will provide an updated view on business conditions and our annual outlook on our next call.  In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Our flexible business model and proven formula for success will continue to serve us well. The accelerated pace of change makes our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers, more important now than ever.  Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Albert Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2022 outlook.  Turning to our third quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $6.2 billion, up 17.3% on a reported and an average daily-sales basis. On a constant-currency average daily-sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 18.7%. Sequentially, sales increased 1.1% versus the second quarter. Third quarter sales were in line with our expectations, reflecting broad-based and balanced growth across our portfolio.  On the supply side, some conditions improved during the quarter, resulting in an overall reduction in our backlog. While supply and lead times of client devices have indeed improved, pockets of pressure remain, especially in solution categories and our backlog remains very elevated. As we've previously shared, we would expect our backlog to feather out over time as supply conditions can begin to ease and this will not likely be symmetrical across product offerings. We continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers who is still uncertain about supply environment, and the team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages to ensure strong returns on working capital.  We once again had an excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 34.8%. Gross profit margin was a record 19.8%, up 250 basis points versus last year. The expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, as we expected for the second half of the year, a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. The category grew nearly twice as fast as overall net sales, primarily driven by Software as a Service.  Second, product margins were strong, driven by both mix and demand for certain hardware products; and third, net sales contribution from high-margin services, which increased 70% year-over-year as a result of our recent acquisitions. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $684 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consisting with higher gross profit attainment and higher coworker count. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was nearly 15,000, up approximately 400 from the prior quarter, reflecting investments in coworkers that support high-growth solutions and services as well as our own digital transformation. Investments in our coworkers and in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are focused on disciplined and balanced investments that will pay dividends. This is evidenced by our record sales and profitability in the period.  GAAP operating income was $466 million, up 20.7% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $549 million, up 26.2%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 8.8%, up 60 basis points from the prior year and 40 basis points compared to the second quarter. Overall, while we're very pleased with this outcome, it was above our expectations and driven by a confluence of factors within gross margin, including a favorable mix and rate of product margins, which we'd expect to moderate in Q4.  Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $63 million. Higher interest expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius as well as the effect of higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. This level of interest expense was in line with our expectation for the quarter. We have not changed our expectation of approximately $240 million for the full year.  Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 25.4%. This resulted in a third quarter tax expense of $101 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 60 basis points versus last year's rate as a result of an increase in nondeductible expenses and state taxes. As you can see on Slide 13, the third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.17. Our non-GAAP net income was $357 million in the quarter, up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.60, up 22%.  Year-to-date results can be found on Slides 14 through 19. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $358 million and net debt was $5.8 billion. During the quarter, we reduced borrowings under a senior unsecured term loan by $400 million, consistent with our plan to reduce leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.5 billion.  Moving to Slide 21. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down 7 days from last year's third quarter and at the low end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting the impact of Sirius and our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management, along with strong growth in the business also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, as shown on Slide 22.  For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital-allocation objectives, including returning $68 million to shareholders through dividends in addition to the $400 million in debt repayment, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 23.  Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income, including today's 18% increase to the dividend from $2 to $2.36 per share. The increased annual dividend represents approximately 25% of a trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income through September. The Q4 2022 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation in the business and marks the ninth consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013. Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 34% from its initial level. Going forward, we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings.  Second, we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the third quarter at 2.7x, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash generation. While we're at the middle of our targeted net leverage range, we are balancing rating agency capital expectations, which would call for us to be towards the bottom of our range. As such, we will continue to prioritize delevering until we are more firmly in our targeted net leverage range and can satisfy the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022.  And finally, while we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital-allocation objectives of M&A and share repurchases, we are firmly on the path to getting back to these priorities.  Moving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 24. While we're cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to execute, pivot to growth opportunities and outperform the broader market. We continue to expect the fourth quarter will reflect a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted-down revenues as a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins, all else equal.  With this in mind, we continue to expect U.S. market growth of 4% and now expect to be at the upper end of our 325 to 425 basis point range of CDW market out-performance in constant currency, on a combined basis. Recall, we previously shared, we would expect to be at the higher end of our premium range if supply improves. Conversely, if we experience elevated levels of supply constraints, or mix more into netted-down revenue streams, we would expect to be at the mid- to lower end of our premium range. On a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius.  On a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 18.5% growth in constant currency. The change in currency exchange rates from our initial original outlook is now expected to be a headwind of $110 million to net sales in the fourth quarter and $260 million for the full year. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.13 to the British pound and $0.73 for the Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter.  Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. This implies the fourth quarter will be the fourth consecutive quarter of 20% or higher operating profit growth. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to approximately 23.5% full year growth in constant currency on a reported basis.  I would remind you that 2021 would have been $8.49 per share on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97 per share, which included only 1 month of Sirius. The change in currency exchange rates from our original outlook is now expected to be a headwind of -- to EPS of $0.04 in the fourth quarter and $0.08 for the full year. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant-currency basis.  Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter, related to average daily sales, we expect a 0 to low single-digit sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. This equates to 9.75% to 10.75% year-over-year reported net sales growth rate for the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued strong gross profit margin and NGOI margin in the fourth quarter at or above year-to-date average levels for both, reflecting some moderation from what we experienced in Q3. And we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the range of 18.25% and 19.25% year-over-year on a reported basis.  Finally, we now expect full year free cash flow to be approximately 5% of net sales, exceeding the top end of our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter and across years. If you recall, 2021 free cash flow was 2.3% of net sales. In aggregate, we expect our 2021 and 2022 free cash flow to balance out and be within our free cash flow rule of thumb over the 2 years.  That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to 1 with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Shannon Cross at Credit Suisse. Shannon Cross : I guess I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the EBIT, and it was very strong this quarter, obviously, and gross margin was strong. And I'm wondering how we should think about the progression as netted-down revenue becomes a larger percentage of the total -- I realize, obviously, some of it was probably from lower-client contribution. But it seems that the model towards maybe a bit higher than EBIT guidance over time might be in place? Albert Miralles : Yes. Shannon, this is Al. So happy to address that. So as I mentioned, the NGOI margin and dollar result was largely driven by strong gross margin. So if we just take the components of gross margin for the quarter, a few things, Shannon, that I would note first, obviously, the benefit and accretive effect from Sirius which we've seen all year.  Number two, the effect of netted-down revenues, right, largely driven by focus on security, cloud, Software as a Service. We would view that component as pretty structural.  Next, I would say, contributions from services. Again, we've made a lot of investments in that space. So we view that as largely structural. And then the last component of our gross margin, Shannon, would be on the product side. And we've talked about through the year that we've had really favorable, both mix and rate on the product side. And that would be the 1 variable that we would see potentially could moderate. And so obviously, in this supply environment, we've seen our customers favor a bit more speed over price. And that's led to a favorable mix and also strong rates. And so obviously, as we start to see supply ease a bit here, you could see that moderate, and that's what we're tending towards for Q4. Shannon Cross : Okay. And then if you can just talk a bit more about client. I know you provided some comments during the remarks. But if you could talk maybe what you're hearing from your customers in terms of what they're thinking about PC purchases as we look forward, is there any indication that some of the Chromebooks that perhaps were placed in 2020 will need to be refreshed? Or are there any education dollars that are available for that? Just any more color you can give would be great. Christine Leahy : Shannon, it's Chris. I'll give you some color maybe on the overall PC trends we're seeing. And as expected, overall, the PC environment has moderated a bit versus the robust client device growth in 2021. But that said, our end markets are not synchronized. So looking at the client-device growth across channels, for example, we helped customers with pent-up demand in our government segment in both federal and state and local.  Obviously, K-12 was down as expected, but our other segments, Commercial Healthcare, higher-ed channels, what they saw was upgrade experience, not right now a broad refresh but upgrading of experience, meaning higher-value PCs along with the collaboration tools and automation that helps with that experience.  What I would say is, I can't tell you exactly which channels are going to start picking up their client devices soon, but we are continuing to see the criticality of client devices [Technical Difficulty]. And so at the end of the day, we'll continue to profitably outperform the PC market for several reasons. Number one, as we've said before, there's a very compelling commercial PC opportunity. When you think about the value PCs deliver -- so employee productivity, for example, and use cases and also PC product cycle. We're already seeing some customers who are moving to Windows 11, a number of customers moving to Windows 11, particularly for things like security updates.  And then the natural refresh. We've talked a lot about the aging of devices from 2018, '19, '20, and we'll see those refreshes start to kick in. The other thing is think about the services that CDW wraps around PCs, which are very attractive to our customers. There are massive market opportunity available to us, addressable market opportunities when we think about cross-selling to our Sirius customers and also international.  And then the thing I finally say is that CDW has got the absolute best PC muscle in infrastructure, which has allowed us to outperform the market significantly in the past. And remember, when our partners are looking to move the needle in any arena, they look to CDW to help them do that. So very confident PCs are critical to the future, moderated a bit, but still fundamentally part of the solution customers are looking for. What I would say is right now, in terms of prioritizing, our customers are largely leaning into their infrastructure, the things that they had not invested in over the last couple of years, so infrastructure, cloud, security, things like that and priority and PCs are a little lower on the priority list. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani : I guess the first one, you obviously have a very sizable upside to gross profit dollars despite the revenue that we think in line with consensus. Maybe to talk about how much of that is a structural shift towards more netted-down revenues versus perhaps mix of a bit more favorable. And really the talk about the netted-down revenue map, I'm curious, at some point, does it start making sense, Chris, to talk about your ability to grow gross profit dollars at premium to IT spend versus talking about revenues going at premium to IT spends? Albert Miralles : Yes. Amit, this is Al. So similar to my response to Shannon there, really, if you tick down the list, again, the kind of the priority order of what contributed in gross margin, Sirius for sure, netted-down revenue, contributions from services and then on the product side. And I would say that both the netted down and the contributions from services would be deemed a bit more structural. Certainly, from a product margin perspective, there's a structural component, but you're going to vary depending on mix in any given period. And so that's what we've been seeing. To your question on guiding on gross profit, that's certainly something, Amit, that we talk about. Just remember beauty of our deep and broad portfolio means at any given time, you're going to have puts and takes in terms of where things show up and what our customers need. And so what we discussed really there is there are going to be periods where there's stronger hardware contribution and refreshes and those types of things. And that's where certainly focusing on the net sales is important as well. But as time goes by, and particularly as we see some of the supply conditions change, certainly, we'll talk more about kind of the contribution of gross profit and how we think about that from an outlook perspective. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I just follow up, there's really notable deviation, I think, in the growth we're seeing out of the SMB bucket versus corporate. I know you talked about kind of what's driving this trend with net count that commentary and so on. But maybe just tell on why are we seeing such a big divergence? And then is 1 a more leading indicator or not? Or is that not the way to think about it? Just any help on the deviation would be helpful. Christine Leahy : Amit, it's Chris. On small business, it's been interesting. I would just start with the execution from the team. It's a cautious environment for sure, but the team is really helping customers navigate what's become ubiquitous impacts of technology across literally every aspect of their business. And in the small-business arena, like all of our customers right now, there's a focus on mission-critical priorities. And that tends to be software, cloud and security led. And so CDW, with the capabilities we've built within that segment, you'll recall we separated it out about 4, 5 years ago, we bring the full stack, full life cycle support for customers. And we've been able to, over the past several quarters, really nimbly shift towards the solutions that maximize their prior investments and add services to the mix there.  So look, we continue to see momentum behind the strategic execution in small business, and we're really confident in our ability to leverage our broad-solution portfolio and pivot where the customers need us. And that right now is infrastructure solution and modernizing and optimizing and securing their networks.  What I would say also is this notion that technology has become more critical to business strategy is the same in small businesses. It's really no difference there. So thematically, customers are very much prioritizing their technology investments. And while there's pressure on budgets for sure, and customers are being prudent, technology is getting a priority. So the pulse of our customers is pretty strong right now, and we're just staying very close to them in what's top of mind. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Woodring at Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Maybe I'll have one for each of you. So Chris, maybe if I just start with you. Maybe can you help us understand what has been the biggest change to either kind of your end-market outlook or your customer discussions since we all were on your 2Q call 90 days ago, anything that is notable that you'd call out in terms of changes, either it's positive or negative? And then I have a follow-up. Christine Leahy : Yes. Sure, Erik. Here's what I'd say between the 2 calls. And it's the words I just used before, where there's certainly, I'd say, incrementally more pressure on budgets generally for our customers. Look, there's persistent uncertainty out there. And when that happens, there's just pressure. That said, customers are being prudent and what we are seeing consistently is notwithstanding that added scrutiny. Technology is being prioritized because it's reframed from a cost center to an asset of innovation, an enabler of cost efficiency and agility and risk mitigation and resilience and experience. So technology touches everything that drives competitive advantage for our customers. Further, we are continuing to see a scarcity of talent in the market, coupled with the heightened complexity that technology brings and security risks continue to essentially explode. So you have all of that happening in a more pressured budget environment.  The good news for CDW is in those environments, our customers lean even more into CDW. And so the strategy that we've been executing with discipline over the last few years, has created -- has really strengthened our value prop. I would say our value proposition and the broad-based portfolio, particularly of solutions and services has never been stronger. It's never been more relevant. It's never been more resonant with our customers and they can look to us to help them make the best decisions in an unbiased outcome-based way. So I guess the point is more pressure right now, persistent uncertainty, but that actually drives the need for CDW even more. Erik Woodring : Perfect. That's really helpful. And then, Al, maybe a follow-up for you. Historically, you do see a sequential expansion of gross margins in the December quarter. You made some comments about margin rates moderating from 3Q. So maybe if you could just help us understand, again, some of the moving pieces as we think about 4Q margins, whether that's on the growth -- gross and/or operating side, just so we could think about what that might mean for seasonality versus what normal seasonality has historically looked like? And that's it for me. Albert Miralles : Yes, sure. Thanks, Erik. So look, I would say Q4, I think, is going to be a decent reflection of what we've seen year-to-date, which has been really strong margins, both gross margins and NGOI. Q3 was exceptional. And I think I've called out some of the areas that really drove that, particularly on the product margin side. So I would say it's stay the course pretty much on par with what we've seen for the year, notwithstanding that, again, as we start to see this feathering out of supply, it's conceivable you could see a bit of a moderation on the product margin side. So that's basically been what you've seen year-to-date is low 19s on gross margin and low 8s on NGOI margin may be slightly better. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Housum at Northcoast Research. Keith Housum : Question for you guys on price increases that we've seen over the past year. Have you guys seen a moderation of those price increases from the vendors and your ability to pass those on? And how has your customers buying decisions changed as most recently as a result of those based on the current environment? Christine Leahy : Keith, it's Chris. Yes, I would say on the price increases, first of all, the ubiquitous across the industry. We haven't seen them abate really. We have been able to pass them along. And right now, given the continued supply constraints and the prioritization of technology, we're not expecting to see those abate anytime soon because customers are okay taking those on. We might start to see that sometime in 2023. But for right now, they're holding strong. Keith Housum : Great. And what kind of -- and how should that contribute to actually your top-line growth you say this quarter? Albert Miralles : Yes, Keith, I'll take that. So I would -- it varies by channel and obviously varies by products. Certainly, there are pockets where we've had very solid unit growth. And then in some cases where net sales is more bolstered by ASP. And so that's going to vary by channel and by product.  But back to Chris' point, I would say, for the quarter and what we see now, ASPs continue to be firm. But we're certainly cognizant as supply changes, potentially some customer behaviors change, you could maybe see a bit of that easing of that, and that's why we're just being a little bit prudent on the product margin side. Operator : Our next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ruplu Bhattacharya : I have 1 question on revenue growth and 1 on margin expansion. Christine Leahy : Ruplu, we can't hear you. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Can you hear me? Christine Leahy : Not quite. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Can you hear me? Christine Leahy : Yes. Perfect. Thank you. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Great. Sorry about that. I had 1 question on revenue growth and 1 on margin expansion. So maybe I'll first the first one on revenue growth to you, Chris. At a high level, when we look at the commentary in the prepared remarks, it seems to indicate that there's ongoing strong end-market demand. And yet, you are seeing some deceleration in year-on-year growth first half versus second half. So like the second half is growing mid-teens year-on-year based on your full year guidance versus low 20% year-on-year growth in the first half. That's still strong growth, but it is a decel. So my question is, are you seeing any end-market demand deceleration in any end markets? Or is it all just a matter of more netted-down items and a change in mix? Christine Leahy : Yes, Ruplu, I would tell you that it is more mix than demand generated. Really, as we had expected, we have mixed more heavily into netted-down items, even a little bit more than we expected, and that really is the main driver of the pressure on the top line. And that's -- from a deceleration perspective, like I said before, there's pressure. PCs have moderated, as we said. But really, otherwise, we're seeing what I would consider pretty robust demand and performance as a result. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe I'll ask the margin question to Al. So the full year guide is for a low 8% operating margin, and that's really good margin performance compared to your peers. But my question would be like can you talk to us about factors that can drive margin expansion beyond that? And if the U.S. were to go into a more protracted recession, can you still expand margin? So what do you need to have either from a revenue growth standpoint or a mix standpoint? I mean do you think that even in a slower demand environment or in a recessionary environment, are there factors, are there levers that you have to expand margins beyond this? Albert Miralles : Sure, Ruplu. I'll take that. This is Al. Back to my comments on just the components really starting with gross margin and the fact that we would deem the more netted-down categories. Remember, cloud, security, Software as a Service as structural. And my comments there are more kind of over time, but also certainly thematically important in this environment. If you think about what we're talking about there, right? You got a lot of customers that are focused on how do I drive productivity, how do we get to the cloud, how do I reduce my costs. So thematically, structurally, we think there's durability there.  Same thing with services, right? Now we've bolstered and we've made significant investments on services. But also in times like this, this is where our customers look to us, they need assistance more so than ever. So those components really, really important. And then just look to the beyond the gross margin down to NGOI margin, it's important for us that we, just like our customers, remain very diligent and thoughtful about our spend, and we are on the pulse of our customers and what's happening and making sure that both the timing, the size and the criticality of our investments are always top of mind, and that's how we try to manage -- kind of manage the margin profile over time. So hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan Chase. Samik Chatterjee : I guess for the first one, we've seen a few other enterprise suppliers report already. And I think in relation to sort of pulled back or a bit of a sort of pressure on customer budgets that's not as surprising to hear at this point. But they've also indicated a bit more pressure when it comes to the international markets, particularly EMEA.  I was just wondering, Chris, I mean, is there a difference you're seeing in terms of engagement with customers in the U.S. versus in the international markets? Is there a bit more of a pushback or a pullback in terms of thinking about budgets for next year in the international markets? Maybe your insights on that front will help. And I have a follow-up. Christine Leahy : Yes, sure. What I would say on that one is I focus in on the U.K., it's a pretty complex environment there right now for all the reasons we know. And I'd say a couple of things. First of all, our position in the market is very similar to CDW U.S. We've got the most broad-based portfolio of solutions and services capabilities. We have customers focusing on the same types of things : digital transformation, security, cloud, collaboration, et cetera. And also the criticality of technology is obviously central to companies and organizations over in the U.K.  That said, it is a tougher environment. And so I would just say that I attribute our ability to perform as well as we have been and in particular, this quarter, which was exceptional performance to the execution of the team and their ability to stay close to their customers, know what their customers need access, supply and provide the professional services at the front end for advice and counseling to ensure the highest return on technology investment. And that trusted adviser rule, you can never underestimate the impact that has on results in a market that is really in. It's very dynamic, I would say. So we expect them to continue to perform well despite the external factors. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Got it. And a follow-up, if I could get an update on the growth rate you're seeing or the growth trajectory you're seeing at Sirius and I know you mentioned sort of challenges around hiring talent at your customers, but what sort of constraints you might be having at the same time on Sirius and your ability to sort of scale that business? What are you trying to think about sort of how accretive it is to your out-performance to underlying industry growth, particularly as we start thinking about next year? Christine Leahy : Yes, sure. On the talent side, I would say, look, everybody is feeling tightness in the labor markets, but our position as the best place to work has been pretty solid for a very long time. And we have not seen length to fill or quality diminish at all. We've been very pleased with our ability to bring in talent. Part of that, I believe, is because it's a great place to work, but equally, the development of our technical talent in particular, is top of the list. So if you even look this year at the number of certifications has increased dramatically, particularly around cloud services, for example, in security services. So CDW is a place to be if you're a technologist and that bodes well in the market. And as a result, obviously, we've been able to -- it's reflected in the performance. As a result, we've been able to help our customers with talent orchestration where they have talent scarcity and we've been able to staff professional services engagements at a very fast pace. So we're -- look, it's tough, it's a tough market, but we aren't inhibited by it right now, which is great. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Cash at Raymond James. Mark Cash : This is Mark on for Adam. It sounds like cloud and SaaS are doing very well for you and up by about 4Q. But assuming out of that, I think there's some earnings on the hyperscaler slowing down. Are you starting to see any of that impact to the pipeline? Or just the broad customer base, things like the strong digital transformation and security demand help keep you insulated from that somewhat? Christine Leahy : No, I think it could be a short answer. No, we aren't seeing that slowdown actually. We're seeing cloud continue to accelerate. And I don't need to take through all the reasons for you why that's happening. But look, with regard to our customers, we've got customers who are -- some are just starting the journey to the cloud. Some are on the journey. Some are trying to optimize the cloud. Some are moving optimized cloud and on-prem. And there's just a lot of opportunity to support customers in this journey. But we certainly are not seeing it start to slow down. Mark Cash : Okay. Perfect. And then just a follow-up. I appreciate the update on the backlog you guys provided. Also wonder if you can update on what you're seeing around potential risk of double ordering and cancellations and a slowdown to the backlog. Albert Miralles : Yes. Sure, Mark. We continue to not see any evidence of double ordering or canceling. So I would say that just the clarity and the commitment of our customers to the products they originally want and what we're delivering has been pretty solid, pretty seamless. So no concerns there. Operator : Our next question then comes from James Suva at Citigroup. James Suva : Great. I had a question about higher labor rates, both on your cost of goods sold buying as well as your kind of OpEx line. Do the clients and customers kind of see it or notice it? Or is it just kind of all built-in? And are those creating a little bit more challenging thing for your customers? And then as we approach the end of this calendar year, can you remind us about like annual merit increases or anything like that on the OpEx line regarding higher wages and just cost of living adjustments and things like that? Christine Leahy : Yes, good question about labor because it's a pretty dynamic and fluid market. With regard to our own folks, remember that we are a highly variable compensation organization with a significant amount of compensation geared to performance. So that is a positive thing, and it doesn't really put as much pressure on kind of raising cost at the baseline level because there's opportunity on the upside with performance. With regard to fees for professional services, for example, we do bring those up, like the rest of the industry in line with inflation. And that lags a little bit, right, when you bring it up because you got contracts in place. But so far, customers again, when it's a critical -- and it's a critical project, customers do not back at the expertise they need. It's just you've got your go-to trusted advisers and you're willing to pay for that because, look, there's pressure, and there's a lot at stake in getting the technology right.  In terms of our raises going into next year, performance raises, we're in the middle of evaluating that, and we'll know what we're doing when we get to next year. Operator : We have no further questions on the call. So I will hand back to Chris Leahy to conclude. Christine Leahy : Okay. Well, thank you, Seb. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our nearly 15,000 coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking with you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for dialing in. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2023. Then I'll hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our fourth quarter was an excellent example of the power of our business model when coupled with our broad and deep portfolio of technology solutions. In an extraordinary period of shifting customer priorities, we delivered record profitability. For the quarter, net sales were $5.4 billion, $100 million below 2021, and roughly flat on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP operating income was $523 million, 23% above last year; and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.50, up 21% year-over-year, up 22% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by the team's ability to pivot to meet customer priorities and capture high relevance, high growth opportunities. This led to excellent performance across services, cloud, security, and software. Performance that drove record profitability and exceptional outcome given market dynamics and an outcome that is a direct result of the investments we have made in solutions and services over the past several years. Simply put our ability to deliver outcomes across the full stack and full lifecycle of technology drove strong profit growth notwithstanding a meaningful decline in client devices. This quarter clearly demonstrates the power of our strategy when combined with the resiliency of our business model. So what happened to client devices this quarter? While we expected some level of contraction in client devices and accessories given the past two years of heavy investment, the magnitude of the decline in the fourth quarter was certainly steeper than anticipated. The primary driver was the K-12 market, which represented roughly half of the client device decline. We also saw a general moderation in client device demand across channels as economic uncertainty increased. As we always do, we stayed the course on our playbook and maintained our discipline with a focus on our customer and our value proposition. This discipline contributed to this quarter's excellent cash flows and strong economic returns. In Q4, the combination of lower transactional business and the team's success delivering on customer demand for solutions and services led to a meaningful shift in our sales mix. Let me put this in perspective for you. You've heard us speak over time about the impact of solutions mix and notably netted-down revenue streams on our financial results. As we have grown our netted-down revenue streams over time, total annual customer spend has consistently grown a few hundred basis points faster than net sales. In periods where we mix into more solutions business that nets down and mix out of client device business that fully shows up in net sales that growth rate spread will be wider. In Q4 an extreme mix shift took place. The result was meaningful customer spend growth significantly dampened net sales growth and very healthy gross margins that drove delivery of gross profit. Now let's turn briefly to the full-year results. 2022 was a year of financial performance underpinned by progress on our three-part strategy for growth. The first pillar of our strategy is to capture share and acquire new customers. One way we do this is through strategic acquisitions. The addition of Sirius is a great example of this. Sirius elevated and expanded our services capabilities providing an excellent cross-sell opportunity into our existing customer base. At the same time, Sirius customers represent excellent cross-sell opportunity given the broader CDW portfolio. The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions areas. Strategic coworker investments contributed to excellent solutions performance through 2022, with strong growth in cloud, security and network upgrades. The third pillar of our strategy is to expand services capabilities. As a key enabler of our value proposition, services are fundamental to our full stack, full lifecycle, full outcomes go-to-market approach. Services engagement solves critical customer problems and drive enduring customer relationships. In 2022, the team delivered more than 20% services growth across the business. No doubt, our acquisitions have accelerated our services breadth and depth and have been foundational to our success. 2022 was indeed a year of strategic performance across all three of our priorities. It was also a year of exceptional financial performance. The team delivered record results with constant currency net sales growth of 15% and each profit category down the P&L statement up 20% or more. Results enabled by ongoing investment in our three-part growth strategy, investments that have made us a vital technology partner, whether customers' priorities require transactional or highly complex solutions. You see the impact of these investments on our fourth quarter performance as the team pivoted to meet customer shifting priorities and advise, design and orchestrate full outcomes. Outcomes that deliver five key organizational benefits : innovation, lower cost, agility, risk mitigation, and enhanced experiences for customers and coworkers. Let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter. There were three main drivers of our fourth quarter results : our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio, and relentless execution of our three-part strategy. First, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels : corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion over the last 12 months. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of US$2.9 billion. Our corporate team delivered another strong quarter with a 7% sales increase. The team helps customers accelerate implementation of priorities to automate tasks, detect fraud and enhance customer and employee experiences. This drove excellent cloud software and security results. Our ability to address priorities focused on application and network modernization and consumption-based data center solutions led to excellent services and net comp performance, each up double-digits. Economic uncertainty led customers to de-prioritize endpoint solutions, which resulted in a decline in client devices. Small business declined 13%. The team pivoted to help customers address priorities to maximize prior IT investments and identify savings opportunities to fund new and ongoing projects. At the same time, the team helped customers address mission-critical priorities around security and take advantage of the benefits of cloud, both with heightened urgency. Strong growth from security and cloud were balanced against the decline in client devices as customers put upgrades on hold awaiting greater clarity around the economy and employment plans. Strong results across healthcare and government cannot offset the decline in education driven by K-12 client device dynamics and public sales decreased 9% year-over-year. The healthcare team delivered another excellent quarter of robust growth, up 8%. Talent needs and data center projects remain key focus areas as customers increasingly thought technology solutions to address complex industry challenges. This drove excellent performance in NetComm, servers and services. Mission-critical investments to enhance patient care and experience continued with telehealth and telesitting driving excellent collaboration performance. Government grew double-digits, up 13.5%. Strong state and local sales growth continued, driven by customer adoption of IT strategies for hybrid cloud, as well as network modernization and Zero Trust security frameworks. Services increased more than 50%, as the team helps state and local municipalities address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagements. Federal also continued to grow in the fourth quarter. The team's ability to help agencies achieve their priorities around data management drove excellent server and storage performance.  For education, higher ed high single-digit sales growth was more than offset by declines in K-12 and overall sales decreased. Higher ed continued their success helping implement student success programs, which institutions use to promote enrollment. Our ability to help drive program elements that include improved security, campus connectivity as well as enhanced storm room experiences drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, server, storage, software and security. For K-12, we expected a continuation of third quarter performance where sales were down low-double-digits but instead experienced a more significant decline with client device units down more than 68%. As we shared last quarter, K-12 customers continued to focus on digesting the past several years' investments and evaluating multi-year funding opportunities to ensure they are making the best decisions for the future. This quarter, as many schools achieved one-to-one student client device ratios, there was a significantly heightened focus on reevaluating plans, and demonstrating need for ECF awards. When the device per student ratio was below 1 :1 demonstrating need was straightforward. Today, with device per student at or above the 1 :1 ratio, demonstrating need is more complex. For example, articulating why new devices with higher processor capability are required to run more complex applications or provide greater security is just a more complicated discussion and takes more time and approval. This heightened focus led some customers to defer or retract awarded funding commitments in order to assess, reevaluate and potentially reapply under the third and final wave of ECF, which is scheduled to end December 31, 2023. For CDW, this equated to several hundred million dollars of CDW awarded funding commitments being pulled back. I should note that even with these dynamic variables in the K-12 client devices arena, the team successfully executed on infrastructure opportunities across services, NetComm and servers, leading to strong gross profit delivery. And just as we've been doing in past cycles with K-12, the team will be there for our customers to help them work through the challenges to achieve their mission-critical outcomes and efficiently utilize available funding mechanisms. Other, our combined UK and Canada results reflected broad-based and balanced performance in both regions in local currency. UK increased low-double-digits in local currency and Canada increased high-single-digits in local currency. These results continue to demonstrate the grit and resilience of our teams and the power of our investments to drive growth in these markets. As you can see, our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and a driver of our differentiated performance. The second driver of our performance was the broad and deep portfolio. Our ability to address priorities across the entire IT continuum delivered high-single-digit growth across our solutions portfolio. U.S. hardware sales declined mid-teens. Within hardware, network modernization upgrades drove double-digit increases in NetComm. These excellent results were not enough to offset the decline in client devices and wraparound accessories. Supply conditions continued to improve across core transactional areas, while supply and solutions categories remained tight. Once again, we exited the quarter with an elevated backlog and extended lead times and solutions and notably in NetComm. We continue to expect this backlog to feather out over time. U.S. software sales increased 8%. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment with strong double-digit increases in operating systems, application suites and data management. Cloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to profitability. Once again, gross profit increased by double-digits. Compute database, storage, mobility and connectivity were key cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase. Our teams delivered excellent results as they continue to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement identity and access management solutions and provide training to our customers to help manage cloud deployments and enhance endpoint and application security. Services results were stellar again this quarter, up more than 20% with balanced performance across professional and managed services. Services are integral to today's complex technology solutions. Customers continue to lean into CDW as an extension of their own teams and leverage CDW services as part of their strategy. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our three-part growth strategy. Clearly, investments in our customer-centric growth strategy contributed to our strong profitability this quarter. Investments in services and solutions have elevated our relevance to customers for the highest level it has ever been. Our rigorous strategic process that is designed to ensure we can serve customers across the full stack, full lifecycle has made us a vital technology partner, whether customers' priorities require transactional or highly complex solutions. And that leads us to our 2023 outlook. Our baseline view of the U.S. IT market in 2023 is for flattish growth, factoring in both expected mix and the level of overall economic uncertainty. Consistent with economic forecast, this outlook assumes stronger growth in the second half relative to the first half. We continue to target CDW market outperformance of between 200 basis points and 300 basis points. Our current view of the market recognizes we are operating under greater uncertainty as it incorporates the potential impact of some of our recent wildcards and indeed, most notably the economy. With thousands of sellers connecting with customers every day, we have a real-time pulse of the market. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Our fourth quarter results highlight that although we cannot definitively know where our customers will place their priorities; there are two things we know for sure. Technology will continue to be a critical driver of outcomes. And with our agility and broadened deep portfolio, we will be there to support our customers wherever their priorities now live. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Al Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the fourth quarter and full-year, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.4 billion, down 1.8% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales declined 0.4%. Net sales were impacted by the significant change in client device demand during the quarter. With the decline in transactional products, there was a meaningful mix shift to solutions and services. Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of mixing into solutions and services on our results. Certain solutions such as Software-as-a-Service, software assurance and warranty solutions as well as aging commission fees generate meaningful customer spend but are recorded on a netted-down basis. Since we are not the primary obligor on these solutions, we record gross profit as our revenue. That is why you sometimes hear us refer to these netted-down revenues as 100% gross margin items. You certainly see the impact of this in both our net sales and our gross margin performance this quarter. As we continue to execute on our growth strategy and scale our solutions and services, we expect to continue to grow our netted-down revenue streams. All else equal, this mix dynamic will pressure net sales while remaining neutral to gross profit dollars and expanding gross margins. While much of what I've described is tied into the accounting treatment, it is also reflection of our success in the execution of our three-part strategy to capture share, enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions and expand services. The impact of this strategy was on full display this quarter as we experienced a significant mix shift out of client devices and into netted-down revenues, reflective of our customers' priorities. Returning to the P&L. Sequentially, net sales decreased 12.5% versus the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales historically decreased versus the third quarter but this quarter was exacerbated by the decline in demand for client devices. To dimensionalize the shortfall in net sales relative to our expectations, two-thirds of lower net sales were related to the public sector and driven primarily by K-12. In aggregate, solution categories delivered results above our expectations. Notwithstanding the noted mix shift of customer priorities, with respect to customer behavior, we did see increased scrutiny and deeper evaluation of projects and extra signatures increasingly required. In this environment, our sellers are staying close to their customers and working with their technical coworkers to help customers maximize return on investments. While we've not seen meaningful customer cancellations, we have seen some postponements and re-architecting on more complex hybrid cloud solutions as customers balance cost and utility. On the supply side, we saw similar conditions as in the third quarter with some improvement across categories but pockets of pressure remaining, especially in the solutions space. Our solutions backlog remains elevated versus historic levels and lead times are still extended. We expect our backlog to feather out over time as supply conditions ease, although not likely symmetrical across product categories. We continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers through this still uncertain supply environment. And just like our customers in this environment, our team is diligently managing working capital as we seek to enable profitable growth while ensuring strong economic returns. Our coworkers delivered excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 21.1%, lapping for the first time a one-month serious contribution in the fourth quarter of 2021. Gross profit margin was a record 21.7%, up 410 basis points versus last year and 190 basis points above our prior year quarter record. The year-over-year expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, product margins benefited from both mix into complex hybrid cloud solutions and lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, as we expected for the fourth quarter, a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. The category outpaced overall net sales growing 26% in Q4 2022 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Software-as-a-Service. And third, net sales contribution from high-margin services, which increased 28% in Q4 2022 compared to the prior year quarter with significant contribution from our recent acquisitions. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $658 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consistent with higher gross profit attainment and higher coworker count. SG&A declined by $26 million compared to the third quarter, reflecting the variable component of our compensation structure, which is principally tied to gross profit attainment. In this uncertain economic environment, we are also being mindful of our discretionary spending and our pace of our hiring. Our fourth quarter expense levels reflect both the benefits of our variable cost model and our prudent expense management. Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was nearly 15,100, up approximately 1,100 in the last year and essentially unchanged since the third quarter. Investments in our coworkers and in our strategy continue to be integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are focused on disciplined and balanced investments that drive value. This is evidenced by our record profitability in the period. GAAP operating income was $447 million, up 31.6% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $523 million, up 23.2%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 9.6%, up 190 basis points from the prior year and 80 basis points compared to the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, this improvement was driven by a confluence of favorable factors within gross margin. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $59 million. Higher interest expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius. This level of interest expense was in line with our expectation for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 24.7%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $94 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, 30 basis points below our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5% due to lower state taxes as well as non-deductible items. As you can see on Slide 13, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.09. Our non-GAAP net income was $343 million in the quarter, up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.50, up 21%. Turning to full-year results on Slide 14 through 19. As Chris mentioned, 2022 performance reflected exceptional execution, relentless focus and a strategy that is working. Net sales were $23.7 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, full-year consolidated net sales grew 15.2%. On a combined constant currency basis, we estimate full-year sales increased 5%, below our prior expectation of 8.25% due to the moderation in IT market growth as well as a contraction in our premium in the fourth quarter. Gross profit was $4.7 billion, up 31.3% and grew 19.7%, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. In 2022, software and services accounted for more than 40% of the total gross profit. Organic and inorganic investments in our services and solutions capabilities and a continued shift in the netted-down revenues are driving growth. Operating income was $1.7 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $2.1 billion, up 24.6%. Net income was $1.1 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $1.3 billion, up 19.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $9.79, up 22.9%. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $315 million and net debt was $5.6 billion. During the quarter, we reduced borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan by $200 million, consistent with our plan to reduce leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to Slide 21. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down three days from last year's fourth quarter, and within our range of high teens to low-20s, reflecting our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management, along with strong growth in the business also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $1.3 billion, as shown on Slide 22. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objective, including returning $80 million to shareholders through dividends in addition to $200 million in debt repayment, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 23. Our execution remains consistent with objectives we communicated last quarter. For 2023, we're updating those objectives as follows : first, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. This increase demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business. Going forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the fourth quarter at 2.6x net leverage, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash flow generation. As we expected and communicated during the third quarter call, 2.6x had us near the lower end of our 2022 targeted net leverage of 2.5x to 3x. For 2023 and beyond, our targeted net leverage ratio will be 2x to 3x, a range that is consistent with our commitment to an investment-grade capital structure and provides us with flexibility to proactively manage liquidity over time. Finally, we have successfully satisfied the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. As such, we are pleased to have reestablished our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A, and share repurchases, respectively in 2023. For 2023, we will target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. This is supported by the Board's authorization for a $750 million increase in the company's share repurchase programs. Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 24. While we are cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to execute, pivoted growth opportunities and outperform the broader market. While the overall IT market growth rate sentiment has been mixed, in the near-term, we continue to expect netted-down revenues will grow faster than other product and solution categories. With this in mind, we expect the IT market to be approximately flattish, reflecting our expectation of mix and the level of economic uncertainty. We maintain our long-held expectation to outgrow the market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points per year. Currency is expected to be neutral for the full-year, with modest headwinds in the first half and modest tailwinds in the second half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.24 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar in the first quarter. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid to high 8% range. We expect full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be at the upper end of a mid-single-digit range in constant currency. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter related to average daily sales, we expect low-single-digit sequential growth from Q4 to Q1. This equates to a mid-single-digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline for the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued strong gross profit margin and NGOI margin in the first quarter above the full-year 2022 levels for both but reflecting some moderation from what we experienced in Q4. And we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low-single-digits year-over-year. Finally, in line with the reevaluation of our capital priorities, we're adjusting our long-term rule of thumb for full-year free cash flow. In 2023, we expect full-year free cash flow to be within a range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales, up from our prior range of 3.75% to 4.25%. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter and across years. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now start today's Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I was hoping to ask just questions regarding your take on the client device environment. Not a big surprise that it was down significantly, particularly in K-12. But could you talk about the commercial side of the business? It sounds like some customers are being more cautious on upgrades. What's your thought on the PC cycle on the commercial side of the business and how you see that playing out this year? Chris Leahy : Good morning, Matt. Yes. It's a good question. We have seen customers elongate the replacement cycle given the uncertain times. I mean you're seeing what we're seeing with hiring freezes and layoffs and things like that. So right now, there's just more pause than we had seen earlier in the year. Eventually, the benefit of enhanced productivity and security from the newer replacements will certainly drive a replacement cycle, but it's not happening right now with the level of uncertainty. Matt Sheerin : Okay. And that's not contemplated then in your forecast for the year? Chris Leahy : A rebound? Matt Sheerin : In terms of a -- yes, yes. Chris Leahy : Yes. Our forecast contemplates the environment to feel pretty much like it feels now. That's what we've reflected in the forecast. I mean we do expect the PC market to remain larger than it was pre-pandemic. But right now, our forecast reflects the current environment and the current temperature. Matt Sheerin : Okay. And then in line with that, are you also seeing pricing pressure or ASP declines as memory and other component prices come down? And is that also going to be reflected in your business? Al Miralles : Yes. Good morning, Matt. This is Al. We are not seeing -- I would say ASPs in the fourth quarter and ongoing continue to be really firm. And so that is not contemplated in our outlook. Operator : Our next question today comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Chris, from the prepared remarks, I mean it's clear that client devices are weak and likely will remain weak in the near-term. But if we think about it, if SMB is really a bellwether for the macro economy, are you concerned that demand for advanced solutions or data center devices like servers and storage that demand can also moderate? So what have you assumed for sustainability of that demand through 2023? And I think in the prepared remarks, you guided for kind of the seasonality in this year to be skewed more to the second half versus the first half. So what are you expecting to be stronger in the second half of 2023? Chris Leahy : Good morning, Ruplu. Let me break that out. There are a couple of questions in there. Let me just start with the small business. And what I'd say on small business is the team is really executing well in a fairly cautious environment. And as I did mention, we are helping customers with priorities around infrastructure, networking, et cetera, primarily led by software and cloud. And of course, security is still top of mind. So what we're not seeing is a dampening in the small business of the need to modernize their infrastructure and maximize their prior investments. So we're seeing -- what I would say is continued steady demand from our small business customers for sure, with an emphasis again on cloud and security. In terms of the split, first half to second half of the year, I'm going to let Al address that in terms of the seasonality there. And then I think there was another question in there that you had, which was -- was there another question that you had? Ruplu Bhattacharya : Or just the sustainability of demand for servers and storage and solutions throughout the year. I mean do you think that, that can be better in the second half? Or do you think it's a sense at this level throughout the year? Chris Leahy : Yes. Here's what I'd say. I think as we've said for a while now, technology has become more vital to every walk of life into competitive advantage into success, et cetera. And we believe it's going to probably be more resilient to a challenging economic environment. Equally, given our business model and the strength of our portfolio, our ability to capture opportunity in a more difficult environment is pretty strong. But our expectation is for a level of resiliency in the technology space. Al Miralles : And good morning, Ruplu. On the -- on your question on seasonality, so first, just look, our outlook is based on the premise, we continue to see strength in software and services and lower growth in terms of hardware overall. With respect to the timing of that, first half, our typical seasonality would be first half 48, 49, we'd expect to maybe be slightly below that in the first half, and that's reflective of that continued slope towards more netted-down revenues and cloud, security, et cetera with the expectation that in the second half, you may see a pickup there, more on the client device. And so second half a bit stronger in terms of top-line impact, if you will. Chris Leahy : Ruplu, it's Chris again. I would just add -- let me just add that as we think about the customer behavior more recently, and a lot of folks have been talking about extra signatures, a little more scrutiny, et cetera. Yes, we have been seeing that. We haven't been seeing is a pullback -- wholesale pullback in projects. In fact, those infrastructure projects that we had talked about being delayed a little bit are actually coming to the forefront. Again, back to the technology being essential to all of our customer base. So we are seeing that resiliency as well. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Got it. Thanks for the details there. Can I ask a follow-up? Al, I may have missed this, but on the call, did you mention what was netted-down items as a percent of gross profit in the fiscal 4Q? And sounded like that, that percent was unusually high in the quarter, and you expect that to moderate but your guide for next year for operating margin, I mean you're guiding it to be higher at mid to high-8% versus your original guide for this year was below 8%. So I guess my question to you would be what are you assuming for netted-down items as a percent of gross profit in 2023? And in general, can you help us parse out that year-on-year operating margin improvement? What are some of the factors that are driving the increase? And what are some of the headwinds year-on-year? Al Miralles : Sure. So let me just start with the operating margin. So operating margin, I would most notably point to expectation that we would continue to be somewhat higher on gross margin in 2023 versus 2022. I certainly would not expect that those gross margins would match what we saw in Q4, which was really extraordinary. But I would just start from that square that somewhat higher gross margins in 2023 will certainly drive our NGOI margin, coupled with expectation we'd have some operating leverage there. To your original question on netted-down revenues for the quarter, you're right. Our prepared remarks noted that netted-down revenues grew 26% year-over-year. On a percentage of GP basis, Ruplu, that was 31% in the fourth quarter, so continue to be really strong. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Hi, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, in sort of the capital allocation priorities that you referenced in your prepared remarks, maybe we can sort of get a bit more color about how you're thinking about the M&A pipeline here? And sort of what are the focus areas, particularly as you look at sort of the changing mix of where customers are looking to spend? How are you thinking about the M&A pipeline and what are the focus areas for the company? And I have a follow-up, please. Al Miralles : Let me just start, and then Chris can add on from an M&A perspective. So as you know, our capital priorities reopened both M&A and share repurchase. And the way that I would think about that, as I spoke to that range of our free cash flow of 50% to 75%, we would expect return to shareholders. So if you take the dividend, you can get a sense for what that range would look like. There is a range there because we view that as really optionality for us to tackle between what's going to drive the longest strategic value, including M&A as well as what's going to maximize shareholder return in the more near-term. And so look, both of those options and array of options are available to us. We're certainly back on the path of share repurchases, but M&A is also on horizon as well. Chris Leahy : Yes. And I would just add, we're never out of the market. We did have a pretty heavy year integrating Sirius, which is an incredibly successful and having an impact in the market. But we're always looking for organizations that can add capabilities in -- broadened capabilities, I should say, in high-growth, high relevance areas and also add scale to those practice areas that we've built if we can add scale at a faster pace, and we think about geography and our global presence. So we're always looking, and it's good to have a solid year of the Sirius integration behind us. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Got it. And for my follow-up, I know you're all talking about sort of client devices being softer than expected. But I think you also mentioned on the flip side, solutions tracked much better than expected which, again, sort of is counter to the mixed impressions we get about enterprise spending. So maybe if you can sort of give us a bit more color on -- is that really solutions doing better than expected more of a supply dynamic where supply is easing up faster? Or are you seeing sort of upsized deals from your customers? Or is it really a strong run rate of orders that you continue to see on that front continued interest from customers? Just trying to sort of parse that out in terms of the backdrop of -- the macro backdrop that we have. Chris Leahy : Yes. No, it's a very fair question. And I would characterize it this way. We are seeing strong demand in the solutions space. And while we've had some supply feather out, I mean, where it's really moderated is on the client device space, some pockets in solutions but we're still carrying heavy backlog, particularly in NetComm. So the demand that you're seeing reflected in our performance is just that, it's demand, it's not a flow through of backlog. Operator : Our next question today comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, Chris, maybe to start with, you folks are talking about IT spend being flat in 2023. When I listen to IDC, Gartner, even some of your peers, they're all talking about IT spend being up about 3%, 4%. So from your perspective, where is the biggest delta here versus what you're talking about versus what maybe IDC Gartner and your peers are saying? And then how much of the delta do you think is perhaps conservatism and you can color where you're seeing that versus the netted-down revenue impact that you have? Chris Leahy : Good morning, Amit. Well, look, I wish I could say that it felt stronger out there. I really do, but that's not what the temperature is that we're feeling. So we build our expectations by listening to our customers. We've got thousands of sellers and technical advisers out there. And it's just the pulse that's coming back to us and looking at industry and partner data, we're feeling that it's going to be flattish. And then the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of premium that we always commit to would be on top of that. In terms of mix, I guess what I would say is we don't calculate in our customer spend versus net sales as an example. But of course, in this kind of environment, as we've explained, when you've got hardware that's more muted and you've got, in our case, netted-down solutions more heavily in the mix, you can expect more meaningful customer spend than the net sales line reflects. But that said, we are right now feeling flattish. Of course, we'll update you as we move through the year, but that's kind of where we feel right now. Amit Daryanani : Got it. It always seems that you folks start to guide gross profit dollars growing at a premium to IT spend versus revenues given the way the mix is going up. That may be a discussion for a different day. But I do want to ask you a follow-up on the NetComm market. You talked about December quarter; I think it was up in that business. I'd love to get a sense, as you see supply starting to improve, especially on the NetComm side, are you seeing cancellations or deferrals happening over there? And then how do you think about NetComm into 2023 in this flat IT spend environment? Al Miralles : Good morning, Amit. We are not seeing any level of cancellation or postponements there. The demand on NetComm, and you can see from our reported results, really, really strong. We're not getting a lot of help from a supply perspective, honestly. Extended lead times is still there. Our backlog has not moved substantially really -- our backlog has moved more in client, as Chris suggested, supply is still -- there's still friction there on the NetComm side, but that's notwithstanding really strong written demand. Operator : Our next question today comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Erik Woodring : Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Yes, Chris, maybe a high-level question for you. And that's now that you have a year of Sirius under your belt, and that being one of the larger acquisitions CDW has done in the last handful of years. How do you think about doing more transformational deals going forward rather than tuck-in deals? And then does kind of the lower leverage targets that you guys communicated today -- is that because you want greater flexibility to do larger deals? I just want to kind of get a sense of how you're thinking about transformational deals because it does seem like Sirius has been a pretty significant success for you and what your appetite would be for those types of deals going forward? And then I have a follow-up. Chris Leahy : Yes. No, look, it's a great question, Erik, and it's all a matter of supply and demand, right? We're pretty particular in looking at organizations that really complement our suite of capabilities and/or scale them, along with the -- obviously, the financial return, but the fit in terms of culture. And I'll tell you, we've done eight over quarters and check, check, check. They've all been really outstanding. Now that said, there are companies out there that we think of and always reflecting on and some other larger transformational deal would certainly be something we'd consider. But it's a matter of finding them and making sure they're going to fit and provide the financial return. And you asked a question on the debt ratio, though, Al, did you want to tackle that? Al Miralles : Sure. So Erik, obviously, we're within our stated range, and I noted that our new leverage range is 2x to 3x. So certainly, we have room in that regard. And I would say as we think about M&A, certainly, smaller bolt-on as we've certainly done plenty of. We can do that with free cash flow and with our existing net leverage capacity. As we think about things bigger, obviously, we're going to look at what's the best use of our capital, which could include taking on more debt and could include other avenues. I will just note that while our goal is to stay within that investment-grade capital structure. Certainly, from the rating agencies, we get some room there that if you do larger M&A and you go beyond that, you have a grace period, if you will, and you have time that you then get back into that range. So all of that would be contemplated in our calculus as we think about deals. Erik Woodring : Okay. Totally understand. And then, Chris, I'm not sure who wants to take this one. But generally, I think we've been hearing in the market kind of more weakness at the large enterprise level versus SMBs, your results would somewhat suggest the opposite with small business down versus the corporate business up. And so can you maybe just talk about some of the high-level trends you discussed in terms of extra signatures or deal downsizing, how that differs between the corporate business versus SMB business, if you are seeing any differences there? And again, same thing. I know we asked about pricing earlier on this call, but any difference in pricing between corporate versus SMB? And that's it for me. Thanks. Chris Leahy : Okay. Erik, yes, so differences between enterprise and SMB in terms of the process. I would say that the -- look, larger enterprises have a muscle for this and we're dealing with that muscle, and we know how to deal with the muscle. The smaller business, frankly, turn to us for cost evaluation as a trusted partner. And so in some ways, we actually play this avid role with them, which is how do you figure out, where you make adjustments in your technology roadmap to achieve the cost effectiveness. So in terms of the behavior itself, I'd say small and medium-sized businesses are being cautious. Enterprises have kind of kicked in their muscle and they're doing the analysis that they do. But all of that said, we do continue to feel strong demand across all of our segments. Even K-12 that we've talked about, that was a real dynamic in the quarter. We're still very successful with them with network modernization, all the things that have to support the client devices. It's the demand. Demand is okay right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I was wondering, can you talk a bit about working capital requirements as your model turns more and more to netted-down? I know this inventory levels came down quarter-over-quarter even with the shortfall in PCs and you've raised your target for free cash flow. So just how do you see your cash flow and balance sheet morphing over time? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Al Miralles : Good morning, Shannon. So a few things. One, our -- we talked about our rule of thumb for free cash flow, and we raised that and I would say that's a reflection of our continued improvement and progress on really effectively managing working capital and also a somewhat of an effect or supported by the countercyclical nature of the business. So obviously, as this economic environment kind of moderates a bit, it actually helps from a cash flow perspective. So both of those things kind of in play. Your comment about netted-down or question about netted-down is a good one. It is a bit of a mathematical exercise. But just recall with our netted-down revenues, that while they show up in our net sales net, we're actually collecting gross dollars. So what that does from a cash conversion cycle perspective, it actually has the tendency to increase the DSO, increase DPO given the denominators and the numerator. So the way we think about that is really on a net basis. And can we continue to make progress within that band of high teens, low-20s on cash conversion. So all of those factors we consider as we're managing the business, including the puts and takes relative to our investments in inventory as well as how we manage AR and AP. So that's all part of really a dynamic operating model around working capital, and we're making really good progress on that front. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about demand you're seeing for Device-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service? It seems like in a challenged end market; maybe the ability to pay more ratably would be gaining some traction. But I'm just curious as what you're hearing maybe both from an enterprise standpoint as well as SMB. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes, Shannon, I'll take that. On the Infrastructure-as-a-Service, that is picking up. Our OEMs have been building that capability over time. And I'd say we've hit an inflection point where customers are eager to learn more and invest primarily enterprise, I would say, is a little stronger than the demand that we've seen in small business. On Device-as-a-Service that's a little more complicated because on the one hand, while it's an obvious of interest type solution. It's more complicated if it's either a lease or it's more complicated than that. And so it hasn't taken off to the extent that one would think, but may in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. I have a question on, there's been a lot of like government stimulus programs. I was wondering how you've been seeing those rollout develop; embrace any potential red taper slowdowns in them or accelerations of that? Thank you so much. Chris Leahy : Jim thanks for the question. Well, can I say they're rolling out as they typically do? And sometimes, that includes red tape and not all the things that you expect with government. I mean seriously, there's -- when we think about the federal budget that was passed, we're used to dealing with that, and we know where we can go find the funds. And I think that's been pretty kind of standard operating procedure, if you will. The Infrastructure Act is a little more to figure out where funds that can benefit our customers' vis-\u00e0-vis technology that's taking a little bit more time is what I'd say. But it's nothing that is daunting us or nothing that concerns us, frankly. Jim Suva : Okay. And have you also been finding a lot of those new programs and systems have been kind of more on a higher-end service product offerings that you've had, say, today versus 5 or 10 years ago, meaning more like cloud and security and software solutions as opposed to more kind of plug-and-play hardware solutions? Chris Leahy : Yes. That's -- that's a great point. The ability to access that funding for more advanced solutions is absolutely there. There's more demand for that versus merely client devices, for example. That's a good point. Security, another one that you tends to thread through all of the funding mechanisms at this point. So yes, that's a good point. And the answer is yes. Operator : Our next question is from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum : Good morning. Appreciate the opportunity. Chris, just looking at the hiring that you guys did over the year, 1,100 people through the first three quarters and then obviously, you guys were flat in the fourth quarter. I guess two things. One, is that kind of a testament to your thoughts on the overall market, perhaps weakening here as you guys went through the fourth quarter? And then what kind of people were you hiring during the year in order to meet your needs? Chris Leahy : Yes. Keith, good morning. As we've been doing over the last few years, we've really been targeting our hiring in a couple of areas. It was the high demand, high capability. So think about the sales organization, think about the practice areas like technical specialists and security and cloud, software, the spaces that we've talked about and really targeting those areas. Along with what I would say is technologists and digital specialists for our own evolution of our business. That's really where we've been focusing. In terms of as we come into the back half of the year, just consider that disciplined management of the business. As we look out at the economy, as we see what's happening, we're just being very disciplined in the way that we're approaching our own cost management. And you'll see that in some tempering in our hiring in the back half of the year. Keith Housum : Great. I appreciate it. And then looking at your guide a little bit more, trying to unpack it. As you think about like the macro environment, are you expecting roughly a flat GDP? And where are you -- what kind of assumptions are you making for interest rates as you guys think about your guide? Al Miralles : Yes. Good morning, Keith. I would say just in terms of broad macro GDP, yes, I'd say flat, maybe slightly down, if you will. And so you get your translation from an IT market perspective with all of the components that we talked about, both our mix and uncertainty as well. Interest rates -- look, I don't know if we have a formal market view on that. Certainly, we make sure that the posture of our capital structure is protecting against that. We do have largely a fixed rate capital structure but we do have a component of our debt that's term loan, that's adjustable rate. And so the way we think about that is the most effective way to manage our interest rate risk is where we see there's risk there that we might pay down that debt a bit faster. You saw that in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to operate in that regard. And obviously, we think about that in the construct of our overall capital priorities. Operator : Our next question is from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on 2023 revenue growth guidance of 2% to 3%. I think it's a lower overall starting point than I can recall in many years. I know your split says the assumption is no market growth, but the largest global distributor just guided to double the growth rate that you're describing. So for investors that take this to mean that your share gain premium is effectively lowering inherently in this guidance, which is notable as we're shifting away from PCs. Maybe you could, Chris, opine on that market share premium piece as we move into a different environment from a mix perspective, away from transactional and towards solutions and tie in to your observations that you saw during Q4. Thanks. Chris Leahy : Thanks, Adam. Let me just -- let me start with our guide, when our guide is coming versus when some of the other observations about the outlook for the market came out a month or 1.5 months ago. And the pivot that we've talked about in Q4, we started to see more dramatically end of November and into December. So that might be having an impact on how -- on the discrepancies that you're hearing. In terms of the 200 basis points to 300 basis points and the validity of the 200 basis points to 300 basis points, I think that question was the one you were asking, we still view that as our target go get. As we mentioned, Adam, and this might be what you're getting underneath. But as we mentioned, as we think about 2023 and the dynamics that we've seen in the fourth quarter of 2022, continuing into 2023, namely for us, stronger growth in cloud and Software-as-a-Service and security and more muted hardware sales. That does mean that our customer spend will be more meaningfully greater than the number, I think you gave a 2.5% figure. It will be meaningfully greater than that number. So we would look at that outperformance as 200 basis points to 300 basis points plus, if I could put it that way. Adam Tindle : Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up, Al, on the Q1 guidance. In years past, CDW would talk about seasonal being down high-single-digits sequentially, 7%, 8% down. Today you're guiding flat to low-single-digit growth sequentially. And as I think about the mix of the business, with Sirius being in there, I would think it would be even more seasonal to Q1 given the enterprise focus. So maybe just help me understand the change now to seasonality versus historically. Thank you. Al Miralles : Sure. Thanks, Adam. Look, the most notable thing I would just say is the Q4 was a very extreme period. And so as we look at Q1, you're right, seasonally, we would typically say there would be a contraction to Q1. And I guess what you should take from that is, while thematically, we'd still expect this mix into netted-down and lower transactional, maybe not as extreme as what we saw in Q4 and therefore, with some of that balancing out, we'd expect that we'd have modest growth on the top-line in the first quarter. And then again, a little more modest in terms of the gross margin. So just really kind of a bit of a dampening effect of the extremity that we saw in Q4. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand you back over to CDW for closing remarks. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Drew. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our 15,100 coworkers around the globe. Your ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for joining CDW fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. You may disconnect your lines.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company.  With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover today. I'll begin with an overview of our results and our outlook, and Al will provide a deeper view into the financials as well as an overview of our capital allocation priorities, and then we'll move right to your questions.  Market conditions were turbulent with a marked down shift in demand as the quarter progressed, translating into lower business volume. For the first quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, 16% lower than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $434 million, down 6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.03, down 8%. While clearly not satisfied with these results, our excellent cash flow and record gross margin reinforce the durability of our underlying profitability and integrity of our strategy. So, let's take a look at what happened in the puts and takes of the quarter. First, what happened? In short, demand was weaker than anticipated in our commercial business. When we exited 2022, our forecast called for a moderate softening of IT demand in 2023 and a mid-single-digit year-over-year decline in first quarter sales. As the quarter progressed, IT demand weakened more than expected as a confluence of events intensified already heightened economic concerns and recession fears.  This led to a fairly rapid shift in customer behavior, most notably in our large commercial customers. Projects that drove cost reduction, productivity, and financial returns were prioritized. Project justification and budget scrutiny ruled the day. And although deals were not canceled, sales cycles elongated, written sales slowed, and deal sizes compressed. While all of this translated into lower sales, the value of the solutions we provided customers continue to grow. You see the impact of this on our gross margin momentum. Margins were consistent with last quarter with meaningful year-over-year expansion in each of our customer end markets.  But unlike the fourth quarter, our strong margins did not fully offset the magnitude of our net sales decline. Let's take a look at the puts and takes of the quarter by customer end market. Recall, we have five sales channels : Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government, and Education, each a meaningful business on its own, with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, the teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. Our commercial operations are organized around geographies, verticals, and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales.  These unique customer end markets often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each as was the case this quarter. The shift in large commercial customer behavior had an outsized impact on corporate results with sales down 17% year-over-year. Declines were particularly steep in client devices, servers, and storage. Three meaningful hardware categories that require capital outlays, outlays under pressure, and out of favor. The corporate team's success helping customers achieve ongoing network and application modernization led to excellent NetComm performance. up double digits.  Momentum continued around projects focusing on increasing productivity and enhancing customer and coworkers' experiences, which drove strong growth in cloud and software spend. The small business team posted another quarter of solutions growth, driven by success helping customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity, priorities that drove meaningful increases in cloud and software customer spend on pace with recent quarters. Network upgrade activity also drove a high single-digit increase in NetComm with resilience in demand for solutions, the gross margin of the small business channel continued to be accretive to overall margins. Strong solutions performance was more than offset by the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty on transactions and small business net sales declined 23%.  Public sales declined 12%. Performance in government and healthcare held firm as organizations called on CDW to help them extract more value out of their IT footprints while education remained under pressure. Solutions momentum in health care was strong, driven by continued success helping customers adopt technology to drive productivity as an offset to higher costs from rising labor and materials inflation. Cloud performance was excellent, hesitancy over privacy concerns waned and healthcare systems embraced the speed and efficiency that cloud solutions can deliver. Talent needs and data center projects remain focused areas, with customers increasingly using technology to address complex industry challenges. Patient care and patient experience continue to be mission-critical, driving ongoing investment in collaboration solutions. However, similar to our commercial markets greater focus on shorter-term ROI and tight budgets resulted in elongated client devices replacement cycles and overall sales were flat. Government activity levels were strong. The credibility and track record of the combined and now fully integrated teams of legacy CDW and Sirius opened doors and led to more seats at the table. Since the first quarter is a seasonally light quarter for both federal and state and local spending, our progress is a bit harder to see. Federal's low-teens growth was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in state and local, and sales were flat to last year. Federal growth was balanced across solutions and transaction\u2019s categories. The team's ability to help civilian agencies achieve their priorities around data management drove strong server and storage performance and contributed to high single-digit growth in solutions. Services increased high-teens and Cloud spend remained strong. Underscoring the value of our diverse end markets, federal posted year-over-year transactions growth, which was driven by client, video and audio, and collaboration. State and local low single-digit growth in solutions reflected the team's success helping customers address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagements. Double-digit Cloud spend was driven by both software and security upgrades. Consistent with the fourth quarter, customers made do with their current client devices, and client device declines continued.  For education, solid higher-Ed growth was more than offset by the year-over-year declines in K-12 and overall sales declined 27%. The Higher-Ed sustained their track record of enabling student success programs used to promote enrollment. These programs, which are focused on improving security, campus connectivity, and delivering enhanced dorm room experiences drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, storage, software, and security. K-12 posted another quarter of excellent solutions performance. Solutions mid-teens increase was driven by networking and data center efforts with substantial double-digit increases in storage, servers, and NetComm. Our ability to wrap services around applications and physical security drove excellent services performance.  The K-12 team's solutions performance was more than offset by a meaningful year-over-year decline in client devices and overall sales declined. Similar to last year, customers placed a lower priority on client devices as schools reach student-to-device ratios near or at parity and continue to digest endpoint investments made over the past several years. Instead, schools were focused on networking and data center needs as well as planning for the next horizon of multi-funding -- multiyear funding opportunities. Opportunities, which, given the expertise that we have in this area will generate even more ways to serve this important customer channel.  Our U.K. and Canadian operations, which we report as other, continued to execute very well in the quarter, delivering consistent profit performance as customers prioritize strategic investments and solutions. Similar to the U.S., top-line growth for both markets experienced the impact of heightened economic uncertainty which especially impacted client device demand. U.K. decreased by mid-single digits in local currency, while Canada decreased by high single digits in local currency. Similar to the U.S., strong gross margins reflected a higher value mix. Now let's take a look at how the end market performance translated into portfolio performance. The economic uncertainty that led to the downshift in our commercial business impacted performance across all three of our portfolio categories : hardware, software, and services.  As a full stack full life cycle provider, the deferral of major hardware projects results in lower attach of services and other solutions. All the components of the deliverables are delayed, pending implementation of the project. Delays in pushbacks and hardware may dampen warranty and security opportunities and focus on in-year ROI often drives compressed deal sizes as many customers elected to favor short-term deals versus multiyear agreements. First quarter portfolio results were adversely impacted by all these cascading factors. U.S. hardware decreased by 21%, a further step down from the fourth quarter. Large commercial customer client device declines had the greatest category impact as corporations work through the impact of slower hiring and layoffs.  NetComm hardware growth was very strong in this quarter and increased across all customer end markets. This strong performance was largely driven by improvements in supply but also reflected better demand than we expected. U.S. services decreased to 2%. Growth was impacted by weakness in services tied to hardware, particularly in warranties.  Momentum in Managed Services growth was solid and professional services continue to grow, though was impacted by the delayed timing of full stack IT integration. U.S. software growth remains strong. Double-digit increases in network management software and storage sand were partially offset by declines in software categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels. Security remained a key focus area for customers, but results were impacted by the shift in large commercial customers' buying behavior and U.S. security sales declined slightly year-over-year. Significant growth in identity management, privileged access management, intrusion detection, and risk and government was offset by declines in firewall. Our largest category, which is also tied to either refresh of physical assets or expansion of customers' footprint. Overall, security demand remained very strong in small business. Once again, cloud was a meaningful contributor to performance with double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit, led by security, platform, and productivity. Within this period of economic uncertainty and heightened customer caution, our trust and engagement with customers and partners was never stronger, trust and engagement that when coupled with our capabilities and deep expertise, serves us well today and trust and engagement that will serve us well when the temporal shift in demand recovers. Although volumes are down, our ability to help our customers drive outcomes across the five components of our eye care framework, especially cost management right now, continues to drive our customer value. Our ability to drive outcomes and address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum enables us to pivot where our customers need us most.  Any ability that and that -- an ability that reflects the impact of strategic investments we have made to enhance our high relevance and high-growth solutions and services, investments that are exceeding our expectations in both capabilities and performance. Investments like our acquisition of Sirius have maximized our differentiation in the market, provided more and better seats at the table, increased customer stickiness, and contributed to our evolution as a one-stop trusted partner. A partner with the capabilities and expertise that can help customers achieve the outcomes they need from the technology and solutions they can trust. The strategic actions we've taken have not only strengthened our value proposition, they have also fortified our profitability, contributing to our operating profit margin expansion of more than 100-basis points since 2020.  It's our strategy when combined with our flexible business model, execution rigor and financial discipline that enables our ability to profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market, and that leads us to our view for the balance of 2023. The initial 2023 U.S. IT market forecast we shared with you on our February call was for flattish growth. Given our belief that first quarter business conditions will persist through at least the second quarter, we now look for the U.S. IT market to contract at high single-digit rate for the full year.  We continue to target outperformance of the U.S. IT market by 200-basis to 300-basis points. This outlook assumes that we will see a moderate pickup in activity in the back half of the year and anticipates that ongoing economic uncertainty will continue to impact customer behavior. Wildcards include deeper recessionary conditions, heightened credit tightness, and debt ceiling-driven liquidity events. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year.  We are operating in choppy waters right now. We have the strategy, capabilities, and discipline to continue to profitably outgrow the market. And while we have a durable process to manage and align cost to opportunity. Given our expectation for market demand, we have amplified our expense discipline to preserve profitability. A hallmark of CDW is to serve our customers whenever and wherever their needs may be. The outcomes technology delivers haven't diminished, and our customers know that we will be there for them regardless of market conditions. CDW is an all-weather team, always adapting and evolving to lead in the market. We have faced turbulent markets in the past and have leveraged our proven business model, unmatched competitive advantages and deep and trusted relationships to come out stronger. We will do so again.  Let me turn it over to Al now who will provide more detail on the financials and outlook. Al? Al Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail in the first quarter. Move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 7. Consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, down 14.2% on a reported basis and 15.6% on an average daily sales basis. Net sales results came in below expectations relative to our outlook. Transactions declined more than expected and despite greater resiliency and while flat year-over-year, Solutions also came in lower than anticipated. Notwithstanding the lower-than-expected solutions performance, the decline in transactions drove a mix shift that benefited margins. And as we've shift shared before, the impact of mixing into a higher relative percentage of solutions and specifically netted down revenue has a dampening effect on total net sales, but tends to bolster gross margins, all of equal.  Since we are not the primary obligor on these transactions, several important high-value components of our solutions portfolio, including Cloud, Software as a Service, much of security, and partner-delivered services and warranties are recorded on a netted down basis, where gross profit is our revenue. In the first quarter, these netted down revenues, and notably SaaS transactions outgrew our overall net sales and represented 32% of our gross profit compared to 31% in the fourth quarter and prior-year first quarter. This continues to be an important trend in our business. Sequential net sales were down 6.1% versus the fourth quarter on a reported basis and 7.6% on an average daily sales basis. Our outlook anticipated better than normal first quarter seasonality, given the unusually soft demand in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes public would have better than historical sequential growth, which it did. It also assumed our commercial channels, corporate and small business will remain firm and deliver close to historical sequential growth levels, they did not. The disconnect came from a downshift in large commercial customer spend, which had an adverse impact on our results. To dimensionalize the shortfall in net sales relative to our expectations, roughly two third of the amount was driven by large commercial customer activity across both transactional and solutions business. On the supply side, the dollar value of our backlog did not change meaningfully relative to the fourth quarter. And while the backlog and product lead times associated with transactional products are essentially back in line with normal levels, supply chain challenges have persisted in NetComm solutions and the backlog here remains elevated.  We continue to anticipate this remaining backlog will feather out over time as supply conditions ease. So, this has been more drawn out than anticipated. As always, we continue to judiciously manage our working capital to support our customers while ensuring strong economic returns. Our free cash flow performance which we'll discuss shortly is emblematic of this discipline. Our team delivered excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.1 billion, a year-over-year decrease of only 1%, despite a double-digit decline in sales. The gross profit margin was a first quarter record of 21.3%, up 280-basis points versus the prior year period and down only 40-basis points versus the record fourth quarter. The year-over-year expansion in gross profit margin was driven by similar factors as in the fourth quarter.  First, product margins benefited both mix into the complex, hybrid cloud solutions and a lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back index transactional products we expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, as we expected for the first quarter a greater mix in the netted down revenues. The category outpaced overall net sales growing low single digits in Q1 compared to Q1 in the prior year, primarily driven by double-digit Software as a Service growth; and third, net sales contribution from high-margin services mix with significant contribution from our recent acquisitions. Turning to SG&A on Slide 8. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $655 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher fixed payroll as our coworker count increased during last year. This was partially offset by a decline in sales payroll expense, reflecting the variable component of our compensation structure, which is principally tied to gross profit attainment. We expect the impact of the higher year-over-year fixed cost SG&A to diminish as we move through the year. To that end, we are focused on our efforts to innovate our operating model and drive productivity and savings. Given the demand environment, we've advanced initiatives to ensure our cost structure is aligned to our opportunity set. This includes driving structural savings as well as pacing our overall coworker count with the level of business demand and in the areas where we can provide the most value to our customers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was approximately 15,300 up slightly from the fourth quarter principally due to the most recent acquisition, which added to our technical resources in professional and managed services. Strategic investments in our solutions and services capabilities remain key to our three-part strategy for growth, an important catalyst for the achievement of our profitability and margin goals. GAAP operating income was $355 million, down $32 million compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $434 million, down $28 million versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income margin was strong at 8.5%, up 70-basis points from the prior year, although down 110-basis points compared to the record fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter, this year-over-year improvement was driven by our strong gross margin. The sequential decline reflected a higher ratio of fixed costs as a result of the lower volume of net sales and gross profit.  Moving to Slide 9. Interest expense was $58 million modestly above the prior year, driven by higher interest rates, but relatively in line with our expectation for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 10 was 22.3%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $66 million. Together non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.7%, within our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5%. As you can see on Slide 12, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.68. Our non-GAAP net income was $279 million in the quarter, down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.03, down 7.9%. Moving ahead to Slide 13, period-end Cash and cash equivalents were $279 million and net debt was $5.5 billion. During the quarter, we reduced our overall debt by almost $130 million, consistent with our plan to maintain our net leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.3 billion.  Moving to Slide 14. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down three days from the fourth quarter, two days from the prior year first quarter, and within our targeted range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $411 million, as shown on Slide 15. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 and capital allocation objectives, including returning $80 million to shareholders through dividends and $200 million in share repurchases in addition to the $130 million in debt repayment. We also closed the acquisition of Locus recruiting in February.  That brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 16. Our execution remained consistent with the updated objectives we communicated last quarter. First, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. This increase demonstrated our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business. Going forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the first quarter at 2.6 times, flat to the end of the fourth quarter and within our new range of 2 times to 3 times.  We continue to convert business performance into cash generation and have a rigorous process in place to maintain our flexibility and proactively manage liquidity. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities is M&A and share repurchase have remained important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we'll continue to target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned roughly 68%. As a reminder, the Board authorized a $750 million increase to the company's share repurchase program last quarter on top of the remaining dollars from the prior authorization.  Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 17. The current overall IT market sentiment reflects the caution and prudence of customers. We expect this to continue in the near term with a modest recovery of demand conditions in the second half of the year. This informs our expectation that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. With this scenario as our baseline, we look for netted down revenues to continue to grow faster than our other product and solution categories. And we maintain our long-held expectation to outgrow the market by 200-basis to 300-basis points. Keeping in mind that in times of hardware softness, our overperformance tends to be on the lower end of this range and vice versa.  We continue to expect a neutral currency impact for the full year, with modest headwinds in the first half and modest tailwinds in the second half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be within the range of 9%. This reflects the expectation of lower net sales and gross profit, balanced with higher gross margins and a reduction in the level of our fixed expenses.  Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings to decline low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. Related to average daily sales, we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. That equates to a low double-digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline from the second quarter. We anticipate continued strong margin performance in the second quarter with a gross profit margin consistent with levels in Q1 and NGOI margin higher as expense efforts improve operating leverage. And we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to decline mid-single digits year-over-year. In 2023, we expect full-year free cash flow to be at the high end of our new rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales as we continue to emphasize a return on working capital. While we are clearly operating in a cautious and uncertain environment, given our resilient business model, the rigor of our financial controls, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the profitability margin and cash flow, our stakeholders have come to expect. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to start with, Chris, one the concerns I think folks have had is how much of the issues that you saw in the March quarter are macro versus micro really CDW-specific and I think all the reasons you really mentioned sounds like it's a much more broader trend rather than CDW's success, but I'd love to hear, do you think there's any company specific that may have impacted or magnified these issues. And then any change in trends you're seeing for the month of April so far versus what you saw in March? Chris Leahy : Yes. Good morning, Amit. Well, let me just take you through and unpack it a little bit. look, the key driver, the overwhelming driver of the performance miss to our expectation was the sharp uptick in concern and caution that we saw with our commercial customers as economic uncertainty intensified through the quarter and the meaningful downshift in customer demand, particularly amongst our large commercial customers as a result. And that translated into an outsized impact on results given the relative size of our commercial business. If I dig a little deeper, look, when our customers got cautious and exhibited a lot of concern, they went into decisions around deferring and pausing and reducing costs generally, which is a playbook for larger customers. And that brought greater scrutiny to projects that brought a focus on shorter-term ROI that brought a focus on overarching cost reductions, all of which created longer sales cycles and shorter duration contracts. I would say we didn't see cancellations, what we saw were delays in smaller deals and the knock-on effects of that. So as a full stack, full life cycle provider, there's a cascading impact across hardware, software, and services. right? So, if you've got large delays in deals, then you have less attach of services and other solutions at that point in time. And when you think about commercial representing more than 50% of our business, the impact just created a major headwind for our top line sales.  Now I would say as you go through the rest of the portfolio, the balanced portfolio of customer end markets did help. But particularly given the extreme softness in the client device market, generally, it didn't help as much as we would have liked. So, when you think about government high Ed and health care, they all performed well but did have some growth challenges, again, due to client international executed well, K-12 executed well in solutions, but they certainly had continuing year-over-year pressures and didn't quite perform in the client area as well as we thought they might.  And so, as a result, the top line was impacted. The other thing I would just unpack for you a little bit is if you go through the portfolio itself, NetComm was strong across the board. Software was strong across the board. Cloud growth remains strong. Services in the areas where we focus strategically, professional, and managed services were strong and solid. We had a little -- we had some impact on services relative to warranties that were softer. But up and down and across the portfolio, we felt very good about execution is really, in our view, is a macro impact. And look -- and you look in terms of profit, contrary to Q4, record first quarter margins weren't enough to offset the magnitude of the shortfall but we did have record first quarter margins and excellent free cash flow. So, I would say that the team is performing well in a really challenging environment. And our cash flow and margins are really demonstrating that the strategy is working as our investments are contributing to enhanced profitability. The other thing I'd say on it, and you've seen this over the years is in periods of uncertainty, we further strengthen the trust and engagement with our customers. We've been through turbulent times before, and these are the times when our customers turn to us and our partners turn to us to address their challenges. And they know we're there for them, regardless of the conditions in the market, and they know that when the temporal shift in demand lifts, we'll be there for them. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. And Chris, can I just follow up on that last part which you were talking about. I think historically, what I mean you see as you come out of these positives or recession or whatever happens in the next six months, you tend to see an inflection of share gains going higher for CDW. So, I'm wondering, I guess, maybe you could touch on what do you think the duration of this path could look like? And do you think you're well positioned to see an acceleration in share gain as you come out of it, given the engagement you have with your customers? Chris Leahy : Yes. Amit, I would say, in these times, you can imagine what we're doing, controlling what we can control, staying in front of our customers, playing aggressive offense, and really doubling down on the relationship. And that always bodes us well. We like to say accelerating out of the curve is what we do, and that's what we would expect. In terms of the timing, look, hard for any of us, I think, to predict the timing of client devices significantly turning around, for example. But we do feel absolutely confident that as demand shifts that we will be very well positioned to capture more than our fair share of the uplift. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Amit. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the color today in your prepared remarks. I was just wondering, just starting off with the 2Q guide here for a mid-single-digit sales growth expectation -- now I understand that's not as robust as what you used to see pre-pandemic. But in terms of what's driving the confidence of sort of guiding to a growth into 2Q? And should we expect sort of that growth to continue to and 4Q?  Is that sort of how you're thinking about customer activity starting to sort of return and spending start to improve? And just sort of what's baked into the second half, particularly in terms of your client device expectations? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. Al Miralles : Yes. Good morning, Samik, this is Al. So, with respect to Q2, I think what you're seeing from our outlook is, again, both expectation that the overall conditions and customer buying behavior would be similar and particularly in commercial that is softer with an offset that, we'd expect that regular seasonality, particularly from our public business. would be in play. So, the lift there largely from that seasonality from public with a bit of a muting from our typical seasonality given the softer conditions otherwise. Now with respect to your question on the second half, so the second half, similar, we would expect we'd have our normal seasonality, including our government business and public having higher seasonality in Q3. And while obviously, we've got extreme conditions we've seen the last couple of quarters, we would anticipate at this point, a pickup in activity. Now that pickup in activity will say kind of balance between clients and solutions. And it's a little bit of a TBD exactly when you'd see client pick up, but there's a reason to believe that we'd see some of that activity in the back half of the year. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Got it. And my follow-up, just maybe if we can -- if I can ask you to double click on the NetComm product momentum or the momentum in -- within your portfolio seems to be an outlier related to what you're seeing otherwise in the other parts of the portfolio. Any color on what's driving your customers to still continue to spend on NetComm. Obviously, it's not been -- it's been supply challenge, but not really demand challenge even for the last couple of years. So, what's driving that momentum there still? Chris Leahy : Samik, it's Chris. And I'd say a couple of things driving the NetComm momentum. One is network momentum. One is supply chain. Obviously, we've got some relief in the backlog, which has been good. But we are seeing demand and when you think about our customers modernizing their infrastructure and the cloud performance that you're seeing, we do have customers who are moving to the cloud, using networking to handle larger and heavier workloads.  We do see customers like our K-12, I mentioned earlier. They're hard at work on classroom upgrades and modernization. When you also think about the trend towards back to the office and in the commercial space, notwithstanding the fact that these large corporate customers are in cost reduction mode. They are focusing on digital transformation and experiences of their own coworkers and their employees and networking is a very important part of that, obviously, as the data center and networking drive the connectivity out to the employees and to the customers. So, it's not surprising given the amount of client investment that's been made over the past few years, usually ingesting client devices actually requires upgrading networking, and that's what we're seeing. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse. Shannon your line is now open. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you, very much and good morning. I'm wondering what your customers are saying about artificial intelligence. And I think you have a pretty unique position, I guess, in terms of your, our diverse customer base and ability to talk to them. And I'm just wondering where are they at in their AI journey? Where are they thinking that they're going to be investing as they look to AI? Anything you can give us would be helpful. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes, Shannon, it's a great question. You're right. There's nobody who's not talking about it. And everybody is talking about it a lot. The good news for CDW is right now, it's moving fast, and it's complex. And there are a lot of work to be done around how the kind of new form of AI can support customers. So, what our customers are saying is frankly, they're saying our CEO says we really need to be all over this. And I say that because there's pressure on the system, which means -- which is always good for CDW because the conversations that we're having around AI and general AI are right now. We're at the front of the design with our customers.  And here's how we think about it. Obviously, we think about it internally for CDW, but as importantly, for our customers. So, A we've always helped our customers unlock the potential of technology to meet whatever the needs are for their current and future business, okay? When we think about AI and what we offer our customers, it fits really nicely into the full stack full life cycle, full outcome approach. And what we're trying to do with customers is they're thinking about what the use cases could be going forward. Those are things, as, like workflows to build innovative products or improving efficiencies in the case in their existing workflows, things that we've all been talking about. What do they need from CDW and how can we help them. A it's identifying those use cases and building them out and supporting them up and down the stack, think professional services, right? Think applications and building B2B applications, think computing and data infrastructure need a whole new kind of infrastructure to support what AI is driving and think models and tooling.  So, our digital velocity team that practice actually already orchestrates AI initiatives with many customers today, and they're having deeper conversations. But I would just say, look, we're at the forefront of this. There is a lot to be worked out. But it is definitely one of those trends that is -- the hype is real in this case. There is going to be a fast and growing market that AI is going to drive, and it fits really nicely within our full stack solution. And so, we're having lots of conversations with customers. And we're doing the same internally. Look, we're looking at all the ways that we can use the new AI to basically drive efficiency within our organization. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you. And then just -- you're at the high end of cash flow for the year. We're about two years, while not quite, but years past the Sirius acquisition. So, what are your current thoughts on acquisitions, what do you see in the landscape like? Are prices coming down or valuations coming down at this point? Or are people still thinking over or a couple of years back and valuations are high? Chris Leahy : It's really interesting because I would say valuations have not ticked down significantly. Although the pipeline and the outreach has increased. So that tells you something what the landscape might look like three to four months from now. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Erik your line is now open. Please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Thank you, so much. Good morning, guys. Chris, maybe I'll ask you a question. I appreciate all the color you provided by end market and product. And clearly, there's a lot of moving pieces. I guess if we step back and think about your product exposure and think about what you reported relative to how you guided in February. Can you just understand which products are kind of most responsible for the guide down or maybe for the miss in 1Q and then for the guide down for the rest of 2023? Just trying to understand kind of what is incrementally weaker as we moved through March and into April? And how -- which products are impacting that guide the most? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Chris Leahy : Yes, sure. Good morning, Erik. Well, let me start with the client device -- let me just start with hardware and client devices because that really was the core of the impact. And again, primarily are the largest impact came from our larger commercial customers. So, number one, on the client side, we continue to see, the market generally has got kind of an extreme -- is an extreme softness right now and that continues. Okay. So that had an impact. And we saw in the client space moderating either -- even further down as we progress throughout the quarter. And you continue to see staff reductions across every industry. And those things are impacting client device purchases.  And I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the large commercial customers client device category was the biggest down shift in the corporate space. So, client device is number one. Server storage, hardware, things that are customers are looking at, and finding ways to save money. That's another source of the down shift. And what happens when you've got hardware either being refreshed not refreshed delayed or paused if you have a knock-on effect. It's like a cascading effect. So, if projects are delayed, the services that go with the project obviously aren't implemented some of them until the integration of the product. You also have things like warranty that are going to be a bigger impact to warranty when you're not buying hardware. So, if I come back to the categories, I'd say it all starts with large customers reducing their costs immediately, which means let's reduce hardware, let's extend the useful life of assets. When we're purchasing software, for example, we can purchase a one-year deal instead of a three-year deal. They're pausing on making decisions on things because they don't want to get locked in. But it does start with the areas of hardware. And then where we saw softness in places that I would say are very strategic for us, that really was, again, an effect of the delay or deferral of larger projects. I would say, overall, look, our services business is very strong in the areas that are strategic. If you take out warranties, professional services, managed services, strong, yet impacted security, strong in the areas that we've been investing heavily in weaker in firewalls, which are related primarily to the, when you're buying physical assets or extending your geographic footprint.  And then cloud. I mean cloud is continuing to be extremely robust across every one of our customer segments. So, I'm trying to dig into the weeds a little bit here for you, and I hope I'm getting to the heart of your question. but it's starting with the climate. I mean that's really what happened, starting with the climate and climate of cost containment. Erik Woodring : No, that was exactly what I was looking for. And then maybe my follow-up. We've gotten a lot of questions about CDW's definition of U.S. IT market growth versus how other companies might portray it. And Obviously, there is an impact of netted down revenue mix that it would be helpful to maybe understand. But said differently, if U.S. IT market growth in CDW is down high single digit year-over-year, how would you think about your overall customer spending to trend in 2023? I think that would be helpful just again, because there is an impact of this netted down revenue that dampens the view of your U.S. IT market growth. So, I just want to unpackage that, please. Thank you. Al Miralles : Yes, Eric, let me take that. This is Al. So just a couple of things. You're definitely right with respect to netted down revenues and the impact from that. The other component is obviously you have a mix component. If you think about the broader IT market relative to our mix, there is a translation, if you will. I think most notably, in normalized years that does not create significant distortion in a year like this where the mix has shifted significantly. That is client coming down considerably and more solutions and netted down revenues being up. It does create more exaggerated results.  So, what I would tell you is if you think about our full year guide with respect to the IT market, it is high single digits decline, if we think about that on a gross spend basis, Obviously, that would be more muted than that decline. Does that help you? Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam your line is now open. Please go ahead. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thanks, good morning. Al, I hate to be the one to question guidance again, but it's a question that we're getting a lot here this morning. Q2 is obviously very clear, so I appreciate all the details, but more on the shape of the back half of this year embedded in your guidance? And if I look last year, you guided Q3 to low single-digit sequential growth. And if I applied that here, it would imply a really big hockey stick in Q4. Conversely, if Q3 was above that level, it's implying a bigger Fed quarter, but we've got debt ceiling concerns causing a potential Fed slowdown in that quarter. So, a little bit of a double-edged sword. And just wondering if there's any way we could be thinking about waiting in the back half because there's a fear that this might not be the last cut. Al Miralles : Yes. Sure, Adam. Happy to address that. So, on the back half, first of all, let me just say the, our expectation that Q2 would look a lot like Q1 obviously informs then the seasonality for the rest of the year, right, because we would apply our typical seasonality. Q3 definitely reflects, I'll call it, reasonably normal public seasonality. And so, you have that in play. Look, the comps, frankly, for Q3 are much tougher than Q4. Q4 was really the first time that we felt the effect of softening and particularly in client. And so, I think Q3 probably looks a little bit more normalized from a seasonality perspective. And then Q4, I'll call it more of the pickup there, particularly given the lower comps that we saw there with education and with client. Adam Tindle : Okay. Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, Chris, I'll ask a higher level one. You often talked about the CDW story and culture as a differentiator, in particular, for the company. leads to your ability to outperform the IT market consistently and profitably. Here most recently, you have made a tough decision to reduce coworker count. So, I'm just wondering how you thought about that decision to implement layoffs essentially in efforts that you made to try and preserve culture. And Al, if you wanted to maybe talk more quantitatively about how you're able to maintain expectations to outperform the market by 200-basis to 300-basis points while reducing workforce with your sales productivity expectations look like post that would be helpful. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes, Adam, it's a great question as well. And as you can imagine, we approached a decision like that with great care and respect. And I'll tell you, look, we have been -- we are operating discipline -- cost discipline is something that is evergreen. We are always focused on finding productivity and efficiencies. It's just how we operate. as we've been in a cautious environment, we've been very prudent and I think proactive in calling our costs and calibrating to the environment. which, as we've mentioned in Q1, really, we got a pickup in intensity of the economic uncertainty. And so, we went into high gear in terms of our prudence. And what we've done is really pull every lever we can pull to align our current cost structure with the demand that we're seeing. And when I say every lever, I mean all the things you would imagine, discretionary spend, hiring, promotion, staffing, geographic locations, et cetera. And one of the decisions we had to make was to adjust our staffing to current demand environment. Now look, these are really hard decisions. I'm proud of the team and how they put it together and how we communicated it. And everybody was very respectful. Now all that said, the teams have -- are looking forward because that's what the organization needs to do. We're pivoting to the future. and focused really heavily on our customers. But you're right, it was a tough decision but the right decision for the business and for the customers ultimately. Al Miralles : Adam, I'll just add a couple of comments to your questions on productivity and hitting on our goals, if you will. So, to Chris' point, look, this was not a reaction. We had been pacing our hiring and our coworker count and our discretionary spend in the quarter is building up. Obviously, we saw a sharp turn in Q1, and we expect some of that to persist.  We had structural efforts, activities in place to drive productivity and savings, and we basically just amplified those efforts. So, let me just parse it for you when we think about kind of allocation of our coworkers, first from a revenue-producing GP and going through something like this, we're looking at where are the areas and the practice areas that the demand vectors are stronger and we should allocate more resources and where areas where maybe that demand could be softer for a more prolonged period. And so that was part of the calculus in going through that. And then when we think about kind of more of the support layer and the infrastructure, again, we got structural initiatives, but we also expect that we're going to drive productivity, coworker savings from that. And so, there are all the things that went into this decision and these actions. And we believe while difficult, obviously, to go through, ultimately, we'll add the greatest value for our customers. and obviously, improve efficiency. Adam Tindle : Understood. Thank you, very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Matt your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Thank you, and good morning. I have a question on your cloud-related revenue, which continues to be strong. there are some concerns that large customers are now digesting their cloud investments and looking to optimize those investments. Are you seeing any signs of that? Or do you expect continued strength as customers elect to move workloads off-prem instead of refreshing their own data centers? Chris Leahy : Matt, it's Chris. I'd say both actually. We're seeing large customers who are optimizing for sure, particularly in this environment of cost optimization and reduction opportunity for CDW with our professional services and our FINOP services and things that we can offer to our customers to help them do exactly that and then potentially convert that into managed services going forward. But equally, we are seeing organizations that are kind of optimizing their cloud environment, not just workloads on the cloud, but the cloud environment and continuing to make decisions about where workloads are best optimized, whether it's on-prem whether it's -- now we're moving towards private on-prem, but where that should sit in multi-cloud public arena as well, so moving workloads potentially from one public cloud to another public cloud, again, for optimizing either for performance, functionality, costs, et cetera. All of this requires health from CDW to design the movements to actually do the migrations. And as I said, ultimately, we're seeing more and more opportunity to convert some of this into managed services, cloud managed services, which, of course, is a is a positive thing for us and for our customers. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thanks for that. And I had a question regarding your comments on maintenance contracts, which I -- which appears to be weak. In my past experience with CDW in down cycles, you've actually seen an increase in maintenance contracts and renewals as customers look to so-called sweat your assets longer. What's different this time? Or am I missing something? Chris Leahy : No, no, you're not. It's a great question. We asked the question earlier. What's different? What's different is we do see when folks are sweating assets, they are extending warranties typically, they're extending them for short periods. So, at a time when you would typically see a hardware renewal with a three-year contract, for example, warranties are coming in at shorter time periods. We also have some folks who are making the decision not to extend warranties. So, we're just seeing softening across the board there. And what we don't have is the offset of hardware purchases elsewhere, software purchases elsewhere, we're seeing new warranties come into play. So, it's a bit of a while you'd expect warranties to have an uptick because people are -- our customers are extending the useful life of their assets. The size of those warranties, the deals are smaller so it's muting the impact of the top line. Al Miralles : And Matt, maybe just let me add just a couple of comments. Number one is just recall that warranty business shows up as netted down revenues. For us, the recognition is upfront. And so therefore, if we have a typical four-year warranty, that turns into a one year, obviously, the recognition and the result for us obviously becomes muted. The other element I would just add here and look, maybe somewhat obvious is just the -- some of this focus on shorter ROI and the financial impacts therein are creating more conversations that will come back around with customers. That is the -- there's a sweating assets, but an expectation that, that business will come back around, both in terms of refreshing some of the infrastructure and some of the clients, but as well as, in some cases, renewals of software assurance software and warranties that we're seeing in a little bit shorter duration here. Chris Leahy : And I would just add to what Al said, I think it's an important point. The delays, the pauses, the deferrals that we're seeing is really just that. We haven't seen the cancellation. So, all of this really reflects itself in pipeline in the future. And so that's a positive sign. Matt Sheerin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith your line is now open. Please go ahead. Keith Housum : I know we're running late, always get the one in here. I know client devices have been very important for you guys. And as you look out going forward, I think it was as early as last quarter, you guys were talking about perhaps a return of client devices. I'm assuming that thought process has changed a little bit. And as you think about client devices, in particular, is there a period for which you can no longer sweat these assets? Is it a few quarters it goes out to a few years? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Good morning, Keith, it's Chris. I think I understood your question was around kind of when assets have to be replaced? Was that the question? I just want to make sure I was getting the question right. Keith Housum : Yes. I think PCs have been under -- particularly have been under pressure and the thought process was that in the second half of the year, you might see some recovery. I'm assuming one that's not the same assumption anymore. And then two, like PCs or client devices, when they are sweated. Is there a period of time that you can no longer sweat them forward and you really have to make the investment regardless? Chris Leahy : Yes. Okay. I got the question. It's a good question. I'd say, look, when it comes to PCs, the PC themselves can go foru years, five years. I'd say four, five, 5.5 years. that's not ideal because the feature functionality gets to be very old by that point in time. But if customers are really sweating the assets because they're in a financial situation needs to do so, it can go that long. All that said, if you look back over the last four years to five years, you're going to see a number of PC refresh requirements that are coming up.  And I'd add that you have things like win 11, which is going to add more pressure to those device refreshes. So, we've said this before, we do expect a refresh cycles to be starting sooner rather than later, whether it's federal government when we know when they're buying cycle is, whether it's Chromebooks. I mean, we're seeing a number of large RFPs related to Chromebooks for our education students already. So, our expectation is refreshes are going to be under pressure to begin later in the year into 2024. And when they do, we'll reap the benefit of that. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Chris, in the past, in a downturn, corporate and small business typically decline first, followed later by government and other public sector channels. Revenues from government and health care looks like in 1Q were slightly up year-on-year. Are you seeing any weakness in those sectors? And are you concerned at all about those end markets? And what have you factored in for the full year for those end markets? And I have a follow-up. Chris Leahy : Okay. Good morning, Ruplu. In terms of federal and health care, the countercyclicality that you pointed to, we're a bit in the reverse of that, actually. We had some softness in the public space going back a bit. And what we're seeing now is public, federal, in particular, we're seeing strong activity, I'd say, getting back to our normal seasonality and stronger activity as we run into the back half of the year. In fact, their performance this quarter was quite balanced across transactions and solutions. So, we're not seeing any issues there that we're concerned about and expect normal seasonality in the back half of the year. Health care is another one. It's been a pretty good balance across transactions and solutions, a little tougher in the client space but health care is really doing well. Given the increases in costs and wage inflation and everything they're experiencing, they're needing more help on technology and people help as well.  So, we're actually seeing our value proposition with our health care customers accelerate in many ways, and you add our Sirius team into the mix here. And as I said before, it opens doors and gets more seats at the table. Health care is also equally feeling very robust. So, we don't have concerns of either of those end markets going into the end of the year. Al Miralles : And maybe Ruplu, just one component I'd add there is just the -- just remember, one of the big drivers always is funding. And we would say, from a funding perspective, both government and education, we're at a reasonable level there. So, we think that there certainly is the impetus and catalyst there for continued spending. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for the details. Can I just ask, Chris, why is high single digits year-on-year, the correct number for U.S. IT market growth? I mean, why not down double digits or down even mid-single digits. I mean, just if you could give a little bit more color on what you're assuming for data center products like server, storage, networking growth versus PC growth? And how much of the backlog that you have factors into your particular revenue growth of down mid-single digits year-over-year in 2023? Thank you. Al Miralles : Let me just maybe Ruplu, start on the backlog. So, backlog, not a meaningful contributor in our expectations I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that NetComm continues to be a sticking point. We would expect that to feather out. It's taken longer, but we would not consider that to be a meaningful contribution for the remainder of the year. So. Chris Leahy : Yes, Ruplu. I would add -- look, let me just start with how we shape our view of the IT market, and it's substantially grounded in 11,000 customer-facing coworkers who are in market every day. And so there -- they've got the pulse of what's going on in the market and what customers are doing, saying and feeling. And while we have a number of market factors that we look at and analyze that the customer pulse is the most relevant one that we consider.  So, I'd just say that's 1 thing that we are looking at. And then we're factoring in as we think about the year, the caution and concern that we've already mentioned that, that will continue at least in the short run, and we've reflected that in our Q2 outlook. And then expecting some moderation in the back end, some moderating recovery in the back end. So, all of that combined is a reflection of, as I said, what we're seeing in the market, the current activity in terms of written demand, in terms of back order, in terms of all of the things that we triangulate. And frankly, that's just -- that's where we end up. because of what we're seeing because of seasonality. We've already kind of gone through Q2. It's going to feel about the same as Q1, right?  We'll get a little bump in seasonality, but that will be muted as Al mentioned earlier. And when you think about the back half of the year, what we have benefiting us there is seasonality from our government business, for example, and education running into the third quarter. And we also have lower overlaps, compares are easier in the last quarter. So, all of those things combined, you put them together, and that's just -- that's where we end up. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for the details, appreciated. Chris Leahy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I'll hand back to the CDW team for any further remarks. Chris Leahy : All right. Well, thank you very much. Let me close by reemphasizing my confidence in this team in our strategy and the durability of our resilient business model. Thank you to our CDW coworkers across the globe for your unwavering commitment to our customers. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. And Al and I look forward to seeing you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call as usual with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and our views on the second half of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our team executed extremely well in a market facing persistent challenges. As expected, commercial top line remained under pressure and public returned to more normal seasonality. For the quarter, the team delivered net sales of $5.6 billion, down 9% in U.S. dollars, down 8% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income of $530 million was up 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.56 was up 3%. These results demonstrate the power of our resilient business model when coupled with our broad and deep portfolio of technology solutions. In an ongoing period of economic uncertainty, our ability to drive outcomes and address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum enabled the team to pivot to where our customers need us most. An ability that reflects the impact of strategic investments we have made to enhance our high relevance and high growth solutions and services. While transactional business remained under pressure, increases in solutions contributed to meaningful margin expansion. Margin expansion that together with ongoing expense discipline, delivered strong profitability. Let's take a look at this quarter's key performance drivers. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Each of our five sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education is a meaningful business on its own, with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act counter cyclically given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each. Our second quarter results provide an excellent example of this. Economic uncertainty continued to weigh on the commercial market and both our corporate and small business results reflected ongoing cautious customer behavior, caution that once again drove elongated sales cycles, smaller deal sizes and greater focus on mission critical projects. Caution that also drove customer focus on short-term ROI with both corporate and small business posting double digit increases in cloud spend. For corporate overall sales declined 16%. Mission critical projects continue to move forward and slowly ticked up throughout the quarter. Large commercial customer spending sequentially improved. Continued postponement of upgrades and utilization of existing product resulted in a double digit decline in client devices. Well, we remain cautious on the outlook for client devices. Corporate delivered its first sequential volume increase in the past four quarters providing some indication of demand stability. Notably, client device ASP's held buoyed by mix into higher value, higher functionality units. Momentum around projects focused on increased productivity and enhanced customer and coworker experiences and that drove excellent growth in cloud spend. Implementation of network modernization projects delivered double digit Netcom growth. Small business declined 21%, reflecting the impact of ongoing caution by economically sensitive customers. Client devices continued to decline, with upgrades on hold pending greater clarity around the economy and employment. Focus on mission critical priorities around security and efficiency drove double digit customer spend increases in both cloud and software. Public performance partially mitigated commercial market pressure and was seasonally higher than the first quarter. Sales increased 2% year-over-year with strong performance in government, another quarter of stable performance in healthcare and an upturn in education. Government increased 12% and continued to benefit from strategic efforts to target complex services enabled hybrid infrastructure and cloud opportunities. Federal delivered double digit growth in the quarter, largely driven by the team's ability to help agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This delivered excellent net common storage performance. Legacy Sirius relationships contributed to significant growth in services. The state and local team also delivered double digit growth. Excellent services performance reflected the team's success, helping state and local municipalities address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagement. Cloud adoption drove strong software and security performance. Healthcare performance was relatively flat. Talent needs and data center projects remained focus areas as customers increasingly leveraged technology to address complex industry challenges. Customer hesitancy around cloud continued to dissipate and adoption increased meaningfully in the quarter. Client devices remained under pressure given ongoing customer focus on mission critical projects that deliver short-term return on investment. etcom,: Client devices were flat as the volume decline was offset by mix into higher value units which drove strong ASP performance. For K12, the team continued their success executing on infrastructure opportunities and delivered excellent growth in services netcom and storage. This quarter, the team also delivered a sequential improvement in client devices. As you know, the summer season represents the height of K12 buying. With our June 30 quarter end, we occasionally see anticipated summer sales hit the end of the second quarter. We experienced this in the quarter with anticipated back half refresh driving a significant sequential improvement. Refresh driven by aging devices and higher than historical breakage rates given more students take their devices off campus. Other, our combined UK and Canada business declined 7%. Similar to the U.S., each team continued to execute well and sustained profitability improvements under challenging conditions. UK posted a low single digit decline in local currency, while Canada declined by low double digits. We're seeing growing customer caution in both the UK and Canada, similar to what we heard from U.S. commercial customers a quarter ago. As you can see, the diversity of end market growth this quarter demonstrates the benefit of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Category performance demonstrates the benefit of our second performance driver, our broad and deep portfolio of products and solutions, which enables the team to pivot and support customers wherever needed. Ongoing economic uncertainty in the commercial space continued to have an outsized impact on both transactions and solutions. While the rate of decline moderated, transactions were down double digits. Solutions performance improved with mid-single digit growth versus flat performance in the first quarter. Similar to the first quarter, all three of our portfolio categories, hardware, software and services were impacted by commercial pressure with deferral of major hardware projects resulting in lower volumes in services and solutions. Hardware decreased 11% year-on-year. Client device performance in the commercial space significantly impacted hardware performance and corporate continued to have the greatest category impact. Netcom had an exceptional quarter, posting meaningful increases across all customer end markets. This strong performance was largely driven by improvements in supply and continued work on customer's network modernization projects. Services were relatively flat year-on-year. Growth varied widely with strength tied to channel specific customer priorities, offset by services attached to transactional and solutions hardware. Professional services were solid and while managed services activity was solid, given extended sales cycles and ratable revenue streams, the impact on net sales was minimal. Software customer span increased by mid-single digits driven by mix into software-as-a-service. Double digit increases in network management software and database software were offset by continued declines in software categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels and net sales decreased at a mid-single digit rate. Security remained a key focus area for customers with spend up single digits. Top growth categories included endpoint security, e-mail security, identity management and physical security. Security associated with growth and business expansion remained challenged. Once again, cloud was an important driver of performance across the business contributing meaningfully gross profit. Productivity, infrastructure-as-a-service and security were the top three workloads in the quarter. Each of our customer end markets posted double digit increases in cloud, customer spend and gross profit. Profitable growth that was enabled by the strategic investments both organic and acquired that we've made in cloud capabilities over the past 10 years, capabilities that enable us to deliver for our customers and our stakeholders. And this leads to the final driver, our performance in the quarter, our three-part strategy for growth which is to first acquire new customers and capture share, second enhance our solutions capabilities and third expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Our investment in data analytics is a great example of this strategy and action. Like many of our strategic investments, data analytics delivers value across all three pillars. Our data analytics capabilities are underpinned by the intimate knowledge we have about our customers, knowledge earned through deep and long lasting relationships which range on average over 12 years. They are also underpinned by our broad and comprehensive product portfolio, which provides extensive historical information about buying patterns across industries and verticals. This proprietary customer and product knowledge powers our data analytics that helps create robust and data-driven predictive models, models that identify customer needs and create personalized and targeted outreach to drive tailored services, products and solutions, solutions that help our customers accelerate their strategies and achieve their missions. We continue to invest in the breadth and performance of these models utilizing machine learning and other advanced analytics techniques and have produced tangible lift in sales conversion and market relevancy. Clearly our investments in data analytics are delivering for CDW. They are also delivering for our customers. Today we have significant data analytics expertise across server, database, model construction and training, expertise that delivers outcomes in our ICARE framework, particularly in the areas of innovation, agility and experience, expertise that bolsters our consultative professional services capabilities including our AI consulting practice. For CDW, AI adoption feels very much like other transformative technologies of the past. Customers recognize the evolutionary benefits of AI, yet they face incredible complexity and choice, complexity and choice that plays to our strengths and our value proposition as a trusted partner and advisor. And just as we have in the past, we have made and will continue to make the investments necessary to ensure we are ready, ready to lead the market and ready to help our customers maximize the return on their AI investments, another excellent example of how we strategically invest for today and the future. And that leads me to the expectations for the balance of the year. You'll recall on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for the U.S. IT market to post a decline of high single digits in 2023. This assumed a moderate improvement in the commercial environment in the back half of the year and a return to normal seasonality in the public space. To date, the demand environment has been consistent with our expectations and our view of the U.S. IT market remains unchanged. Within this environment, we continue to target outperforming the U.S. IT market by 200 to 300 basis points on an organic constant currency basis. Wildcards remain the macro environment, further tightening of credit and the potential for federal government budget disruptions. And as we always do, we'll provide an updated perspective on business conditions as we move through the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out execute the competition. We will also continue to judiciously invest to ensure we are there for our customers so they can achieve their mission critical outcomes today and in the future. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro or end market specific challenges, a strategy designed to ensure we remain our customers partner of choice and most importantly, a strategy that enables us to continue to deliver excellent cash flows and profitably outgrow the market. With that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more details on our financial performance. Al? Albert Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 7, consolidated net sales were $5.6 billion, down 8.5% on a reported and average daily sales basis. Second quarter net sales were up 10.2% versus the first quarter on a reported and average daily sales basis, ahead of our outlook which had anticipated a mid-single digit seasonal increase. Broadly speaking, our expectation held that the first quarter's uncertain macro environment would persist with our commercial performance coming in as we expected while public moderately exceeded our expectations. Public results were driven by the strength and solutions performance across channels and the impact of some early shipping of anticipated client device refresh volume in K12, leading to return to year-over-year growth and the strongest sequential growth for this segment since Q2 2020. On the supply side, the dollar value of our backlog declined relative to the first quarter, which contributed to our stronger solutions performance. Backlogs and product lead times associated with transactional products ended the quarter essentially in line with more normal historical levels, while remaining supply chain challenges and netcom solutions continued to ease in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the remaining pockets of backlog to weather out over time. As always, we judiciously managed our working capital to support our customers while ensuring strong economic returns. Our year-to-date free cash flow performance, which we will discuss shortly, reflects this discipline. Our team delivered strong profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 1.1%. Record second quarter gross margin of 21% was up 200 basis points year-over-year and increase in transactional product volume had a mild impact on margins compared to the first quarter, but overall margins remain strong driving a year-over-year gross profit increase despite lower net sales. As a reminder, the record gross margin performance in recent quarters has principally been driven by two factors; first, product margins benefiting from both mix into complex solutions and a lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, a greater mix into netted down revenues, the category again outpaced overall net sales, growing 10% in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022, primarily driven by double digit software-as-a-service growth. Netted down sales represented 31% of our gross profit compared to 28% in the prior year second quarter. This continues to be an important trend within our business. Turning to expenses on Slide 8, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $652 million for the quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, prior year quarter non-GAAP SG&A was flat as increased payroll expense associated with modestly higher co-worker count was offset by the prudent managed management of discretionary expenses during the quarter. Coworker account at the end of the second quarter was approximately 14,900, down from the first quarter, principally due to our efforts to align our cost structure with the level of business demand, while continuing to prioritize the areas where we can provide the most value to our customers. Strategic investments in our solutions and services capabilities remain key to our three-part strategy for growth and important catalyst for the achievement of our profitability and margin goals. GAAP operating income was $412 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $530 million, up $14 million or 2.6% versus the prior year. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was larger than usual, primarily the result of the workplace optimization charge in the quarter which is detailed on slides 8 and 11 :00. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached a record second quarter record of 9.4%, up 100 basis points from the prior year and up 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. We remain laser focused on delivering leverage on our gross profit growth despite challenging market conditions. Moving to Slide 9, interest expense was $58 million, approximately flat to the prior year and relatively in line with our expectations. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 10 was 25.7%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $91 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-gap net income add backs as shown on the slide 11. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9% within our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5%. As you can see on Slide 12, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares of 136 million GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.92. Our non-GAAP net income was $349 million in the quarter, up 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.56, up 3.2%. Moving ahead to Slide 13, at period end, cash and cash equivalents were $204 million and net debt was $5.6 billion. During the quarter, net debt was relatively flat, consistent with our plan to maintain our net leverage ratio within the range of 2 to 3 times. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.2 billion. Moving to slide 14, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 14 days, down four days from the first quarter, five days from the prior year's second quarter and below our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our continued diligent management of working capital, particularly with respect to inventory. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital favorably or unfavorably in any given quarter. We continue to believe our target range remains the best guidepost for modeling future working capital. Our effective working Capital Management also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $684 million as shown on Slide 15. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $79 million to shareholders through dividends and $196 million in share repurchases. That brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 16. Our execution remained consistent with the updated objectives we communicated at the start of the year. First, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. Going forward we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place for the targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the second quarter at 2.6 times, flat to the end of the first quarter within our new range of 2 to 3 times. We continue to convert cash profits into cash flow and have rigorous process in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining our flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we continue to target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 17. We continue to see caution and prudence in the market and in the sentiment of our customers. Given this, there is no change to our previously shared expectation that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. Our baseline view incorporates a modest recovery in the second half of 2023. We have not seen indications that would suggest a major turnaround on our commercial channels otherwise. With this scenario as our baseline, we maintain our expectation and outgrow the market by 200 to 300 basis points and continue to anticipate that netted down revenues will grow faster than other products and solution categories. Keep in mind in times of hardware softness, our over performance tends to be on the lower end of this range and vice versa. We also continue to expect a neutral currency impact for the full year, modest tailwinds in the second half after seeing modest headwinds in the first half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.24 to the British pound and CAD0.77 for the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to continue to be in the range of 9%. This reflects our expectation of continued strong gross profit margin with modest softening following three straight quarterly gross margin records. Operating margin is also supported by our actions to better align expenses. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of flat year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an increase from our prior expectation reflective of our better than expected second quarter results. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook and a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense and the non- GAAP effective tax rates can be found on Slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts of the third quarter, for average daily sales, we expect mid-single digits sequential growth from Q2 to Q3. This equates to a mid-single digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline for the fourth quarter in terms of average daily sales. As noted, we anticipate gross profit and [indiscernible] margins to be below second quarter levels, driven by both mix and rate elements. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. In 2023, we expect full year free cash flow to be approximately 5% of net sales, above our rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5% and reflecting our strong cash generation in the first half of the year. While we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain market, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability, margins and cash flow to our stakeholders. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we've provided updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. If you could just talk a little bit about seasonality, I know you guys have guided for the third quarter and as you look into the fourth quarter, there's a lot of debate on whether the pull in, incline devices for the second quarter is going to result in below seasonal growth for the second half, that's on the client devices side, and just generally a lot of caution on other hardware spend, whether it's on the compute or storage side just given a cautious spending environment and shift towards AI. So if you could provide me what you're seeing in the channels and then your end customers that would be great. And then I just have a follow up on free cash flow as well. It's -- you're looking like it's pretty strong for this year. How should we think about potential acquisition and a boost to the growth rates that you guys have outlined for this year? Thank you. Christine Leahy : Well good morning, Asiya. It's good to have you on the line. So let me just say with regard to expectations for the last half of the year and this concept of pull forward, look the quarter played out very much as we anticipated with commercial still feeling some pressures due to market sentiment and market caution and public returning to seasonality with somewhat over delivery by our government and education groups. Look if I take a step back and I think about Q2 versus the first -- the second half, let me just say this, I'm encouraged by the tick up that we saw at the end of the second quarter with regard to commercial customers in both activity and sentiment. I am encouraged by public returning to that seasonality that feels much more normalized as compared to pre-COVID for example. I'm encouraged by the fact that our international team notwithstanding sales decline maintained their profitability progress that they're making. I'm encouraged frankly that small business feels like it is not getting any worse. It's kind of hovering around the bottom, it's not getting any better, but it's not getting worse. So there are a lot of things that encourage me. I'm impressed with the execution of this team frankly. They always pull through in tough environments and they did it again. All that said, we are still cautious, we're cautious and we got a one month into the quarter where we felt an uptick, so we're cautious about the back end. And what I would say is, we still believe that we are starting to and will continue to see a mild-to-moderate recovery in the back end and we're holding firm to that. I mentioned K12 and we had a little bit more in the second quarter than we might have anticipated, that's just straddling quarters. That's just a phenomenon, but we're not seeing anything that is causing us to believe that the second half is going to be any different than we're suggesting in our outlook. And we're getting this from our customers with 10,000 plus sales folks and sales professionals and technologists in market, we're getting a real time pull and it feels like a pretty solid outlook to us. Albert Miralles : And Asiya, maybe I would just put this is out, maybe just add the just kind of to give you the technical component with our Q2 delivery and kind of allocation across the channels, Q3 would essentially look seasonal, that is obviously it's the seasonal peak for public, and we'd expect that would play out. And what we experienced from the commercial channels for Q3 would look much like Q2. So when we think about that pickup of activity, modest recovery, probably a little bit more weighted towards Q4 in those segments that have been softer in the last few quarters. Christine Leahy : And you had a follow-up, Asiya, on free cash flow? Asiya Merchant : Yes, just on the free cash flow. Yes, it's obviously trending higher than what you guys had previously anticipated or guided to. How should we think about the use of cash here? Albert Miralles : Yes, great question. So we've had -- look, we've had a good run of four plus quarters on the free cash flow generation side. And look, driven by strong cash profits, Asiya, but also by pretty diligent management of working capital in an environment that's been challenging. And I say look, on an evergreen basis, you'd expect that we will continue to be judicious about working capital, but certainly, there's a countercyclical component to this. And so as the environment has been a bit softer, we've been tighter in that regard. As we look to the second half and we look to pick up, and particularly in the transactional side, it's reasonable to believe that there'd be a bit of a more pull on our working capital in the second half. And notably, you'll see from our cash conversion that much of that favorability has come on the inventory side. So we're trying to make a little space for an expectation of pulling a bit more on working capital in the second half. That being said, for the full year, we gave you a refreshed rule of thumb of 4 to 4.5, and we expect it will come out for the full year at 5. And then just to your latter point on M&A and otherwise, look, we're going to utilize our capital where we see best, both supporting our strategic objectives, but also where the best relative value is. Asiya Merchant : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start, it looks like kind of the old CDW that we've come to know and expect in terms of over-delivering relative to expectation is back this quarter. So at a high level, Chris, prior to this quarter, we had two quarters that were very different from plan in Q4 and Q1. I just would be curious for investors that are wondering what changed in Q2 from either a guidance process or what enabled the over-deliverance that we can kind of get confidence that the old CDW is back moving forward? Christine Leahy : Well, good morning Adam, I appreciate that. Look, I'd say a couple of things. The macro environment really had a significant impact on Q1 and Q2, well, Q1 and in the front end of Q2. And when you think about the challenges to our larger commercial customers, in particular, which have an oversized impact on the whole of the business, I would say that, number one, was the first driver. The second is we weren't -- we were anticipating a return to seasonality for the education space and the government space, but as you know, those are really the summertime in the third and fourth quarter, as Al mentioned. So as we sat in Q1, we had a tough economic environment impacting our large commercial customers and our public sector just couldn't quite make it up. What you're seeing now is the benefit of the counter-cyclicality and the difference and diversity of our end markets really coming into full play. So it was and I would call it timing to some extent and the macro environment. I'd also say, Adam, that we are seeing this somewhat of a stability. I'll use the question a little bit of stability. I mentioned client devices are still down, but first quarter of sequential increase in commercial, K-12 is still down, but delivered very nicely in the quarter. And we're starting to see on the commercial side, in particular, a little bit of uptick in sentiment. That's giving us some optimism. And then you had the execution of this team, as you know very well. This team executes like nobody else. And given the change in the market we're seeing happening in back to seasonality, we're just going after it and leveraging our competitive advantages. And customers have been holding off on spending for a long time. So as they start to loosen the reins a little bit, we have been there, and we'll be there for them. Adam Tindle : Got it. And maybe just a follow-up for Al on guidance, just a little bit more in-the-weeds question here. Your Q3 guidance, I think you said mid-single digits sequentially per day, which if I look back historically, that's kind of seasonal, like you said. As I think about Q3, that's typically a big public sector, particularly government quarter, but you also had a very strong public sector result during Q2. So I guess the question would be what gives you confidence that there wasn't pull-in during Q2 in public sector and why guide mid-single digits in Q3 or that seasonal based on that strong Q2 result. Thanks. Albert Miralles : Yes, sure. Thanks, Adam, for the question. You're right, Q2 is really strong and particularly in public segment. All of the data that we see in the pipeline that we evaluate ongoing would suggest there's continued strength there. And I'd say, notably, in the government side and as well higher end that really had strong performance in the quarter. We mentioned, Adam, that K-12 had some, I'll call it, kind of summer seasonal pickup in activity, which some of which we might typically see kind of straddle over to Q3. So there's probably a little bit of that showed up in Q2, but modest enough that we feel comfortable holding to the expectation of seasonal uptick in public overall. Adam Tindle : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks and congrats on the results. Christine Leahy : Thanks, Adam. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. And in terms Chris, your commentary about seeing at least a modest recovery in the commercial markets in Q4, based on what you're hearing from customers, do you see any sort of PC refresh or is that more on the infrastructure and solutions side where projects getting pushed out will get done? Christine Leahy : Yes. Matt, it's a great question. We've been all asking ourselves this for a long time, when our PC is going to start to come back and that, as we all know, is really tied to the market and projects that are related to growth initiatives within organizations and employment. And look, I think that the farm has not yet been cleared and I don't think our customers yet are on the kind of solid footing of they're ready to open the coffer, so to speak. They're still being incredibly judicious in their spending. They're scrutinizing relentlessly, frankly. And so what we're hearing is more focused around mission critical, and I'll call that more solutions oriented endeavors right now. So it's hard to gauge on the PC refresh and when we'll start to see it come back. That said, look, we all know that the PCs are the productivity tool, right? They're what connect people to the applications. I think we all agree on that. We also know that we've got devices that are sitting old in the system. We talked about K-12 as an example, two to three years old, breakage five times higher than it was pre-pandemic, frankly. And Win 11 is right around the corner. Now you heard us talk about ASPs and customers buying devices that are kind of higher functionality, higher productivity, those would be Win 11 devices. So we do see customers starting to explore the benefits of Win 11, and that's going to set in at some point, and that's going to be a nice tailwind. Whether it will be Q3, Q4, 2024, it feels a little longer term than this year. Matt Sheerin : Okay, thank you. And on the Infrastructure & Advanced Solutions side, I guess there's some concern that we're seeing backlog across many companies come down because of component availability, product availability is much better now. And then also as customers maybe refresh servers, they move to a cloud model. I guess that would benefit you. But are you seeing any signs of any of those things playing out? Christine Leahy : Yes. So on the networking side, we certainly saw a healthy flush this quarter, and I would say that we had double-digit growth across all of our customer segments, and that was largely due to backlog flush and continuation of network modernization projects. In terms of the movement to cloud and AI, look, I would just say that this is a topic of conversation. I've used the word frenzy before, but it's a topic of conversation and as I said in my prepared remarks, there's a lot of complexity. There are a lot of questions out there. What will it drive? And what I would just say, Matt is, look, the benefit of our broad portfolio and the investments we've made across high growth type solutions areas as well as the services capabilities in particular, position us well to support customers wherever they are on the IT spectrum and whatever they're buying. So in any case, I do really see the customer decisions benefiting CDW because we'll benefit them with the portfolio and our capabilities. Matt Sheerin : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks and congrats on a nice sprint here. I guess, Chris, I want to kind of go back to this question around the June quarter upside that you folks are seeing, but you're still not -- you're not really raising the full year guide, I guess. So I'd love to maybe just go back to this and understand what are you seeing in the back half that refrains you from perhaps taking up the full year guide at least to reflect the upside design in June. So was it a bit of a pull in? Is it conservative? Just I'd love to understand given the big beat in June, what refrains you from raising the full year guide? Christine Leahy : Yes. Amit, thanks for the question. Here's what I'd say. I'd say too early too call. We're taking it quarter-by-quarter right now. On the commercial side, there's still caution, there's still prudence. There's no doubt that's still sitting in the market, notwithstanding, as I said, slight uptick as we get to the end of the quarter. So a couple of weeks, a month of a quarter does not -- was going to say trend make, but it really doesn't create solid ground yet. So we have to give it a little more time. I see some good indicators, but they're just not enough to make the call. So moderate feels better to us than major turnaround. On the public side, look, the way that both education and government work is we track very early in the year. So in the first quarter, we're tracking the projects that are coming in. So we have very good visibility to seasonality and generally what's going to happen during the strong seasonality. K-12 has been strong, and it's delivering. Having some of that come in, in June in our second quarter versus third quarter, we're not worried because we actually are seeing a real uptick in refresh needs. We talked a couple of years ago about the breakage rates and how that was going to drive refresh, well it is. And on the public side, it's looking very, very normal to us. So we don't want to get ahead of our skis on either commercial or public. We're just kind of calling it as we see it as we rounded out the quarter. So that's what I'd say. I don't know Al, if you want to add anything? Albert Miralles : Yes. I would just echo Chris' versus comments there and just say, Amit that, look, we had called for in the last quarter a modest recovery based on the information we had at that time. Q2 did come in a bit stronger. We're now effectively saying Q3 looks seasonal, and Q4 ultimately look above seasonal on that expectation of a pickup. And so there are still plenty of puts and takes that could call that into question, but we're comfortable overall with what we're seeing and kind of all of the data that we evaluate. That pickup is appropriate, but certainly wouldn't expect at this point that it's going to be much more of a churn than that. Amit Daryanani : Perfect, thank you. And then I guess, Al, maybe if I could ask you this question. Gross margins are up fairly nicely, I think, 140 basis points in the first half of this year versus last year. And you touched on a couple of things that are helping you there, but maybe you can talk about how much of an uplift do you think is cyclical in nature of the fact that the PCs are down a lot versus things that might be a bit more structural in nature. I'd love to just understand how do you think about gross margin run rate as you go forward from here? Thank you. Albert Miralles : Yes, sure, Amit. So you're right. Look, 2022, we ended 2022 with gross margins of just shy of 20%, which were new record levels, and we're up from there. if I had to parse it kind of year-over-year Amit, I think it's both a combination of, I'll call it, kind of thematic components of netted down revenue and that continued growth there, right? So particularly focused in cloud, SaaS, security, if you will. So we do think there are durable themes there. But there have also been factors driven by both mix and rate. So on the mix side, obviously, the tough environment has shifted more customer spend into solutions, which come at and services, which come at higher margin. So we have good reason to believe that, that could/would balance out over time. And when that does and particularly with client on it, you could see some moderation there. And then on the rate side, look, I've talked a couple of quarters now about product margins being firm and they've held up and even in this quarter, continue to hold up, and some of that is, I'd say a more durable theme from all indications of customers going a bit up market in terms of kind of products, but also, it's just been a really firm environment, I think, substantially driven by supply chain. So there are some of the puts and takes. So look, we feel good overall. We're holding to our NUI [ph] margin of 9% for the full year, but it's reasonable to expect that you could soften a bit here on gross margin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Erik Woodring : Awesome. Thank you. Good morning guys. Congrats on the quarter. Chris, I was wondering if you could just maybe elaborate on some of the pricing dynamics you are seeing in the market today, meaning are discounts accelerating? And if so, where conversely, are you pulling back on any discounting? How are customers responding to any pricing changes? How do you expect that to trend into the second half? Just broadly, any incremental color you could share on pricing would be helpful. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes. Let me start, Erik, with you know that we're a price plus model, right? So you're familiar with that model. If the prices, the OEM prices go up, we're usually passing that on to the customer, but let me set that that aside for a second. Let me -- I would characterize it as follows. I would say that pricing is holding fairly firm in an intensely competitive market. And I'd say that and give credit to the team that is reflecting to the customer the value that the CDW is delivering. But I will acknowledge that we're in a very intensely competitive environment. And when you think about the levels of scrutiny and all the things we've talked about in terms of purchasing processes right now, there's a lot of getting it out. That said, ASPs are holding pretty firm for CDW and what happens in the second half, I would expect the market to remain competitive. But I would expect also that the value that we, for example, wrap around client devices when they come back more robustly, that really resonates with customers, and I would expect us to hold ASPs pretty darn firm. Erik Woodring : Awesome. That is super helpful. And then I'd love to follow up again with you. Just on some of the nuances or comparing and contrasting a bit what you're hearing from the existing MedLar [ph] the Corporate clients versus the smaller SMBs, just any differences or similarities that you're hearing from them, maybe slightly nuance, but anything that you could call out would be super helpful. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes. No problem, Erik. Here's what I would say, small businesses are acting like small business. They're the most highly sensitive to the economy and in particular, hiring, right? And so right now, without -- again, the fog hasn't cleared. Without more clarity around the economy and potential for growth and hiring, they're kind of in a bit of a hold position except for those mission-critical projects that are productivity related, that are security related, that are frankly, even a little lower cost because we're talking about cloud versus large hardware purchases. Interest rates have really impacted that group of customers in terms of access to capital, and we're seeing that. I do think we've stabilized there kind of at the bottom, as I said. The difference when we look at the larger commercial customers, first quarter to now, we talked about first quarter that large commercial customer being what was the real drag, if you will, on the overall results. Those are the customers we've started to actually see the uptick in. So think about the last month of the quarter, starting to see movement back to mission-critical projects, the things that were on delay. That's where we're actually seeing some stability and sequential increase in client devices. So the difference is the small businesses, they're going to be a little longer to get -- kind of get back on the major buying page. Those larger entities are starting to inch back in and that's what's giving us -- that's one input to the confidence we have in the back end of the year. Does that help? Erik Woodring : That's -- yes, that's super helpful. Thank you so much and congrats again. Thanks guys. Christine Leahy : Yes, thanks Erik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Chris, maybe to some extent, following up here on Erik's question about what you're hearing from customers. With supply generally improving, is the visibility that customers are providing you or even the heads-up in terms of like heads up around projects that they're planning, is that starting to come in and sort of get compressed a bit more? What are you seeing on that front? And I have a follow-up. Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes. I mean, Samik, that would be some of it. We think about activity, right? We think about quoting. We think about the activity we track in our CRM system. We think about, obviously, invoicing and writings. But we -- all of those activities with the customer is what drives our kind of pipeline analysis to inform what is coming and what we think is coming down the pipe. So back to those kind of mission critical, we are starting to see some of those loosen up, which means writing around those are ticking up slightly across the full stack related to solutions, for example. So the answer is, yes. It's about the activity that we triangulate with the customers and the conversations we're having. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, got it. And if I can just ask more specifically to NetComm, that has continued to be an area of growth, but you did mention that you have continued to work down backlog. I think one of the questions we get often is, how sustainable can growth be once the backlog gets drawn down and normalized, any thoughts around that? I mean, are you expecting a similar pickup in NetComm sort of in the pipeline once spending recovers to a more normalized level? Or is backlog going to be a headwind in relation to growth? Christine Leahy : Yes. It's a fair question. Here's how I think about network modernization. There is a lot that is driving a continuous need for network modernization. Take any of the segments or customer end markets, higher and it's all about willing students, which means it's all about experience, which means their network has to be improved. When you think about kind of leveling into a hybrid work or back to work, that has major network requirements. It's basically if you tickle AI, frankly, as you're thinking about consulting and advising customers around AI use cases, that has network upgrade, if you will, modernization requirements. As we think about a refresh coming down the pike, that's going to have upgrade requirements. Our classrooms definitely are focused on modernization. So while the backlog was quite helpful to results this quarter, I don't expect that we're going to see network modernization dramatically slowdown in the near-term given the needs. Albert Miralles : And Samik, this is Al. Just to maybe add one thing. What we experienced with the backlog with NetComm in the quarter was what we would call pretty orderly. We have been saying we expected that backlog would work its way down, and it did. So while it contributed to the performance for NetComm, certainly underneath there, there's still continued written demand, as Chris suggested. Samik Chatterjee : Got it, okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Chris, can you talk a bit about what the discussions you're having with customers on AI? And what I'm curious about is, within your various customer segments, is there any that are sort of ahead? I don't know if I kind of doubt state and local would be. But how -- where people are in their AI discussions? Where maybe they're thinking about first deploying some of these generative AI solutions? And how you see it developing, because you have such a unique position in that you speak with so many various customer groups? Thank you. Christine Leahy : Yes. Sure, good morning Shannon. Yes, I guess when we think about AI, we think very simply two parts, two sides. First is the catalyst for CDW to accelerate and expand our own internal use cases, obviously. And then it's an opportunity to evolve our -- help our customers evolve using our services capabilities and transaction capabilities. It might sound very simplistic, but I'll tell you the way that we think about it is putting tools in the hands of coworkers and customers and taking the work out of the hands of coworkers and customers. I mean, it really does fall into those two buckets. And CDW's full stack approach allows us to help customers across the entire value chain from what I'll call the base to the tip. So think advisory services, right? And think applications, think modeling and tools, think computing and data structure that's required to run on all of that. And we are having conversations, I would say, on the advisory level, it's essentially its assessment, AI maturity, how do you use AI instances? How do you use data models? Do I want to use a private or [indiscernible], it's basically some of the basics. Application level, it's around the embedded AI tools that are there or coming and ensuring customers understand the benefits that they can accrue and then helping them consume and use those benefits and then modeling in tools and obviously, infrastructure required and the tools to create the use cases. You asked about particular industries. Look, I'd say contact center is a huge use case and it was a fast pickup in a number of industries, including financial services, retail, et cetera. We've seen a lot of activity there. Then you think about things like marketing transformation. You think about things like knowledge assistance and customer assistance. Those are the types of use cases that we're talking actively with customers about right now and that's really across industry. So think customer assistance, think retail, think food, think knowledge assistance, think financial services, et cetera. But those are the buckets that we're really starting to have conversations about in addition to what I would say more proprietary conversations with customers about specific ways that they can monetize, specific to their industry or to their organization. So that's what we're seeing right now. There's a lot of discussion, a lot of -- go ahead. Go ahead, Shannon. Shannon Cross : Got you. I was just going to say, are you hearing from customers that like next year's budgets might expand because they're finding so much benefit from AI and it's so early in the investment cycle that they see their IT expenditures may be growing above trends? I know the trend right now is down, but in theory? Christine Leahy : Yes. Here's what I'd say about that. I would continue to think that our customers are at the front end of this discussion. We certainly have some, as I said, in a number with contact centers where we've already implemented solutions, and they're reaping the benefits. I think in the middle of the year right now, given the environment we're in, customers are not prepared to increase budgets as a result of AI for 2024 yet because we're in the midst of planning what their -- helping them plan what their 2024 looks like. Do I think over the last, over the next six to 18 months, customers are really going to understand the tremendous benefit? I call it evolutionary -- evolutional. It's transformative. It really is one of those technologies that is going to massively change how companies operate and the benefits they accrue. But I think we're going to have to wait and see a little bit longer to understand what that opportunity looks like and when it's going to come to fruition. But it will be there, in our view. It will absolutely be there. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will go to the line of Keith Housum with North Coast Research. Your line is now open. Keith Housum : Good morning guys. Just a little bit broader question in terms of the M&A strategy. You guys made two acquisitions this year at least this year that we know of, Locus Recruiting and Enquizit. But perhaps can you just touch real quick on what both of those acquisitions add to you guys and how it makes CDW better going forward? Christine Leahy : Yes, sure. So both of the acquisitions were relatively small, didn't have a material impact on the financials, but I would be -- I would say, strategically write-down the fairway in our sweet spot. So the first one that I think that you're thinking of is Locus, which is a consulting company, and they're in what we call our talent orchestration space. So they help us to basically provide professional and managed services engineers so they expand our technical talent base period to end. And it's a way to have I'll call it, kind of a flexible burstable model across our technology resources. Locus actually doubled the size of that business in one fell swoop, and we're really delighted where actually we've seen very significant success, almost right out of the bat with Locus because we've been able to fill talent needs and talent orchestration needs with customers even more quickly around all of the important areas like networking cloud and security. Enquizit is the other one, the acquisition we made recently, also very exciting. They're AWS Premier Cloud, a service provider in the government and education and not for profit space. And they complement our existing digital velocity team. Think of what Enquizit does as professional services around application modernization and cloud migration. And they also have a proprietary tool that combines professional services with IP, which helps automate the migration process. So it's very unique to Enquizit and so far, that's gained a lot of traction in our federal space. So, two great acquisitions that we were delighted to bring into the family and already paying dividends. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude the question-and-answer session. So I will now pass the conference back over to CDW for closing remarks. Christine Leahy : Thank you. And I want to recognize before we close the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders.

I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. The team continued to execute extremely well under persistently challenged conditions. Commercial markets remained cautious and conditions in international markets worsened, public markets held firm. For the quarter, the team delivered net sales of $5.6 billion, 8% lower than last year, record non-GAAP operating income of $556 million, up 1% year-over-year. And record non-GAAP net income per share of $2.72, up 4% year-over-year. Record profitability that underscores the power of our strategy when underpinned by our resilient business model and financial rigor. Profitability driven by relentless execution and profitability that is a clear demonstration of the value we deliver to our customers. Customers maintain their laser focus on mission-critical priorities and optimizing costs and once again, our deep and broad portfolio enabled the team to pivot to solutions that address our customers' priorities. Solutions that provide operating efficiency and expense elasticity like burstable performance in modern, hybrid and multi-cloud environments or solutions that are usage-based like SaaS and private cloud. Solutions, we are well-positioned to deliver. In today's environment, where customers are closely scrutinizing their IT spend. Our value as a trusted adviser is greater than ever before, an adviser who helps customers cut through complexity and evaluate options. An adviser, who designs, deploys, integrates and many times manages the solution. Capabilities made possible by the investments we have made in our three-part strategy for growth. Investments that enable us to serve customers across the full stack and full life cycle. Investments that have made us a vital technology partner. As we have executed our strategy, the amount that customers spend with us has consistently grown faster than net sales, a dynamic that reflects both the success of our strategic investments and increasing customer preferences for cloud and SaaS-based solutions. Recall that these offerings drive significant customer spend that are netted down in our sales and thus dampen our top line growth while enhancing our gross margin. Let's take a deeper look at quarterly results. There were three main drivers of performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our breadth of solutions and services portfolio and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Each of our five build sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education is a meaningful business on its own with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act counter-cyclically, given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each, you see the benefit of our balanced portfolio again this quarter with public performance partially mitigating declines in commercial. Commercial market conditions continue to weigh on customer confidence and drive cautious purchasing behavior. Instead of the modest improvement in hardware we expected, we continue to experience pressure, particularly in client devices. Corporate net sales decreased 12%. Momentum continued around projects focused on increasing productivity, as well as projects focused on enhanced customer and go over experiences. With a shorter-term ROI lens, customers favored solutions enabled by cloud, which contributed to double-digit increases in corporate customer spend on cloud. AI and security were also major customer focus areas with CIOs increasingly being asked two questions, what are you doing with AI and how are you projecting our data? While AI remains in early stages of commercialization and development, and not yet translating into meaningful customer spend, our full portfolio of security offerings contributed to double-digit increase in security spend. Ongoing network modernization also led to excellent net comp performance, once again up double digits. Corporate top line performance continued to reflect meaningful year-over-year client device declines with ongoing postponement of upgrades and utilization of existing products. Small business net sales declined 22%. Market conditions were consistent with the second quarter, and customers continue to see clarity around the economy and more conducive conditions for hiring and new business formation. Focus remains on cost management and the prioritization of product \u2013 projects that need to get done. Projects that were more want rather than needs remain hot. Consistent with the second quarter, solutions increased up low single digits, while transactions declined by double-digits. Focus on shorter-term ROI for mission-critical priorities drove double-digit spend in cloud and software. Client devices continue to drive small business top line performance as refresh remained on the back burner and declines were on par with the second quarter. Public sales increased 1% year-over-year. Healthcare and education each posted a 2% increase, while performance was flat in government compared to last year's exceptional near 40% growth. Government performed relatively in line with historical seasonality, with Federal's mid-single-digit growth, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in state and local. The federal team continued its success helping agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This delivered excellent server performance up strong double-digits. The team also continued its work with agencies to optimize existing cloud investments and deliver new cloud solutions, which require rigorous proof of concept. The state and local team delivered solid sequential growth well above the historical averages, up 4%, but net sales declined mid-single digits compared to last year's double-digit growth. Solid Solutions growth was more than offset by a decline in transactions. Cloud-enabled solution adoption with strong, delivering double-digit increases in customer spend. Healthcare net sales increased 2% augmenting talent needs, modernizing data centers and driving cost savings and efficiency projects remain focused areas for customers. With complex industry challenges and tight operating budgets, healthcare systems continue to turn to cloud solutions. Armed with our full portfolio, which includes proprietary cloud-based health care solutions, the team drove a significant increase in cloud spend. Our broad portfolio of solutions also contributed to a double-digit increase in security spend growth as they help customers address heightened cybersecurity needs. Needs driven by the disproportionate percentage of all ransomware attacks that target healthcare organization. For education, net sales increased low single-digits, the first positive growth quarter for education in over eight quarters. K-12 low single digits increase more than offset a low single-digit decline in higher ed. Higher ed high single-digits increase in Solutions was offset by a double-digit decline in transactions, a decline largely driven by ongoing declines in client devices. Institutions continue to invest to improve security, campus connectivity and student experiences. The teams continue to focus on delivering these impactful solutions led to double-digit growth across netcomm, services and software. It also delivered low-teens growth in cloud spend. For K-12, the team continued their success helping schools and their efforts to achieve digital equity and improve learning outcomes, which delivered excellent growth in services and netcomm. Solutions grew meaningfully, while transactions declined low-teens, reflecting ongoing moderation of client device spend, security remained a key focus area with double-digit growth in customer spend. Other, our combined UK and Canada business came in below our expectations, down mid-teens. While the teams continue to execute well, the deterioration in market conditions in the UK and Canada were deeper than we anticipated, both the UK and Canada decreased by double-digits in local currency. Our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and enable consistent performance amid an uncertain and uneven macro environment. The second strategic advantage and driver of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio, which enables us to pivot to address our customers' evolving needs. Similar to the second quarter, solutions sales increased mid-single digits, while transactions remained under pressure, down high teens. Hardware declined by double digits. Similar to the second quarter, performance continued to reflect depressed client device demand, particularly in the commercial space. Overall, client performance was roughly in line with the second quarter's double-digit decline. Net comp increased double digits with stable demand. Backlog continues to feather out and is now approximating historic levels. Cloud spend increased nearly 20% with increases across every end market, roughly half of our total third quarter cloud spend came from commercial customers and half from public. Security spend increased by double digits with a significant portion being delivered via software and the cloud. Cloud and security success contributed to a mid-teens increase in software, increases across virtualization and network management and security were partially offset by declines in categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels. Solid managed and professional services growth was more than offset by the impact of continued drag from lower services attached to transactional and solutions hardware and overall services net sales declined. As you can see, performance varies significantly across the portfolio. That is the power of our deep and broad portfolio. It enables us to meet our customers where they are and it is power driven by the investments we have made in our growth strategy. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our growth strategy. A strategy guided by three pillars; first, capture share and acquire new customers; second, enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions area; and third, expand services capabilities. Over the past five years, we have broadened and deepened our capabilities. Our comprehensive life cycle management capabilities now deliver design, deployment, integration and management, capabilities that have deepened our relevance to customers and fortified our role as a trusted adviser to our customers. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers across physical, digital or cloud based environment in the US and internationally and capabilities that drive favorable outcomes for our customers. In today's uncertain macro environment, with customers increasingly reluctant to make big upfront capital investment, our ability to deliver the cost savings outcome of our ICARE framework is a major competitive advantage. Armed with our consultative approach to problem solving, the teams both identify and implement consumption-based solutions with lower upfront costs, solutions that enable customers to move ahead with mission-critical projects, solutions that deliver value to our customers and deepen customer relationships. Many of these solutions are enabled by our Cloud Readiness Assessment, enablement and migration services, which are second to none in the industry. A great example of this in action is a solution we provided to an Illinois school district that had a legacy converged storage environment reaching end of life. The customer had three priorities; first, student teacher and administrator experience. Second, agility to meet end of school year deadline; and third, deliver costs that they manage within the constraints of their fixed budget. After a comprehensive evaluation of the wide range of on-premise and hybrid cloud solutions we can provide, the team determined that a consumption-based approach would provide the best outcome for the customer ultimately developing a private cloud hyperconverged solution. A solution that supports deployment and management of modern applications and provides the ability to seamlessly scale for future growth, one that delivered needed flexibility and cost predictability and deepens our relationship as a trusted adviser, another great win-win. Investments in our customer-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the US IT market, and that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. You will recall last quarter, we shared our expectations for the US IT market to post a decline of high single digits in 2023. This assumes three things. First, greater clarity in the market would lead to a modest improvement in the commercial IT hardware market in the back half of the year. Second, a moderate deterioration in the UK and Canada; and third, a return to normal seasonality in the public space. We did see a return to normal seasonality in public and while commercial spend has been stable there was a greater shift to solutions that net down in lieu of IT hardware spend. We also saw a deeper-than-expected international market deterioration. Current conditions and order today customer interactions lead us to expect these trends to continue. Our estimate of US IT market growth in 2023 remains at a high single-digit decline, and we continue to expect to profitably outperform the US IT market by 200 to 300 basis points when adjusted for this year's meaningful shift in customer spend to our complex solutions that net down. We are cognizant of the significant wild cards to our customers in the market space in this environment, a list that has grown more complex and now includes intensifying geopolitical instability and potential for federal government shutdown. We will continue to keep a watchful eye on these and other potential factors as we always do, and we will provide an update on business conditions on our next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Now, let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Al Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail on the third quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. This quarter, our continued execution and financial discipline delivered three notable records : record gross margin, record operating margin and record earnings per share on a diluted basis. We achieved these records on consolidated net sales of $5.6 billion, which were 9.4% in 2022 on a reported basis and down 8% on an average daily sales basis. Third quarter net sales performance reflected both the impact of uneven market conditions and our continued success providing cloud and SaaS-based solutions that drive meaningful customer spend. On a sequential basis, third quarter net sales increased 1.6% on an average daily sales basis, slightly lower than our outlook, reflecting a higher-than-anticipated mix in the cloud and SaaS-based solutions that are netted down, in our top line results as well as economic conditions that adversely impacted our international business. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus prior year as a record gross margin, which increased 200 basis points year-over-year, offset the impact of lower net sales. Our gross margin of 21.8% was driven by two factors. First, the impact of higher mix in the complex solutions, which have higher product margins; second, a higher mix into netted down revenues, which while dampening net sales growth also enhanced gross profit margin. These cloud and SaaS-based revenue streams once again outpaced net sales growth. For this quarter, this category represented a record 32.6% and our gross profit compared 31% in a prior year third quarter. While we expect this mix shift to continue to be an important durable trend within our business, eventually, we anticipate a greater mix back in transactional products, which will balance out both the top line growth and corresponding gross margin impacts we've experienced in 2023. For the third quarter, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $671 million, down 1.9% year-over-year. Coworker count in the third quarter was approximately 15,000, up slightly from the second quarter. We continue to prioritize investments in our three-part strategy that are important catalysts for the achievement of our growth, profitability and margin goals. As our customers optimize and rationalize their own IT investments, our disciplined approach to discretionary expenses helped drive non-GAAP operating income of $556 million, up $7 million or 1.3% versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached a record 9.9%, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Moving down the P&L. Our interest expense tax rate remained in line with our expectations. As you can see on slide 8, our non-GAAP net income was $369 million in the quarter, up 3.5% on a year-over-year basis with third quarter weighted average diluted shares of 136 million. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was also an all time record at $2.72, up 4.4% year-on-year. Moving to slide 9 at period end, net debt was $5.3 billion or 2.4 times net leverage. During the quarter, net debt declined reflect our continued strong cash flow performance and modest debt repayment during the quarter, consistent with our targeted net leverage range of two to three times. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to slide 10. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 15 days, down three days from the prior year and below our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our continued diligent management of working capital, particularly with respect to our inventory levels, and we expect to remain at the lower end of this targeted range this year. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital in any given quarter. And we continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Strong profits and effective working capital management drove our strong year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion, as shown on slide 11, well-above our rule of thumb as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation priorities, including returning approximately $79 million to shareholders through dividends and $54 million in share repurchases. This brings us to our capital allocation priorities on slide 12. Our execution remained consistent with the objectives we communicated at the start of the year. First, as always, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. This morning, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually. This is our 10th consecutive year increasing the dividend, we've grown the dividend at a compound annual rate of approximately 31% from the initial level. Going forward, we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the quarter at 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of last year and within our targeted range of two times to three times. We continue to convert profits into cash flow and have rigorous processes in place to proactively manage liquidity, while maintaining our flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocations of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we now anticipate returning 60% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases, up from our prior range of 50% to 75%. All in all, strong results given ongoing economic uncertainty and uneven market conditions. We continue to run our playbook and remain laser-focused on margins, cash flow and predictable profitability. And that leads us to our outlook on slide 13. The uncertain marketing conditions we've operated under throughout the year are persisting and continue to lead to customer caution and prudence. Given this, we expect that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. With this scenario as our baseline, we expect to deliver a 200 to 300 basis point growth premium to the market albeit not evident on a net sales basis as the outsized share of netted down revenue makes the impact of our premium. Keep in mind that, our premium is most significant when hardware demand is strong, like in 2021 and 2022. We're currently maintain a meaningful premium to the IT market on a customer spend basis. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low to mid-9% range, up from our prior expectation of approximately 9%. This reflects our expectations of continued growth stronger profit margins along with expense efficiency as we manage through this uncertain economic environment. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an increase from our prior expectation of flat based on our strong third quarter profitability and relatively unchanged profitability expectations for the fourth quarter. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on slide 14. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter. For average daily sales, we now expect a largely seasonal mid-single-digit sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. This equates to a low- to mid-single-digit net sales decline on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter in terms of average daily sales. This is lower than we previously expected and reflective of both the current business conditions and top line mix components previously referenced. With this, we also anticipate gross profit and non-GAAP operating margins to be strong, similar to third quarter levels driven by both mix and rate elements. And we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year. For full year 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately 6% of net sales, above our prior year expectation of 5% and well above our rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5%, reflecting our strong cash generation in the first nine months of the year. While we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain market, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability, margin and cash flow to our stakeholders while continuing to invest behind our strategy. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thank you and thanks for taking my question. I'll just have two quick ones, and I'll ask both together, if that's okay. Chris, I think a broad investor concern here has been that most of the resilience we've seen in total spending from customers has been held by the public sector. And beyond that, when you look at the broader customers beyond the public sector, there hasn't been as much momentum. And in fact, momentum in spending is probably deteriorating on the commercial side. Can you dive into what you're seeing from a pipeline perspective going just beyond the public sector? And is there sustainability of demand from the commercial accounts. And for my second one, I mean, obviously, we're getting close to the end of the year here and maybe any insights you have into how you're thinking about next year spending. We haven't seen two consecutive years of significant declines in a while in enterprise spending. So any thoughts if we are at least looking at a year where you should be expecting higher spending from a lower level base, or are we looking for another year of declines from customers? Thank you. Chris Leahy : Okay. Good morning, Mr. Samik. Let me get to the first question first on the commercial side. Look, I'll just say again that the environment this year, all year, frankly, has been cautious. It's been uneven -- has been challenging. All that said, I would say one thing that has held true is investments in technology continue to be a priority for all of our customers. What that's looked like in terms of their spending has been pretty consistent throughout the year as well. Commercial customers have remained focused on cost optimization throughout the year on operating efficiency, on experience, both employee and customer experience. And they have been more focused on consumption based and ratable solutions like cloud, much more hesitant to make significant upfront capital investments and very much focused on managing their costs throughout the year, given the fact that we continue to not have the clarity, I'd say, in the business environment that would give them the confidence to invest more heavily. Now remember, what we're seeing from where our customers are investing and how they're investing across cloud, security in some of these areas that I call mission-critical has been very strong. Clouds up double digits, securities up double digits, software is up significantly. And this is the customer reflecting the need for technology to drive their missions forward. In terms of the real impact to commercial, I would look at hardware and in particular clients. We saw some budgets loosening up a little bit in the second quarter, and we anticipated that, that would lead to a modest recovery, I'd say, in the back half of the year in hardware, in particular, in the client device. That's not proved to be true. Our customers in -- across corporate and small business are not seeing the clarity of the business climate and therefore not willing to increase their spend in that area. But net-net, what I would say about commercial is still investing behind technology in a different bucket, a bucket that is more cloud-based right now, more ratable, more prudent and measured around the immediate spend, but still very much seeing technology as critical to their mission, as I said. As we think about next year, look, we'll give you our views as we get through the year. One thing I'd say again about client devices is we're not seeing the pickup or signs of a pickup that we were hoping to see in the last half of the year. So when that happens, we'll see. But once there's clarity in the market, we might get to see that, but we have not seen those signs just yet. And that's where I'd leave it. I think we've got to get through the last couple of months. Here's what I just close with. The good news, which is the investment behind our strategy as physicians CDW to be able to offer our customers the broad portfolio, and we are seeing when they need help with their technology no matter where it sits across the full stack or the life cycle. Our sales and technical teams are there. And the good news is I'm really pleased with what I'll say is the engagement, the activity, the discussion and the depth with which we're ingraining our relationships with those customers. So feeling very good about when we kind of come out of the curve, we'll accelerate out with our customers. You've seen that in the past, and I wouldn't expect it to be any different at this time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Erik, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Awesome. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Chris, maybe can we just start out. Can you just give us a bit more detail on linearity in the quarter? And specifically how the trends progressed from July through September and into October and how that has influenced your updated expectations for the full year? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes, sure, Erik. Here's -- I'd just say, it was pretty stable throughout the whole quarter. You'll remember, in Q2, we talked about an uptick as we went through the quarter, and that gave us some level of confidence that there might be some more clarity in the business climate. In Q3, we just kind of saw the same level of activity across the three months. Erik Woodring : Okay. Super. Thank you very much for that, Chris. And then, Al, I just wanted to dig into your gross margin comments a bit. We've heard for several quarters now about a mix shift to these more complex solutions that are obviously higher margin, when we eventually see a mix shift towards more transactional sales, as you've kind of cautioned us as we look forward. Do you expect that this will drive a mix away from these complex solutions? Or can kind of both of these trends coexist together because I think it does have an important influence on what -- how we think about gross margins in the future. So if you could just kind of help us understand if this is a zero-sum game or if you can see strong transactional alongside strength in complex solutions and what that would do for gross margins, that would be helpful. Thank you Al Miralles : Yeah. Thanks, and good morning, Erik. I think they definitely can coexist. I think what we've seen in the environment Erik, it's essentially, I'll say, commercial customers kind of fixing on their spend and choosing to weight that towards more of these netted down revenue streams, if you will and holding back on some of these other spend items in IT hardware and particularly in clients. But our expectation and our expectation was that with less uncertainty in the economic environment, we would see an incremental pickup on the hardware side, in particular clients. And so the expectation would be that the durable trend of our netted down revenues would persist and likely outpace net sales, but we also would see pickup in some other categories. So I do believe that, that would co-exist, we're not seeing in the current environment in a more cautious environment, but that's what hopefully the future will hold. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vogt of UBS. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. So two, if I may. So can you maybe just touch on the demand signals that you're seeing out there, a little bit more robustly in terms of maybe what you're hearing from customers versus the backlog signals that you're hearing? How much of the weakness is macro related, do you think, versus some continued normalization of backlog? I know you mentioned net comp sounds like it's back at normal historical levels with public as well. But I just want a little bit more color there. And then when you think about calendar 2024, and maybe go back to Sam's point, it certainly sounds like some of your related companies in your ecosystem are talking a little bit more robustly about demand, particularly in, let's say, PC clients. I'm just trying to get a sense for maybe what the disconnect is from a timing perspective, maybe a Windows 11 refresh perspective. Just any more color there would be incredibly helpful. Thank you. Al Miralles : Yeah, sure. Good morning David, it's Al. I'll start. Overall, I'll just break it down a bit by segment. So look, as Chris suggested in Q2 what we were seeing from customers might have suggested that with a bit more clarity in the economic environment that things would pick up. And again, we noted that we would have anticipated that would be more IT hardware and PC. That has not played out, and we have seen this really sentiment-driven environment has driven buying behavior. So on the commercial side, corporate and small business, we would say stable but not showing a pickup. With respect to our public business, first, they've executed exceptionally well, but I would say pretty much in line with expected seasonality. And then maybe lastly, I would just note in the international markets, we anticipated that you would see some moderation on the demand side in Q3 and our expectations for Q4 I would say that's worse than expected. And we would call it as maybe a few quarters behind what we've seen in the demand market in the US. So there are a couple of the puts and takes in terms of the demand environment, what we saw in Q3 as well as Q4. And then, David, just to your point on backlog, as Chris suggested in her prepared remarks, our backlog is nearing normalization. Maybe the lagging piece would be more networking, but we're getting close to what we'd call normalization. So no significant impact as we sit here now. Chris Leahy : On the PC side, the question you asked about a potential \u201cdiscipline\u201d and I'd say a couple of things. I mentioned earlier that we have not seen picking up in activity around client devices. And as we know, that's the last place that our customers start to spend again once they're feeling better about the business market. But what I would say is, we are certainly closer to the end of a downside than we are to the beginning. So that's quite clear. The other point I would make is that consumer tends to react earlier to market changes than the commercial business. So when you see a bit of a lag in terms of what we are suggesting versus what you might see from OEMs, et cetera, Part of that is who is doing the buying. The second is the timing of the market in terms of the kind of flush of inventory into the channel from the OEMs and distributors and then us to the end market. So that will account for a quarter or two of differences. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI. Amit, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Good morning, everyone. I have two as well. You suppose to -- Chris, there's been some degree of chaos at the federal level from a budget perspective. It sounds like September quarter went relatively fine for you folks. But there's a Spotify day extension that I believe, expires in a couple of weeks. How are you thinking about federal spending in the December quarter and just the with from this extended shutdown potentially? Chris Leahy : Yeah. Amit, look, I guess I'd say it this way, we've been here so many times before. The team knows how to manage through both the uncertainty. And if we do have a shutdown, have to manage through that, we're past the year-end, which is good. I would say that, projects that are in-flight already will stay in flight. There might be some projects that are in flight that might be on hold. I'd say that's really we're looking at 2024. But the good news is we have a team that has executed in and out of these -- these environments, I guess, sadly, in some regards, but in these environments many, many times, and I have great confidence they'll do a terrific job this time as well. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. And then if I could just maybe follow-up. If I think about the operating margin performance of the company in calendar based on the midpoint of your guys in December, it's going to be up like, I don't know, 80, 90 basis points year-over-year on the operating margin side. And there's obviously a bunch of levers over here. Some of it is cyclical client devices not being well some of it is secular. But how do you think about what's the durability of these operating margins as you go forward? And if you reflect on the tailwinds in calendar 2023, how would you say is cyclical that perhaps is not sustained into the out years? Thank you. Al Miralles : Sure, Amit. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things I would note. I think if I kind of parse the pickup we've had in our operating margins, a few things. Number one is we benefited from -- obviously, really strong gross profit margins up 200 basis points year-over-year. And that is a function of a few things, but I'd say most notably a mix of business. And so a lot of that gross profit margin pickup is dropping down into our operating margins. The other piece, Amit, would be really just our efforts to align our expenses with what we're seeing in the business and demand vectors and that is our efforts Q1, Q2 along those lines certainly helped. We have kind of a targeted range, and I've talked about this before of high 54s into the 55 of expenses relative to GP, and that's kind of our sweet spot in this environment. That's where we're operating. Now, I'll just say that is notwithstanding, we continue to invest behind our strategy, but at the same time, we have significant efforts to drive productivity, efficiency, kind of, managing our expenses commensurate with where we stand in. So they are the major components that are driving our operating margins. So Amit, I would just maybe just say that in terms of durability, you can expect we're going to continue on the efficiency front while we invest the impacts or influence of gross margin. Certainly, the netted down growth is going to continue to help that in that regard. But as we mix more into transactional products and PC start to come back, you could have some dilution effect there. So we certainly have moved quickly on the operating margin. Some of that ultimately could see giving back, but you're going to see different geography in our income statement as it plays out. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thanks and good morning. I'm hoping, Chris, that you can elaborate on the comments about the weakness in the international markets. You're not the first one calling out that specifically in Europe. So is that something that you saw throughout the quarter? And Al, you did mention that you expect that softness to continue over the next couple of quarters. So anything more you can add would be great. Chris Leahy : Yeah. Good morning Matt. On the international front, we did start to see a downtick in Q2, which we mentioned on our last call. And I would just say, it continues with a steepness we hadn't anticipated in the third quarter. And that is across the business, very, very similar to what we've seen in the US throughout the year. And our expectation is, as Al mentioned, is we're probably a couple of quarters behind on the international front. That's both the UK and Canada in terms of performance and demand and the certainty in the market there. So that's what we're seeing. Matt Sheerin : Okay, great. Thank you. And just regarding PCs, there's been buzz recently about AI enabled PCs down the line and potentially being another catalyst for upgrade cycle, are you curing that at all from customers and suppliers? And is that something that folks will get excited about at some point? Chris Leahy : Yeah. Matt, it's a great question. AI is on everybody's mind. And I think the short answer to your question is, yes, we do expect customers to get excited about AI enabled client devices. And if we just take a step back, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're at the front end of commercialization and development, but obviously, it's going very quickly. And the way we think about it is we're building what I would call our end-to-end full stack capabilities. AI is going to be integrated into all technology products across the full stack. It's going to need the infrastructure optimized to support AI. It's going to need services to be able to move from arrival to adoption. And so we are very much aligned with all of our partners, in fact, building practices with our partners around AI enabled technology. And so yes, we think customers will be excited. And again, CDW is well-positioned to help them make across the full stack and in particular, client devices. It's just there's more choice in complexity in the market. And thinking years back, Matt, where customers had to think about the technology choice, the brand choice, then we had consumption, then we have CapEx versus OpEx models. Now we've got intelligence across all of the full stack, it's getting more complicated. That said, there's a very high expectation within all of our customers that their CTOs and CIOs and their line of business leaders are thinking about how artificial intelligence can help drive their efficiency and their experiences for their customers. So look, we see it as an accelerant I think from a timing perspective, it will move fairly quickly, but we are still at the very front end stages. Operator : And our next question comes from George Wang from Barclays. George, your line is now open. Please go ahead. George Wang : Well, hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. Firstly, can you just maybe talk about share gains, especially by geo you guys talked about kind of weaker international UK, Canada. Just curious if the fit industry weakness or maybe some share shifts? Maybe you can kind of double collect on the share gains, both in the US and also in the overseas markets? Chris Leahy : Yeah, I think the question was on share gains. Hi, George, good morning. Look, here's what I'd say. We hold ourselves accountable over the long term to outperforming the market by 200 to 300 basis points. And we feel very confident that we're continuing to do that. When I think about other periods when we had weaker hardware environment 2016 comes to mind. And in that environment, we had hardware declines, but we noted that our netted down solutions, which in those -- back in 2016 would have been software and software assurance and things like that. We're growing at a faster base, fast forward to now. And when we look at the customer spend, what customers are investing through CDW, we're seeing a delta of more than 5%. So it's a fairly big delta, and we feel very confident that we continue to take share across our markets, and we'll do so in 2023 and over the long run. George Wang : Okay. Great. Just a quick one, if I can, just as a follow-up. Just in terms of any tuck-in kind of bolt-on deals, given just netted down kind of margin accretion and the kind of bad guidance. Just curious, any thoughts and color you can share just on so they continue to sort of roll up kind of tuck-in deals seeing any segments do you want to cut off? Chris Leahy : Yeah. I would say on the M&A side, I think about that as a vehicle for investing behind our strategy. And you've seen us invest both organically and through acquisitions very successfully. And again, kudos to the team for on companies that we've joined with on both sides for both moving quickly and creating more value for our customers as a result of those investments. And those have been primarily, as you know, along capabilities there are advanced solutions related, cloud, security, digital things that you are now seeing really strength in the market and strength in our business. So we'll continue to look at M&A opportunistically. And if it's the right fit, we certainly would consider moving forward is always on the docket. We're never out of the market. But I'll have Al chat a little bit about cash position. Al Miralles : Yeah, George, I would just add. Obviously, M& A is always front and center for us. And as we think about our capital priorities, we're going to balance strategically where are the opportunities that are going to add value to us as well as the tactic where our valuations and where can we kind of best deploy our money. So stay tuned on that. You can see that kind of we do have a -- a cash position in place, and it is a volatile and variable environment. So we certainly value optionality with respect to our capital in this environment. George, to your comment about where can we expect we're going to look across and we'll continue to look across the ecosystem of opportunities. Our last acquisition was Enquizit that was in the cloud space, mostly focused in federal. So you can imagine some of those revenue streams would have a higher concentration than netted down. But I wouldn't per se that's part of our strategy. It's going to be more about the capabilities. So more to come on that front. Operator : And our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu, your line is now open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two of them, one for Al, one for Chris. Al, is there a way to quantify the impact of netted down items on year-on-year sales growth in 2023? And is there anything unique about this year, or as we look into 2024-2025, should we expect a similar level of year-on-year impact or even higher? Because I mean, it looks like it makes sense for you guys to mix shift more into these items. So just your thoughts on that Al Miralles : Sure, Ruplu. So a few things. Number one, we've said before and we continue to say we would expect, as we look forward, that netted down revenues would outpace our overall net sales, if you will. So I'd say, give you that one data point. I will note that the mix into netted down this year has been more extreme and a couple of metrics that I'll just note; number one, netted down for the quarter of $400 million was 7% of our net sales, but 32.6% of our GP and you can go back sequentially and look at what that looked like. But it's notable both sequentially and I'd say, versus prior year. If you try to put those dollars on a more even basis with net sales that grows up, you'd get a sense for the impact. And I think, and Chris alluded to this, it would suggest that our decline in net sales is pretty considerably less than if you looked at it on this customer spend basis. So there are a couple of things you could look at from a math perspective that would show the pretty notable growth and outsized impact even down has had this year. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for the details there. Chris, let me ask you this. On the prepared remarks, you talked about device refreshes remaining on the back burner. As you look out over the next couple of quarters and 2024, given fundamentals like the age of PCs in the market, I mean, do you expect to see any device refreshes either in the client side or in the data center side. And I think you've said that typically, when that happens, CDW's outperformance to the US IT spend is at the higher end of the 200 to 300 basis points range. So I guess what I'm getting at is even though the macro is weaker today, should we expect that when the macro improves and you get this added benefit of device refreshes that your outperformance can actually be at the higher end of the normal range. So can you give us your thoughts on that, please? Chris Leahy : Yeah, Ruplu good morning, and I would say you've got it right, our track record of outperformance we were seeing refreshing hardware is strong. And part of that is our ability to gain share. And part of that is the fact that those are recognized on the top line net basis. And so we tend to outperform our premium as a result of those two things. In terms of looking forward, I just repeat a little of what I said, Ruplu, which is we do feel that clients, the downswing is kind of we're at the back end of that cycle, if you will, as opposed to the start of that cycle. That said, as Al mentioned, it's really a sentiment-driven market right now driving demand. And until our larger commercial customers had a level of confidence in the business climate, we think that client device and even data center refresh will be kind of the last point where they start to invest more dollars. Now, you're right, we're -- we've got a refresh cycle. We've got 40-year-old Tove devices, et cetera. We've got Win 11 coming. So there are a lot of things in the market that will certainly be a tailwind for client devices. AI, as we mentioned, embedded in client devices, those are all going to be positive. And I would also add that our teams are definitely having conversations with customers about refresh in terms of planning, we're just not seeing that convert. And again, we'll be ready when they're ready to convert, but it's just not to converting yet. Operator : And our last question today comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Adam Tindle : All right. Save the best for last. Al, I wanted to maybe start by reflecting on 2023, the silver lining this year, I think it's been cost management. You've been protecting earnings all year despite very volatile revenue. And I think you mentioned that OpEx to GP is your metric, which makes sense, but it's now optimal. So the question would be, as we look forward, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like the outlook for 2024, based on what you're seeing is a little bit more muted. I see you're not really investing in headcount, it's up modestly sequentially. Inventory days are very low, so you're not carrying up for revenue growth. You've got mix shifting on -- as a headwind for GP dollars. So the question would be how to think about protecting earnings in a more muted environment moving forward? Would it be fair for us to anticipate more negative operating leverage moving forward? Why or why not? Thanks. Al Miralles : Sure. Thanks, Adam. Great question. A couple of things I would call out. First, like I gave you the range how we think about expenses. Just understand kind of underneath the engine there, there are puts and takes in terms of the -- where are we driving productivity, where we're driving efficiency. Not only to kind of keep within that range, but also to make sure that we can appropriately fund investment opportunities. I think what you can expect is those efficiency efforts will continue, but we will continue to invest. And you noted that our headcount was slightly up, but it was up. If you look at the gross effect of the those -- that headcount would look at more significant, if you will, from a gross basis. So look, I think it's a balancing act. I think, Adam, as we start to see the demand cycle start to turn in some of the areas we've talked about we would certainly accelerate and continue to ramp-up on the investment side. But I would call the efficiency efforts somewhat evergreen. And so therefore, when you add that up, we're still going to try to remain within a range. I would not be able to tell you definitively every quarter, if we show operating leverage, there could be some quarters where we say there was a great opportunity. And therefore, we have less operating leverage or de-lever but it's going to be a big quarter-to-quarter with kind of that strategic balance that I mentioned on top of that. Adam Tindle : Got it. Maybe a quick follow-up on gross margin. I understand that net revenue is benefiting or mix. But we can exclude that, give it a 100% gross margin and strip it out and look at just traditional hardware gross margin. And at current levels, I'd love for you to maybe unpack some of the items that might be more cyclical versus structural and help us to gauge the outcomes, because that analysis can get some pretty scary outcomes of returning back to historical levels. I think you can get over $1 of EPS coming out from reverting that back to the mean. So if you could unpack the ex-net revenue gross margin and what's cyclical versus structural, that would be helpful. Thank you. Al Miralles : Yeah, absolutely, Adam. So I've talked about in the past, obviously, mix matters, and we've had a pretty extreme mix movement particularly this year on these netted down revenues in lieu of hardware, PCs, et cetera. Certainly, we would expect that to balance out over time. And so that is a variable that would dilute gross margins. The other piece, Adam, would be that in general, product margins have held very firm. And if you look back over the last two years, they've actually moved up quite a bit. So there's been resiliency there. I would also note that though in that, there is this component of more upmarket premium spend on higher level, higher value product that is persisting, and we're seeing that continue to hold up. And there may be an element there that what you bought in the way of premium product. Now you're in it and you're going to continue to invest in that same way. And then the last component, Adam, I would note, and we know this, that over time, you could see commoditization. We've not seen that, but it's conceivable that some of that could come back over time. So we are at pretty significant levels in terms of gross margin when you add those components up. Certainly, components that I referenced that are durable and in some areas, some components that could be somewhat transitory and we could see at a bit over time. Operator : And with no further questions, I'd like to hand the call back to the CDW team for closing remarks. Chris Leahy : Thank you very much. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our nearly 15,000 coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you, everyone for joining. You may now disconnect.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2024. Then I will hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as always to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Fourth quarter net sales were $5 billion, 7.7% below 2022. Strong growth and operating income margins mitigated the impact of top-line performance on profits, and we delivered gross profit of $1.15 billion, 2% lower year-over-year, non-GAAP operating income of $519 million, 1% below prior year, and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.50, up 3% year-over-year. Our results reflect consistent, strong execution by the team, our financial rigor, and our ability to deliver solutions and services across the full life cycle, full stack. Results delivered under uneven commercial and international market conditions, which continue to drive cautious customer behavior. Customer priorities remained laser-focused on operating efficiency and expense elasticity. Priorities increasingly met by as-a-service and consumption-based solutions like cloud and SaaS, as well as nascent, ratable, on-premise solutions. The team's ability to pivot to address these priorities drove excellent performance across solutions, including categories that commonly net down on a revenue basis. The impact of this success, combined with ongoing softness in traditional hardware categories, resulted in further pressure on net sales. When this happens, we experience what we saw this quarter, meaningfully dampened net sales growth with very strong gross margins. This phenomenon was not unique to the fourth quarter. Market dynamics drove hardware deprioritization and preference for solutions that net down throughout 2023, and our net sales of $21 billion were over $2 billion less than 2022. Notwithstanding our muted top lines, strong execution by the team underpinned by our full stack, full lifecycle, full outcomes, go-to-market approach delivered flat, non-GAAP operating income, a 1% increase in non-GAAP net income per share, and strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion. Outcomes driven by the strategic investments we have made over the past five years to increase the value we deliver to our customers. That is the power of our strategy when combined with our resilient business model. 2023 was a year that truly pressure tested our strategy. The fourth quarter is an exemplary example of this inaction. There were three main drivers of results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio, and relentless execution of our three-part strategy for growth. First, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government, and education. Each channel is a meaningful billion-dollar-plus business on its own. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together deliver sales of US$2.6 billion. Often, our customer end markets perform differently given macroeconomic or industry-specific headwinds or tailwinds. This quarter, all but one customer end market experienced a decline in net sales. The profit story was very different, with gross margin increasing across all customer end markets. Let's take a look at the puts and takes of how each end market performed in the quarter. Corporate net sales decreased 8%. Top-line performance continued to reflect the impact of both netting down and hardware pressure. Momentum remained for projects focused on increasing productivity, as well as projects focused on enhanced customer and co-worker experiences. The team's ability to meet customer demand for these priorities with as-a-service and ratable solutions drove strong cloud performance. Year-over-year client device declines moderated down mid-single digits compared to the double-digit declines of the first three quarters. For netcomm, while network modernization stayed a top priority, customers focused on digesting investments made over the past few years, leading to a long-expected backlog of normalization, and sales declined year-over-year. Small business net sales declined 13%. Market conditions were consistent with the first three quarters of the year, and customer behavior remained cautious. Priorities remained squarely focused on cost management and projects that need to get done. Once again, projects that were more launched than needs remained paused. Customer demand for projects with shorter-term return on investment drove excellent performance in cloud and in total security -- total software, excuse me. Security remained a top priority, and the team delivered strong performance across our broad portfolio of hardware, software, and services security offerings. Similar to corporate, small business client device declines moderated in the quarter, down-high single digits compared to the prior three quarters double-digit decline. Public sales decreased 4% year-over-year as government's mid-single-digit net sales increase was more than offset by declines across our other public-ed markets. The federal team delivered a double-digit net sales increase as they continued their success helping agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This drove excellent netcomm performance up strong double digits. The team continued its efforts to help agencies optimize their existing cloud environments as well as deliver new cloud solutions. The state and local team delivered a mid-single-digit increase. The team's success-enabling cloud-based solutions, especially with budget constrained cities, delivered a triple-digit increase in cloud performance. For the second quarter in a row, the team delivered sales growth in client devices. Healthcare net sales decreased by 5%, augmenting talent needs, modernizing data centers, driving cost savings and efficiency projects, all remained focus areas for our customers. The team drove a significant increase in cloud performance. Growth driven by their success-helping systems adopt deep cloud portfolio, which includes proprietary healthcare solutions. Our broad portfolio of solutions also contributed to security growth as the team helped customers address heightened cybersecurity needs. Education net sales decreased by 12%, with K-12 posting a mid-single-digit decline and higher ed down mid-teens. For K-12, the team continued their success-helping schools and their efforts to sustain technology gains of the past several years. This delivered excellent growth in services and cloud, both posting double-digit gains, gains that were offset by the combined impact of a double-digit decline in netcomm and low-single-digit decline in client device sales. The high ed team's success-helping universities address business process transformation efforts contributed to double-digit growth in services and cloud. Client devices showed stability. These encouraging trends were more than offset by declines in netcomm this quarter. Other are combined UK and Canada business, declined by 14%. While the teams continued to execute well, market conditions were as expected, and sales in both the UK and Canada decreased by double digits in local currency. Once again, our diverse end markets contributed to our performance amid an uncertain and uneven environment. The second driver of performance was our broad and deep portfolio. Let's take a look at how each category performed. The market did not experience the stabilization in hardware we expected, and net sales of our hardware portfolio declined by high-single digits. This was primarily driven by double-digit year-over-year declines in netcomm as the normalization of backlog adversely impacted year-over-year growth. Client device performance improved sequentially with a low-single-digit decline. Software customer spend increased by high-single digits, but given the significant portion of the category that nets down, net sales declined. Strength was broad-based across software as we continued to help customers manage data, enhance productivity, and secure their IT environments. Growth was particularly strong across security, virtualization, and application suites. Cloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to growth's profit. Customer spend increased across all end markets, with roughly half a spend from commercial customers. Infrastructure as-a-service, productivity, and security were the top three cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase, and customer spend increased by low-single digits. Our teams continue to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement identity and access management solutions, and provide training to our customers to help manage cloud deployments and enhance endpoint and application security. Services was a standout category this period, with double-digit increases in professional and managed services. Integral to today's complex technology solutions, customers continue to lean into CDW as an extension of their own teams and leverage our services capabilities as part of their strategies. Our portfolio performance leads to the third driver of our results this quarter, relentless execution of our growth strategy. Core to our growth strategy, our objective is to expand and enhance our solutions and services capabilities. Over the past five years, investments both organic and non-organic, including 10 acquisitions, have bolstered our expertise and resources in these two key areas to support our full stack, full life cycle, full outcomes, go-to-market approach. Investments that have grown our capabilities in high-growth complex areas like cloud migration and cyber security, that have enhanced capabilities like full stack and cloud-native software development, DevOps engineering, robust consulting, and cloud-based workflow automation, expertise and resources, and investments that have expanded our services footprint across the U.S. and Canada. As you can see, each investment we made is purposeful and delivers a specific capability that furthers our strategy. A strategy designed to ensure we evolve with the market and constantly fortify our leading position as trusted advisor to our customers and vendor partner of choice. Evolving with capabilities that underpin our relevance and ensure we are there for our customers today and as new technologies come to market. New technologies like artificial intelligence. With its extremely short high cycle, our customers are increasingly seeking opportunities to use AI to achieve their objectives. And while most customers are in the discovery phase, some are already adopting AI with our help. There's a great example. An industry-leading semiconductor and software designer needed training and development for a domain-specific large language model to support a range of internal use cases. The data-intensive and highly proprietary nature of the company's designs and intellectual property made the use of a hyperscaler's LLM and cloud-based compute and storage resources less optimal. The CDW hybrid infrastructure team worked with the customer to build a custom platform that supports both training and inference workloads for generative AI. The team designed the underlying architecture, which included a best-in-class 16-node supercomputer, with a high-performance parallel file system storage solution. The successful installation and customer handoff resulted in a multi-million-dollar hardware and software engagement and service with opportunity. With both usage and use cases growing quickly, the company has engaged CDW to support further expansion of their existing infrastructure and to evaluate new solutions. Clearly, investments in our customer-centric growth strategy have elevated our relevance to customers to the highest level it's ever been. Our focused and disciplined execution of our strategy continues to make us a vital technology partner, whether enabling customer priorities that require high complex or transactional solutions. And that leads us to our 2024 outlook. The uneven market conditions we experienced throughout 2023 have persisted into 2024. Customer decisions remain deliberate and restrained with ongoing projects scrutiny, pursuit of short-term ROIs, and continued buying hesitancy, particularly around hardware. With this backdrop, we currently look for the U.S. IT market to grow by low single digits in 2024 on a customer spend basis, including the expectation of a slow start to the year, a view that incorporates the potential impact of some of our recent wildcards, including upcoming elections and geopolitical issues. For CDW, these conditions set up a year that thematically looks much like 2023, and our outlook assumes the growth of customer spend outpaces our net sales growth. Our customers face proliferating data and ever-expanding cybersecurity needs. They face expanding workloads and hardware obsolescence, and they face the potential and promise of exciting new technologies. With our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services, we are there for our customers today and tomorrow, wherever their priorities lie. We are there for our customers as their trusted advisor to help them navigate increasingly complex technologies. Whether growth comes from consumption-based or as-a-service solutions, or from hardware sales, we are well-positioned to continue our track record of profitably outpacing U.S. IT market growth by 200 to 300 basis points. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages, and out-execute the competition. Now, let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Al Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my preparatory remarks with detail on fourth quarter performance, briefly touch on full-year 2023 results, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2024 outlook. The team's strong execution and our financial discipline delivered very strong quarterly growth and operating margins, and growth in our fourth quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis. We achieved these results on consolidated net sales of $5 billion, which were 7.7% below 2022, on a reported and average daily sales basis. Fourth quarter net sales performance reflected both our ongoing success providing cloud and SaaS-based solutions that drove meaningful customer spend and profits, and the continued impact of uneven market conditions that we experienced throughout 2023. On a sequential average daily sales basis, fourth quarter net sales decreased 10.8%. While historically fourth quarter net sales are lower than the third quarter, the sequential climb this quarter was more significant than we expected, reflecting a lack of hardware spending recovery, a continued mix shift into solutions that net down, and generally softer economic conditions impacting our international end markets. Fourth quarter gross profit was $1.2 billion, down 2.3% versus prior year, with our gross margin increasing 130 basis point year-over-year, and partially offsetting the impact of lower net sales volume. Gross margin of 23% was driven by one factor, a higher mix into netted down revenues, which while dampening net sales growth also enhanced gross profit margin. Cloud and SaaS-based revenue streams once again outpaced overall net sales growth. For the quarter, this category represented a high 35.4% of our gross profit compared to 30.7% in the prior year fourth quarter, and was also up from the third quarter's 32.6% level. While we expect the mix of netted down revenues to be an important long-term durable trend within our business, it is important to recognize that this mix may fluctuate with customer priorities and product demand. Turning to expenses for the fourth quarter, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $635 million, down 3.5% year-over-year, prudent and diligent management of discretionary expenses and our overall fixed cost base helped to hold the line on profitability amid the challenging IT spending environment. Co-worker counts at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 15,100, up slightly from the third quarter and flat relative to year-end 2022. We continue to expand our solutions and services capabilities while concurrently driving efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Following along on slide nine, our flexible business model and financial discipline helped to deliver non-GAAP operating income of $519 million, down 0.8% versus the prior year, despite our contraction on the top line. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached 10.3%, up 70 basis points from the prior year, and up 40 basis points from last year's 9.9%. As reflected on slide 10, our non-GAAP net income was $349 million in the quarter, up 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. With fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately $136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was up 2.8% year-over-year. Shifting gears briefly and moving to slide 11 to review full-year results, we experienced a persistently challenging environment in 2023. Uncertainty for our customers caused re-evaluation and optimization of their tech spending, which combined with a marked shift in spending mix led to a full-year decline in our net sales of 10% on both the reported and average daily sales basis. Despite the top-line decline, gross profit was approximately flat, down 0.7% for the year. This gross profit stability exemplifies the impact of our strategy over the last five years with both organic and inorganic investments underpinning the team's ability to pivot to our customers where customers need us, no matter the environment. Enhanced gross margin combined with effective cost controls resulted in a full-year non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.5%, with non-GAAP operating profit dollars similarly down just 0.6% year-over-year. Moving down the P&L, our net interest expense was slightly below our full-year expectations driven by higher interest income earned on our cash balances. Our tax rate was within our expected range. As shown on slide 12, our non-GAAP net income was $1.3 billion, up 0.4%, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $9.88, up 0.9% from the prior year. Moving ahead to slide 13, at period end, net debt was $5.1 billion. Net debt declined by approximately $200 million from the third quarter, reflecting our increased cash position and modest debt repayment during the quarter. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.8 billion. Moving to slide 14, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down four days from the prior year and within our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, particularly with respect to our inventory levels. As we have mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital on any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Strong profits and effective working capital management drove a record full-year adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, as shown on slide 15, representing 106% of non-GAAP net income and well above our stated rule of thumb at 6.7% in net sales. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $83 million to shareholders through dividends and $50 million in share repurchases. For the full year, this translated $322 million in dividends and $500 million in share repurchases. A combined $822 million return to shareholders for approximately 58% of adjusted free cash flow. This was within our initial target range for the year and slightly below our updated range through the stronger than expected cash flow in the fourth quarter. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities on slide 16. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. In 2024 and beyond, we will continue to target a 25% target ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place with targeted net leverage ratio. We ended 2023 at 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of 2022, and within our targeted range of 2 to 3 times. We have rigorous processes in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and shared purchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2024, we will target returning 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. In lockstep with this, we have announced the board's authorization for a $750 million increase to our share repurchase program. Combining our prior authorization with this new additional authorization, we currently have approximately $1.1 million of availability under share repurchase program as we start 2024. And that leads to our outlook on slide 17. The uncertain market conditions we operated under 2023 have persisted into early 2024, and customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent. And while indicators suggest a compelling need to address workload and data growth, rising security threats, and eventual client device obsolescence, our current expectations for a slow start to the year for IT spending and full-year growth in the low single-digit range. With this customer spend scenario as our baseline, we additionally expect to profitably gain 200 to 300 basis points of share in 2024. As you know, when we mix in the netted down solutions, the impact is fully reflected in our gross profit, but it is muted in our net sales growth. Conversely, when hardware volume is strong as we saw on 2021 and 2022, our net sales growth is stronger as these products are counted for on a full gross accounting basis. Given the impact of shifting customer priorities on our net sales and the inherent accounting differences that result from different business mix, we believe that gross profit has become a more effective barometer for gauging our growth expectations. As such, beginning with 2024 and go forward, we will align our outlook with a view on gross profit in lieu of net sales. Based on our current view of mix and margin rates across our portfolio, our expectation for 2024 is for low to mid single-digit gross profit growth. This assumes a flat to modestly higher gross margin relative to full-year 2023. Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be up mid single-digit share of a year. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effects tax rate can be found on slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter, we anticipate gross margin comparable to 2023's level, albeit lower than 2024, and leading to low single-digit gross profit growth on a year-over-year basis. Moving down the P&L, we expect operating expenses to be higher to begin 2024 compared to Q4 as we accrue for a reset of compensation expense that was more muted at the end of 2023, along with other seasonal workforce expenses. We expect operating expense leverage as a percentage of gross profit to gradually improve as the year progresses and expenses even out. Finally, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the low-to-mid single-digit range year-over-year. As we start the New Year, we are also adjusting our approach on the outlook for adjusted free cash flow. Again, given the variability of mix of business and the corresponding impacts on net sales, we believe the relationship between adjusted free cash flow to non-GAAP net income will provide a more consistent metric go forward. For 2024, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income. It is important to note that while we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain environment, remain confident our ability to deliver profitability margins, and cash flow to our stakeholders just as we did in 2023. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one for the brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you and good morning. My first question is just regarding your comments on the weakness in infrastructure products, particularly netcomm products, after a very strong first three quarters with that backlog down, do you get a sense of how long it's going to take in terms of that digestion period from customers and when that might pick up again? Al Miralles : Yes, good morning, Matt. Thanks. This is Al. I would say, Matt, at first, just I think you hit it right. We would expect some headwinds on the netcomm front. I'd say underlying demand is solid with some strength in some pockets, but not significantly strong. The bigger headwind there would really be the compares when you look back in 2023 and particularly the first few quarters, the growth in netcomm was between 20% and 40%. So with those types of growth numbers from 2023, we would expect that we'd see declines at least for the next few quarters. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thank you. And then on the PC demand and client devices, it looked like the year-over-year decline was much better or less worse if you will, in Q4. What are your expectations in terms of client device upgrades? It doesn't sound like you're super optimistic, at least for the first half. So what's the outlook there? Al Miralles : Sure, I'll take that as well, Matt. I think that's right. For at least the first half, what we're calling for is similar trends, what you've seen the last few quarters, that is continued strength and netted down revenues, specifically cloud and SaaS, and we would not see strength on the hardware side, including PCs. What our outlook calls for is a modest recovery in the back half, and that includes PCs. And look, I'll just add the, while we still believe that there is impetus and catalyst for PCs to return, it becomes just basically a matter of when, not if, we think we're a few quarters off from that. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thank you very much. Al Miralles : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam, please go ahead. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thanks. Good morning. I just want to start at a high-level question, maybe Chris or Al could answer. But as we think about CDW from an investor perspective, a lot of us have thought of this as a compounder that generally experiences double-digit earnings growth, with an algorithm of kind of mid-single-digit top line, some leverage, some capital allocation, you kind of get to this double-digit earnings growth. You just finished a year with flattish earnings growth, and then this year, your initial guidance for 2024, I think, is mid-single-digit earnings growth. So I'm just wondering if you could revisit that, and how should investors think about CDW's earnings algorithm? At this level of size and scale, should we sort of reset our expectations and think of this more as a mid-single-digit compounder at this point? Why or why not? Thanks. Al Miralles : Sure. Thanks, Adam. This is Al. Look, I do think that we're in this transitory period, right? We've gone through periods of extremity with the pandemic and with returns that were significant. Obviously, there's been some digestion and quite a bit of mixed shift as we've eased in the post-pandemic period. I would continue to call 2024 a transitory period, right? We are just not seeing the strength or the return to demand on the hardware side of things as customers have essentially decided to ration their spend to items that they believe will optimize their costs, create the greatest ROI, et cetera. That being said, all cycles kind of have their beginning, and we do believe that on the backside of this, there are significant catalysts that will balance things out and include a return to growth on the hardware side. So, I think what you're seeing from our outlook and what you saw in 2023 is something like a transitory period. When we look beyond that and some of the catalysts that we think are on the other side, we believe the returns will look more significant. Chris Leahy : Yes, and Al, thanks. I would just add, if you take a big step back, Adam, what are our customers facing? They're facing proliferating data. They're facing ever-expanding cyber threats, expanding workloads, hardware obsolescence, the incredible promise of new technologies. And so the landscape that they're facing and the essential nature of technology to every single walk of life is not going away. So as we look forward to those catalysts that Al mentioned, think about digital transformation. That's a durable trend, and it's a continuous process, and many customers have really paused on their investment and evolution in 2023. That's going to come back when uncertainty abates. Network modernization continues to be top of mind, and once that digestion gets through the process, then there's only going to be a need to handle greater network traffic and data, et cetera. Security threats continue to grow, and they're more sophisticated, kind of exclamation point. Client devices are just aging, and even the pre-pandemic devices are coming on four years old, and then we've got Windows 10 sun-setting. You've got all of those things that are catalysts that we're going to see coming down the pike, and then just add AI. Still early innings, use cases not quite proven out yet, but we're seeing incredibly exciting opportunities for the services and execution of adoption around those. So I think we couldn't be more excited about the technology industry generally. Adam Tindle : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up, Chris. Obviously, net leverage is about at optimal levels. Cash flow has certainly been a bright spot for the business. Understand the share repurchase authorization today, but wanted to ask more from a strategic M&A standpoint since that's been sort of a core competency of CDW, I would say. As you think on a forward basis, obviously, there's been some moves around you from some competitors moving into some more cloud-based strategic areas. Wondered how you were evaluating or thinking about the strategic roadmap from an M&A perspective. On one hand, I think in the past, we've talked about perhaps expanding more internationally after such strong success with the Kelway acquisition years ago. On the other hand, obviously, expanding strategic capabilities would be another direction. Just -- how you're thinking about a strategic roadmap from here? Thanks. Chris Leahy : Yes, no problem, Adam. Thanks for the question. The vectors you hit would be still consistent with how we're thinking about it, whether geographic expansion, larger acquisitions to bolster capabilities and tuck-ins, which we've been doing. And I would just reiterate, look, M&A is a strategic driver of our value prop and our growth strategy. And you've seen us do 10 acquisitions over the past five years. And those have been very valuable in terms of driving value to our customers. So as we think about where we focus our efforts, driving capabilities and solutions that are high growth and high relevance and in services capabilities, there's a plethora of areas that we could focus, including areas like security and cloud and AI. And so, I would just say, look, at the end of the day, we've said it before, we're always looking, and we've got a number of identified targets in our pipeline, but it also has to be opportunistic. The one thing I would say, Adam, is when you think about the success in evolving our business to be able to deliver the profitability that we did this year with the hardware pressure and the other dynamics happening in the marketplace, that's due to bringing on capabilities that are highly strategic, highly relevant, and then executing against them. So when I think back five years versus now, our cloud business has grown on a compound annual growth basis by 30%, and we did it again in 2023. I look at security, another area that we were very focused on, a maiden acquisition in addition to internal investments, and that business has doubled in three years. So we really are investing behind the most important capabilities, and we're seeing great results as a result. Al Miralles : Adam, let me just add one element you hit it on the front end. We take pride in our ability to compound, and you noted about free cash flow. In the environment we've been in, there's a bit of a kind of hunkering down, focus on margin, focus on cash flow. You'll note that we've increased our cash position. We're excited about what's on the horizon from a capital perspective when we think about the cash optionality we have in front of us, and that would certainly include M&A. Adam Tindle : Make sense. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant of Citigroup. Asiya, please go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for taking my question. How do you guys think about market share gain in the current environment? And if you could maybe peel back a little bit on the gross profit linearity, looks like that's going to be a key metric, and I agree that's the rightful metric. Maybe if you can walk us through the confidence and what's driving the confidence in improving gross profit growth rates from the low single digits at the start of the year, and as you ramp through the year? Thank you. Chris Leahy : Thanks for the question. I'll start on market share gain. Look, we hold ourselves accountable consistently to deliver 200 to 300 basis points above IT market rate of growth, and we have a track record of doing just that, and we are confident that in 2023 we did gain share. If you look at our net sales versus what customers spend with CDW, we've talked about that delta widening significantly, and we're over seven basis points now, so we're very confident that we've taken share, even in this very cautious and uneven market environment, and that's due to team's excellent execution and the value of our full stack full life cycle portfolio. Al, I'll turn it to you for the gross profit question. Al Miralles : Yes, so, Asiya, on the gross profit front, obviously like Chris said, there is a focus in this environment thinking about customer spend, and that spread between customer spend and net sales has been significant. We also feel confident about the continued trend of items such as netted down revenues, which we think will bolster gross margin. There may be a bit of an evening out on the gross margin front in the back -- the back half, as we see additional mix of hardware start to kick in, but all things considered, I think that the seasonality and the pacing of GP would not be dissimilar what you've seen in historical seasonal trends. Asiya Merchant : Okay. And so just to recap, you guys are thinking about some perhaps modest recovery in the second half on client devices, and again, that backdrop, you guys are still kind of thinking about gross profit improving sequentially as you progress through the year? Al Miralles : Yes, I think that is broadly correct on the mixed front in terms of the modest recovery in the back half, and with that, our GP would accelerate through the year. Asiya Merchant : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Amit, please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Good morning, everyone. I have two as well. I guess, Chris, maybe you should stop, but I'd love to understand, as you engage and talk to customers, what are the top priorities from an IT spend perspective in calendar '24? And I'm sure AI is a very hot topic, but the part I'd love to understand is, are the investments for AI, the dollars for that, are they coming from some other bucket, i.e., they're cannibalistic, or are they going to be net incremental to IT budgets? Chris Leahy : Good morning, Amit. And yeah, in terms of priorities, they're consistent with what we said in the prepared remarks. I mean, customers in the commercial space in particular are focused on cost optimization, customer employee experience, and things that revolve around that. There's still a heavy focus on digital transformation, obviously, and security as well. AI, which is where you're getting to, AI is a hyper focus. I think last call, we mentioned that you can't have a conversation with a customer without AI coming up, and it's been very exciting because we've had a data AI practice for several years, and that practice, I would say, we deepened it and we scaled it, particularly when we brought IGNW and Sirius into the CDW family. And currently, I'd say there's burgeoning demand for consultative services in particular, and I'm talking deep technical capabilities as well as industry specific capabilities. And so, we're seeing quite a bit of momentum in our practice there. What I would tell you is that a number of customers are at the front end of their experiences, and we're helping them through use cases and what the efficiencies are to be had. And then we've got customers who are actually piloting some really interesting capabilities, and we're helping them work through those. Here's what we're not seeing. We're not seeing a budget shift out of IT. What we are seeing and hearing is that budgets are coming from elsewhere in the organization, the functional areas that are going to be improved through AI innovation, like HR, like finance, like marketing, literally across the organization. Organizations are using budgets there to allocate to AI improvements because they're thinking about it merely as business transformation. So we haven't seen a shift, and frankly, we're not expecting that to happen. We're very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, though. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you for that. And I guess, Al, if I could ask you a question. Gross margins in '23 are up about 210 basis points. I think if I go from '21 to '22, they're up 0 to 400. I always get a question on like what is the right gross margin range for CDW. But as you look at this performance, maybe for calendar '23, to the extent you can parse that, how much of this do you think the gross margin expansion is secular versus cyclical? And is there a normalized range once you think about gross margins for the company? Al Miralles : Sure. Thanks, and good morning, Amit. Look, if I peel back 2023, three core drivers, the most significant would be the pickup and mix shift, the netted down revenues, and particularly SaaS and cloud. And that was the most significant component. Number two would be that hardware was softer, and therefore that less mix of hardware and particularly PCs benefited us from a mixed perspective. And then three, and we've noted this before, overall product margins were firm in 2023. And so that was a positive contributor to the gross margin story. So if I scroll that forward, which I think is the logical question on it, we expect that the netted down revenue trend is durable and will continue. And particularly, we would know we expect strength in the first half, and then you'll get some balancing out with hardware. Number two, on the hardware front, we are expecting a modest recovery in the back half on hardware, including PCs. So that would have the effective diluting margin somewhat. To be candid, though, we don't believe that that shift in what we're calling modest would significantly move the gross margins. And then finally, on the product margin front, but we studied this closely, and really our assessment at this point would be that product margins are holding firm. And I think that's a reflection of both a competitive environment, but not any rational environment for pricing and margin perspective. And then I've mentioned this before, but there's a trend of, I'll call it richer configurations on the product front, right, customers moving up the value chain. And we do feel like that trend is and will persist. And so really, that's the rationale overall for our outlook on gross margins being substantially similar to 2023, maybe a tick up. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, the line is yours. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Good morning. As we think about AI and understanding it's very nascent still for you guys and the rest of the industry. Is this more of a solution or a hardware or a software or consulting, you know, opportunity for AI and for a CDW? And how does that evolve over the next several years? How should we think about that? Chris Leahy : Yes, it's a great question. I would say currently nascent, the opportunity and the burgeoning demand right now is because of the complexity and the speed and trying to figure out and test use cases. So we are seeing most of the activity for us in our advisory and consulting services. I think I use the word burgeoning. The momentum has been significant. But if you think longer term, this is a full stack play. And that's why CDW is a scaled full stack full life cycle provider with expertise, not just technically, but deep into each industry vertical is positions as well to help our customers. And as you know, when we think about CDW strategy and the growth over the years, we have been moving our capabilities to ensure that we are moving closer to the front end of the value chain. AI is a great example of that strategy and action given the consulting momentum that we've been seeing. But at the end of the day, we're talking about the need for power and consumption and data center enhancements and up and down the stack. So in terms of timing across the next several years, it's hard to say exactly when the various components of the stack will hit. But what I would say is just like any kind of revolutionary technology change, it moves fast and this will move faster. So we're seeing AI as an accelerant in our business and one that we think will play out fairly quickly over the next 24 months. Keith Housum : Great. Thanks. And maybe a follow-up, maybe to touch on a little bit here, but it did occur to you guys to announce some optimization charges within the EPS. So perhaps Al, you can perhaps touch on the genesis of what those items were? Al Miralles : I'm sorry, Keith, can you say that one more time? Keith Housum : Yes. Just when we look at your non-GAAP EPS, we see that you had some optimization charges or restructuring charges in there. Perhaps you can just highlight what those items were made up of? Al Miralles : Yes, sure. So largely, Keith, they would fall in the category of workforce optimization, really two components to that. We did have, as you know, some co-worker events during 2023. And that was really about aligning our fixed cost base and our co-worker count base with the level of the business and activity we were seeing. So that's one, call that more really one-time nature. The other element within that category would be real estate. As you would expect, and you're seeing more broadly, we are and continue to take a hard look at our real estate portfolio, where we are in the hybrid phase, if you will, of our workforce and making sure that we constantly re-rationalize our real estate portfolio. And so there are some charges that are coming through that front. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Al Miralles : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Samik, the line is yours. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And maybe for the first one, if I could just follow up on the AI questions and so the question Amit asked. We understand sort of your comments about being more heavy towards consulting in sort of the early days of these AI sort of discussions with their customers. But when you think of a full stack solution or Envision One in sort of when the customers deploy it, does this even take you further down the road of netted down revenue mix increasing in the overall mix of your business? Or does it really bring back or sort of pull back the netted down revenue mix in terms of balancing out the hardware and the software sales? Just curious about how you see a full stack solution playing out. And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah, I'll start and then Al jump in. You know, I think it's hard to say at this point. What I would say is when we think about AI as a tool to increase productivity and results, just like we say technology is essential to every component of every organization being competitive and winning and delivering on their mission. AI is going to be central to that proposition, because artificial intelligence is going to be embedded in every component and everything that we sell from the edge to the core. And so, however that plays out in terms of how of our customers consume it, how they purchase it and how they consume it, we will be able to deliver across the full stack to them in terms of what that looks like in netted down revenue specifically. Again, hard to really have a crystal ball as to how it's going to play out in that regard. Al, any thoughts on that? Al Miralles : Yes, I think that's right. And Samik, look, we will see exactly how this evolves at this point. Like you said, it is a bit more consultative and maybe services oriented, which is not netted down substantially. Chris hit it earlier. This is ultimately a full stack opportunity for us. And that would certainly include hardware. So we think that will be meaningful. As I would contemplate the netted down component that would likely show up and spend associated with cloud and SaaS. So is it conceivable that we would see that come through? Certainly, it just becomes kind of a matter of when and the pacing and track, if you will, for customers and how they ultimately deploy AI. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. And I have a follow-up. I mean, just curious, given the change we've had here in the inflation backdrop, are you starting to see any changes from the customer side in relation to their discussions around pricing with you or even with the relation to the OEMs themselves? How they think about pricing or are you preparing for a different sort of pricing regime than we've been in the last sort of couple of years? Thank you. Al Miralles : Sure, Samik. I'll start and Chris may want to add. As I think as I mentioned, we have not seen an environment that's irrational on the pricing or the margin front. I would say, ASPs have largely held firm. So, looking forward at this point, we wouldn't see any drastic changes. We're not seeing activities from partners or customers that would suggest that we're going to see any sharp movements up or down. So our outlook is based on the presumption that we'd be largely firm here. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Erik, please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe, Chris, to start off, you know, it's been a few quarters now where you've been clear that the spending environment is challenging. And in some cases, some of that hardware spent hasn't come through in the way that you perhaps thought it was. As you talk to your customers or you look at your pipeline, what is that catalyst that will unlock the recovery in the second half of the year right now? What gives you confidence? What are you hearing or what are you seeing that that allows you to take that view as we sit here today? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Chris Leahy : Yeah, Erik, it's a great, great question. One, we actually face here at CDW. At one point, you know, we do -- we loosen the first strings. Here's what I'd say, two things. One, there's definitely pent up demand. Our customers are ready to start putting plans in action. Two, they're looking to be more confident in the expectations for the rest of the year. So while there have been some more positive indicators currently around the economy, I mean, we still have elevated inflation and elevated interest rates, and they're just merely waiting to feel more confident in where the economy is going. I hate to make it that simple, but, but frankly, it is. But we're also equally confident of the pent up demand and the desire for our customers to get moving on those projects. I'm talking about the commercial space in particular, but get moving on those projects that they have delayed and deferred for some period of time. Erik Woodring : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Chris. And then maybe Al, you know, clearly some puts and takes when it comes to free cash flow, obviously a bit of a changing business mix, depending on the environment that we're in. The new kind of net income to free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, that's a bit lower than it's just been over the last two years. Realize again, puts and takes this year, but if we -- if you could just address anything that we should think about that, that you'd call out this year specifically when it comes to either working capital changes, that would be helpful. But, but really longer term is there a rule of thumb that we should be thinking of for free cash flow conversion is 80% to 90% how we should think, you know, three, five years down the line? And that's it for me. Thanks so much. Al Miralles : Sure. Thanks, Erik. At this juncture, 80% to 90% is the rule of thumb that we would give you. As you recall, we start the years with a prudent view of what that would look like. And we'll see how the years play out. If you look back at the last two years, we were north of 100% on a non-GAAP net income basis. That reflected, I'd say, strong cash profits, strong and diligent management of our working capital, but also the counter cyclical components, right, as growth softened a bit, if you will. So I would say the other element that I would add for 2024, Erik, is the, we don't know exactly how the year will play out and what the pacing of business would look like. And so we try to give a little bit of space for use of working capital. Our inventory is at very low levels. And you can look at that both on a DIO and just inventory balance dollar basis. And so, look, we just want to take a prudent view out of the gates here that we may be more active users of working capital. And certainly we'll update you as the year progresses. And I would just finally just say that it is and will continue to be high priority for us of continue to drive cash flow, convert profits, and ultimately have the optionality in our capital decisions to deploy it. Erik Woodring : Thanks so much. Operator : With that, I'll hand back to CEO Chris Leahy to end. Chris, please go ahead. Chris Leahy : Well, thank you very much, Taylor. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening through your time and continued interest in CDW. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, our strategic progress and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Market conditions remained challenging, and first quarter results came in below our expectations. For the quarter, gross profit was $1.1 billion, 2% lower than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $404 million, down 7%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $1.92, down 6%. In the first quarter, customers demonstrated caution and concern given heightened macro uncertainty, weighing on capital investment decisions. At the same time, the complexities of the tech landscape continued to ratchet up, particularly given the additional layer of AI and changes in the IT market landscape. This lengthened decision-making as customers deliberated on both how to navigate technology road map and when to spend on infrastructure in a challenging economic environment. While activity was reflected in a solid pipeline with deals being pushed out, our sales and gross profit lagged. Results were also impacted by the federal budget stalemate, which led to a pause in our federal channel. Bottom line, while many of these factors are beyond our control, we are never satisfied. And as we do not expect decision cycles to improve in the near term, we remain focused on accelerating pipeline growth and using all of our competitive advantages to take share in this low-growth environment. During the quarter, our teams maintained a high level of engagement, working with customers to implement mission-critical projects, help prioritize and evaluate options, develop multiyear plans and prove out use cases. You see the impact of this in our gross margin, which was a first quarter record and our excellent cash flow, which together reinforce the durability of our underlying profitability and integrity of our strategies. Whatever the market condition, we are laser-focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers. To ensure we continue to deliver on this commitment, we remain resolute in our strategy and continue to invest to ensure we have the capabilities to deliver full stack solutions and services. Broadly speaking, customer priorities included cost optimization, data protection and workforce productivity. This drove focus on security, cloud and as a service as well as client demand and interest in AI. Let's take a look at how all of these priorities impacted performance. First, customer end market performance. Recall, we have 5 sales channels : corporate, small business, health care, government and education end markets, each a meaningful business on its own with 2023 annual sales ranging from $1.6 billion to $9 billion. Within each channel, the teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. Our commercial operations are organized around geographies, verticals, customer size and spend. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered USD 2.6 billion in 2023 sales. These unique customer end markets often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each of them. Corporate top line declined 3% year-over-year. Decision-making further elongated with heightened focus on ROI and a high level of project scrutiny, given interest rate expectations. Cloud and security prioritization continued to drive excellent increases in customer spend and the team capitalized on client device demand and year-over-year client sales were up low double digits. Corporate saw declines in hardware categories undergoing transition and absorbing capacity notably servers and NetComm. Storage, however, was a standout category up double digits, driven by data and workload growth as customers improve efficiency and capture savings from newer solutions. Small business posted a 7% year-over-year top line decline, but with sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter. The team continued to help customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity which drove meaningful increases in cloud and software customer spend. Consistent with corporate NetComm and servers declined and storage increased. Small business continued to be accretive to overall margins. Client devices posted a sequential increase yet remained down year-over-year. Public sales declined 5% from the prior year. Health care declined 2%, transactional performance was positive with an increase in client devices, while solutions declined. Health care performance was similar to commercial with customer caution given the significant focus on cost optimization. Security was also a major focus area, delivering double-digit increases in spend and gross profit. State and local mid-teens increase was more than offset by a decline in federal top line and total government declined 1.5%. State and local performance was broad-based with strength across transactional and solutions categories. Client devices sales increased for the third quarter in a row, up high teens. Public safety remained a key focus area with security up substantially double digits. Cloud adoption continued to gain traction. Federal's mid-teens decline was driven by the congressional budget impact, which was not resolved until late March. Some activity related to existing contracts continued, including client device refreshes, which drove a mid-teen increase, larger-scale network and data center projects paused. Engagement remains strong, and we expect to pick up and spend once agencies are able to allocate their appropriated funds. It continues to be a challenging environment for education and the segment posted a 10% decline. Consistent with recent quarters, higher ed institutions remain focused on doing more with less, and the team posted a mid-teens top line decline. Hardware categories declined across the board, while ongoing focus on cost elasticity led to a strong double-digit increase in cloud. K-12's top line decreased by high single digits. Client device sales increased by low single digits, with some school systems refreshing aged Chromebooks, several funded via normal operating budgets and not stimulus programs. Audiovisual solutions like smart whiteboards and interactive flat panels posted a substantial decline as schools continue to digest purchases from the past several years. Security remained a top priority in both top line and gross profit increased by mid-single digits. Our U.K. and Canadian international operations, which we report as Other continued to experience challenging market conditions and each declined by mid-single digits. Both teams continue to execute well and are leveraging their capabilities to deliver great outcomes for our customers. For the most part, portfolio performance was consistent across customer end markets. Transactional product sales performed somewhat better than solutions and modestly increased sequentially. Both posted year-over-year declines with a greater decline in solutions from the fits and starts of decision-making. At the portfolio level, hardware top line decreased by 4%. Services also decreased by 4% as weakness in services tied to hardware more than offset growth in managed services, which increased by low teens. Even though software net sales declined by 7%, gross profit increased slightly year-over-year. Top line performance was driven by declines in licensed software due to accelerated transitions to SaaS models. Let's turn now to the topic that is getting a lot of attention, AI, and specifically what we are doing for our customers in this space. Right now, most of our customers are at the initial stages of the assessment process, developing and analyzing use cases and adopting data governance best practices to deliver insights and ensure end-to-end security. Essentially, they are exploring the art of the possibility and working through the science of exactly how do we do this. This is exciting work for all of us and our customers. The complexity of adopting AI plays to our strength. We know how to bridge the gap between the promise of technology and transformational outcomes. And since deploying AI drives the need for technology investment across the full stack with entry points across the entire stack, we are uniquely positioned to serve our customers, and we are doing that today. To support our customers as they navigate successful AI adoption, we offer 2 broad areas of consulting services. First, connecting AI to outcomes and ROI, which we call AI discovery, and second, a practical approach to implementing AI, including data governance and security, which we call Master Operational AI Transition, or MOAT. While still early innings, these services are gaining traction. We scoped the broad AI opportunity around 4 areas of focus : workforce productivity, notably end-use assistance and edge devices; high-value use cases; broad-scale vertical solutions; and full stack where customers rely on us to provide the infrastructure underlying applications and solutions. A great example of full stack is the corporate training and development, domain-specific large language model solution we shared with you last quarter. Our broad-scale solutions are vertically based. As you know, we have expertise across many verticals, including health care, financial services in many key industry segments, expertise that enables us to deeply understand the unique needs and challenges faced by organizations in these sectors and tailor solutions and services that directly address their opportunities and pain points. Let's take a look at a couple of the vertical AI examples. First, our AI offering for the K-12 market. AI presents an exciting opportunity to empower teachers and improve learning outcomes, but it must be done very carefully. Our education team has leveraged its expertise and relationships in this field to offer a safe AI platform that is specifically designed for K-12 classroom with a custom large language model that generates responses from embedded educational content, not the entire Internet. The second example is a proprietary CDW health care solution, Patient Room 'Next'. While AI holds the promise of medical breakthroughs, our solution addresses the intense pressure institutions face to manage costs while sustaining high levels of patient outcomes. Our solution combines AI and connected devices to transform patient rooms, improve care delivery and enhance overall health care experiences. The solution is HIPAA-compliant and runs on an end-to-end intelligent platform powered by GPUs, a platform that provides real-time insights from data and automated documentation. One current application serves over 300 beds and builds $4 million in annual licensing. Add to that, the services and equipment we provide for an end-to-end solution like cameras, network connections and servers, and you can see the opportunity this represents to deliver value for our customers and for CDW. Of course, AI will take time to become embedded across our entire customer set, we know that, we have been here before as we've helped our customers adopt cloud. And while the hype cycle is much shorter than cloud, the adoption is very similar. Bottom line, we are here for our customers today and will be there for them in the future as they continue to ramp their efforts. And that leads me to our thoughts on the balance of 2024. You will recall that on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2024 U.S. IT market growth in the low single digits and our target to grow 200 to 300 basis points above market. Despite the slow start to the year, we still see potential for market growth. Let me be clear that we do not expect to demand hockey stick but do see potential for client device refresh and for improved solutions performance. Wildcards include further dampening of capital investment from sustained high interest rates, worsening of geopolitical issues as well as unusual election year uncertainty. As we always do, we will update our view of the market as we move through the year. A hallmark of CDW is to serve our customers wherever their priorities lie. As we look ahead, our customers face a compelling need to address cloud workload growth, protect against increasing security threats, manage an aging client device base and navigate All Things Data as they build out their plans to leverage AI to capture insights and achieve their productivity aspirations. Armed with our full stack, full outcomes, full life cycle portfolio and unique vertical expertise, no one is more prepared to help our customers successfully navigate this period of unprecedented change. With that, let me turn it over to Al. Albert Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with detail on our first quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2024 outlook. Turning to the first quarter. We began 2024 experiencing the same uneven IT market conditions that we faced throughout last year. Caution on uncertainty range, high interest rates and growing pessimism towards the timing of rate cuts but deals under even greater scrutiny and ultimately led to the dampening of capital investment. Customers are evaluating, optimizing their IT spending. And while we actively partner with them to build out tech road maps to support their strategies, the overhang of economic and financial uncertainties as the delay in deliberation and ultimate decision-making, exacerbating elongated sales cycles. During the quarter, we were able to capitalize on demand for client devices as some customers could no longer postpone refresh activity with sales of more complex solutions tied to digital transformation and network modernization were weaker. Notwithstanding, we see the potential for both client device refresh activity to continue and for improved future conversion of our solid solutions pipeline. Moving on to the specific results. First quarter gross profit was $1.1 billion, down 2.4% versus prior year and below our original expectations for low single-digit growth for the quarter. Consolidated first quarter net sales of $4.9 billion were down 4.5% versus prior year on a reported and average daily sales basis. Gross margin increased roughly 50 basis points year-over-year and partially offset the impact of lower net sales. Gross margin of 21.8% was a first quarter record and was broadly in line with both full year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024. First quarter margin expansion was primarily driven by higher mix in netted-down revenues. This category grew by 6%, once again outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 35.1% of our gross profit compared to 32.3% in the prior year first quarter as our teams were successful serving customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. While we continue to expect the mix of netted-down revenues to be an important and durable trend within our business, it is important to recognize that this mix may fluctuate with customer priorities and product demand. However, even with a higher mix of client devices, margins remained firm in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter gross profit was down 7.8% compared to the fourth quarter on a reported basis. On a sequential average daily sales basis, first quarter net sales decreased 4.4%. While first quarter net sales and gross profit are typically lower than the fourth quarter, we had anticipated a more modest sequential decline as early 2024 customer engagement suggested more balanced spending across categories than we ultimately experienced. Instead, the sequential decline this quarter was more in line with traditional seasonality, reflecting continued uncertain conditions impacting the spend of our corporate customers in addition to the congressional budget for laying spending of federal customers. Turning to expenses for the first quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $660 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. Expenses were consistent with the expectation we shared on our last earnings call, with the first quarter higher than the fourth quarter as we reset some of our variable expenses for the year and accrue for other seasonally higher items. This played out as expected, but our expense efficiency ratio was further elevated due to our lower gross profit production for the quarter. As we scroll forward, we continue to manage discretionary expenses prudently and diligently while balancing this against both our expectations for the year and the need to expand our capabilities and drive future growth. Our discipline was also reflected in our coworker count at the end of the first quarter, which was approximately 15,000 and down slightly relative to year-end 2023. Customer-facing coworker count was also unchanged at approximately 10,900. As we expand our solutions and services capabilities, we are concurrently driving efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations intended to fund these investments. Following along on Slide 8, we delivered non-GAAP operating income of $404 million, down 7.1% versus the prior year driven by the combination of our gross profit shortfall and flat expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.3% was down 20 basis points from the prior year. As reflected on Slide 9, our non-GAAP net income was $261 million in the quarter, down 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. With first quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately 136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.92 was down 5.5% year-over-year. Moving ahead to Slide 10. At period end, net debt was $4.8 billion. Net debt declined by approximately $230 million from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting our increased cash position alongside modest debt repayment during the quarter. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion. Moving to Slide 11. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down 2 days from the prior year and slightly below our target range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital particularly with respect to our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Despite profit that was moderately lower than our expectations, effective working capital management drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $364 million, as shown on Slide 12. Over the last 12 months, adjusted free cash flow was 104% of non-GAAP net income, well above our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90%. As we've mentioned in the past, timing will impact adjusted free cash flow throughout the year, but we're pleased with our first quarter performance, and we'll continue to update our outlook on this front as the year plays out. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $83 million to shareholders through dividends and $52 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 13. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio in 2024 growing the dividend in line with earnings. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the first quarter at 2.3x, down from 2.4x at the end of 2023 and within our targeted range of 2 to 3x. We will continue to manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We currently have over $1 billion of availability under our share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook on Slide 14. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023, have persisted into 2024, and customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent. Last quarter, we spoke about a slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending, which has come to fruition and will likely continue in the near-term. However, as we look forward, we continue to see a compelling need to address cloud workload growth, increasing security threats, aging client devices and All Things Data, as we help our customers build out their plans to leverage AI and capture insights and achieve their productivity aspirations. Our updated full year 2024 expectation is for low single-digit gross profit growth, reflecting the slower start to the year. We maintain our view that customers will spend their IT budgets in the upcoming quarters, but within the context of historical seasonality. With this also comes an unchanged expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full year 2023. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be up low single digits year-over-year. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 15. Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter, we anticipate low single-digit gross profit growth compared to the prior year. With no change to our expectation that gross margin will be comparable to full year 2023 and Q1 2024. Our first half/second half split is slightly more weighted to the second half than historical levels in keeping with our expectation for the market. However, we still anticipate seasonal quarterly patterns to reasonably hold, including a lower fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Moving down the P&L. We expect second quarter operating expenses to be moderately higher than the second quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis, but reflecting a more normalized ratio relative to gross profit than we experienced in Q1. Finally, we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be in the low single-digit range year-over-year. For 2024, we're maintaining our expectation for adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income, assuming a higher level of working capital investments to support growth. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam Tindle : I just wanted to start one of the big themes during the tech earnings season is spending on AI as very, very strong and I appreciate all your comments in the prepared remarks. But it's hard not to dovetail that with CDW results here for Q1 that were a little bit weaker than expected and showing a decline in solutions where presumably AI would be reporting. Just figured I'd throw it out there to address any investor concerns that perhaps CDW is not participating in AI spending. What would that thesis be missing and if there's portions of that, that might be fair, things that you can do to capitalize more on AI spending, whether that's organic or inorganic? Christine Leahy : If I could, let me zoom out first and then zoom back into AI. Let me just start with the environment that we experienced in Q1. There are a couple of factors that impacted results in complex solutions results. And look, we had a dynamic in a pretty complex environment that manifested in what I would call fits and starts of both the market and our customers who have lack of certainty and visibility. You take the first economic and financial uncertainty. In other words, the interest rate and inflation environment and that was really the primary driver of the impact for our corporate team and our small business team. And that created an overhang in the environment, which drove what I'll call an uneven market condition situation pretty similar to the trends we saw in 2023. And as a result, our customers remain cautious. They remain prudent, there is relentless scrutiny on deals across the board in the solutions space, in particular, as customers focused on cost optimization and short-term ROI and ultimately, that dampened capital investment in the period. I'd also say to a lesser degree, AI considerations as an added complexity in the deliberation process enter the picture. We're at a real inflection point with AI, critical decision for all of our businesses, understanding what it means to their business and their workforce, what it means to their road map, technology road maps and what the implications for infrastructure are. I just would highlight a couple of other pressure points during the quarter or a lesser impact, but we had some changes in the IT landscape with some consolidation and acceleration into -- as a service, which creates a natural interruption, I would say, in just the customer process. Fed budgets delayed and then the education market is transitioning really back to a more normalized funding mechanism. And the result of all of that was collectively, we had to spend deficits. What I would say is our engagement overall is incredibly strong. I'm really pleased with the engagement, and we are seeing that our value continues to build as we help our customers manage the complex tech environment and a dynamic period, but what didn't happen is the solid pipeline that, that translated into did not then translate into invoicing in the solutions portfolio as it would in a normal operating environment. Now while we have seen the pause on the complex solutions, we are helping customers who need to refresh client actually start doing that. And that's some positive signs in what I'll call a lower risk, lower-friction client [ story ]. But at the end of the day, right, it was solutions that impacted our results overall. Now if I flip to your question on AI, here's what I'd say. Look, we're in the early innings. Some of our customers are advanced, but really most are in an assessment and experimentation stage, and it's going to unfold over time. CDW is uniquely positioned in the space to take advantage of what will be ubiquitous and a full stack opportunity. We know how to take customers on the journey. We've done it before, this art and science of new technologies. We've got the full stack and broad portfolio. So we can help customers at every entry point. And we've got services against the entire part of the stack and across the life cycle. And so we've got the ability to deliver integrated solutions. We also understand our customers' pain points and opportunities given our deep vertical expertise and our intimacy with our customers. So we have created packaged solutions that can scale pretty quickly as well as customized solutions. So you think about it in terms of the choice, we help them identify the best solution, compatibility, developing road maps for integration and cost and value analysis. Now in the areas of opportunity, there are 4 that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and I'll just emphasize those, and then I'll talk about where we're seeing pick up now and what we anticipate going forward. First, in workforce, think productivity tools and assistance. We're the leader here with regard to many of our partners, and there is much interest in workforce AI impact currently. High-value use cases, think horizontal and aligned personas, things like security and customer experience, chatbots that can be deployed horizontally across many of our customers. Think broad-scale vertical applications where they're deeply verticalized and multidimensional and then the full stack infrastructure to underpin the applications and solutions. Now we are leveraging our deep partner relationships to understand and use our customer knowledge to influence our road maps, very similar to what we've done in the past, whether it's cloud or security and to bring to market products that are suitable for -- fit for certain customers. We're expanding our engineering and services capabilities. We're partnering with innovative AI start-ups. And we're developing our own internal experience, which helps us operationally but builds credibility with our customers. Where we sit now, Adam, is primarily a services engagement. We have a lot of activity around those 2 solutions, MOAT discovery that I mentioned. And typically, in those we're finding that customers come to find that their data is not in the shape that it needs to be. And that leads to engagement around data and data governance and data security, et cetera. Over time, we would expect the arc of AI to move from the application layer and the services that we're providing through to inference at the edge and then into the data center. But it's going to be a journey, and we're in the early innings. And we've seen this before play out. We certainly feel absolutely confident that it will be a full stack play and that our strategy and the strength of the partnerships is going to -- we're positioned and are already capturing the ability to navigate our customers through the journey. Adam Tindle : Yes. Complexity is typically good for CDW. That makes sense. Just a quick follow-up, Al, on guidance. The gross profit dollar for Q2 where you talked about low single-digit year-over-year growth. I think if I did the math on a sequential basis, it's like low double digits. And the last couple of years, it's been more like 6% to 8% sequentially, so above the last couple of years. Just given a little bit weaker-than-expected trends in Q1 and not wanting to get into that situation again in Q2, maybe just help us with how you thought about that gross profit dollar guidance in Q2? And is there anything that maybe underpins that sequential growth, whether it was maybe pushouts from Q1 or something like that? Albert Miralles : Yes, sure, Adam. Happy to address that. A couple of things. First, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, look, we feel encouraged by the pipeline that we have and kind of what's out there from a customer spend perspective. And a lot of that would be more in the solutions category as we talked about. So that's number one. The thinking, Adam, is, look, if you look back over history of seasonality -- historical seasonality would be more in like the mid-teens level. And so when we take the sum of the catalysts that Chris mentioned upfront, that is the workload and data growth, the need on the security front and obsolescence of client devices. We think that there's both catalyst there, but also kind of an existing tangible pipeline that we see. And so when you add that together and you think about the context of historical seasonality in the more mid-teens, our Q2 outlook would actually be short of that seasonality modestly, and we think that knowing that Q1 was a slower start, there's a decent pipeline there, and we know that ultimately, our customers have to get back to these critical spend items. We have confidence in ability to get to that level from a seasonality perspective in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess, Chris, I sort of appreciate all your comments about what you're seeing in terms of a challenging sort of customer spending environment. I'm just more curious when I contrast this to last year. Obviously, the challenges or some of the scrutiny on budgets isn't new. But through last year, we did see sort of solutions remaining quite robust, and it was more the transactional business that was sort of impacted. So as you now are starting to see the transaction business open up a bit with the solutions business pullback, any sort of insights or sort of read into -- sort of what the change in customer thinking is? Or what we might be able to see in terms of recovery in that solutions business from the insights you have from the transaction business as well? Just curious on that, and I have a quick follow-up. Christine Leahy : Yes. Let me start on that one. I think what we're seeing now is we talked about the macro environment and the added complexity now of AI as a consideration and as our customers this year are continuing on that kind of pause in deliberation added to it the AI factor, if you will. They are also faced with the need to refresh client devices. And so I tell you what I think we're seeing is a need to go ahead and spend budget on things that they really can't hold off on any more. They'd like to -- they have old devices. They'd like to get over to the new operating system. They want to make sure the devices are available as demand will start to pick up and there's some switching of the budget over to the devices right now. I think that's a behavior we certainly are seeing. In terms of the trend as we go through the year, I'll let Al speak to the outlook and our expectation regarding the outlook. Albert Miralles : Yes, sure. A couple of things I would mention. When we think about the parallel to 2023, look, a year later, a lot of the caution and concern that we experienced has persisted, and I would say, to some extent, in Q1, became even more heightened. And look, there is a mixed story on the economy, but when you think about the financial aspects intra-quarter, we went from an expectation in the market of a number of rate cuts to the potential of now just a few. So there's been quite the whipsaw effect just to give that kind of backdrop, if you will, that is the economic and financial environment continues to get more complicated, Samik, for sure. The other element I would add is on the solutions front a year later, notwithstanding those comments about macro uncertainty persisting. We've got several categories that obviously have gone through pretty significant market transitions and digestion of capacity. And really, it all points back to as the clock moves forward, we get closer and closer to those catalysts that we talked about, that is need for network modernization, need to address workload and data growth and so our confidence on the solutions front is that ultimately, customers will have to act on those things. And I would say, our pipeline reflects a lot of those intended actions just the space that we're in right now is customers are deferring, taking longer, have more decision-makers to get to that solution spend but we know that it's out there. So that would be how I compare the different periods. Look, hopefully, we'll get more economic and financial clarity that will assist. Hopefully, we'll get further down the path of customers thinking about what their IT road maps will look like in this era of AI. And then we do believe that we would see more balanced spending across both solutions and transactions. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. And Al, a quick follow-up for you. Just in terms of expectations for the gross margin as we progress through the year, you sort of get to 21.8% in 1Q, you're guiding to a similar number for the full year. Is it going to be pretty similar through all 4 quarters as you sort of see solutions spend improving maybe through the year, but client devices being a headwind on that margin? Like how should we think about progression here? Albert Miralles : Sure, Samik. For the full year, I would say, we're holding to our expectation on gross margin that we gave, which was that it would be similar to 2023 all in. I think there's going to probably be some variability quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, most notably driven by mix, but at this juncture, we would hold to those expectations. Certainly, given that the mix has shifted a bit in Q1 and we saw stronger client device growth and less solutions, you'd expect that, that would have some impact on our gross margin. But I would say when we think about the contribution of netted-down revenue, which we think is durable that's helped to hold those margins. And so at this juncture, we're holding to that expectation of that kind of high 21s gross margin similar to 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I have, I guess, a question and a follow-up as well. When you folks talked about the hardware categories, one of the things that really stood out was storage performance was fairly good. I'm curious like historically speaking, the storage seems to be a leading indicator for what you see eventually with NetComm and servers or not. I'd love to kind of understand from a software perspective is storage is a better indicator. And then maybe related to that, the NetComm weakness, do you think it's more inventory digestion at this point? Or is it really demand is weak? Christine Leahy : Amit, it's Chris. I think what we're seeing with storage right now are a confluence of 2 things. One, we had a number of customers who are investing in networking and implementing networking over the last few years and storage is kind of coming -- storage kind of what's the next investment, if you will. So we're seeing positive results there. The other thing is we've got some new exciting products out in the market, and that's always appealing to our customers. So that's really what I think is driving the storage growth in this period. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then I guess, Al, just for you on capital allocation, the buybacks were fairly minimal in the quarter given how the free cash flow generation was and the fact that leverage is towards the lower end of the 2 to 3x range that you folks talk about. How do we think about buybacks for the rest of the year? And is the intent to perhaps show up some capital or cash for the debt paydown that you might have to do by the end of this year and early next year? Or would you use it for buybacks? Albert Miralles : Look, we will continue to do what we've done in terms of balancing both the strategic and tactical elements on the capital allocation front. And I think, look, I think 2023 is probably a good guidepost for you in terms of what that looks like. At any given time, we're going to look at all the elements of the -- what's going to provide the best short-term return, how do we feel about the valuation front, and where do we get the most strategic value. I think the opportunity for us on it in 2024 is we'll continue to be patient and opportunistic. But with $800 million of cash on the balance sheet, I'd say, pretty consistent track record here of cash flow generation. We feel like we've got plenty of opportunity and optionality to be able to create value across all 4 of the priorities in our capital allocation scheme. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Matthew Sheerin : Chris, I hope you can elaborate more on what you're seeing in the government sectors. You talked about budget-related pushouts in federal. So -- and I know there's obviously some seasonality, particularly in the September quarter. So what should we expect in terms of the seasonality across those markets? Christine Leahy : Yes. On federal, I'd tell you that the federal budget delay, which was about -- pushes things out by about 6 to 8 weeks, creates a pretty much a complete pause. But once the budget was implemented, then the trickle-down effect starts to happen and the money is making its way to the agencies. We have seen, I'll call it, very strong activity in both projects and programs that were ready to go, and that's been a positive and very strong activity and those that will take a little while to get through the pipeline.  So what I would say, Matt, is as we think about seasonality back to the full year landing more on what you'd see as a federal seasonal year with it being more back-end loaded. And remember, sometimes when you get pushed out by a quarter or so in terms of the government decision-making, oftentimes, you just need to get the PON by the end of the year. So it's possible we see some of it pushed even into the following year that January sometimes happens. But what I would just tell you is, we knew it was coming. We've been working with the customers, poised to start moving the orders, and I feel quite good around federal playing out seasonally for the year. Matthew Sheerin : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, concerning the client device demand that you're starting to see pick up, are you seeing any interest or traction on AI-enabled PCs yet? Or is that still early? Christine Leahy : Matt, I would say it's still early. And when we look at the units that we're selling now, really minimally AI PCs. They're the Win 11 and Apple next generation. And the impetus is really threefold. It's just refresh aging machines get to Win 11, frankly. And it's also an interest in getting ahead of any increasing demand. We are finding customers having longer memories when it comes to the pandemic and remembering that sometimes just in time doesn't work because you got to stay ahead of the supply. So that's also been a factor in the positive signs that we're seeing. I'd also say, look, I mentioned it before, it's a low-friction purchase and it's kind of no regrets. When you put together aging machines, the need for Win 11 with that kind of stable landscape, customers are just starting to move forward. The AI PCs will come. There is interest. There's a lot of talk with customers, a lot of talk around which personas are they best going to be used for. But right now, what we're -- what our partners are providing have ample compute power to handle the AI that is in current form. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Chris, maybe I'd love if you could maybe unpackage some of your pipeline comments a bit more. Outside of federal, if we put that to the side, you mentioned broad pushouts. But can you maybe clarify anything you're seeing in terms of customer set or products where you're seeing this behavior most acutely? Are you seeing any cancellations is to push up behavior this quarter, any more notable than past quarters? And is it as simple as the macro is the key factor here that can unlock this spend? Or are there any other factors that you see here when you speak to your clients, where they say, listen, we just have to refresh these devices, for example, where we have to modernize our data center infrastructure? And then I have a quick follow-up. Christine Leahy : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. Let me just start with where you ended. And I would say, as we've suggested, the macro overhang really is the predominant factor in the extended and elongated sales cycles. What we're not seeing is we're not seeing cancellations. We're seeing just more deliberation and greater time and more involvement, frankly, by more business unit constituents in the decision-making process. And as I said, the AI consideration is a real thing. It's a bit of a pause. How do we think about this over the long term? As you know, the progress, the speed with which AI functionality is moving is really fast and they're taking that into consideration. But I would say that the -- it feels very similar to 2023. And as Al mentioned, I mean, this quarter, we created more uncertainty in some ways than we saw in certain quarters last year. So it's not that dissimilar. And it really does have to do across what I'll call, complex solution sets. Remember, we don't really have customers buying point products per se. We are seeing in some areas of server, for example, refresh. We're just at the point where customers need to refresh, and we're figuring out how to do that or potentially starting to move some things to cloud. But I would just characterize it very similar to the trend from last year. Albert Miralles : And maybe, Erik, just adding on to that and to kind of stitch the story together. We talk about these catalysts. Within those catalysts are plenty of opportunities from a solutions perspective. I think that what we saw transpire is this kind of heightened caution and concern kind of the -- as you can see what's around the corner phenomenon, if you will, from a corporate perspective just caused more delay in deliberation. And then to Chris' point, you add on AI and the complexity of the -- what is it ultimately going to mean for these customers' infrastructure environments, and it's just more impetus to say, let's take a little time. And I think the corollary there, Erik, would be that we had a pickup in client device, and it was literally across our end markets. And so we would have said that, that was a catalyst that was out there, and that was a catalyst that started to see some free up, call it modest but some free up of spend in that regard because despite it being a catalyst kind of been held back before, it really was the lowest friction choice for customers. And so that's how the quarter played out. Christine Leahy : Yes. And I would just add that the durable categories we've seen over the last several quarters are security and cloud. Erik Woodring : Okay, very helpful. And then just maybe a clarification, quick follow-up is, you mentioned expectations at least for 2024, U.S. IT market growth to be relatively similar. You did guide to low single-digit gross profit growth versus low to mid-single-digit growth last quarter. So that would presume weak gross margins would be a bit weaker than when you guided 90 days ago, but Al, you reiterated kind of the expectation for similar gross margins to 2023. So can you just help me maybe on package what is the main factor that is causing the gross profit dollar? The slight change in gross profit dollar growth guidance for 2024? And that's it for me. Albert Miralles : Yes, Erik, a couple of things. So look, from just working from the -- from a customer spend perspective, we're calling for low single digits plus our typical premium. So that's come off a bit. And if it were coming off in a category, that would probably be substantially from a solutions perspective. That is the slow start that we experienced in Q1. We're not suggesting we're going to make that up. So that comes off the top. And then that's basically just kind of works its way down to GP. We're getting an earlier start to client device, at least for the first quarter than maybe we would have anticipated. So while that doesn't help from a gross margin perspective, it certainly does help from a gross profit perspective, right, because you're getting the volume. And I think if you look down our P&L for the quarter, you'd see the delta on net sales was closer because we saw more from a client device perspective. So there are some puts and takes within that. But I'd say, we're in the range of -- with solutions being a little lighter, client being a little stronger and frankly, continued durability of netted-down revenues, there's not much of a change there on the gross margin front. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vogt from UBS. David Vogt : I just want to come back to maybe a longer-term kind of discussion on AI and some of your hardware categories. As you guys look out maybe beyond this year into '25 as traction starts to really accelerate in AI, how are you thinking about sort of the uplift in maybe configurations, ASPs? And how does that flow through your business? So for example, obviously, AI PC, there's a lot of discussion of having considerably higher price points. The same obviously holds true, I think, with AI-enabled optimized servers. So just trying to think about how you're thinking about that as it impacts your business, maybe not this year but in '25? Albert Miralles : Yes, David, I'll take this. Look, I think TBD, to some extent, right, we're going to see how pricing plays out. What I would tell you is in current context, we're not seeing much in the way of ASP changes. I'd say prices broadly, including on the client device front, held pretty firm. So our growth during the quarter was largely units. Certainly, there is plenty of buzz out there that as we start to see AI PCs and other AI categories emerge that you could see price increases. But I'm not sure that we're fully prepared to kind of call on what that would look like. Just remember for us, look, we're going to work closely with our customers as we are now, and we'll continue to in terms of how do you navigate that landscape, how do we help them get in front of it to the extent that they can. But also remember that for us in terms of kind of impacts, any lift there on the ASPs may lift the top line but we're largely still very much a cost-plus provider, so you may not see significant movement from a gross margin perspective. David Vogt : Got it. So just to clarify, obviously, wouldn't be subject to ASC fixed accounting, these would be grossed up revenue and then the commensurate gross profit dollars associated with the revenue, correct? Is the right way to think about it? Albert Miralles : As we understand it now, and what the new product generations would look like, I think that's true. Operator : We currently have no further questions. I will hand it back over to Chris Leahy, Chair and CEO, for final remarks. Christine Leahy : Thank you. And let me close by reemphasizing my confidence in this team, our strategy and the durability of our resilient business model. Thank you to our CDW coworkers across the globe for your unwavering commitment to our customers. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Chris Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and view on the second half of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Second quarter market dynamics played out roughly as we expected. Cautious customer behavior once again, elongated sales cycles and drove prioritization of needs over wants and cost savings over expansion. Capital investment in complex solutions, particularly those tied to data center and network modernization continued to be downsized or put on hold, and there was growing refresh activity in client devices. What was not expected were two end-market specific dynamics, a worsening in the UK environment and further federal funding challenges. Within the limited demand environment, we continue to help our customers build out technology roadmaps and our pipeline remains solid in the solution space. Conversion remains challenging with uncertainty weighing on our customers' appetite to spend. The team's value as a trusted adviser and ability to deliver solutions that met our customers' most pressing priorities drove excellent performance across cloud, security and services. Performance that contributed to strong profitability and cash flow, performance made possible by the strategic investments we have made over the past five years to bring full stack, full lifecycle solutions to our customers. For the quarter, the team delivered gross profit of $1.2 billion, flat year-over-year with a gross margin of 21.8%, up 80 basis points, net sales of $5.4 billion, which were down 3.6%, non-GAAP operating income of $510 million, down 3.7% with a non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.4%, which was flat and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50, which was down 2.6%. Let's take a look at this quarter's performance drivers. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Recall, we have five sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education, each a meaningful business on its own with 2023 annual sales ranging from $1.6 billion to $9 billion. Channels are further segmented to focus on customer end markets including geography, verticals, customer size and spend. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.6 billion dollars in 2023 sales. These unique customer end markets are typically uncorrelated given the different economic and external factors that impact each of them. Our second quarter results provide a good example of this. Corporate posted a net sales decline of 2%. Robust increases in cloud and security supported profitability with a meaningful increase in gross margin. Client devices increased for the second quarter in a row and posted both year-over-year and sequential sales increases of low double digits. Notably, client device ASPs held firm with a mix into higher value, higher functionality units. Once again, servers and netcomm declined as customers continue to undergo technology transitions in its real capacity. Storage was a standout category increasing double digit driven by upgrades of legacy systems. Small business net sales declined 3%. The team's ability to help customers address mission critical priorities around security and productivity with cost-effective software and cloud solutions contributed to improvements in both gross profit and margin. Small business did not see significant refresh activity and while increasing mid-single digit sequentially, client devices declined slightly year-over-year in the quarter. Consistent with corporate ongoing postponement of infrastructure investments in netcomm and servers drove low double-digit declines. Public sales declined 2% in the quarter with mixed performance by end market. Government decreased 6% as growth in state and local was more than offset by a decline in federal. Federal results were further impacted by the delayed fiscal 2024 budget authorization as several key customers did not receive funding releases until late June, weeks later than expected. These released funds face processing delays from the normal gears of government as hardware and software orders require solicitation, competitive bids and evaluation. We know that ongoing projects will eventually move forward, but some agencies may pause new projects as they await the clarity around the next administration's priority. In light of these layers of friction and uncertainty, we do not expect a federal catch up in the back half of 2024. The state and local team had another solid quarter, up mid-single digits. Security remained a key performance driver. Client devices increased by mid-single digits both year-over-year and sequentially. While early state and local budget dollars are being allocated to improving citizens experience at state and municipal agencies, including enhanced AI-powered automated response and messaging platforms. Healthcare net sales were flat. Security remained a key focus area and the team delivered robust customer spend and gross profit growth, led by security assessments for cloud migration and identity management. Driven by refresh, client devices increased by double digits. The team's ability to deliver cloud migration, including moving applications out of hospital data centers, drove excellent cloud performance and contributed to both increased gross margin and profitability. Education sales declined roughly 1%. K-12's top line was roughly flat year-over-year while profitability grew. For the second quarter in a row, client device sales increased up mid-single digits as school systems refreshed aged Chromebooks. Security and cloud remain top priorities, both delivering strong growth and gross profit. Once again, collaboration hardware, primarily smart whiteboards and interactive flat panels, declined meaningfully as schools continue to digest significant purchases made over the past several years. With the sunsetting of ETF funds and upcoming deadlines for ESSER funds of September 30th, the team is focused on helping their customers pivot to refresh programs funded through traditional mechanisms. Consistent with recent quarters, higher ed institutions remained focused on investments to enhance student experience to drive enrollment, while doing more with less, and the team posted a mid-single-digit top-line decline. Cost elasticity continued to drive strong double-digit growth in cloud. Security remained a top priority, up strong double digits and client devices returned to growth in the quarter, up high single digits driven by refresh. Our UK and Canadian international operations, which we reported other, declined 13%. While both teams continue to execute well, the demand environment, particularly in the UK, worsened during the quarter as the early general election amplified already challenging conditions. UK sales declined high teens in US dollars and Canada declined 4% in US dollars. Given current conditions, we expect the UK market to remain volatile and under pressure through the back half of the year. As you can see, the diversity of our end markets results is fundamental to the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Category performance demonstrates the benefit of our second performance driver, our broad and deep portfolio of products and solutions. Transactions categories increased during the quarter while solutions categories declined. Both transactions and solutions increased sequentially in the quarter. At the portfolio level, hardware decreased 5%. High single-digit client device growth and mid-single-digit steward growth was more than offset by meaningful declines in netcomm and collaboration. Software customer spend increased mid-single digits while net sales were impacted by our strong mix into netted down revenue and decreased by 1%. Services increased by 6% driven by cloud and security-related services. Once again, cloud was an important performance driver, contributing double-digit gross profit growth across software, services and security. Profitable growth that was enabled by the strategic investments, both organic and acquired, we have made in solutions and services capabilities over the past five years. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, our three-part strategy for growth, which is; first, acquired new customers and capture share; second, enhanced our solution of capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage the solutions our customers want and need in any environment. Let me share an example of our strategy and action as we delivered on a customer's priority in today's challenging demand environment. An insurance company faced early end of life for its hyperconverged infrastructure equipment, something not contemplated in their already tight budget. Armed with our broad and deep cloud portfolio, our cloud, hybrid infrastructure and services group collaborated to architect a cloud subscription-based solution that delivered cost elasticity, the customer's budget could absorb. The multi-faceted solution seamlessly moved on-premise workloads and data to the public cloud, delivered cloud compute, migrated custom and off-the-shelf applications, created a virtual desktop infrastructure and delivered security measures with virtual firewalls. Plus, it optimized workloads to ensure the customer effectively managed CPU usage, memory and storage, further mitigating costs. This comprehensive solution generated more than $1 million in product revenue and a multi-million dollar CDW professional services engagement. After seeing our cloud expertise in action, the customer engaged us for additional cloud solutions, including identity management and unified cloud call center ongoing managed services. Today, we were one of the customers' most valued strategic partners. A great example of how we're delivering value to our customers both for today and for the future. And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. You will recall that on the last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2024 U.S. IT market growth in the low single digits. And our target to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market. This factored in a modest improvement in demand conditions in the second half of the year. Given real-time feedback from our large and diverse customer base, we now expect current market conditions to persist throughout the year, not get worse, but not get better. Given the market's slow start to the year, without a second-half demand pickup, we now look for U.S. IT market growth up towards the lower end of a low single-digit range. We continue to maintain our target to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market. Growth will return. The demand drivers are there. Workload and data growth, increased security threats, client device obsolescence, and adoption of AI-powered assistance and applications. But customers need greater clarity and confidence, clarity around economic conditions and clarity around the impact of AI on their tech roadmap, and confidence that investments made today will deliver the right foundations and economic returns in an AI-powered future. Improved demand conditions are a function of when, not if. Wildcards for the balance of 2024 include the potential of greater macro and geopolitical uncertainty, significant degradation of market conditions in the UK, as well as unusual uncertainty in the U.S. election. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions as we move through the year. Whatever the market conditions, we will remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers, gaining share and executing with the discipline and rigor that is CDW's hallmark. And we will continue to play the long game, holding steadfast in our commitment to executing against our growth strategy to ensure we have the solutions and services capabilities our customers need to achieve their mission critical outcomes. With that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al Miralles : Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our Q2 performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our updated 2024 outlook. Second quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion is roughly flat, up 0.1% versus the prior year. This is modestly below our original expectations for low single-digit growth for the quarter as the aforementioned strength in cloud, security and services was offset by lower demand for netcomm and collaboration hardware. Consolidated second quarter net sales of $5.4 billion were down 3.6% versus the prior year on both reported and average daily sales basis and up 11.3% sequentially, driven by seasonally higher demand in education channels and government channels and especially pursuant to client devices. Gross margin increased approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin of 21.8% was flat quarter-over-quarter and broadly in line with both full-year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024. Second quarter year-over-year margin expansion was primarily driven by the higher mix in the sales, where CDW acts as agent, also known as netted down sales. This category grew by 8.7%, once again, outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 33.2% of our gross profit, compared to 30.6% in the prior year's second quarter. Year-over-year expansion came from our teams continuing to successfully serve customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. The netted down category of solutions represents an important and durable trend within our business, contributing to our ability to deliver enhanced gross margins. It is important to note that netted down sales growth and its impact on our mix of business will fluctuate over time with customer priorities and product demand. Second quarter gross profit was up 11.3%, compared to the first quarter of 2024 on both reported and sequential average daily sales basis. While second quarter sequential net sales and gross profit growth were higher than the sequential growth rate seen in the last few years, they were very modestly behind our own expectations, as well as historical seasonal upturn we experienced in pre-pandemic years. This reflected two factors, longer-than-expected delays in spend from our federal customers related to the prior congressional budget impasse and lower performance by our UK business, which is impacted by volatility in the economic and political climate. Turning to expenses for the second quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $673 million, up 3.2% year-over-year. Expenses were roughly consistent with the expectation we shared on our last earnings call, including expense efficiency ratio more in line with normal levels. The improvement from the first quarter reflected higher gross profit attainment and relatively lower level expenses on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was approximately 15,200, up slightly over the first quarter and year-end. Customer facing coworker count was also slightly up at approximately 11,000. Our goal is to balance driving growth and exceptional customer experience with efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $510 million, down 3.7% versus the prior year, driven by the combination of roughly flat gross profit and moderately higher expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.4% was flat to the prior year and up from 8.3% in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $339 million in the quarter, down 2.9% on a year-over-year basis. The second quarter weighted average diluted shares of 135.6 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.50. Moving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $5 billion. Net debt has declined by approximately $93 million since year-end 2023, primarily reflecting our increased cash position alongside modest debt repayment. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.9 billion. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, up three days from the prior year, but still at the lower end of our targeted range of high-teens to low-20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including active management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted free cash flow was $138.4 million in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and seasonal business trends. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $503 million, an 84% of non-GAAP net income within our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90%. First-half performance puts us on track to meet our 2024 objectives. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $202 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio in 2024. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We ended the second quarter at 2.4 times within our targeted net leverage range of two to three times. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our three-part strategy for growth. Year-to-date, we've utilized over $250 million of cash on share repurchases and have over $830 million remaining under our current share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023 have persisted well into 2024. Customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent across end markets, particularly in the commercial, international and federal channels. Last quarter, we spoke about the slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending and shared our expectations for tough conditions to persist in the near-term, but to modestly improve in the second half. At the same time, we noted a compelling need for our customers to address cloud workload growth, increasing security threats and aging client devices. These priorities continue to resonate with customers and were brighter spots in the second quarter, while uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware. Given these market conditions, our updated full-year 2024 expectation is for flat-to-low single-digit gross profit growth, a view that incorporates both our slower start to the year and our view that the mild recovery we anticipated in the second half is not likely to materialize. This leads to seasonality roughly in line with historical levels, with the first half contributing approximately 48% of net sales and gross profit. We maintain our expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full-year 2023 and much like we've seen throughout the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be flat to up slightly year-over-year. Please remember we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. We anticipate low single-digit gross profit growth compared to the prior year with no change to our expectation that gross margin will be comparable to full-year 2023 and the first half of 2024. This leads to roughly normal seasonality, compared to historical levels and also the moderately lower second quarter base. We continue to expect the fourth quarter to be meaningfully lower, compared to the third quarter, principally due to seasonally lower demand from education and government customers. Moving down the P&L. We expect third quarter operating expenses to be moderately higher than the third quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis given the higher gross profit performance, but at a similar ratio relative to gross profit. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year. For full-year 2024, we are maintaining our expectation for adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income. We currently sit comfortably within that range. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Amit, your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe, just to start with, if I look at your core gross margin, the gross profits excluding netted down revenues, it was up fairly, nicely, sequentially and really flat year-over-year despite what seems like a much higher mix of PCs in the quarter. Could you just talk about what is enabling the sequential gross margin expansion in June for your core business and if there's a structural change to what PC margins may look like going forward? Al Miralles : Yes. Thanks, Amit. Good morning. I'll take that question. Nothing too significant there to report, Amit. I would just say that, within the array of the product sectors, we did see strength in storage in a couple other categories that supplemented our client device margins. And then further, I would note that on the client device side of the house, we continue to see firm margins there including, and Chris alluded to this, kind of a higher mix in the kind of premium product, if you will. So, overall, we continue to see an environment, where product margins appear to be holding up. And obviously, as you pointed out, they are further supplemented by the growth that we continue to see on the netted down revenue stream side. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then, yes, I guess, Chris, could you just talk about, if I think about it at the start of the year, the expectation was for gross profit dollars to be up mid-single digits and it kind of went to low single digits and now, it's kind of flat to low. Is this downward revision that you made, is it really around what's happening to the PC recovery and how that's become a bigger part of the mix. Or are there other factors Let me see. How do you weigh the downtick in revisions over the last couple of quarters? And is there any change in how you forecast your forecasting philosophy as you go forward related to that? Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes. Good morning, Amit. Thanks for the question. As we think about, let me start with the first part of that question, the outlook, and I'll just walk you through. I mean, at high level, that our outlook, incorporated a modest uptick in the second half demand of 2024. And that change really reflects, that we think current market conditions will persist. I think, I said not get worse, excuse me, but not get better. And that's just based on our market intelligence with our customers and our frontline coworkers. If you want to go through the puts and takes, look, when we start with corporate after a long period of fits and starts, and what I'll call uneven performance, corporate feels on more solid footing and is demonstrating a steadier rhythm to the business. That said, with signs of stability, it's still a bit too early to call and to bake that into the expectation in the back half of the year. Just need to see a couple more data points to build confidence on that one. Small business, I'd say not getting worse, not quite as volatile, but still bouncing along the bottom, so not seeing an uptick there. And then we've got these two end markets that had very unique impacts and we think will impact going forward. The UK, the degradation in the UK that I mentioned in the environment there, which impacted the second quarter and expecting impact the second half of the year. And then the federal gears of government, these two delays are just creating, frankly, a bottleneck that's not overcomeable at this point, on the federal side. And so, we don't expect to see a pickup back in the second half of the year in federal as we expected to. So, I just say that the outlook net-net reflects that there's no substantive change in the commercial market demand. It incorporates normal seasonality and it also includes, I guess, a moderate IT refresh across primarily client devices and some other solutions that can't be postponed. So, that's the way that we're thinking about the outlook. I think you asked a question on forecasting. And I would just say that on the forecasting, look, the team is doing a phenomenal job staying highly-engaged with our customers and pivoting, when needed. As you can see from our results, security cloud, software services results, it's very clear that we -- our portfolio and our people allow us to be the trusted adviser and support in the moment in the market type solutions. The forecasting is, yes, it's a little bumpier. because you've got lumpy - lumpy-big deals and they're all interrelated. There's no the example that I shared during the script. You see how interrelated and complex the solutions are. So, as those push, they push. but I think the team's doing a great job staying engaged with customers. And I would also say that our solutions pipeline is really quite strong. It's been the conversion given the market that is reflecting the appetite to buy, but the pipeline is really quite strong. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, your line is now open. Matthew Sheerin : Yes. Thanks. Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the commentary regarding the continued slow demand for netcomm and servers, advanced solutions products. This is probably the third quarter that we're into that malaise. I know there was a lot of backlog that was worked down. Are you seeing any visibility of signs of pickup there. And then on the server side, we're hearing, particularly, SMBs and middle markets, where there's more an acceleration toward cloud instead of doing their own internal upgrade. So, any visibility into those markets? Chris Leahy : Yes. I would say on the networking side, there's certainly interest from customers on network modernization. That is a high priority. but there is still significant digestion going on. The supply chain is normalized, but we still have customers that are digesting what they purchased or actually received, I should say, later in the cycle. I think as we get back to the back half of the year, the overlaps will look a little bit different and so the performance will likely look a little bit different. But I would just say it's high priority. There's just still a lot of excess at our customers that they're digesting. On the server side, on the mid-market server side, we are seeing some strength in that area. but again, it's subject to our customers really, being cautious about where they're spending and pivoting a little more to cloud and elastic advisable solutions at this time. Matthew Sheerin : Okay. Thank you. And then regarding the outlook for the government business, it doesn't sound like there's going to be that seasonal uptick in federal, yet you're guiding the overall company for a seasonality in the next couple of quarters. So, are there any offsets to that weakness in federal. Al Miralles : Good morning, Matt. I would just note, look, we are still going to see reasonably normal seasonality from the government business. And remember, there's significant strength there on the state and local side of things. So look, even in the quarter, state and local offsetted some of that compression from a federal perspective. So, I would say it's all in the realm of regular normal seasonality for government, with just a downtick a bit in federal for Q3 and Q4. Matthew Sheerin : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, your line is now open. Keith Housum : Great. Good morning. Just one question really. In terms of the CrowdStrike debacle that happened recently, was that a positive or negative for you guys in terms of working with your customers. Chris Leahy : Oh, Keith. Thanks for the question. First of all, it was CDW didn't impact us that much, which was great. But I'll tell you, I'm really proud of this team. They were so quick to help customers do boot-refixes and workarounds and essentially, get after customers immediately. So, it just reinforced, I think, the fact that we have such strong relationships with our customers and that the trust adviser role is so important. Once you do a transaction with a customer, it's not one and done, but this just reflected the fact that the aftercare and the relationship ongoing is so important. So, it was a very unfortunate, obviously, circumstance across the world, but really proud of the team for stepping up and stepping in with our customers. Keith Housum : Yes. If I can follow-up on that, is that an opportunity for you guys to gain customers by showing exactly the experience and advisor leadership you guys have. Chris Leahy : Oh, absolutely. Yes. So, in circumstances like this, when we have been able to help, when there's a particular issue that's popped up that absolutely goes back and across the sales organization, we take it to other customers to help highlight potential vulnerabilities and then help them resolve those. Keith Housum : Great. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Same in the security space. That's what we do. Operator : Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant of Citigroup. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for taking my question. If I could -- if you could just double click a little bit on the OpEx intensity, where is CDW spending these U.S. -- spending these operational expense dollars on. and how we should think about the trajectory of those expenses as it relates to your overall revenue or gross profit dollar growth in the back half. Thank you. Al Miralles : Sure. Good morning, Assia. A couple of things that I would just note. Number one, remember when we started the year, we indicated that we would have expected the beginning of the year would reflect higher level of expenses than usual and a ratio of SG&A relative to GP would ease as the year played out. Asiya, some of that is a function of just timing and seasonality of certain expenses that we see in the first half, some of it a function of our lower GP production -- gross profit production in the first half. And then just from a compare perspective, I would just note for you that, that last year obviously was a pretty uneven year, if you will. And pretty early in the year, we saw indications that our outlook was coming down. So that has an impact on the timing and our judgments with respect to things like compensation accruals. So, because of that, when you add it all together, our first half, we look a bit more shifting towards deleverage from an expense perspective. And what you should expect in the back half is that, that would ease, that would balance out obviously as our gross profit attainment would be higher. but also, you get a bit kind of a pickup from a seasonality timing of our expenses as well. So, for the full year, we expect it would look reasonably normal. The back half is going to look a lot different than it did in the first half vis-\u00e0-vis operating leverage. Asiya Merchant : Okay. And if I may, just you've talked about a strong pipeline here for your customers. Help us understand how you think about that pipeline conversion to revenues. I understand it's the federal impact and the macro, and the UK. But if you could just as you think about more into, let's say, the next 12 months ahead post-calendar \u201824, how are you thinking about that pipeline conversion. And how would you think about CDW's trajectory of growth ahead. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yes. well, we think about the pipeline -- excuse me, we think about the pipeline, starting first, in terms of engagement with our customers and staying very close to our customers and doing and suggesting solutions that are best for them. In a market now, where cost optimization is high and needs are prioritized over once. A CDW is very careful to help our customers accommodate that, which might mean that not new and not growth revenue, but revenue that is finding cost optimization for them. All that said, what we do in an environment like this is we work hard to increase the pipeline to ensure that when it's time to convert, it's sufficient to drive growth. We do all the things that we do with a lot of rigor. We inspect the pipeline. We grow the pipeline. We measure the pipeline. We drive conversations with our customers. It's really just the appetite to convert at this point that we're not seeing. Now as I said, what has been very positive is the rhythm of the business feels, feels more stable, feels a little more firmer footing. and I think that's a good indicator of moving to more solid footing, which means a pipeline converting it in the not-too-distant future, which will convert into growth. Asiya Merchant : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, the first question I'll ask to Al and it's another question on gross margins. When you look at the core business margins, ex-netted down items, looks like in fiscal 2Q that grew by 40 bps to about 15.7%. Can core business margins continue to grow for the remainder of the year? I guess, Al, my question is the gross profit for the year is lower, is that because the mix of netted down items is lower, or do you think the gross margin of the core business is also lower? Al Miralles : Sure. Thank you, Ruplu. Look, for the full year, we are calling for gross margins to look much like the first half did and frankly then much like 2023 in total. What you can expect there is continued durability and trending of our netted down revenues, which have been extremely strong. We would expect that would continue. And particularly, I'd say, in the year, we typically see more of that with renewals, of cloud and SaaS contracts et cetera. And that would be balanced with our regular mix of business, including expectation kind of a glide path of our client business. Now, on the non-netted down margins, I'll just note again, that product margins there have continued to help hold firm, and that's been quite a run, where they've been firm and we would expect that to continue. So, that's the sum of the different parts, Ruplu, to get us to that gross margin expectation very similar in the back half as what we saw in the first half. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for the details there. Maybe, as a follow-up, can I ask, Chris, how are you thinking about AI related spend in 2024. Did you have any AI-related revenues in fiscal 2023 and how do you see the impact of that on hardware and also on your services revenues in the year? Thanks. Chris Leahy : Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ruplu. I'd answer it this way. Look, we're really in the very early innings of AI monetization, and CDW is investing behind and doing well frankly. We're investing primarily in people and enablement, and doing well in the areas that are kind of early stage, which I would say, are consultative primarily at this point. AI certainly opens conversations with customers extensively. But I would say our opportunity, the massive opportunity for CDW is full stack over the long run, and I would call this a long a long game. look, it feels very much, and we've said this before that AI is like any other kind of transformative technology of the past. and it plays to CDW's strengths. Complexity and choice always make it more difficult for our customers, and that helps us bring our knowledge, expertise and portfolio to bear. So, as I think forward, we do see it as an accelerant. We're investing behind it. Our customers are still at the stage of what's the art of getting this done and how's the sign what's the science of doing it. It's just a matter, frankly, Ruplu, of what the time frame of growth looks like over the long term. but I feel confident that we'll play it every -- at every layer of the stack. And it will be embedded in every layer of the stack. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from George Wang of Barclays. George, your line is now open. George Wang : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I just want to ask about AI, kind of wondering if you have a refresher thought in terms of potential uncertainty related to the AI, especially last quarter, you got called about right now, the CDW customers are still in the assessment, the experimentation stage. So, you have sort of air pocket, if you will, before so the ARRI is further validated. Just curious are you seeing a slightly different behavior right now with the customers as they sort of play into this elongation of sales cycle. Just wondering if you can give a little more thought on that compared to a quarter ago. Chris Leahy : Yes. George, I would just -- I would reiterate that we're still seeing that AI has put the architectural roadmap for compute storage and networking under reevaluation and flux, and we're still seeing that play out this quarter. I actually expect that to last for some period of time as we help customers sort through again, what the art of the possibilities. but then what's the actual return on investment dollars. George Wang : Okay. Great. Yes. Just a quick follow-up, if I can. Just CDW has pretty good reputation of share gains through the cycle, especially in the fragmented box space. Just curious, are you seeing additional evidence, especially given, sluggish macro, but you're probably seeing the overall, so the four-stack solutions Are you seeing sort of a stronger pickup in sort of a kind of fragmented shed kind of just maybe, you can talk about competition and the kind of the areas CDW is. So, we're doing much better versus the rest of the field. Chris Leahy : Sure, George. I would just say that we feel very confident that we continue to gain share in this low demand and limited demand market across virtually every category. You saw our results for security and for services, and cloud, client device refresh is starting to pick up. And this is validated both by, obviously, our own data, but equally our partner reviews. our partners validate that we are indeed taking shares that we're feeling very good about, where we're positioned in a limited growth environment. George Wang : Okay. Great. I'll go back to the queue. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Samik, your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe, Chris, if I could just start with the areas of strength that you're seeing from product perspective. And I think storage, you sort of highlighted that as an area of strength. And not going into every specific category, but in terms of the areas that you're seeing refreshes on, just how do you feel about sustainability of that base. Because it does sound a bit more contrast to when you say customers are not really looking to spend as much and there's sort of a stable environment that there would be sort of a longer-term sustainability of the areas of strength that you're seeing at the same time. Just can you help us think about what is giving you visibility on that front. And I have a follow-up. Chris Leahy : Yes. Sure. So, I'd say look, capital investment and complex solutions, especially those tied to data center and network modernization are the ones that I highlighted as areas of more caution right now, given the uncertainty and also the increasingly complex technology landscape. Compute, we did see some pickup. That's really because, it was put off for some quite some time by a number of customers. and so there was a need to upgrade for against legacy systems. And then on the client side, as I said, we started to see, what we think is the beginnings of a refresh. Obviously, given all the catalyst there, that's going to be sustainable. The aged devices, Win 11, AI PCs, et cetera. We expect that to be a real refresh. And then I say sustainability in the clouds, where you saw strength this quarter in particular, cloud security and services in particular, I don't see those slowing down anytime soon. They're a great opportunity to offset some of those capital investments. They're a great opportunity for cost optimization and optimization generally. So, our customers have turned to them and with our portfolio, the beautiful thing about our is whatever our customers are buying, whenever they're buying it, we can give them the solution they need. So, very well prepared to deliver today and as we start to see a recovery in the capital investment appetite. Samik Chatterjee : And for my follow-up, I know you mentioned the netted down revenue mix every quarter. but anything further that you can give us in terms of how to best think about that sort of part of the portfolio, how much of that is security versus some other sort of software, just to be able to sort of more closely sort of correlate with what we're seeing from the peers and how should we really be thinking about which part of sort of software is it more correlated to. Al Miralles : Sure, Samik. I'll take it. This is Al. So, just reminder what categories fall into netted down. You have software assurance. You have warranty. You have SaaS. You have cloud. Right. So, the big components, if you will. The strength that we've seen obviously has been substantially in the SaaS and cloud space. and that runs the gamut in terms of underlying workloads in those categories. Right That includes data, virtualization software, networking to some degree. So, it runs the gamut in those categories. They've been the leaders in that space. I should note, Samik, there, with that over the last year, categories such as software assurance and warranty obviously have lagged. because they are substantially attached to products, hardware and software -- licensed software that is. And so they've been laggards, which at some point as we talk about the catalyst and things beginning to turn from a hardware perspective, you could see some of those categories pick up. But in the meantime, as we are now saying, Hannah, we think that recovery is going to take a little bit more time, the most durable trends are in the SaaS and cloud space. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam, your line is now open. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Al, I wanted to start on guidance. I know, I asked you last quarter on this and some of the explanation was for Q2 was that your modeling is below seasonal. It was off of a weak Q1 and that it seemed like this was sort of a conservative guidance estimate for Q2. and here we are this morning with effectively a miss. That's kind of become a pattern here a couple of quarters now below expectations, and the miss is beyond just the revenue line and mix. So, I just wonder if you might reflect on what has changed in the business to drive this trend; because prior to this period, CDW was kind of a bellwether for visibility into the business, execution on exceeding expectations. So, what has changed And then secondly, how to remediate this issue You know, what kind of changes can you make to your forecasting process or maybe internal analytics to better predict the business. Al Miralles : Sure. Thank you, Adam. Appreciate the question. First, look, no doubt it has been a pretty volatile period of time for now a number of quarters for sure. I would note a couple of things. Number one, when we talked about a Q1, what we were expecting going in Q2, you did ask the question about seasonality. I made the remark that we would expect it would be somewhat short of historical pre-pandemic seasonality and that it was. The delta there, Adam, was essentially the sum of federal business and international. So, two things that we had not factored in. When you actually add those back, we get pretty close to that historical seasonality. So now, so we scroll forward. We have an expectation Q2 leading to Q3, of mid-single-digit sequential growth. And really how we get there, Adam is, it's taken off some of the expectation of meaningful pickup in the business. and I would say it's following now a more normal glide path. Now, that's backed up by a couple things. One, in line or close to historical seasonality, but also just the split between first half, second half. And so, when you think about our 48/52 split between first half, second half, that's not only consistent with the history. but I also would say coming off of a softer Q1. And so, while we are definitely not anticipating an upturn, if you actually look at the trend lines, I would say it's a pretty natural glide path from where we've come from, and we think it's reasonable when you add it up to the back half of the year. Adam Tindle : Okay. Thank you. Maybe, just as a follow-up, Chris. Security is obviously a big growth driver for you and you've done well. I think you've even announced $1 billion in sales with CrowdStrike, some earlier this year. So, I guess the first question on that would be what you're seeing now at the end of July in that piece of the business given the global outage, the impact to the cyber business growth trajectory. And then secondly, beyond just the cyber business, there's an investor fear that this might have a ripple effect into other areas of spending and just cause pausing broadly. We're sitting here on July 31st. You're the largest reseller. What customer behavior are you seeing now in the month of July as that closes to indicate that might or might not occur. Thanks. Chris Leahy : Yes. Adam, I would say customer behavior is on high alert around cybersecurity, and we're having heightened and more conversations with our customers around that. It does not feel that, that is putting off or, delaying any other engagements and projects at all. But we are seeing heightened conversation around cybersecurity. Operator : We have no further questions. So, I'll hand back to chair and CEO Chris Leahy for closing remarks. Chris Leahy : Well, thank you very much. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. You show the power of execution excellence every day in every way. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you, to our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW.

I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our third quarter performance and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Market conditions in the third quarter were challenging. While demand for cloud solutions remained strong, and we continue to see a pickup in client device growth. Hardware solutions remained under pressure and the firmer footing we anticipated for our corporate channel did not materialize. Within this complex environment, the team delivered gross profit of $1.2 billion, 2% lower than last year and gross margin of 21.8%. Net sales of $5.5 billion, 3.5% lower on an average daily sales basis, non-GAAP operating income of $534 million, down 4% year-over-year; non-GAAP net income per share of $2.63, down 3% year-over-year; adjusted free cash flow of $261 million. While our success meeting customer priorities with cost-effective software and cloud solutions as well as services led to a resilient gross margin and strong cash flow, results did not meet our expectations as lower-than-projected solutions hardware drove a shortfall in volume. This shortfall in volume reflects both external factors and CDW-specific dynamics. Let's take a look at each of these and most importantly, the actions in place to mitigate future impacts. First, the macro and IT spending environment remain challenging. Technology complexity combined with persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty has led to large project delays and further extension of sales cycles. Layered on top was the uncertainty around the outcome of the U.S. election, which has dampened not only government spending, but also other public sector end markets, as well as spend from commercial customers. And finally, this limited demand environment has heightened competition and increased pricing intensity across all end markets. Beyond the current environment, market conditions continue to reflect the secular shifts we've experienced over the past several years, shifts that impact how customers consume IT and how customers pay for IT. Consumption shifts driven by as-a-service and pay-as-you-go public and private cloud focus have contributed to market pressure on hardware solutions. And while our conviction toward a hybrid cloud approach for IT is unwavering, market demand continues to reflect unprecedented hardware cyclicality, cyclicality that resulted from pandemic-driven demand for work and learn from anywhere on endpoint, collaboration and netcomm solutions, which resulted in an off-cycle demand boom, a period of supply chain volatility and subsequent digestion. All of these external factors have clearly impacted our results in the quarter and over the past year. The impact has been further amplified by three CDW-specific dynamics. The first dynamic relates to our long-standing financial discipline. While our North Star is to provide value to our customers in highly competitive markets, we maintain our discipline when competitors pursue transactions at uneconomic terms. While this contributed to lower third quarter sales and gross profit, our gross and operating margins held firm even while we mixed into lower-margin client devices. We have seen this market behavior before and expect it to dissipate as the demand environment improves. Second, our exposure to larger deals. As we have deepened and broadened our strategic capabilities, including through the addition of Sirius, our ability to deliver large, full stack, full outcome projects has expanded, projects at the higher dollar tier that can be pushed for any number of reasons. This can drive year-over-year performance lumpiness and depending on the size and timing of decisions, impact results. Impact that is more acute during periods of low demand. You see this in commercial and federal this quarter where larger deals expected to close were deferred or reduced. And the third specific item pertains to our cloud and SaaS-based business. While we have grown this business significantly during the past several years, we have not yet achieved the scale we desire relative to our overall portfolio. As such, when demand for hardware softens, it has a more outsized impact on our financial results. I hope this perspective helps contextualize how CDW-specific dynamics amplified the impact of the low market demand environment and created a near-term growth challenge that we have not yet been able to overcome. These are not excuses. We own our results. So let's turn to what's important. What are we doing? As always, our continuous improvement in seller effectiveness is ongoing. This means delivering repeatable solutions and further streamlining the sales processes to maximize sales professional productivity. I'd like to highlight three additional focus areas. First, we are organically and inorganically growing our capabilities in the fastest growth, highest relevance cloud and software vectors to increase scale in both our services and as-a-service offerings. This will deliver greater choice and value to our customers and lead to greater recurring and reoccurring revenue streams. Second, we are further driving exceptional and differentiated customer experience in our core business. We are aligning our digital capabilities to serve customers in the way they want to plan, buy, consume and manage technology. And finally, we are enhancing our agility and accelerating pipeline growth. We are building on our customer growth engine by opening new lanes with both existing and new customers, and we are deepening our technical and industry expertise across all end markets. We know more than anything, customers value our unbiased highly informed point of view, a point of view that enables our ability to architect and implement full stack multi-branded solutions, which cut through the noise and deliver the outcomes our customers need. These are not new efforts, but we have ramped up intensity. Work is underway and progress is on track. Some actions will have fairly immediate impact and some will take more time to produce results. In the meantime, we remain laser-focused on finding pools of profitable growth and converting sales with rigor and speed. Now let's take a deeper look at quarterly results. Third quarter corporate net sales decreased 4% as sales cycles further elongated, most notably for large infrastructure investments. netcomm storage and servers all declined by significant double digits. We helped customers with client refresh, driving growth of high single digits. ASPs remained strong as customers' preference continued to drive higher-end devices. Cloud solutions was a priority and gross profit from cloud increased by double digits. Small business continued to bounce along the bottom with net sales down 2%. Cloud solutions remained strong given their low upfront commitment and customers continue to sweat data center assets. Unlike other channels, client refresh continues to be pushed out as customers remain in a cash preservation mode. Security was strong as cyber threats increased for lower profile businesses. The team's success delivering services drove strong double-digit growth in both professional and managed services. Public performance was less than seasonal and sales decreased 5% year-over-year. Health care was a bright spot in the quarter, delivering top line growth of 3%. The team continued its success helping health systems adopt managed services and cloud solutions to better control expenses, and they delivered strong double-digit growth in services and cloud spend. Similar to corporate, netcomm storage and servers all declined meaningfully. Client was strong, up double digits for the second quarter in a row. Government declined 12% with both state and local and federal government performance below seasonal in the quarter. Market conditions were challenging for the federal team. Demand impact was felt most acutely in large hardware solutions deals with federal posting double-digit declines in both netcomm and servers. Several agencies moved ahead with refresh and for the third quarter in a row, client devices increased by double digits. Cloud Solutions posted a double-digit increase in cloud gross profit. State and local sales declined by low double digits. Delays due to increased scrutiny and multiple approvals impacted large infrastructure hardware deals with netcomm storage and servers all posting significant declines. Security remained a top priority, posting a strong double-digit increase in gross profit. Services performance was strong, up high double digits, driven by professional services. Education sales declined 5%. Higher ed's top line declined high single digits. Client devices were flat and slow project materialization and budget constraints and cutbacks at some public universities contributed to double-digit declines in netcomms and servers. The team's success helping institutions implement cloud solutions to drive cost elasticity delivered double-digit growth in cloud spend and gross profit. K-12 net sales declined by low single digits, largely driven by declines in audiovisual and netcomm as school systems digested investments made over the past few years. The team continued to help refresh aging Chromebooks and delivered high teens client device growth. Cloud delivered double-digit gross profit growth. Services adoption was also up double digits, driven by our managed client device life cycle solution, which streamlines the configuration, deployment, management and a refresh process so school systems can focus on what really matters, their students. Other, our combined U.K. and Canada business performed above our expectations, up 5%. Both markets experienced stronger demand, albeit off depressed results in the prior year and prior quarter. Both the U.K. and Canada increased by similar amounts in local currency. As you can see, end market performance was mixed during the quarter. Let's take a look at how this translated to category performance. Portfolio performance reflected our ability to meet customers where and how they want it with client device, cloud and software and services growth, growth that was more than offset by hardware solutions decline. A low single-digit increase in transactions was more than offset by solution sales decreases of double digits. Hardware decreased 7%. High single-digit client device growth was more than offset by declines in netcomm storage and servers. Software increased 3.5% with healthy gross profit growth. Cloud was an important driver of this performance, up double digits in gross profit. Services increased by 13%, driven by managed services and warranties. As you can see, while demand varied, the diversity and completeness of our portfolio enables us to meet our customers where and how they need us. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Given current conditions, we do not anticipate market demand to improve for the balance of the year, and we now look for the U.S. IT market to be roughly flat with 2023. We expect our results to continue to reflect the market and CDW-specific dynamics I referenced with gross profit growth challenged, given our mix of hardware and the pronounced cyclicality the market is experiencing. As we always do, we will provide our view on 2025 market conditions in our next call. There's no denying that we are operating in a tough environment, but we are confident that growth will return. The demand drivers are there, workload expansion and data explosion, increased security threats, client device obsolescence and adoption of AI-powered assistance and applications. And when demand picks up, we will be there to profitably capture these opportunities. In the meantime, we are doubling our efforts to drive profitable growth. While this past year has been challenging for us, it has also been challenging for our customers. As they're a trusted adviser, customers need us now more than ever. Our relationships are bolstered by our commitment to deliver value to our customers regardless of the demand environment. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our third quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our updated 2024 outlook. Third quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion was down 2.2% versus the prior year. This was below our original expectations of low single-digit growth as strength in cloud and client devices across most channels was offset by lower demand for solutions hardware. Gross margin of 21.8% was flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and broadly in line with both full year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024. Third quarter margin was aided by a higher mix into sales or CDW act as agent, also known as netted down revenues. This category grew by 7.1% on a reported basis, once again outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 35.7% of our gross profit compared to 32.6% in the prior year third quarter. Year-over-year expansion came from our teams continuing to successfully serve customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. This led to our highest quarterly netted down revenues we've seen as a company as we met customers where they needed us most. The netted down category of solutions continues to represent an important and durable trend within our business. Third quarter gross profit was up 1.5% sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2024 on a reported basis. Net sales were up 1.7% sequentially as well. Higher year-over-year demand in the health care and international channels alongside a sequential increase in government drove growth over the second quarter. However, this growth is below both historic seasonal levels and our own expectations as the firmer footing in the corporate space that we saw at the end of the second quarter did not persist through the later months of the third quarter. We experienced deals getting pushed out and downsized as customers deliberate on where and when to spend and primarily in the solutions space. While international outpaced the U.S. business in the third quarter, we still expect volatility in this space as customers face economic and political uncertainty. Overall, we're competing in a challenging low-growth environment, and we are focused on achieving profitable growth. We acknowledge that we have work to do to better calibrate market conditions and deliver on our own expectations. Turning to expenses for the second [ph] quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $667 million, down 0.7% year-over-year. Expenses were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and the efficiency ratio of non-GAAP SG&A to gross profit of 55.5% was relatively in line with our expectations. We continue to look to align our cost structure with demand and have taken actions early in the fourth quarter to better align expenses to market conditions. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was approximately 15,400, up slightly over the second quarter and modestly above year-end. Customer-facing coworker count was also up slightly at approximately 11,200. Our goal is to balance growth and exceptional customer experience with greater efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $534 million, down 4% versus the prior year, driven by our volume shortfall, offset by slightly lower expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.7% was down from 9.9% in the prior year, but up from 9.4% in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP net income of $355 million in the quarter, down 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. With third quarter weighted average diluted shares of 134.9 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.63. Moving ahead to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $4.9 billion. Net debt is down $91 million from the second quarter and has decreased by approximately $184 million since year-end 2023. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 2030 senior notes and $600 million of 2034 senior notes. We issued the combined $1.2 billion to settle the tender offers of both the 2024 and 2025 senior notes and for general corporate purposes that will maximize strategic flexibility. Since Q3 end, we have fully redeemed the 2024 notes. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.2 billion. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, up 2 days from the prior year and at the lower end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including active management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted free cash flow was $261 million in the quarter, roughly consistent with our expectations. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $764 million and 80% of our non-GAAP net income within our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90% of non-GAAP net income. We are on track to meet our 2024 objectives. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $100 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with our non-GAAP net income growth. We're announcing an approximate 1% increase of our dividend to $2.50 annually, our 11th consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to prudently manage our dividend with respect to the growth environment and target a roughly 25% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward. Our second priority is to have the right capital structure in place. We ended the third quarter at 2.3 times net leverage within our targeted range of 2 to 3 times. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility as evidenced by our recent debt financings. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth. Year-to-date, we've utilized over $350 million of cash on share repurchases and have over $730 million of authorization remaining under our current share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023 have persisted well into 2024. Demand has been below what we originally anticipated and customer sentiment remains cautious across the majority of end markets. Last quarter, we spoke about the slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending and shared our expectations for tough conditions to persist in the near term. That was the case and was moderately worse than we even expected in the third quarter. Customers still have a compelling need to address priorities such as cloud workload growth, increasing security threats, aging client devices, but uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape continue to weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware. Given these conditions, our updated 2024 expectation is for a low single digit gross profit decline. This implies seasonality slightly below historical levels for the fourth quarter and second half gross profit and net sales. We maintain our expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full year 2023 and much like we've seen year-to-date in 2024. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be down mid single digits year-over-year. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter. We anticipate low to mid single-digit gross profit declines compared to the prior year, with gross margins slightly above the first three quarters of 2024, but below the fourth quarter 2023 level. This leads to a slightly worse than seasonal sequential fourth quarter. Traditionally, the fourth quarter is meaningfully lower than the third quarter, principally due to seasonally lower demand from education and government customers. But this first fourth quarter, we also do not anticipate this being offset by seasonally strong demand from corporate and small business customers. Moving down the P&L. We expect fourth quarter operating expenses to be similar to the level of fourth quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis. Finally, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to decline in the high single-digit range year-over-year. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'd now like to open the lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question, excuse me. Our first question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam, your line is now open. Adam Tindle : Okay, thanks. And good morning. I just wanted to start, as we analyze this quarter, I understand tough macro to predict volumes. But I really wanted to ask about the negative operating leverage down the P&L. And taking a step back, I think what investors really like about CDW is the variable cost model and ability to kind of flex up and down with volumes. I understand some of the rationale in the prepared remarks, but this seems to be a pattern for the past few quarters. So I guess the question would be twofold. One for Chris. If you could maybe just assess what is changing and why the negative drop-through is increasingly severe down the P&L. It sounds like you decided to implement some restructuring. So maybe you can tie in some of the rationale for that. And then secondly, for Al, on that restructuring, if you could just help us with the size and what it does to the model in 2025. I think it's about a 10% to 15% of headcount based on the reports that we've seen. So just trying to rightsize how we should think about OpEx moving forward. Thank you. Al Miralles : Yeah, Adam, actually, this is Al. I will start just to give you a little bit of commentary on the quarter and operating leverage, and I'll let Chris jump in thereafter. So first - on the quarter, first, I would just say, Adam, we continue to hold strongly to our variable cost model and the impact therein. For the quarter, if you actually look at our non-GAAP SG&A expenses relative to GP, we came in just about at that 55% range, which we've talked about that being kind of the target that we would have. It's maybe slightly higher than we would have anticipated for the quarter, but that was more of a, I'll call it, denominator factor that is the GP was lower than expected. So in the quarter, we did get the movement in our variable expenses as we would expect. I think the challenge there otherwise, Adam, is that we have a fixed cost base. And while the demand environment has moved pretty dramatically, we certainly have taken action on our fixed cost to try to align with what we were seeing in current demand and what we were seeing as we go forward, it becomes a matter of just the timing therein on that fixed cost base. That said, as you know, going into the fourth quarter, we did take some actions that would reduce our fixed cost base, and that included a reduction in our workforce. Just to size that for you, Adam, it was about 2% of our workforce. So it was not at the level that you quoted there. But certainly, that would align us more closely with where we think we need to be from a fixed cost base perspective. Chris Leahy : Yeah. And Adam, I would just add that we're being very prudent as we look at where we rightsize the business while we continue to invest behind areas that we see will be pockets of growth. So a lot of focus on the demand environment, preserving profitability and also delivering exceptional customer experience for our teams. Adam Tindle : Got it. Thank you. Just a quick clarification since I know that was a long one. When you're talking about the increased pricing intensity and competition, just to clarify, is that higher competition between VARs? Or is that higher competition in pricing amongst the OEM vendors? Thanks. Chris Leahy : Yes, Adam, it's a little of both. It's a little of both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vogt of UBS. David, your line is now open. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. And maybe one for Chris to start. So Chris, I think I heard in your prepared remarks that you'd expect sort of the U.S. IT market to be flat in 2024 and yet you're confident that you can continue to outgrow it. But obviously, the macro has been tough and it looks like you're going to undergrow the market this year. Did I hear that correctly? And how should we think about what that means going forward? I know you're not giving 2025 guidance, but I think that's a little bit disappointing relative to where investors might have been thinking given the challenging backdrop. Is it just really a reflection of where the hardware solutions are ending up? And then along those lines, we're hearing from some of our checks that networking and even to a lesser degree, storage and servers is getting a little bit better. Maybe what are you seeing a little bit differently than maybe what we're picking up and what others are maybe communicating in the marketplace? Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah. Let me just start with the market share. That was the beginning of the question. Look, we continue to hold ourselves accountable for delivering a premium to the IT market rate of growth. And looking at this year and this quarter, given the low hardware demand and taking into account our mix, I'd say we're holding serve and feeling very confident that we've performed extremely well in certain areas, take cloud, Software as a Service, services as an example, but other areas have been challenged for us. And our view is that hardware will come back. It's a matter of when will that inflection point take place, and we'll be well positioned to help our customers in those circumstances. You asked specifically about networking and storage. Look, what we are seeing is we're seeing traction in clients pick up. And I wouldn't yet call it the inflection point, but we do think we're outperforming in that area. Data center has really been the area where customers have paused, have moved spend to the cloud and are taking longer time to make decisions. That means we're seeing storage, networking and servers all quite muted. But once we see the client refresh start, one would expect to see data center begin to pick up again. As I said before, the catalysts are all there. Explosion in data, the need for massive bandwidth for networking, digital transformation isn't going anywhere. Security continues to get more and more focused. So the catalysts for growth are all there. I think we just got to get to the other side of the uncertainty that we sit. And certainly, after we get through the election, there'll be a little more certainty. Al Miralles : And David, maybe I'll just add there. David Vogt : And maybe just - sorry, go ahead, Al. Al Miralles : It's okay. Just to add a couple of data points there. So obviously, all of those categories, Chris mentioned in the solutions space have been softer. We also have the tough comps from a netcomm perspective. Q3 is the last quarter with those tough comps. So while we would not say that demand is picking up meaningfully on netcomm, at least the comps get a bit easier. And then the other data point I would just give you is from our vantage point, just hardware overall, we've now seen eight quarters of declines on hardware. And so again, Chris noted some of the catalysts we think ultimately will play out. We've seen a pretty prolonged period of hardware cyclicality. David Vogt : Great. And just as a quick follow-up. So when we think about looking at the recovery or the potential recovery around the timing of the recovery? I know you're not giving '25 outlook. But what are some of the milestones that you're looking at that gives you increased confidence heading into '25? I know obviously, the election is coming up and hopefully, that kind of changes maybe customer conversations. Anything else sort of maybe at a high level that you're thinking about in your conversations that give you some degree of maybe a leading edge or a leading indicator in terms of what you're thinking about for 2025? Chris Leahy : Yeah. I think about the things that are creating the current environment and whether or not those change. So uncertainty around the economic environment and geopolitical will have an impact. Obviously, the election policy outcomes of the election are going to be very different. That will have an impact most likely. Those are the things that are at the forefront of our mind, how the economy is doing, frankly, how it's perceived to be doing, going to be doing in the future and the volatility across the world are the two things that we look at most closely. Now the complexity in IT is not going anywhere. So the requirement now to have more business and IT leaders involved in decision-making. It's our new norm is kind of longer decision cycles for these larger complex projects. And so we're getting used to that, but we don't see that going away anytime soon. That's what we focus on. David Vogt : Great. Thank you, guys. Al Miralles : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Eric, your line is now open. Erik Woodring : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Chris, if we could just go back to some of your comments on product demand. Obviously, lots of commentary about challenges in Infrastructure Solutions, double-digit declines with many customers across netcomm, servers and storage. I just want to make sure I understand, are those rates of declines that you're referencing reflective of the broader market? Or are you seeing those declines simply because you are walking away from some lower profitability deals and therefore, you are underperforming in those specific end markets. And maybe at the end market, they aren't declining nearly as much as maybe you're seeing. I'd just love to get a better understanding of this is kind of CDW's view or if this is the broader market view? And then I just have a follow-up. Thanks. Chris Leahy : Yeah, sure. I would say it is the broader market view, possibly tempered a bit by CDW not racing to the bottom because we are walking away from economic deals. It's important to keep - protect profitability, et cetera. So I would say it's a bit of both. I would say it is market and consistent with market, but also we are not racing to the bottom. Erik Woodring : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the second question, I'd love if you could maybe elaborate a bit on the market competition comments because you're highlighting market competition, which I can't necessarily remember you citing explicitly before. And to be fair, you guys have encountered several challenging and competitive market environments in the history of the company and still managed to materially outperform peers over those years. And so maybe my question is just what has changed with competition that is new? And really why would that competitive intensity ever go away even in a period of stronger demand? Thanks so much. Chris Leahy : Yeah. It's a great question, and we do reflect on that. We are used to highly competitive environment. What I would say we're feeling right now and this quarter and the past couple of quarters, in particular, is irrational pricing. And we know how to compete in the market, but we are seeing deals at below margin, low margin, et cetera, and that just is not our business model. The last time I saw intensity in pricing like this was years ago. So it has been a little bit more unique over the last couple of quarters, and we're very good with our discipline around financials. So we're holding firm. That's really the answer here. It's a little unique over the last couple of quarters. We've seen it really tick up. Erik Woodring : And just to clarify, that is rational pricing from VARs, from distis or from both? Chris Leahy : I would say it's up and down the value chain. So competitors who are value-added resellers, direct competitors, distributors, I wouldn't perceive as in that chain as much. Erik Woodring : Okay. Thank you so much, Chris. Chris Leahy : Yes, the behaviors that are going on, every competitor is feeling the elongation in the sales cycle. The chunking up agreements to make them smaller, the deferrals, the reductions, the different ways they want to go at saving money or deferring spending, short-term ROIs. That is a market dynamic right now that everybody is feeling. Erik Woodring : Understood. Thank you, Chris. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Good morning. I have two as well. I guess, Chris, just to conclude this discussion you had, you folks are on track to have 2 years of consecutive gross profit declines at the company. And it's something you haven't seen at CDW, I think, historically, even if I go back to '03, '04 or '07, '08 time frame. I understand all the macros that you're talking about, but it feels like the way CDW is navigating this macro uncertainty volatility is worse than what you've seen before. And why do you think that's happening? And what's changed perhaps in the company that you've had multiple years of gross profit declines, which frankly, you haven't had historically? Chris Leahy : Yeah, Amit, fair question. I'll tell you, we're a company in transformation, and we have been in transformation for several years now. So when you think about the CDW - CDW-specific factors I mentioned, they have been having a real impact on results, amplified by the muted hardware demand environment. So if we just think about the third one I mentioned, which is our cloud and SaaS business, we've been investing behind that business and growing it incredibly rapidly over the last 5 years. All of our acquisitions have had a cloud services hook to them. Nonetheless, given the full portfolio that we have, we have not yet attained the scale that we want to be at relative to the full portfolio. So when hardware is muted, it now has even more of an outsized impact because of the secular movement towards cloud. And we're growing that, but we still have a very high mix of hardware. The other thing is the strategic investments that we've made over the year have been incredibly fruitful in developing broader and deeper strategic capabilities so that we can deliver full stack, full outcomes projects. These now we're seeing at much larger, higher dollar tier levels, and those are the kind of projects that are lumpy. We used to talk about this with our federal contracts all the time. The very big deals become lumpier. And depending on when decisions are made, they can get deferred, they can move around, the size can change, and therefore, it can impact results. And we saw that with commercial and federal this quarter. And the last one is what I just talked about in the prior question, which is our financial discipline. We're going to continue to maintain our gross margin discipline as we move forward. And we've hit a couple of quarters where we're seeing behavior that is extreme - pricing behavior that's extreme. So I just - Amit, I'd say it is a combination of our strategic investments that are working incredibly well vis-\u00e0-vis value to the customer and growth in fast-growing high-relevance areas in an environment where hardware has been and continues to be muted on a persistent basis. It's a bit of a double whammy for us. But I'm confident in the growth as hardware turns around. Go ahead, Amit. Amit Daryanani : No, I'll let you finish. Chris Leahy : No, I was just going to say... Amit Daryanani : You know, growth. Chris Leahy : Go Amit. Amit Daryanani : I was going to say, Chris, would it be fair to say that as growth resumes presumably in '25 that you should start to see gross profit dollars increase back to the way it normally does? I think that would be a fair way to think about it. And then maybe my clarification was going to be, we've heard from Cisco and Microsoft, some of your bigger vendors and how they're changing their channel pricing and the channel strategy for 2025. Do you see that being a bit of a driver for you as you think about your growth, especially the agent sales piece of the business into next year and beyond? Chris Leahy : Yeah. As I think about the changes, I think about investing behind our cloud business and really the cloud flywheel where we are trying to - we are delivering a seamless experience from professional managed services to consumption and transaction-based services to managed services around the cloud. And by doing that, delivering higher value to our customers, but that's precisely aligned with what our vendors are the CSPs, the Ciscos of the world exactly aligned with what they - what they're incenting and what they want. So we think we're well positioned, and that will be a positive benefit for us as we move into 2025 and beyond because it aligns with our strategy and our value that we can deliver to customers. And frankly, it drives - because of the services wraparound, it drives better economics for CDW and a stickier relationship with the customer. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just another question regarding the comments on client device growth. I think you said mid single-digit growth, but it sounds like that was skewed more toward the public markets and not so much corporate and SMB. And you talked about macro. Is the expectation for AI PCs? Is that another reason why we're seeing that push out? And are you seeing any kind of growth in corporate SMB versus enterprise there? Chris Leahy : Yeah, Matt, thanks for the question. On the client side, we're actually seeing - we're seeing growth across almost all of the end markets. Corporate was - we saw growth in corporate. It small business is where we are seeing our customers kind of in a cash preservation mode and so pushing off the client device. But we really have seen a nice pickup in client across almost all the end markets. So that's been positive. Al Miralles : Yeah. And Matt, I'll just add the - what has been driving it has been more refresh of aging fleets and need for customers to get on with this activity. It's been less in the way of Win 11 drivers and less in the way of AI PCs. Chris Leahy : So next year, as AI PCs do come on board, that will be another nice accelerant for PC refresh. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then relative to your guidance on gross margin, Al, for Q4, which is down year-over-year, and you had a big bump last year. Is that because you're expecting sort of a lower percentage of the advanced hardware solutions, which carries higher margins or services? What are the other reasons behind that? Al Miralles : Yeah. Great question, Matt. It anticipates that we'll continue to see softness in the solutions side of the business, which comes at moderately higher gross margins. It assumes that client will continue to tick along, not in an outsized way, but that client would continue to move along. And then we would expect that we would get your typical pickup in more of the netted down revenues in the fourth quarter. I'll just note the delta versus Q4 of 2023 is that maybe a little bit modest pick there on the netted down revenues versus last year because it was quite outsized at the end of the year. Matt Sheerin : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Al Miralles : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, your line is now open. Keith Housum : Thank you. Two questions as well, if I could. Chris, just trying to reconcile something here. CDW has always tied itself as being a relationship driven company providing value for its customers. But yet we're hearing about transactional competition and losing deals that way. Perhaps can you break it out for us like how much of the business is more transactional where people are just going with the lowest price versus how much of your business is really driven by that relationship and the value you provide? Chris Leahy : I would say that when you look at our portfolio and the spectrum of our relationships with our customers, that over 90% of those relationships and those customers would tell you that they buy from CDW because of the value we deliver, the access to a full portfolio, the expertise that we bring to bear, the ease with which they can do business, the agility with which we deliver that is what every customer says to me when I meet with them. Regarding the pricing and the transaction issues, there are times when there are large rollouts, for example, that - where the economics just gets lower and lower and lower. And those are transaction purchases that don't typically have the value wrapped around, and those are the ones that we are less interested in pursuing. Keith Housum : Okay. Appreciate it. And then you talked about like the move to the as-a-service model. I guess as I think about that, it's still relatively in its infancy, but it's only going to grow as we go from here. So how much of, I guess, a challenge or a headwind does that present to hardware sales as we kind of think about just the future? Chris Leahy : I didn't hear the whole question. I'm sorry. Al Miralles : I think I got it, Keith. Here's what I would say. Obviously, we've seen pronounced cyclicality in hardware, and that would typically be pretty significant upfront spend. Think about that as kind of CapEx from a customer's perspective. What we've seen kind of counteracting that in some respects is an increase in our netted down revenues, including SaaS and cloud. Now Keith, historically, a lot of that business would be what we would call reoccurring where we are both seeing that business upfront and recognizing that upfront. But I would say that over the last year or 2, more of that business has been moving to a recurring nature. And that is where customers are more making judgments on what they want to spend on cloud, but they're consuming it as they go. And therefore, that shows up over time for us. Now I wouldn't call that a material dollar amount at this point, but it is growing. And therefore, I would say that is part of the calculus of kind of the air pocket when you have pronounced cyclicality of hardware and more business that starts to come on as we go. Certainly, as we continue to grow that sector in that category, we'll report more on kind of that split in details with respect to reoccurring business versus recurring. Hopefully, that's helpful. Keith Housum : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Samik, your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess if I can start with one. Chris, you mentioned in your prepared remarks and in some of the responses as well, the exposure to large projects that you have on account of the capabilities that you've invested in over the years. I mean, as you outlined some actions you're taking on the cost structure side. But as you look at the business and the lumpiness that, that drives in terms of exposure to large projects, are there any changes you're contemplating on that side in balancing out the business between larger projects or transactions versus do you still - or do you still believe that's the right sort of balance or margin mix to have in the portfolio and really just wait for the market to come back on that front? And I have a follow-up. Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah. The way I'd answer that question is kind of yes and yes. In other words, we do have actions underway. Look, we're looking at this quarter in 2025 as an opportunity to accelerate the most important parts of our strategy that we've been working on for several years. But one of them, for example, would be our digital work. We've done a lot of foundational work in digital, and we just need to go faster. And that really means aligning our digital capabilities and our people to deliver personalized recommendations that match how customers want to buy, plan, consume and manage their assets. So think about this in terms of large deals and perhaps smaller deals as an intersection of our sales professionals moving up a value chain and being available to learn and enabled by digital tools to sell at the highest point of the value chain while creating a seamless digital experience for our customers, a flywheel, if you will, so that we can deliver both velocity in that digital flywheel and serve customers how they'd like to be served, self-serve, et cetera, and value with our account managers and sales professionals working together. So that's one area, as an example, where we - our intention is to drive velocity in deals at all sizes, lower-tier levels while we continue to build engagements at high value, high levels. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Got it. And, thank you for that. Quickly for my clarification question. I know you mentioned the election-related uncertainty and some of the slower spend on the public sector federal side as well. I mean we've seen elections in the past as well. Have you had instances or are you looking at any scenarios in which you do end up getting like a budget flush post the election outcomes? Are there any sort of scenarios or any indications of that happening in the fourth quarter? Thank you. Chris Leahy : Yeah, hard to tell. I would say this election cycle, I wouldn't - I would say there's nothing really normal about it. So hard to tell. I mean, right now, what's happening with the federal government is we've got the knock-on effects from the delayed budget previously. And now we've got - while we saw strong spending in the Department of Defense, we're seeing less than we'd hoped because they're waiting to see what the administration's priorities are. So we - right now, we just see the federal government paused. One would hope we'll have some more clarity post election, but then the timing comes down to Congress and the President in getting a budget passed. Al Miralles : And maybe, Samik, I'll just add on the back end there. Obviously, we play all of the different scenarios and how things could play out when we look at the quarterly outlooks. I would say our Q4 outlook has the appropriate level of caution baked into it based on all the factors that we've talked about, the external factors, TDW specific, and certainly, that would include any political uncertainty. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Al Miralles : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. We currently have no further questions. So I'd like to hand back to Chris Leahy, Chair and CEO, for any closing remarks. Chris Leahy : Okay. Thank you, operator. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our 15,000 coworkers around the globe. It's their ongoing commitment to our customers in this challenging environment that makes us successful over the long term. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : As we conclude today's call, we would like to thank everyone for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris. Christine Leahy : Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2025. Then I will hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. For the fourth quarter, the team continued its exceptional level of customer commitment and delivered net sales of $5.2 billion, 5% above 2023 on an average daily sales basis. Gross profit of $1.16 billion, flat as reported and up 2% on an average daily sales basis -- on an average daily basis. Non-GAAP operating income of nearly $500 million, 4% below 2023 and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.48, down $0.09 year-over-year or 4%. The fourth quarter delivered a solid finish to a challenging year. During the quarter, as we have seen all year, customer priorities remains laser-focused on operating efficiency and expense elasticity and continually met with as a service and ratable solutions like cloud and SaaS and consultative services in order to optimize spend and minimize capital expenditures. At the same time, customer focus on mission-critical and must-do priorities drove interest in resuming projects with clear short-term returns on investment. This led to an uptick in demand across several hardware categories. Despite this shift in our mix, our durable and stable gross margin held strong and in fact, reached its highest quarterly level in 2024. Looking back on the full year, the team's ability to deliver as a service and service offerings helped partially offset the impact hardware de-prioritization had on our top line, which declined by 3%, and we delivered full year consolidated gross profit roughly 1% below 2023. Sustaining the resources needed to deliver exceptional service to our customers and support future growth drove slight expense deleverage in both 2024 non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income per share declined by 5% and 4%, respectively. Although 2024 P&L results were not consistent with our record of performance, we once again generated more than $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We stayed the course on our capital allocation priorities and commitment to shareholders and returned $832 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. A commitment that was reinforced with today's Board of Directors' action to increase our share repurchase authorization by $750 million. Now let's take a closer look at our fourth quarter performance. As always, there are three main drivers of our results : our balanced portfolio of customer end markets; breadth of our product solutions; and services portfolio and relentless execution of our 3-part strategy for growth. First, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels : Corporate; Small business; Healthcare; government; and Education. Each channel is a meaningful $1-billion-plus per year business on its own. Within a channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of USD 2.5 billion. The benefit of our diverse end markets was clear during the fourth quarter. Commercial markets showed signs of stability in the quarter and returned to growth. While customer behavior remained cautious and we did not experience traditional year-end budget flush, we did see greater willingness by some customers to spend their remaining budgets. Corporate and Small Business increased their top line, both up by 4%. International or other increased by 5% and public increased 6% driven by Healthcare's standout performance, up 30%. Within public unique end market factors continue to influence Education and government. Education declined 2% as high ed strong performance was more than offset by declines in K-12. As expected, the K-12 market experienced the impact of the first full period without any stimulus-based government funding programs. Government's decline was driven by federal end market uncertainty where we saw spending pauses as agencies awaited clarity around priorities from the incoming administration, clearly, a quarter of varied end market performance. The second driver of our performance this quarter was our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services. Hardware increased top line by 4%, with client devices, NetComm and storage all increasing mid-single digits or better in the U.S. Client Devices growth was primarily driven by normal refresh of aging units. Software net sales were up 5% as robust double-digit SaaS and IAS growth continued to be impacted by the market transition away from licenses. Customer spend and gross profit both increased mid-single digits. Cloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and once again was a meaningful contributor to gross profit. Cloud profit increased by mid-teens. Security was a top contributor to cloud and software results and delivered high single-digit top line and profit growth. Customers continue to leverage our growing services capabilities as part of their strategies and services top line increased 10%. Overall services delivered double-digit profit growth. CDW Managed Services increased more than 20%. As you can see, our deep and broad portfolio of solutions enable the team to address customers' most pressing priorities, and that leads to our third driver of results, relentless commitment to our growth strategy. During 2024, we maintained our strategic fortitude and patients. We continue to build upon our productivity and efficiency work and further strengthen our relevance to our customers, coworkers and partners. One way we are strengthening and differentiating our relevance is by deepening our technical and industry expertise. We know more than anything that customers value our unbiased, highly informed point of view. A point of view that enables our ability to architect and implement full stack multi-branded solutions, which cuts through the noise and deliver outcomes that address each customer's unique needs. Sitting side-by-side with the C-suite at the table, CDW industry experts add value to the decision process and move us up the stack. CDW Healthcare offerings showcase this expertise, our deeply experienced Healthcare subject matter experts include more than two dozen former industry executives. These former CIOs, CTOs and practitioners have been crucial in developing and launching solutions only possible by combining very deep industry-specific expertise with our extensive portfolio and capabilities. Solutions like our proprietary patient room next AI and IoT-based solution and innovative Healthcare transformation centers located across the U.S. Healthcare transformation centers are collaborative spaces equipped with the latest technology and staffed by experts where Healthcare organizations can explore new content, develop strategies and test customized solutions. Solutions that improve patient care and clinical workflows across the care continuum. One center is capable of running a 2,000 bed hospital complete with a stand-alone isolated data center and simulation lab, and another center is focused on exploring scalable and evolving technologies for enhancing quality of life for those aged 50 and older. These transformation centers deliver measurable clinical outcomes. Outcomes like reduced readmission rates, where real-time access to patient data is combined with advanced analytics, so providers can identify at-risk patients and intervene before they are readmitted, and outcomes like enhanced patient satisfaction, where mobile communication tools and solutions deliver greater engagement and streamlined care coordinations, driving higher patient approval scores. Outcomes all made possible by our strategic focus on enhancing our expertise and our capabilities in the fastest growth, highest relevance cloud and software vectors. During 2024, we maintained a patient and opportunistic stance towards capital investment. When the target and the timing was right, we leveraged our cash position and strong free cash flow. And on November 27, we closed our acquisition of Mission Cloud Services a premier AWS partner and leader in driving cloud adoption and migration. Mission complements recent investments we have made to drive greater scale in our services and -- as a service offerings. Investments and capabilities that include cloud migration, full stack and cloud-native software development, DevOps engineering, robust consulting and cloud-based workflow automation expertise and resources. Mission expands our AWS Connect opportunities and delivers a compelling managed service offering that can be purchased through AWS Marketplace, allowing customers to burn down their cloud commits. We know how powerful this can be. Let me share an example of a solution that combined professional and managed services with AWS Connect and AI. It's an example of how we help a customer drive efficiency find cost savings and improve the customers' experiences and outcomes in today's challenging environment. A financial solutions company's on-premise contact center needed an upgrade. After careful evaluation, the CDW team designed a flexible custom solution that improved both customer service and streamlined operations. The solution includes cloud-based compute database and business intelligence that uses AI-driven analytics and natural language understanding. The project began with a multi-hundred-thousand-dollar initial investment in CDW delivered technical and implementation services that provided strong ROI to the customer. The Solution represents a significant monthly spend commitment to CDW for cloud-based customer service agent access to customer data and managed services for continuous performance monitoring. This integrated hardware, software and services solution reduces high maintenance costs, improve scalability, agent performance, customer experience and enables innovative customer service solutions from a data-driven insight. It's an excellent example of the power of integrating managed and professional services with our full portfolio of cloud and AI offerings. Solutions made even more compelling with mission in the family. While we have more to do our investments in high relevance, high-growth areas over the past five years have positioned us well to deliver value to our customers, however they need us. That leads us to our view for 2025. We currently look for the U.S. IT market to grow by low single digits in 2025 on a customer spend basis and for us to outpace market growth by 200 to 300 basis points. This outlook factors in expected impact from unique market dynamics on the public spending side, particularly in federal and Education as well as expected intensified pressure for our U.K. and Canadian operations, given their market face increased uncertainty driven by macro factors and political change. As always, we base our view of IT growth and what we are seeing in the market and what our customers are telling us about their plans and priorities for 2025. Right now, our commercial and public customers' decisions remain deliberate with ongoing project scrutiny, pursuit of short-term ROI and continued large project buying hesitancy. While our market view recognizes the potential for meaningful exogenous factors to impact demand, including policy uncertainty, the level inflation, the impact of tariffs and other potential disruptors, it does not weigh these wildcards too heavily. For now, we are comfortable with our prudent outlook. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, out-execute the competition. Whatever the conditions, we will use all of our competitive advantages to outperform the market. Our customers face proliferating data and ever-expanding cybersecurity needs. They face expanding workloads and hardware obsolescence. At the same time, they face the potential and promise of AI and other exciting innovative technologies. With our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services and capabilities, we will be there for our customers as their trusted adviser, today and tomorrow, wherever their priorities lie. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on the financials and outlook. Al? Albert Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our fourth quarter performance. provide a brief 2024 full year summary, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2025 outlook. Fourth quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion was roughly flat year-over-year, but up 2% compared to the prior year factoring in 1 less day. This was above our original expectation of low to mid-single-digit declines as our teams captured increased demand for cloud, security services and certain hardware products. In-line with our expectations, gross margin of 22.3% was up 50 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the highest margin quarter of the year but below the record level of 23% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023. Compared to the prior year, the decline in gross margin was due to a higher contribution from notebook and desktop sales and a modest contraction in margin rate across a few product categories. Netted down revenues represented a strong 35.8% of our gross profit compared to 35.4% in the prior year fourth quarter. We continue to meet customers where they need us most. The netted down category of solutions represents an important and durable trend within our business. While we expect netted down revenue streams to outgrow the rest of the portfolio over time, driven by consistently strong cloud and SaaS growth we may see variance in growth from some of the other netted down categories, including warranties and software assurance as we did this quarter. Moving to a quick review of our channels for the quarter. On an average daily sales basis, the commercial business, achieved top line growth for the first time in two years, alongside firm gross margins. In the public space, Education was roughly seasonal and its sequential decline. And while government remained challenged, the sequential decline was less than historical levels. Healthcare was a standout performer this quarter as our team outperformed in a challenging end market, reflecting the strategic investments we've made in this space. International net sales grew for the quarter, driven by product volume growth but will behind historical fourth quarter sequential growth rates due to a lack of budget flush activity. We still expect volatility in the international end markets as customers in these regions face ongoing economic and political uncertainty. Overall, I want to credit our teams for delivering above our expectations in a tough environment. Turning to expenses in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $656 million, up 3.3% year-over-year. Compared to our prior expectation for SG&A to be roughly flat year-over-year. This increase was mostly due to higher gross profit achievement. The efficiency ratio of non-GAAP SG&A to gross profit was 56.8%. Coworker count at the end of the year was approximately 15,100. While customer-facing coworker count was approximately 10,900, both down 300 coworkers from the third quarter and flat to last year. These numbers take into consideration both our acquisition of Mission Cloud Services and the actions taken in the fourth quarter to align our expenses to market conditions. Our goal is to balance growth, expansion of capabilities and exceptional customer experience with greater efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Non-GAAP operating income was approximately $500 million, down 3.8% versus the prior year, driven by lower gross margins year-over-year combined with higher expenses. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.6% was down from the record 10.3% in the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $333 million in the quarter, down 4.7% on a year-over-year basis, impacted by slightly higher interest expense following our debt refinancing and lower interest income due to modestly lower rates. With fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $134.4 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.48, down 3.7% versus the prior year. Shifting gears to briefly review full year results. 2024 was the second consecutive year we experienced a challenging environment. Demand was below what we initially anticipated and customer sentiment was cautious throughout the year with more deliberation and decision-making and elongated sales cycles. Net-net, this led to a 1.8% decline in net sales and a 1.1% decline in gross profit. Despite these declines, gross margins held firm year-over-year at 21.9% versus 21.8%, showing that even when client devices are stronger, and solution hardware is weaker, our margins remain resilient. Our strategy investments are working. Investments like the recent acquisition of Mission Cloud Services which brings capabilities which should position us well for growth in the future. As always, we will continue to pivot to meet customers where they need us, no matter of the environment. Down the P&L, we saw higher year-over-year non-GAAP expenses as we pivoted to adjust our fixed cost base to align to an uneven demand environment and made judicious investments in support of our strategy. This led to year-over-year decline of 4.5%, 4.4% and 3.6% and our non-GAAP operating income non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively. Moving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $5.1 billion, up roughly $253 million from the third quarter and approximately $69 million since year-end 2023. This was driven by our use of cash during the quarter, notably to fund our acquisition of Mission Cloud Services. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, up 1 day from the prior year and at the low end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including proactive management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted cash flow -- free cash flow was $315 million in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. For 2024, in total, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $1.1 billion and 84% of our non-GAAP net income, achieving our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90% of non-GAAP net income. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $146 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. For the year with $332 million of dividends and $500 million of share repurchases, we exceeded our target of returning 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders finishing the year at approximately 77%. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with our non-GAAP net income growth. We announced on our last earnings call, an approximately 1% increase of our dividend to $2.50 annually, our 11th consecutive year in increasing the dividend. We will continue to prudently manage our dividend with respect to the growth environment and target a roughly 25% payout ratio versus non-GAAP net income going forward. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We ended the fourth quarter at 2.5x net leverage within our targeted range of two to 3x. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility as evidenced by our 2024 debt refinancing and redemption actions. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth as shown by our recent acquisition of Mission Cloud Services. Likewise, we remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. As such, we are pleased to announce an additional $750 million share repurchase authorization program approved by our Board of Directors. On top of the approximately $588 million of authorization remaining under our current program for 2025 and beyond. And that leads us to our outlook. Customer sentiment remains cautious across end markets. We expect these conditions to persist in the near term but are cautiously optimistic about 25 as an inflection point for the demand cycle. Customers still have a compelling need to address priorities such as workload growth, increasing security threats and aging client devices. And while uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape, may continue to weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware, we anticipate leveling demand for these products, including in areas like NetComm that saw depressed growth rates in 2024, driven by product digestion and after lapping tough 2023 compares. With these factors in mind, our full year 2025 expectation is for the IT market to grow low single digits. We target market outperformance of 200 to 300 basis points on a customer spend basis. Based on the anticipated mix of products and solutions, we expect low single-digit gross profit growth. We also expect gross margin to remain relatively stable and within the range of 2024 levels as we continue to scale up our cloud, SaaS and services businesses, while balancing the prospect of a return to growth in solutions hardware. We expect first half gross profit to be slightly lower than the second half, reasonably in line with our historical seasonal splits of 48% versus 52%. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year as we focus on profitable growth, exceptional customer outcomes and an effective execution of our capital allocation priorities. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. On that note, we expect currency to be a slight headwind to reported growth throughout the year. Moving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter. We anticipate mid-single-digit gross profit decline sequentially and relatively in line with historical levels, leading to low single-digit year-over-year growth, and we expect gross margin to be similar to overall 2024 levels. Moving down the P&L. We expect first quarter operating expenses to be similar to both the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2024 on a dollar basis. As we've seen in the last few years, this will result in the first quarter being the highest level of non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of gross profit for the year. Finally, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the low single-digit range year-over-year. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good morning, everyone. I guess just to start with Chris, when I think about the calendar '25 guide that folks just provided, how are you thinking about different parts of the public vertical kind of stack having the growth profile? And I guess, really, given the focus on efficiencies and the impact on Dodge, how do you see that kind of playing out for CDW in the near to medium term? That would be really helpful. Christine Leahy : Yes. On the public sector side, we've taken into consideration those areas that we can in our typical seasonality and some of the the unique factors that we're facing in terms of Education being at the end of that large funding cycle, et cetera. But here's what I would say. I'd say, look, it's too early to tell where all these things are coming out. We've got a lot of lack of clarity. Things are moving fast. They're very fluid. And so we're basically taking it and analyzing as we go, and we'll update as we go through the year. I would say that when it comes to dose, there are going to be puts and takes. Any time you reduce workforce that tends to slow things down in the government space, and we have factored that in. But on the other side, anything driving efficiency is positive for technology over the long run. So we've tried to be prudent and cautious in our federal approach knowing full well that we just don't have all the clarity and we're going to continue to assess and update you as we go through the year. On Education, we're getting news every single day around the Education side. And so we're just going to be very measured. We're going to stay aware. We're going to stay tuned, but not be overly reactive and we're going to continue to assess funding sources and policy changes across the board. As I said, there are going to be puts and takes. There's going to be -- you'll have reductions, but you'll also have a realignment, and it will be our job to figure out where the opportunities and risks are. And we got a strong -- we've got a very strong federal, state and local and Education business. We have 40 years of finding where the funds are and helping our customers actually work their way through and understand changes, and we're right in the middle of doing that right now. There's a lot of discussion with customers. There's a lot of analysis. They really are turning to us to understand on a daily basis and longer term. Certainly, I think you're going to see some air pockets as people figure things out. But over the long run, we think that technology is going to be a winner across the federal and Education landscape. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's really helpful. If I could just follow up. When I think about the low single-digit gross profit dollar guide for the year, you're expecting the broader IT spend and see that this top line to be somewhat better than that. So what's kind of driving a bit more muted gross profit dollar growth, if you make? Is it mix? Or are there some other factors that we should be aware about? Just help us think about that low single-digit profit dollar growth would be helpful. Albert Miralles : It's Al. I would say, look, as you think about our outlook and down the P&L, the actual variance between the line items from customer spend, gross profit all the way down to EPS. The variance in those growth rates are not significant. So that's number one. So there's nothing there too meaningful to report beyond maybe a little bit of a shifting of mix. So -- and I maybe would just note that with that shifting in mix. We would probably continue to see a little bit of compression in net sales as we continue to lead in lean into netted down, which will bolster gross profit. a little bit of a continued pressure on the expense line that would depress non-GAAP operating income a bit, but then you pick up some leverage as you get further down into EPS. So the variance between those categories, not too meaningful overall. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Samik your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to start off on the 4Q results, you had a strong end to the year, but it also seemed like within the verticals that you called out, Healthcare was particularly strong, up, I think, close to 30% on a day adjusted basis. Can you just go through sort of what drove that? Was it a lot of transaction business or any sort of anything else that drove that number to be that strong and I have a quick follow-up. Christine Leahy : Yes, sure. Look, Healthcare was a standout and Healthcare has been performing for several quarters now. The net sales number reflected the mix that we saw a really nice number there. But at the end of the day, it's been a very balanced success over the last couple of quarters with Healthcare, which is a reflection of our strategy and how we bring value to our customers. The broadened portfolio, particularly around cloud, when you couple that with our deep Healthcare expertise. Those enable the Healthcare teams to be real trusted partners and help our Healthcare customers on their cloud journeys. We've made a number of investments behind Healthcare in the capabilities and technologies and partners, frankly, that we bring to bear. And that is just bearing fruits. Now I would say that we are overlapping a couple of very difficult years. So the number, it does seem high. But at the end of the day, very, very proud of the Healthcare team and the focus and execution that they're bringing to bear for Healthcare organizations that are really earlier in their journey on cloud, and we're right there to help them along the way. Albert Miralles : And maybe, Samik, I'll just add on that. Chris' point about the comps. As we think about overcoming the comps on Netcomm, Healthcare would be a big one in that regard. It also adds that business, as we've invested behind it has built a nice client base, including some larger transactions. So while we are definitely pleased with the execution and the outcomes there, there is an element there of transactions that may not be fully recurring. . And then finally, I would just note, while that the business is really strong in Healthcare, it tended to somewhat offset some of the declines from government Education. So that would be round out kind of that overall public sector. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. And probably this one, the follow-up is for you. Just following up on my last question. You mentioned the mix sort of on the net sales side. And I think what you're referring to, which you referred in your prepared remarks is the change in practices from like some Microsoft on the subscription of the on the cloud subscriptions. I think a lot of investors are curious sort of what that magnitude of exposure looks like and how you're sort of navigating through those changes and policies from some of these sort of cloud companies. Albert Miralles : Sure, Samik. I think we mentioned that last call on some of the Microsoft changes or we got the question with respect to that. Look, we see program changes and change incentive from partners very commonly. This one was telegraphed for quite a while. And so the impact on '25 from that is not material to our overall results. We had been seeing that coming. We were contemplating that. And as usual, we are pivoting to both the other opportunities for growth with Microsoft but also with other partners. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Harry Reid of Redburn. Harry, your line is now open. Unidenified Analyst : Just checking up on a comment made helping clients run down that annual commit on AWS. I'm just thinking about the moats in the business and if there's any threat of disintermediation is the by nature of the value-added service of the reseller essentially protecting that moat and why our clients wouldn't procure directly from AWS marketplace for some of their software? Just any comments there would be very helpful. Christine Leahy : Yes, it's great to have you on. I would characterize it this way, the moat that CDW has is all of the services that we wrap around the market place purchases. In fact, we were just named AWS Marketplace Partner of the Year. And our customers really turn to us because marketplace is another complexity, if you will, in the procurement chain. And CDW brings to bear all the input and expertise that customers make good decisions. The other thing to remember is that our clients are really squarely hybrid cloud, meaning multi-cloud and on-prem and while cloud is obviously growing very quickly. We have many customers who are also repatriating back to on-premise and have particular reasons that they want to stay on premise, including some of the advances in AI and efficiency around models, et cetera. So the interconnectivity that our customers have across their entire hybrid infrastructure is critically important to have knowledge around. And the only ones who could do that are folks like us who understand the customers' full estate and how things work together. So we are investing behind that. Mission Cloud is a great example of a strategic investment to continue to build our differentiation and we're pleased to have them as part of the family and they're -- they've joined us and taken off well. Operator : Next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America. Ruplu, your line is now open. Ruplu Bhattacharya : First one for Chris. In the past, SMB has been a bellwether for a change in end market demand. It looks like revenues in that segment this quarter grew about 3% year-on-year. and that's after essentially two years of weakness. So Chris, was there any onetime in this quarter? And do you think that, that segment can now grow year-on-year? And should we think this as a positive indication for overall market demand? And I have a follow-up for Al. Christine Leahy : Yes. I would say, look, our small business and corporate businesses both showed signs of stabilization this past quarter. And we've said before that we saw small business kind of bumping along the bottom and now in Q4, a little bit of stabilization. We are seeing -- when I say stabilization, I want to be clear that what I mean is the rhythm of the business. We're seeing less unevenness, more stability in the rhythm of the business. the activities in the business, et cetera. So we find that really encouraging. At the same time, Ruplu, I'd just say that customers remain cautious. And we are taking that into account as we think about our outlook and being very prudent, particularly with everything that's happening in the environment. It's unclear what's going to happen with inflation. Clearly, interest rates is an issue out there and then just add all the policy uncertainty and impact -- downstream impact and uncertainty, I think we're going to see small businesses continue to be cautious. But the good news is, is they're cautious and they're optimizing for cost and cost efficiency we've been helping them significantly using cloud and ratable and subscription offerings. So I wouldn't call it a rebound just yet with small business, but we are cautiously optimistic. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Al, if I can ask you a question on margins. specifically, if we look at the gross margin of the core business, ex the netted down items, looks like fiscal '24 overall came in at 15.4%. So it was down about 40 bps year-on-year. But the fourth quarter, I think, came in the core business margins 1.5%, so that grew sequentially. The question -- my question to you is fiscal '25 should see an improvement in some end market or end device products like PCs. So how are you thinking about core business margins trending in fiscal '25? Albert Miralles : Sure. Thanks, Ruplu. A couple of things I would note. You are right. For the quarter, our non-netted down margin was 15.5%. That sequentially was up about 30 basis points. but it was down year-over-year, and I think for the full year, down about 40 basis points, you might have mentioned that. As we think about 2025, I would say net-net, Ruplu would expect that margin to hold reasonably firm. And the reason for that would be while we expect that client will continue to move along a path. We wouldn't expect significant acceleration, but move along the pad, it's been on. We would also expect modest growth of solutions, which we think will aid those non-netted down margins. And then we are cautiously optimistic as hardware comes back that you will see more services attached, which certainly will aid that margin as well. So all things considered, we would expect that non-main margin to hold pretty firm during '25. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, your line is now open. Keith Housum : Chris, just a little bit more on the Mission Cloud Services acquisition. Perhaps can you provide a little bit of context about what it provides to you guys in terms of the financial statements. I mean you do a good job explaining the business. But in terms of -- is it accretive to your gross margins into the bottom line? And do you guys require a significant investment to kind of make it more of a CDW type integrated product that you guys have? Christine Leahy : Yes. Sure, Keith. Let me start and then I'll hand it over to Al. We're really excited about Mission Cloud. It's in a fast-growth mode. It's a profitable business. It brings incredible AWS expertise and reputation in the market. And we're really excited to bring that to there across our customer base. As you know, they are focused on mid-market and small business, which is a sweet spot for us, but extensible into the rest of our segments. In terms of accretive, the price we paid and we won't see much addition to the bottom line profitability this year because of the foregone interest. And as a result, we're not going to see a big impact. That said, we do expect Mission Cloud to have a significant impact on our strategy and growth rates going forward. Albert Miralles : Yes. Thanks, Keith. The only thing I would add is, look, Mission is a company that is in growth mode, but notably is profitable. So we deemed it and deem it as a high-quality asset, but we are in the formative stages of integration, so to Chris' point, the materiality at the gross profit and the non-GAAP operating income line would be not substantial in '25, and then really pretty much flat down to EPS when you think about the interest income. And again, Chris hit this, as we fully integrate in '25, and we open the aperture to our vast customer base. We think the upside in the accretion possibilities for Mission are really significant. Keith Housum : Great. I appreciate it. And then earlier on, you mentioned a little bit of gross margin pressure from some price in the end markets. I just want to make sure I understood that correctly. And two, what's the expectation that would continue going forward? Albert Miralles : Sure, Keith. Yes, in kind of walk of the gross margin components and the puts and takes, one of the things that I mentioned was like-for-like, we saw a bit of a compression, particularly in the product side of the house. Now I just recall, Keith, that we've had now several years of product margins holding up really, really strong. And I think we've called out that at some point, you could see an impression. I would not note what we saw in the quarter as material. And probably the most notable area where we saw a little bit of compression was clients. So when we factor in all of the elements on the margin front for 2025, Certainly, we've made some space for a little compression, but we would not call that an outsized contributor. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Erik, your line is now open. Erik Woodring : Chris, if I look back over the last call it, decade plus, 2024 was the first year that your earnings growth did not outpace your revenue growth. And as I look to 2025, you are guiding kind of as Al referenced, EPS growth, largely in line with gross profit and revenue growth. And so when I take a step back, I'm just -- I'm wondering why maybe we aren't seeing as much leverage in the model as you've seen historically, even including past periods where there was macro uncertainty or a dynamic market. Can you maybe just help us understand maybe why we're not seeing that leverage materialize. And anything that's unique about this environment that truly is different than we look at the past CDW? And then I have a quick follow-up. Christine Leahy : Yes, sure. I'd characterize it this way. We're -- our goal is to balance growth investments in our capabilities with efficiency across the broad base of our operations. And when you look at the investments we've made over the last several years, they've been significant and producing very good results. But we've been doing this in an environment that exacerbates the kind of deleverage. And that is one where we aren't growing. And we've taken a number of measures, as you know, to ensure we rightsize the business for the current environment for demand, but also, Erik, ensure that we are positioned for growth going forward. I think we've been investing very judiciously. We've been investing very deliberately. And I think in areas that are high growth, high relevance. And Healthcare is a great example of seeing that strategy pay off. Our cloud and SaaS business growth in our security business growth, those are great examples of that strategy paying off. but the deleveraging has to do with the confluence of factors, I'd say, which is investing while we've got initiatives going on for productivity and efficiency in an environment that is low to no growth. Eric, that said, we do expect, obviously, as we move forward for operating leverage to come back over the next year and beyond. I mean that is our goal as well, provided that we are in an environment that supports that. Erik Woodring : Okay. sorry for cutting you off there. And maybe, Chris, just a quick follow-up is, I could probably make the case for leaning more into M&A in this environment given the change in administration your historical comments about where you see workloads shifting and how that might impact clients by the CDW. Is your appetite for M&A higher today than when we look back over the last, call it, two to three years? And besides just consolidating a fragmented market, where are the specific product gaps you believe are most critical for CDW to address today? Christine Leahy : Yes, Erik, it's a really interesting question. What I would say is we always have a large appetite for M&A. We are in a different position today because we do have scale and foundation in those areas that we've been driving growth. So when we think about our cloud capabilities, we think about security capabilities. We think about data capabilities. We've been growing those now over five years and have a really good base of scale. I think that puts us in a position that could be really opportunistic to add to those capabilities and fortify them while at the same time identifying tuck-ins that might be more specific to an industry or specific to a particular emerging technology. Our focal areas, frankly, have not changed at dramatically or at all from an M&A perspective. But I would say that we are adding a lens around industry capabilities specifically. You've seen us buy companies specific to Education, specific to federal. This has been a very good strategy for us, and we see that work quite a bit. So I'd just look for us to do more of that. But all said and done, we are patient. We are opportunistic, and we look for great assets. Albert Miralles : And maybe, Erik, I'd just add. Look, I think 2024 is a great example where we did bring the full array of capital allocation priorities. So during a tough period where we would have deemed our stock to be at more attractive levels. We did lean in more to share repurchases, but behind the scenes, looking actively at what is the next acquisition opportunity that could fuel our operating income and really compounding of earnings. So we will continue with that drumbeat and continue to look at opportunities that fulfill our capability needs, but also drive earnings power. Operator : Our next question comes from George Wang of Barclays. George, your line is now open. Dong Wang : Maybe to just -- maybe if you can impact kind of fourth quarter kind of in the prepared remarks, you guys talked about underlying hardware, including NetComm and the storage up mid-single digit. Just curious if you can impacted despite the channel, whether that's all driven by corporate and SMB or whether some from the health care upfront? And also, can you give more color in terms of the full year outlook on the net comp. It seems like you guys are seeing some green shoots. Just curious if we should expect some sort of inflection particularly just on the NetComm side, consider we are probably testing some of the digestion. Albert Miralles : Okay. George, just take a crack at that, that was a lot. So first, just starting with the quarter, on the end market side. I think the punch line would be the most significant element that exceeded our expectations would be on the commercial side. And we saw as Chris suggested, signs of stabilization on corporate and small business. That was reasonably balanced, George, across different categories of growth. in that area. And then the other end markets that I'd point out, and we've talked about it is health care, again, exceptional performance driven by an array of categories if you will, and really a good reflection of our investing behind that strategy. George, as we look out in '25, some of the elements of what we saw from a category perspective in we would expect to continue. That is on the client side, mid-single-digit growth or better is what we experienced in Q4. We think that's a reasonable glide path for 2025. And then we have a modest expectation on solutions hardware. We saw 3%, 4% in the quarter. And in that realm, I think, is quite reasonable. Where will that come from? Probably some contribution from NetComm and again, we're cautious on the demand there, but we think there could be some continued growth in NetComm. Storage was a strong performer for us in Q4. And then going the other way, servers have been challenging. And so we are cautious that may continue in that space. So that would be how it would round out on the hardware product category side of things. Dong Wang : Okay, great. If I can squeeze a follow-up. Last quarter, you guys talked briefly on some of the slight increased competition/pricing pressure. I just want to make sure of the transitory in nature kind of completely went away in the December quarter and going forward. So maybe you can address if you guys are still seeing some increased competition or that was really sort of completing the rearview mirror? Albert Miralles : Sure, George. I'll take that. First, I would say those comments were not just specific to Q3. It was really a reflection on the broader range of the last two years and the challenged environment we've been in. We've been in a tough down cycle of hardware. And with that competition, quite fierce. That's continued. I wouldn't point anything out differently in Q4, and we continue to fight the good fight in that regard. And I think we came out quite well versus our expectations in that regard. I would not point to when we talk about margins, George, that the competition is having any meaningful impact on our margins in that regard. Operator : Thank you very much. At this time, I'd like to hand the call back to CDW for closing remarks. Christine Leahy : Okay. Thank you, Carly. I appreciate that. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our coworkers around the globe their ongoing commitment to serving our customers, it's what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. . Operator : As we conclude today's call, we'd like to thank everyone for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
