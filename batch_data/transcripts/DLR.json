Management's prepared remarks will be followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein. Arthur William Stein : Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you, all of those who are joining us. I'd like to begin today by outlining our strategic vision for the company. We strive to enable our customers to build their future growth here, Digital Realty data centers around the world. We see IT as rapidly evolving from a cost center to a revenue generator. Corporate executives are widely coming to view data as a strategic asset. Data storage is a less critical function than the traffic and exchange of information. Against this backdrop, we believe proximity to major metropolitan areas such as London, New York, San Francisco and Singapore will take on renewed importance, not just for ultra-low latency applications, but for delivery of all matter of content to the broadest population bases with the deepest penetration of smartphones and connected devices. We are building a vibrant ecosystem that will enable our customers to exchange and transmit their data to myriad ultimate destinations as quickly and as efficiently as possible. If we are successful at facilitating our customer's future growth, we will also be successful at maximizing the value of our 4-data-center portfolio, and creating meaningful value for shareholders in the process. Our global footprint is a key differentiating factor. Over 90% of the business that we signed in the first quarter was with existing customers. And no one in the industry can match our ability to facilitate customer growth on a global scale. We produce high-quality data center solutions, and our cloud and network-based partnerships are nurturing an ecosystem that will likewise lead to product differentiation. This vision dovetails perfectly with our #1 objective of optimizing the return on our portfolio for driving improved return on invested capital through the lease-up of existing inventory. Matt Miszewski will have more to say regarding our progress on this front in his commentary. We are also undertaking a review of precisely which properties constitute our core portfolio. We believe capital recycling represents prudent real estate portfolio management. You can reasonably expect to see us cull the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio over the next several years. We expect to prune legacy, non-data-center assets, non-core markets and a handful of underperforming assets. Subject to our board's approval, proceeds will be used to shrink our capital structure on a leverage-neutral basis, which is to say, a portion of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt and a portion may be used to buy back stock, so long as we believe that the public market value of our portfolio is trading at a meaningful discount to its private market value. We will also continue to explore additional joint venture opportunities, which may serve to provide greater transparency on the private market value of our Turn-Key properties, in addition to the Powered Base Buildings that seeded the joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors last September. Our private capital initiative may also serve to demonstrate the significant value our development platform has created. Going forward, however, we are adopting a very disciplined approach in terms of taking on speculative development risk. For example, we now have the ability to deliver a data center pod in 12 to 16 weeks. So we no longer see the need to stockpile finished inventory, and we plan to transition to a build-to-order inventory program. Having a lease in hand before we build will enable us to reduce our risk profile, commit capital only for projects that meet our return thresholds, know our returns with certainty, and avoid accepting subpar returns under pressure. We offer a premium product and our ideal customer fully appreciates the value proposition that Digital Realty provides. This discipline will likely cause us to pass on some deals. But we believe it will lead to a healthier industry dynamic, better returns for our shareholders and a better match between the product that we offer and the customer base that appropriately values our offering. In addition to discipline, however, we must be vigilant about meeting our customer's needs. We cannot just offer them any color Model T they want so long as it's black. We must pay careful attention to the market's evolving product configuration requirements and be sure that we are equipped to provide the product that our customers [indiscernible]. Finally, we aim to implement some subtle shifts in our corporate culture. First and foremost, we will place renewed emphasis on serving customers in addition to managing properties. In our business, customer focus and value creation cannot be separated. Increased attention to our customers' business needs and technological evolution will enable us to anticipate changes, market dynamics, as well as technological shifts, and allow us to continue to match our product to market requirements, ultimately increasing the value of our portfolio. We've also entered a new era of candid dialogue with all constituents, including shareholders, as evidenced by the recent steps we've taken towards improving our disclosure. We have assembled an incredibly talented team of professionals. It is my mission to unleash the intellectual capital and creative energies of this reservoir of talent. One recent announcement that exemplifies both our efforts to unleash intellectual capital as well as our commitment to driving improved return on invested capital was Scott Peterson's promotion to Chief Investment Officer. Having closed some $6 billion in data center acquisitions, Scott is clearly one of the sector's most accomplished investors. But more importantly, he is also, in my opinion, one of the most astute. I could not be more pleased by Scott's well-deserved promotion. And now, I would like to turn the floor over to him to provide further detail on our capital allocation strategy going forward. Scott E. Peterson: Thank you, Bill. Over the past several weeks, we have begun to evaluate every single property in our portfolio as the initial step in an assessment of our long-term performance potential. The results of this analysis will help prioritize capital allocations, decisions -- capital allocation decisions, focus individual asset strategies, and will also help identify potential disposition candidates. The preliminary conclusions of this analysis are that we have a substantial portfolio and it isn't going to turn on a dime. Improving our return on invested capital will be measured in basis points and it will be achieved over time. The only investment activity we closed during the first quarter was the contribution of a fully-leased data center for our existing joint venture with the fund managed by Prudential Real Estate Investor. This property is located in New Jersey and is fully-leased to a AA-rated financial services tenant with over 9 years of remaining lease term. It was contributed to the joint venture at a 7.1% cap rate, fully loaded for all closing costs and debt prepayment penalties. In early April, we sold a small single-tenant building to the user for approximately $42 million. We expect to book a gain on the sale of approximately $16 million in the second quarter. The only notable third-party transaction during the first quarter was Amerimar's acquisition of 401 North Broad, an Internet gateway in downtown Philadelphia. This property reportedly traded at a high 7s going-in cap rate, which does not include an estimated $70 million of projected CapEx, which would put the cap rate solidly in the 5% range. This transaction was fairly complicated to underwrite given its age, prior use and ownership structure, and we believe it will be a fair comp for these types of assets. The common theme among each of these transactions is that data centers continue to become more widely accepted as a mainstream asset class and a liquid private market is developing for these properties. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to shed some light on the demand curve and growth prospects data center investors are currently underwriting. Matthew J. Miszewski: Thank you, Scott. As shown on Page 4 of our presentation, we signed leases totaling nearly $47 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $12 million direct lease with a former subtenant of a Powered Base Building in Santa Clara. The first quarter is typically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year, and the fact that we were able to generate a third consecutive quarter of robust leasing velocity suggests that the business is gathering momentum. We signed over $4 million of co-location revenue on the heels of a $7.7 million contribution in the fourth quarter of last year. And I am becoming increasingly optimistic that our mid-market segment should be able to deliver results within this range on a consistent basis. Cloud applications have been a major driver of our recent leasing activity, and the first quarter was no exception. In addition, we also saw healthy demand from mobile, content and social media. We leased 5 megawatts of finished inventories during the quarter, but the ending balance was essentially unchanged from year end due to new inventory coming online and a Turn-Key tenant move-out in Los Angeles. We had another strong month in April, however, and have several committed deals that should enable us to make a further dent in our finished inventory balance during the second quarter. The polar vortex did not have a pronounced effect on our operation, but we did have one large cloud requirement in Toronto that was touch-and-go to close by March 31 due to weather-related local government office closures. Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow was able to stop the Digital sales team. And we closed that deal in the quarter. And I'm very proud of what the entire team has been able to accomplish together. As you can see from the numbers at the bottom of Page 5, base rates for Turn-Key Flex leases signed were higher than they have been for some time. We do see pricing as generally stable to slightly improving, but the big number in the first quarter was primarily a function of market mix, reflecting higher rates at Asia Pac, which represented fully 30% of our leasing activity this quarter. The chart on Page 6 is likewise indicative of stable to slightly improving pricing. Cash rents on renewal leases were positive, albeit just fairly, for Turn-Key as well as PBB, and GAAP re-leasing spreads were up by double digits across the board. In addition to signings, lease commencements were also quite healthy. And as you can see from the chart at the bottom right of Page 7, the weighted average GAAP between signing and commencement remains reasonable at just over 6 months. I'd like to pause here to highlight 2 data points related to the desired behavior incentivized by the new sales compensation program we rolled out at the start of this year. First, the book-to-bill cycle has stabilized at 6 months, with over 90% of the deals we've signed so far this fiscal year commencing within 12 months. Second, we have already seen market reduction in tenant improvement allowances, as well as rent grants and abatements, without any increase in comparable commissions. Now one quarter does not a trend make, but early indications are encouraging that the revamped sales compensation plan is already beginning to have its intended effect. Moving on to Page 8. The key takeaway here is that the big blue bar called 4Q '14 contractual NOI is up by over $20 million since just last quarter, entirely due to leases signed in the first 90 days of the year. At a cap rate with a 7% handle, that represents around $2 per share of NAV. Turning now to supply. The biggest change in the last 90 days is that all 24 megawatts of the shadow sublease space in Northern Virginia has been confirmed as available, up from 13 megawatts reflected on this chart last quarter. They have a very healthy demand funnel in Northern Virginia and very limited exposure. But the large block of sublease space, in addition to several recently announced competitive starts, could potentially pressure pricing in this market. We believe our solutions should be somewhat insulated, hence, most of the available inventory is shared infrastructure product in contrast to our dedicated infrastructure offering. But we will be keeping a watchful eye on the supply-and-demand dynamics in Ashburn. I should point out that we do have a large lease in Northern Virginia with a financial services tenant that was signed at peak rent and is expected to roll down in the second quarter, which will clearly have an impact on our leasings, but has been fully baked into our guidance. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier, to take us through the rest of the variables affecting our financial results. Matt? Matt Mercier : Thank you, Matt. We had quite an active start to the year on the capital-raising front. During the first quarter, we tapped the preferred equity market for the first time in almost a year. The issuance was met with solid demand and we were able to upsize the offerings and ultimately raise gross proceeds of $365 million. We were also able to price at 7 3/8%, well below the range we had guided to previously. We also executed our second sterling bond offering, which closed in early April, raising gross proceeds of $500 million, 9.5-year paper at 4.75%, at the bottom end of the pricing range in our prior guidance. Interest rate environment remains benign for the time being, and we are pleased to have turned out the substantial majority of our short-term floating rate exposure at what we perceive to be very favorable economics. Matching with the redemption of our exchangeable debentures, $261 million of the debentures were exchanged to common equity mid-April, which had the effect of reducing debt-to-EBITDA by 0.3 turns. Credit metrics, shown here on Page 11, are pro forma for the following : first, the redemption and exchange of the exchangeable debentures; second, the sterling bond offering; third, asset sale that Scott mentioned; finally, the additional $65 million of preferred equity we raised under the reopening partial exercise with the greenshoe on the Series H, all of which closed subsequent to the end of the quarter. You can see here, pro forma for those adjustments, net debt to adjusted EBITDA dropped 5x. Fixed charge coverage remains above 3x. With annualized adjusted EBITDA of over $900 million, we have more than $450 million of borrowing capacity while maintaining leverage below 5.5x. We do not expect to raise common equity on this year's remaining capital [indiscernible]. Asset sales may also be a potential source of capital. Our guidance contemplates an additional dollar-denominated debt issuance, which could be either a dollar bond offering or a term loan. However, the timing has likely been pushed back from mid-year towards the year end, given the larger-than-expected preferred equity offerings, as well as the prospects of potential proceeds from asset sales. Turning now to earnings. We reported first quarter core FFO per share of $1.28, or $0.10 above consensus. Roughly half of the analyst estimates and consensus appeared to reflect the severance charge for a former CEO and the other half do not. On an apples-to-apples basis, core FFO per share would likely have been $0.05 above consensus. As Bill indicated on our last earnings call, the timing and execution of our financing activities, as well as the incremental revenue expected from speculative leasing represented the primary wildcard in our 2014 forecast. We are pleased to report we have made considerable progress on both fronts, having raised $865 million of capital previously discussed, and having reduced volumes of speculative leasings contemplated in our guidance by 50%. As a result, we have raised core FFO per share guidance to $4.80 to $4.90 a share. Solid leasing activity to date has largely derisked the low end of the range, but potential future asset sales and joint ventures represent additional wildcards. But I'd also like to point out a few items to begin to bridge your own forecasts from our 1Q annualized core FFO per share to the 2Q through 4Q quarterly run rate applied at the midpoint of our range. First, as shown on Page 12, 5.9% blended coupons on the $865 million long-term capital we raised year-to-date is almost exactly 425 basis points higher than the all-in cost of our line of credit. 425 basis points on $865 million equals $37 million, or just about $0.07 a share per quarter, as shown on the chart. Second, joint venture contributions, the asset sale and the effect of 1Q expirations will be dilutive to the tune of $0.02 per quarter. Finally, operating expenses and overhead are both expected to pick up over the course of the year, which will reduce the run rate by another $0.01 per quarter. The upshot is that the core quarterly run rate is roughly $1.18 to $1.19 per share, essentially in line with the midpoint of the revised core FFO per share guidance range of $4.80 to $4.90 we've provided in the press release. Shifting gears to operational performance. Our tenant retention was uncharacteristically low this quarter due primarily to a PBB move-out in Minneapolis, and occupancy slipped again as a result. However, we expect occupancy to begin to improve going forward. I would like to highlight 2 new variables with the assumptions underlying guidance that speak to our view of internal growth prospects going forward. The first is we are projecting portfolio occupancy at year end of 92% to 93%. Second, same-capital cash NOI growth of 4% to 5%. This concludes today's prepared remarks. I would like -- I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator. We are pleased to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : My first question has to do with -- obviously, you touched on the retention rate and the occupancy as being connected. A question I have relative to the leasing statistics was across the board on both new and renewal leases, the terms or the lease length appear to be significantly shorter. Can you give us a little bit of background on maybe the composition that drove the shorter terms? Arthur William Stein : So we think that we are living in an improving fundamental environment. So we're actually quite comfortable living with shorter lease terms. In the first quarter, we did have a number of leases with lower-than-average lease terms. But it really varies. So the current pipeline has leases that are also quite a bit longer than what you saw on the first quarter. And our mid-market initiative is designed to even out some of that lumpiness. I just want to remind you that the first quarter is our third consecutive quarter of strong leasing volume. And we saw very stable pricing in the quarter. And in addition, we saw very encouraging results from mid-market initiative, which as Matt said, we're expecting $4 million to $7 million a quarter of mid-market revenues. So to sum up, we think the first quarter demonstrates the continued strength of the overall demand environment. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Great. And then, my follow-up question, Bill, is just relative to your comment on increasingly looking at future joint ventures. Does the company have any outline as to the scope and the nature of those joint ventures? Or is it early days still? Arthur William Stein : Well, it's still early days. We do have a potential joint venture on Turn-Key assets. We're evaluating that right now in the context of the larger capital recycling initiative. And we are looking at potentially using joint venture capital to fund our growth initiatives in Asia Pac. Operator : Our next question is from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Terrific. So the press release refers to pricing being, I think, it said generally stable to slightly improving, and you mentioned the strength in Asia Pac. But if you could provide us more pricing color by region, including around the U.S., are there any particular standout markets, good or bad, right now? Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. Thanks for the question. The pricing differential, and we did talk about sort of the standout piece and with the good deal of the Q1 leasing being in Asia Pac, and certainly is significant that the pricing in Asia Pac remains strong. We do see relatively stable pricing throughout the U.S. with some small pockets of potential increased pricing power in areas like New York metro, and I would say stabilized pricing power in the places where most of our new deals are landing, including Ashburn, Dallas and Chicago. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then, for my follow-up, which is related, just regarding the supply by region that you provided back at the Investor Day. Are you prepared with any stats? Could you update on -- us on that in terms of excess supply? The number of quarters of supply by region? Or can you just give us a feel directionally for how much that's improved? Matthew J. Miszewski: So certainly, I'd be happy to refer to some of the trends that we've seen in the first quarter, as well as sort of an update to where we are in -- from Investor Day. And I did make mention during my prepared remarks about Northern Virginia certainly as a standout area that has got some reported strength in terms of the supply that's out there. And I do want to make sure that we color this the correct way. The supply announcements that happened in Northern Virginia were primarily what we refer to as shared infrastructure supply as opposed to our dedicated infrastructure supply that we have in that same market. So the industry does need to mature to the point that it takes into account some of these product differentiations. But across the board, we certainly did see an increase in supply. As I just mentioned, in terms of pricing, we are not seeing the macroeconomic event that would suggest there would be pricing pressure in that market for us, as our pricing ability in Northern Virginia remains relatively strong. I believe, at Investor Day, we discussed a little bit about Silicon Valley supply as well. And all of these things need to be taken as a whole. Supply, of course, exists in Silicon Valley. And there were some announcements that would suggest additional supply. But we have seen, on our side, in my team, a demand curve that's actually shifting up and to the right. And so, that demand characteristic matches up with the supply that we currently have in that particular environment, which by the end of this half will be small to nonexistent. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Great. Yes. Just, first of all, it's another great quarter of leasing. And I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color in terms of either verticals or applications that you're seeing the demand come out of? And I guess, as a sub-question to that, just wondering how much of your leasing comes through an RFP process versus sort of an outgoing calling effort? Matthew J. Miszewski: Happy to talk a little bit more about the leasing success and the vertical orientation, some of the leasing. We saw significant movement in terms of social media, the cloud being sort of a dominant part of the last 3 quarters of our progress, as well as some movement and some positive movements in terms of mobile applications, as well as content delivery. We believe that the progress in each of those areas in Q1 is indicative of the health of our ecosystem as we move forward. Each one of those has been identified as drivers of data center demand. But as we see us landing and capturing that demand, we think that bodes well for us. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Great. And in terms of the RFPs? Matthew J. Miszewski: So, yes, it's very interesting. I think we commented that 90% of our Q1 deals came from repeat customers of ours. And when we see repeat customers of ours, oftentimes, more than likely, we see those deals before they go out officially to RFP. So we see a good mixture of RFP-related demand, but we also, because of the relationships and the long-term relationships that we've had with our customers and the performance of our operational staff, we actually have a tendency to get some first looks prior to RFPs being released, then we have the ability to capture that demand pretty well. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Great. I don't know if I'm going to break some rules here, but I was wondering if you guys might tell us a little bit about how you're interconnected data center effort is going. And what kind of demand you saw for the bandwidth between your facilities? Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. As you know, we are a big advocate of the digital ecosystem and that was -- the respect that I had for that process was based upon the promise of the digital ecosystem. During the first quarter, I got to see -- I was lucky enough to see the promise of that ecosystem now start to deliver itself in terms of actual results. And so -- and this was maybe a little less obvious in the prepared remarks that we had earlier. But we do believe that there's a shift happening in the data center market that used to focus on data storage as the highest-placed value, and now really focuses on the exchange of information as part of that value. When we started the digital ecosystem -- network ecosystem process, we had done it as a way to increase deal liquidity and to increase the size of those deals as they come out. We did see in Q1 some direct revenues that actually came out of that effort as well. So we're pretty happy to see the outcome be both direct and indirect to our bottom line. Operator : Our next question is from Charles Croson in Barclays. Charles Croson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : This is Charles, standing in for Ross. So in terms of this retail push and taking that into context with the shifting to a more build-to-suit model, how does that work? Because I imagine that you're not building out an entire data center anymore for a few retail-based tenants. Can you kind of tease out how that all works? Arthur William Stein : So the buy-to-order, if you will, is really more targeted at the enterprise market. And the middle market would still require that inventory be available. So that tends to be absorbed very quickly after signing. Charles Croson - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And, Bill, I apologize if you had mentioned this at the start of the call. I got on a little late. Do you have any updates in terms of the CEO search in terms of timeline, a potential short list of candidates? Arthur William Stein : Sure. Well, the update is that the search has started. So a recruiting firm has been retained and the expectation is that the process will be concluded some time in 2014. But in the meantime, the board and the Chairman of the Board, in particular, has indicated that he's confident with the current leadership that's in place. And the board is really focused on finding the right candidate versus rushing to find the candidate in an arbitrary period of time. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. Bill, maybe a follow-up on the last question. For the CEO search process, I mean, can you maybe talk about what criteria, if any, have been identified for that \"right candidate?\" And then, second question, maybe one for Scott. Just wondering if you can comment on where your visibility is on some of the asset sales as part of the capital recycling program. And maybe, what the potential magnitude of that could be this year? Arthur William Stein : Stephen, the criteria is really what you would expect for the CEO of any public company, and particularly one that's in the data center space. So it's an individual that is experienced in data centers, ideally, specifically, real estate, as a subset, technology and finance. But let me -- I want to reiterate here though that the company is really focused right now on pursuing its strategic vision during this interim period. And that represents optimizing our return on portfolio, recycling our capital, as Scott will speak to, and unleashing the intellectual capital of the organization. Scott E. Peterson: Part of the visibility on the asset sales, it's a little early in the process to speak to specifics on that. So we probably will have a better idea of some of the order of magnitude maybe in the next call. The general plan, though, is that we will sell the non-data center assets, the non-core markets, underperforming assets and evaluate the potential underperforming assets. And as Bill stated earlier, we'd expect to cull the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio over the next few years. Operator : Our next question is from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just want to go back to the comments regarding sort of the more customer-centric focus today, which I think is definitely the right direction. In the past, the focus has been more on sort of standardization of processes and some of the scale benefits through the development program when you were -- was a bigger part of the story. I was just curious how you guys balance the benefits of that scale and standardization versus sort of more customized -- custom service-oriented solutions and maybe possibly more customized data centers. Arthur William Stein : Sure, Vincent. So we think that it's possible to do both. So we basically build in blocks or modules. I think you've probably seen our presentations where you see how we build electrical rooms in Dallas, and it's been trucked up to our data center sites. So really, I think the issue is the level of redundancy that a particular customer might need. And we can adjust that through the assembly process, still maintain the cost efficiencies that we've achieved. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And maybe just a follow-on to that question. I mean, as the industry continues to evolve and change, you guys talked about the supply in Northern Virginia being mostly shared infrastructure versus dedicated. I mean, are you seeing that sentiment change at all in terms of is there -- is the pool of folks that really just want dedicated versus shared as big as it has ever been? Or are you starting to see some of that barrier come down as people get more comfortable with the overall outsourced model? Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes, that's a great question. And I would say that I certainly came in as a newcomer to the industry this last year with some of those same types of questions. I'd say that the past 3 quarters of very solid, dedicated infrastructure revenue that we produced is a pretty good testament to a strong and growing market out there for that particular type of product. But as Bill said, we can't keep our eyes closed to particularly new customer demands that are out there. We need to be open to that. And I think that the secret sauce moving forward is truly sort of getting the pieces that we have traditionally provided, that our customers have paid us for over the years. And coupling that together with what some of our partners provide to provide solutions that they're seeking in a new environment. And when we can do that, we find that the value that they're seeking matches well the value that we provide. And that's what we're going to try to do moving forward. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Crow of Raymond James & Associates. William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Bill, in order to avoid maybe a surprise next quarter, you already alluded to a lease with a financial services tenant that was going to roll down. Maybe, you could give us the magnitude of that roll-down. And how many more such leases that would be material we might see over the next year or so? Arthur William Stein : Sure. Firstly, I want to emphasize, Bill, that rolldown is in our guidance. So there shouldn't be any surprise from that standpoint. And the -- we expect that rents could roll down in the 15% to 20% range for that lease. William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Anything more over the course of the year that you think is going to pop up of that magnitude? Arthur William Stein : No. Operator : Our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Yes. I just have 2 questions. The first one being the 4% same-store cash NOI growth that you're projecting for the year. I'm just -- if you give a little bit more color on how you roll up to that number, because your occupancy, you're going to gain somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points. The mark-to-markets are probably going to be flat to modestly positive. I'm just kind of struggling a little bit how to kind of roll on that up to a 4% kind of same-store cash NOI growth number. Matt Mercier : Yes, Tayo, this is Matt. Good question. So we've got 2.5% to 3% basically coming from -- we're talking about cash NOI growth. So we got 2.5% to 3% coming from just embedded rent bumps. And we've got probably 60 to 80 basis points from some of the expirations that we've talked about. And then, we also have another 2.5% to 3% coming from free rents of ramps that are burning off from the embedded portfolio, as well with some additional staggered lease commencements that were part of leasing we've done over the last year. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Got it, okay. That is helpful. And then, the second question is, one of your peers mentioned that they were actively working through the Facebook sublease in Santa Clara. Just kind of wondering, at this point, if you guys are doing anything with Facebook and where kind of things stand? Arthur William Stein : Scott? Scott E. Peterson: We don't make comments about individual customers, but we've enjoyed a great deal of success with Facebook, both as it started out a company and grew inside Digital's data centers. And we continue to see that progress moving forward. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : I think you may have addressed this earlier, but the decline in guidance for spec revenue for this year that's just -- is that related to a longer-than-expected commencement lag? Matt Mercier : No. I mean, this is a positive thing. It's actually -- the spec revenue we've cut in half. So meaning, we've signed up and expect to commence $15 million to $20 million of what we had in the prior quarter. So that leaves a -- or $10 million to $15 million, I'm sorry. And now, we have another $10 million to $15 million left for the year. But it's a positive. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : It's not a cumulative number? Matt Mercier : It's not a cumulative number. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. I was a little bit confused on that. Okay. But that helps. And then, I guess, a question for Bill or Scott, just on the guidance on cap rates. I guess, your max contribution could be $400 million, if I read that correctly. And your average cap rate that you're projecting is about a 7%, and I seem to recall that you guys have said that Turn-Key would be a big component of that, or potentially a meaningful component. And so, I'm just curious if that's the right inference that you guys think that a JV partner is going to pay basically a 7% cap for Turn-Key. And if that's not really much of a spread in cap rate over Powered Base, I'm just wondering if you can help us with the right conclusions to draw from what we're seeing in your guidance? Arthur William Stein : Yes. I think that is a fair inference. And by the way, I want to go back to your question on leasing. The guidance was cut in half because of the leasing we did, not because we don't think we're going to do anymore leasing. I just want to make that clear. But we do think that -- I mean, I think, your analysis is correct that the 7-ish is probably the accurate cap rate to use on the Turn-Key for joint ventures. Scott, do you have anything you want to add? Scott E. Peterson: I think that's probably it. Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : First, I wanted to take a stab at the run rate that you ran through, Matt, on the guidance, starting out at $1.28, and then walking us down to $1.18 to $1.19. I guess what I didn't hear in there was any incremental contribution from the core growth that you're anticipating, as well as the impact of any new leasing in the speculative revenue. And I was wondering if there are offsets to those drivers. Matt Mercier : Yes. Well, clearly, we have a backlog of NOIs we've shown. But the run rate's meant to project where we expect to be starting as of the second quarter. I think there's a couple of other things to keep in mind. First, as we've shown, we did have dispositions, but that's bringing down the run rate. And in addition, we have contemplated an additional capital raise in the year. So that provides some additional headwind that we could be facing, as well as our development program runs down. I think we've talked about in the past that there's capitalized interest that will be coming down. So again, this is just meant to project where we'll be starting as we enter the second quarter. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. Just a follow-up, I think, Matt Miszewski, you mentioned in your commentary that the inventory remained relatively flat sequentially, as you brought on a little bit more inventory and you had a move-out in LA of a Turn-Key customer. So if you could -- so one, I'm curious about the nature of the move-out. But separately, can you just speak to the amount of inventory you would like to have available ideally going forward? Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So I don't think that -- to the question, I don't -- we always sort of bandy about the conversation about what the optimal amount of ready inventory is. But given Bill's comments about the just-in-time inventory adjustment that we're going to make, given that we can deliver within [indiscernible], it becomes a little less of a pressing issue for us. We simply don't see the need for us to hold on to a significant amount of inventory because we're able to satisfy the customer's needs relatively quickly. And I think I may have talked about this at Investor Day, as well. So you may want to refer back to that. The move-out is an interesting story. It was about a 300-kilowatt move-out. And in order for us to do that -- really the organization that did that was consolidating their operations, and they did that out [ph]. Operator : Our next question is from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : It's Michael Bilerman, here, with Manny. So Bill, just had a question. As you think about when the board made the decision to make a change with Mike and let him go, you've titled this whole presentation in the supplemental, \"Turning A New Path Forward.\" I'm just curious, is this your new path forward that you've presented to the board? Or is Chairman of the Board and transition committee putting forth a new path forward? Arthur William Stein : This is a new path forward that both I and the senior leadership team have created. And we presented it to the board, and we're presenting it to shareholders clearly, and we're going to be rolling it out to the employees as well. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And so, how should we think about -- I assume, the board is thinking about a search process, both internal and external. And I'm not sure if you're raising your hand, or you have raised your hand. But I would assume, and if it is, if you're not the guy, and the new CEO comes in, they may have their own ideas about what path that they want to take, and their ideas about where they want to go. And isn't the board pigeonholing themselves a little bit? Or are you opening up investors to a secondary path forward when a new CEO comes into place, if you're not the person? Arthur William Stein : Mike, well, I mean, I think these are pretty basic and fundamental in terms of a strategic vision. So optimizing a return on the portfolio, recycling capital, unleashing the intellectual capital of our workforce, is motherhood and apple pie? And I can't really see anyone else disagreeing with those initiatives. Operator : Our next question is from Gabriel Hilmoe of UBS. Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just going back to the spec revenue number for a minute, and what's been derisked so far. Are there any other moving parts in that number where you've added some additional spec relative to the $20 million to $30 million that you had in there before? Is that clearly here [ph], or has it truly been derisked, I guess, by 50%. Matt Mercier : Can you repeat that? The first half was kind of lost. Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I guess, just on the spec revenue number, is it -- is the $20 million to $30 million, and I guess, now it's $10 million to $15 million, is that truly an apples-to-apples comparison? Or has anything been added on a go forward basis that's new spec revenue I guess? Matt Mercier : I mean, that isn't apples-to-apples. I mean, just to be clear, it reflects what we expect to recognize from -- on a revenue basis from new leasing. It doesn't include re-leasing or renewal-type activity. So this is new incremental leasing. And at the start of the year, as we've noted, we had $20 million to $30 million expected from -- we expected to sign and commence from new leasing. And as a result of the strong first quarter results, we've cut that in half. Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then, I apologize if you mentioned this before, but how much of the leasing in the quarter was related to, I guess, the mid-market strategy? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much that played out in the numbers? Matthew J. Miszewski: I think, it's in there. But $4.1 million was related to colocation mid-market strategy. Operator : Our next question is from George Auerbach of ISI Group. George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Matt, you mentioned the pre-stabilized bucket has some assets moving in and out. Do you have a number for what the lease percentage would have been quarter-over-quarter had that bucket remained static? Matt Mercier : I'm sorry, can you repeat that? George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. The pre-stabilized bucket, the $500 million of assets that's now 10% leased and was 17%. I know there's things moving in and out. Just trying to figure out what -- at year end, it was 17% leased, where would that have been today had you not sort of moved some assets in and out of that portfolio? Matt Mercier : I don't have the ins and outs in front of me. I'm sure that's something we can follow up on. Arthur William Stein : But, Steve (sic) [George], just to be clear, one of the reasons that percentage went down is that we took some properties out of that bucket that were signed and shown as leased last quarter, and were moved out because the lease has commenced. So that caused the percentage to -- percentage lease decline. And in addition, we delivered some new pods to the bucket as well. Those are pods at Melbourne and St. Louis. So in Phoenix, we commenced leases that have already been signed. They moved out of the bucket. We also -- I mentioned some leases in New York and, again, that bucket percentage will go down. But at the end of the day, this is going to represent our finished inventory. It has to be leased. So I think you would expect, but for properties that are signed but not commenced, that lease percentage should be relatively low until the lease has commenced. George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Right. I guess I was just trying to think of some sort of measure, how you're doing leasing up that finished inventory? So I was just trying to figure out, as you went from Q4 into Q1, how much was done? And I guess, maybe, the question is, of the $500 million that's in the pipeline today, at 10% or 11% leased, on a same-store basis, where do you think that portfolio is on a lease percentage -- occupied percentage by year end '14? Matthew J. Miszewski: So I don't know if I've got that exact number. But I think what you're going for, between Q4 and Q1, I'm always careful about the word I use, but we did burn about 5 megawatts of that inventory. And moving forward, we feel like we've got a target on burning even more of that inventory in Q2. I think that gets towards your question. Matt Mercier : And just to follow-up. Most of that space is not in the pre -- is not going to be in the same capital pool. It's going to be in -- it's new space. And I think that I would refer you back to the 92% to 93% overall total portfolio occupancy that we're guiding to. We're at 92.1% to date. So clearly, that suggests that we expect to lease a decent amount of that pool in the remainder of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes. I was interested in the comments about one-size-fits-all. And I don't know if you answered it earlier or not. But you talked about, Bill, all Model Ts and being black, and so forth. And are you -- is there something different in terms of the technical specifications or parameters of the product around density or size that you were alluding to that's going to be different going forward? And then, my second question is, if you could speak to kind of the European market, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and so forth, and where you're seeing strength? And what kind of a competitive environment it is? Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So great question about the product development that may be needed as we continue our customer focus moving forward. And you get right to the heart of what this senior leadership team over the past few weeks had struggled with and come to some conclusions about. We don't believe that there is a significant departure in terms of density and size, and what I call the building blocks of the solutions that our customers are seeking. The building blocks from our perspective will remain, space and power that we have delivered over time. They will also leverage our digital ecosystem in terms of the network deployments that we have made and that we have been able to leverage from some of our partners. And then, they will take some pieces from our partner ecosystem in the new Digital partner network, including items like managed services, cloud service provision, and the like, and they will be coupled together into solutions that our customers want. So in terms of what we need to provide from Digital's perspective, it remains in our wheelhouse. The density and size doesn't even change a whole lot. There may be a few things that we need to provide an individual market that maybe a little more dense or a little less dense, or a little larger, a little smaller. But the general facilities that we provide will continue to be the facilities we'll provide in the future for our customers. But the solutions will be different and will be tailored to their needs. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan -- a follow-up from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Reading a lot about data centers being built with no resiliency, no redundancies, so I guess, N, and obviously, the cost structure around that is a lot less. You guys have flexibility in terms of the redundancy that you can deliver to your customers. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any demand around that. Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So great question, Jonathan. We see a lot of demand. And it really, from a resiliency perspective, plays the gamut. But the greatness of sort of our POD 3.0 architecture is we can deliver the components that our customers are asking for within the same time frame from market-to-market. So we had an example in 2013, where someone did come to us with a solid N requirement and we were able to deploy a data center solution whose cost profile met their price profile and met exactly what they were looking for in terms of resiliency. So I think that if there is anything changing, folks are moving more towards our incremental process so that they can actually address differing needs without addressing -- without significantly augmenting the cost to deploy. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session and conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Stein. A. William Stein : Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Last quarter, we outlined our strategic vision for the company and the initiatives that we\u2019re pursuing to advance that vision. Today, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the progress that we\u2019ve made over the last 120 days, beginning here on Page 2 of our presentation. We\u2019ve stated that driving improved return on invested capital through the lease-up of existing inventory is our top priority. I am pleased to announce that we leased 9 megawatts of existing inventory during the second quarter. We\u2019ve reduced our finished inventory balance by over 25% since Investor Day last November. This enhanced asset utilization has boosted our ROIC by over 20 basis points so far this year. We\u2019re also well underway on a rigorous evaluation of the entire portfolio. This process is designed to identify non-strategic and underperforming assets that can be harvested to narrow our focus on the core. We expect our capital recycling initiative will likewise have a meaningfully positive impact on overall return on invested capital. We expect to conclude this exercise over the summer and bring the first set of properties to market immediately after Labor Day. Scott Peterson will have more to say about our efforts on this front during his remarks. In early June, we announced our global cloud marketplace, a solution that makes our customers public, private and hybrid cloud services, easily accessible to our entire global customer base. We believe that partnering with our customers is the best way to provide our enterprise customers with a differentiated offering and to create value. The global cloud marketplace will enable Digital Realty clients to instantly provision on demand, burstable cloud services from trusted cloud providers such as IBM SoftLayer, Internap, Interoute, GoGrid, and SingleHop. And program is still on its infancy, but demand for the offering has been strong and we expect to see healthy adoption as awareness grows. I\u2019d like to pause here for a moment and explain why the concept behind the cloud marketplace is so important for our future direction. A year and a half ago, at the Citi Conference in Florida, Michael Bilerman stepped out of character for a moment and served me up a softball. He asked what aspect of our story was most underappreciated by investors? I responded that it was our global footprint and our enterprise customer base. That was true then, but it\u2019s even more applicable today. Modern cloud providers cater to small and medium-size businesses, but they all aspire to penetrate the enterprise marketplace. The enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base. They already populate our data centers around the world. Our recent leasing activity has been heavily skewed to cloud service providers, in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. Enterprise customers in turn are attracted by the ability to easily and securely connect to multiple areas of their hybrid cloud. Both sets of customers choose to grow on our platform, in part because of the presence of other. The final catalyst connecting our incredible enterprise customer base to the cloud service providers they now need to grow is the deployment of our global network ecosystem. This mutual attraction and our interconnected global portfolio essentially act as a wide mode that is extremely difficult for competitors to replicate. No one else has the footprint and the cost structure to effectively service the enterprise customer on a global basis. The competitive advantage of this network effect is analogous to a network-dense data center but on a global portfolio scale rather than a single building. This premise will be borne out over time by the ability to attract new enterprise logos, as well as new cloud service providers, the ability to retain these customers and the growth of their existing footprints within our portfolio. Back to current results. Our mid-market segment turned in another solid performance this quarter. The investments we\u2019ve made in upgrading connectivity and expanding the amenities that we offer are enhancing RPO to retail customers. As you can see from our press release, we\u2019ve raised guidance for our capital spending plans over the balance of the year. Over 90% of this additional capital commitment is due to incremental leasing activity. This match between leasing and funding is exactly what we aim to achieve with the build-to-order inventory management strategy that we outlined last quarter. Unleashing intellectual capital is something of a soft initiative. So let me give you some tangible examples. For starters, our General Counsel, Josh Mills\u2019 responsibilities had been expanded to include environmental fairs and corporate real estate. Sustainability has been important issue for data centers, given the sector\u2019s energy footprint and Josh will be sphere hitting our efforts on this front. John Sarcus who many of you met at various conferences and investor events has recently been named Colocation general manager, in addition to his responsibilities leading our connectivity initiative. Scott Peterson\u2019s promotion to Chief Investment Officer has arguably had the most immediate impact. He and his team are restructuring the investment review process to ensure consistency across disciplines and regions. Essentially, any deal that requires commitment of incremental capital is now brought before the investment committee. This process is imposing tighter discipline on capital allocation decisions and promoting appropriate behavior from the sales team, as well as the broker channels. It also delayed two quarter end leasing transactions, which has traditionally been the window when customers were able to extract the most favorable terms. One of these deals has come back to us and appears likely to close on terms that we proposed. This underwriting discipline may impact leasing velocity in future periods, particularly, as we continue to riddle down our stockpile of available inventory. However, we are confident that this approach is translating to improved net effective leasing economics and better returns for our shareholders. Looking forward and turning now to page 3 of the presentation, we see robust demand for the premium data center solutions we offer, providing peace of mind to our customers and enabling them to focus on their core business. The macro backdrop appears relatively benign despite the reason rise in geopolitical uncertainty. Data center fundamentals are gradually improving, as excess supply is being consistently absorbed. We are taking a much more disciplined approach to inventory management. And we see more rationale behavior for many other industry participants as well. Consequently, we are cautiously optimistic that data center fundamentals will continue to improve underpinning acceptable risk-adjusted returns, as well as the stability of our cash flows. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Scott to provide an update on our capital recycling initiatives. Scott E. Peterson:  Thank you, Bill. As mentioned in the last quarter, the investment team is undertaking a wholesale analysis of every single property in our portfolio. This analysis is well underway and should be complete later this year. The first phase of the project targeted a group of high priority properties consisting primarily of non-core assets, data center properties in non-core markets, underperformers and at-risk properties. As a result of this analysis, we expect to prune the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio in order to refine our strategic focus, fund future capital requirements and improve return on invested capital. As Bill mentioned, we plan to start bringing these properties to market after Labor Day. During the second quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of a small single tenant building to the user for approximately $42 million, generating a gain on sale of approximately $16 million and realizing a levered IRR in the low teens. While the cap rate was at the high end of our expected disposition range, it is not a very relevant metric in this instance as there are only 18 months left on the lease term. We did explore several options for the property and determined we could generate a better return on our capital elsewhere. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to discuss our recent leasing activity. Matthew J. Miszewski: Thank you, Scott. As shown page 5 of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling over $35 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter. The first half of the year tends to be seasonally slow. The consistency of our recent leasing momentum is readily apparent from a comparison of our year-to-date leasing activity, relative to the first half of any previous year. Keep in mind that the $47 million we reported in the first quarter included a $12 million direct lease with the former subtenant at a Powered-Base Building in Santa Clara. Excluding this lease, our second quarter leasing velocity was right on top of the first quarter and both quarters progressed according to plan. This positive momentum has carried through to the month of July and the third quarter is off to a strong start as well. Colocation revenue accounted for over 15% of our second quarter leasing activity. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that our mid-market segment has delivered a contribution within a range for $4 million to $8 million. The purchase in context, is helpful to realize that prior to the third quarter of 2013, this segment typically generated between $1 million and $2 million per quarter. Cloud, content and social media were the drivers once again accounting for over three-forth of our second quarter leasing activity. Existing customers represented more than 80% of our second quarter lease signings, but the new team has also added 60 new logos year-to-date. Cash rents on renewal leases rolled out by mid-single digits as shown on page six. The large lease with the financial services tenant in Northern Virginia that was signed at Pageant and that we highlighted on the last call was finally renewed in July. The rent roll down 11% on a cash basis, a bit better than the 15% to 20% roll down we guided towards previously. This renewal was not reflected in our second quarter leasing statistics, but will obviously leave a mark in the third quarter although it has been fully baked into our guidance. It\u2019s important to note that this transaction was also expanded to include one part in Dallas, as well as the fourth part in Ashburn. Base rates on Turn-Key Flex leases signed were lower than last quarter entirely due to market mix, reflecting a concentration of activity in lower cost, lower rent in North American markets including Dallas, Ashburn and Phoenix. On a like-for-like basis, base rents were flat to up slightly. More importantly, concessions are abating. This improvement reflects our retool sales compensation program, and the revamped investment review process, as well as gradually improving data center fundamentals. Turn-Key leasing costs were elevated in the second quarter driven primarily by one large 15-year lease. Adjusting for term on a per square foot per year of lease turn basis, the second quarter leasing cost terms are significantly diverged from the norm. Turning now to lease duration on page eight, lease terms are admittedly shorter on core location leasing and as Bill mentioned, last quarter we are comparable going a bit shorter in a rising rental rate environment. The average turn on leases signed during the second quarter was over seven years. This is true whether the second quarter leasing activity is weighted by square feet or by rent. The weighted average remaining lease term across the entire portfolio is half year shorter, we did by rent rather than square feet, but it\u2019s still well over six years. The duration of our average lease term supports the stability of our cash flow stream and strengthens our cost of capital advantage. In addition to signings lease commencements were also respectable. As you can see from the chart at the bottom right of page nine, the weighted average lag between signing and commencement and stuff from six to seven months. This lag is entirely due to future delivery of committed space and is not indicative of either free rents or an elongation of the sales cycle. The team reached a total of 17 megawatts during the second quarter of which 9 or a little more than half came from our finished inventory balance. To put this in contact, the historical average mix of existing inventory as a present of total leasing has been one-third of the total. We started new clouds in Ashburn and in Hong Kong this quarter and the net absorption of finished inventory was 4.5 megawatts. As Bill mentioned during his remarks, and as you can see here on page 10, we have reduced our finished inventory balance by over 25%, since the Investor Day last November. The positive net absorption in Phoenix over that timeframe is particularly encouraging. It was also encouraging to see this positive net absorption translate to a 70 basis point improvement in overall portfolio occupancy. Following several quarters of declines, due to the move out of various non-data center tenants along with the delivery of the inventory that we are now absorbing. We did have one tenant occupying 2 megawatts in Phoenix, that was in whole over started as of June 30 and is expected to move out in the third quarter. We have a very healthy demand funnel in Phoenix however, and we expect overall portfolio occupancy to continue to improve in the second half. Turning now to supply on pages 11 and 12, the available inventory in Northern Virginia has actually come down by a few megawatts over the past 90 days. While new construction is underway in Texas. I\u2019d like to point out, that these charts reflect total market supply and do not differentiate between shared back plain facilities and our dedicated infrastructure product. We believe that much of this available supply is not directly competitive with our offering. As a case in point, we have a very healthy demand funnel in both Northern Virginia and Dallas, and we can scarcely keep any inventory on the shelf in either market. The uptick in sublease space in Santa Clara resides within our portfolio. We received notice from an internet enterprise that represents approximately 1% of NOI that they intend submit approximately 10 megawatts they occupy in Santa Clara. Their leases expired in 2016 and 2019 and the in place rent is well below market. We are working with the client on it solution, and do have interest in the space from multiple perspective customers. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier, to talk you through our financial results. Matt? Matthew Mercier : Thank you, Matt. Most of the balance sheet activity occurred prior through our last earnings call, but several significant events took place during the second quarter. In mid-April, our exchangeable debentures are exchanged for common equity, which improved debt to EBITDA by 0.3 turns. We also raised an additional $63.5 million in April under reopening of the 7 and 3H Series H preferred and partial exercise of the underwriters over allotment option, including the sterling bond offering and the original Series H issuance that closed in the first quarter. This brings our year-to-date total of long-term capital ratio approximately $900 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter S&P revised its outlook from negative to stable reflecting our improved operating performance As shown here on page 14 of the presentation, the bond market has taken note and our credit spreads have tightened considerably over the past several months, and have also our performed the re-BBB benchmark, most notably since S&P revised its outlook. Turning now to operating performance, as Matt alluded to in his remarks, portfolio occupancy ticked up 70 basis points. The first sequential occupancy gain in the past six quarters. We\u2019ve also raised guidance for the year-end portfolio occupancy by 75 basis points at the mid-point on the strength of the second quarter rebound. As Matt indicated in his presentation, cash releasing spreads were positive across product types in the second quarter. Although, the large roll down in Northern Virginia was signed in July, it will have an impact on our third quarter leasing statistics. Same capital cash NOI growth was 5.8% for the second quarter, above the high end of our forecast. The year-to-date number is squarely within the 4% to 5% guidance range. I\u2019d also like to address our guidance for incremental revenues remaining to be recognized in 2014 from speculative leasing, which shows the reduction from $10 million to $15 million last quarter to $5 million to $10 million this quarter. As of mid-July, we have already achieved the full speculative leasing target that was embedded in our prior guidance. We are not resting on laurels for the rest of the year, however, we\u2019ve raised the bar by an additional $5 million to $10 million of current year revenue we expect to recognize from leases that have not yet been signed. We\u2019ve also raised CapEx guidance for development spending and capitalize leasing cost by approximately 15% at the mid-point. However, as Bill mentioned in his remarks, over 90% of this additional capital commitment is related to incremental leasing activity. We expect to fund near term capital requirements with proceeds from asset sale and joint ventures. We currently have no plans to revisit the equity market any time soon. At the bottom line, we\u2019ve raised core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Our improved outlook is entirely organic. We\u2019ve actually reduced our acquisitions guidance by half. We\u2019ve also introduced disposition guidance for the first time and we do expect a couple of pennies per share of dilution on a combination of assets sales and joint venture contributions in the second half of the year. To recap the highlights for the quarter, as advertised here on page 16, we signed over $35 million of new leasing during the second quarter, including a $5.7 million mid-market contribution. Released 9 megawatts of existing inventory with 4.5 megawatts of positive net absorption. We achieved our full-year speculative leasing target. We\u2019ve registered an uptick in occupancy for the first time in a year and half. We generated positive cash releasing spreads across the product types. We delivered 5.8% same capital cash NOI growth. S&P revised its outlook from negative to stable. Our second quarter core FFO per share consensus by a $1. And finally, we raised 2014 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05 at the mid-point. We are quite pleased with our second quarter financial results. And as most people here at Digital know I am fairly hard to please. And now, we\u2019ll be pleased to open up the call and take your question. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vance H. Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great. Thank a lot. So as you look to bring the first set of properties to market after Labor Day, maybe if you could just provide an update on the money flows in the data center world. Who the potential buyers might be? I think in the recent past, you've mentioned seeing pension and other money looking to invest. Any updates there on demand or even cap rates? Will it be more users looking to buy? And any appearance of sovereign wealth money yet? Scott E. Peterson: Yes. Vance it\u2019s Scott Peterson here. It\u2019s a little soon to say, but as far as the buyers we\u2019re seeing a lot of \u2013 we\u2019re seeing demand on the buy side to be pretty robust in the private markets. I think we\u2019ll find on the non-core assets, I think we\u2019ll find traditional buyers for those types for assets that will be interested in them, the data center buyers will be a mix and the non-core markets will be a mix of maybe value add as well as traditional stabilized asset buyers, and then for some of the underperformers I think we\u2019ll see probably more the value add type buyers there, there might be private equity backed, but that\u2019s kind of really speculation at this point, what I can say is we\u2019re getting numerous phone calls from potential buyers out there that are very interested in looking at anything that we\u2019re interested in selling. Vance H. Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then as my follow-up, you mentioned geopolitical risk. Could you expand on that a bit? Where you think there might be potential risk? And perhaps while you\u2019re at it, just walk us through Europe \u2013 do Germany, France, and the UK remain strong? Any updates on demand in Asia? Do the inventory shortages continue there? Just kind of walk us around the globe in terms of strength and weaknesses? A. William Stein :  So London is very strong for us Vance, in fact we\u2019re in the process of running out of inventory there. We\u2019re bringing a project online in Dublin and we would expect the demand there to come mostly from this side of the pond. We have very little inventory in Paris I think less than half a plot and we\u2019re considering Amsterdam, but we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we have a site in Amsterdam, a land site but we won\u2019t be building there unless we have a pre-lease situation. Asia-Pac is also a very strong; Singapore, we could be out of inventory in Singapore by the end of next quarter. And I think in Hong Kong it\u2019s a good possibility we\u2019ll be out at the end of this year. So we\u2019re looking for additional sites both in Singapore and Hong Kong and leasing in Australia has been steady both in Melbourne and Sydney. Matt Miszewski : Vance, this is Matt Miszewski and given my political background apparently I get to answer the geopolitical risk questions. I don\u2019t see any impact to us on the geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, or in Central, and Eastern Europe. It is important though to understand that privacy concerns of the European Union and the non-Union countries that are inside Europe does have a bit of an impact on operations of datacenters through continental Europe as well as the islands. That actually ends up being a demand driver for some of our key customers including some very large cloud providers who are taking a deployment strategy to eliminate the data sovereignty risk that other providers have. So we\u2019re happy to see folks adjust for data sovereignty requirements within EMEA. As Bill said, we see the Asia demand on the demand side extremely strong and we don\u2019t see any geopolitical risk throughout our Asia-Pac portfolio. Operator :  And our next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Rob for Jonathan. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the increasingly solutions based sales approach under match guidance and how the strategies evolving in terms of the sales team and the recession by customers. And secondly regarding the launch of the global market place can you talk a little bit about take rates or how those services have been adopted with new customers or with new leasing and the impact on pricing. Matt Miszewski :  Happy to Rob, your first question is about the solution based sales approach and we continue to see this evolve in the best of possible situations where we are getting closer to our customers and really starting to approach the customer base from their point of view as opposed to from our point of view. We did need to make some fundamental adjustments to the sales force including the compensation plan adjustments that we made this past year before we went after the more advanced selling process in terms of solution selling, but now we see solution architecture as part of what we do inside the sales force as well as inside the small marketing team that I have on my team. If you think about the basics of this instead of us simply providing fantastic technical solutions for customers that we create here in San Francisco or in London or in Singapore, now we do this in partnership with our customers by sitting down with them talking to them about what their needs are and then making sure that our products and our solutions sit and meet their needs. One of the things we found out when we started this solution based process was that we did need things like the global cloud marketplace. And so the conversation that we are having with our customers are leading us to do things that make them more sticky inside all of our properties. The global cloud marketplace is one of this; the global network ecosystem is another one. And this has been successful we started as you know we started in Europe; we finished the North America rollout and the Asia Pacific rollout is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. When we finish that rollout, our network ecosystem will feature connectivity to over 1,000 available networks across the world. The last piece I will talk about in terms of this solution approach is our Open-IX initiative, not our Open-IX initiative, but the communities Open-IX initiative, is really starting to take off. We\u2019ve of course landed at the Amsterdam internet exchange inside our New York \u2013 one of our New York facilities as well as landed them into one of our Western Coast facilities and we are talking to four more providers right now. As you can see as we\u2019ve taken this approach and we\u2019ve led this approach in terms of solution based selling, you can start to see the data center industry itself start to transform from storage to a more affordable way for our customers to exchange data, which is truly the value that they see inside data centers today. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Anything about take rates? Or any sort of \u2013 can you quantify any of that related to new leasing activity or anything? Matt Miszewski : Yes. So when we announced the global cloud marketplace in June, we announced it early and we\u2019re in the early innings of the consideration of the GCM, what we\u2019ve also noticed is that there is an awful lot, we\u2019re learning more than we thought we would learn initially. And that learning is that there is an awful lot of demand for global cloud marketplace that we didn\u2019t anticipate. So we\u2019re starting to see not just cloud marketplace that we\u2019ve launched, but individual cloud marketplaces that are starting to come up in the conversation that we have with both our partners, as well as our customers. So I think the take rate question is a little bit too soon right now. We\u2019ve just operationally launched the facility and we\u2019re filling it up with partners today. and once we start to see, I mean we start to actively market that solution, I think you\u2019re going to start to see the uptake increase. And so we should be able to give some updates on that on next call. Operator : And our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Yes. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on just the economics around some of the deals that were signed this quarter, specifically Page 17 of the supplemental. If you just kind of take a look at leasing costs of square foot, it\u2019s gone up quite a bit that many leverage lease term is filled roughly about the same for a lot of your new leasing activities. So I\u2019m just a little bit curious about why the higher leasing costs and what may be going on and we got to higher negotiating with tenants that\u2019s resulting in this? A. William Stein : Tayo, that was one long-term deal in the quarter that drove an external commission that was quite substantially. So the leasing costs were based on that land commission, not TIs. And we don\u2019t see this as a trend. I think importantly, we\u2019re still seeing ROICs including TIs and LCs hitting our target range of 10% to 12%. And the comp plan that we put in place at the beginning of the year as we think is proving these leasing economics. Matt Miszewski : Yes. Tayo, this is Matt when we start to look at the total leasing costs across the quarter of course, we dug in a little bit deeper as the guys who launched the new comp plan, I wanted to make sure we\u2019re having the demonstrative effects that we anticipated we would. And as I said in my opening statements, we\u2019ve seen the rent abatements go away and lease ramps shorten, we\u2019ve also seen TIs in our world start to decrease when we do quarter-to-quarter comparisons, it is a significant decrease especially across the GKF products. Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : I think we took up that large tenant what would be you know what the number would have been for the quarter in regards to leasing cost per square foot on that when tenant? A. William Stein :  I don\u2019t know that I have that data immediately in front of me, but I\u2019d be happy to provide that right after the call. Operator : Our next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead. Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you guys talk a little bit about the lease expirations for the remainder of the year I see you got 5.4% of your rent roll expiring at about 190 bucks per foot can you just give us a little bit of color on what you think the retention rate is going to be on that? I know you talk about that one I think was that one leasing in Phoenix but beyond that what you expect the retention to be? Matt Miszewski :  Yes, this is Matt. We actually showed in terms of rent what we expect to expire over the balance of the year. It's on the NOI, NOI step up chart as part of the presentation is a $5 million that's included so of what expire we expect about $5 million and annual base rent not to renew as of today. Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Bill, can you give us an update on where things stand with the CEO search overall in the timing thereof? Thanks. A. William Stein : Ross, we are happy to. I mean as I said on the last call the board, our board is comfortable with the leadership that\u2019s in place. I think that comfort has been validated by what I would say has improved employee, customer and investor confidence both on the equity side and the fixed income side. I think it\u2019s interesting to note that since the change in leadership we\u2019ve recovered almost $2 billion of market cap for our shareholders. So the board continues to be focused on sourcing the right candidate for the job, but nevertheless the timing is still expected to be this year and meanwhile this team is focused on executing the strategic vision, which we played out to be optimizing the return on portfolio recycling capital and unleashing the intellectual capital of the firm. Operator : Our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Hello good afternoon everyone. Just want to go back to the new lease pricing in the US which dropped down to 130 per square foot I know a lot of that was attributed to the particular markets in the U.S., which are lower-priced in general. Just curious those three markets what percentage of within those three was all of it? A. William Stein :  So Vin, The drop as you said, the drop in rates is all market. North America, I think from North America perspective quarter-to-quarter in the first quarter 44% I think of our TKF GAAP rents came from Toronto while in second quarter 48% came from Dallas and Phoenix. It\u2019s actually give you an idea of a rough makeup in the North America since globally in Q1, we had some very large deals in APAC and EMEA about 62% of rents coming in across APAC and EMEA in the first quarter and again that comes back to North America in the second quarter about 75% of the rents. Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.:  Great, okay. And then, I\u2019m sorry, you also mentioned, I think Northern Virginia being a fairly big part of the mix this quarter, what was that percentage of leases? A. William Stein :  Yes, so in Northern Virginia was \u2013 there was sizable lease in the quarter and I\u2019m just going to back into that number I\u2019ve got to get that number for you. And I don\u2019t have in front of me. Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: You mentioned the quarterly same capital growth NOI growth was 5.8% was exceeded expectations. Can you just talk a little bit about what the upside was relative to the expectations and the implied guidance at the midpoint suggests some slowing from the 5.8% that we saw here in the second quarter just curious if that's really what you're expecting us to see or maybe your trending towards the higher end of that range? A. William Stein : Yes, I mean it\u2019s obviously that\u2019s just one quarter comparison. I think that\u2019s why we also stated with the year-to-date growth was which is clearly in the middle of where we\u2019re guiding and right now we are comfortable that with the year-to-date it reflects clearly accurately where we expect to be coming end of the year. Scott E. Peterson:  And Vin, just to get back to you on Northern Virginia Q2 it\u2019s about 10%. Operator :  Our next question will come from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead. Steve T. Sakwa \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Thanks, I guess good evening at this point or good afternoon. Just two questions, I guess on the Turn-Key joint venture Bill, what exactly or the goals if you want to get out of that. Is it too kind of established pricing and kind of core markets for yourself? Is it to eliminate some of the smaller markets that your end or markets really have one or two assets, I guess what\u2019s the immediate goal of that joint venture? A. William Stein :  There are two goals, Steve. The first is I think it\u2019s prudent for any company to diversify its capital sources. And so we clearly have access to public and private debt and access to public common debt and preferred this we believe will give us access to reliable source of private capital. In addition, we expect this will provide some transparency on private market valuations from a sophisticated investor for our Turn-Key product. And we think that\u2019s important as well particularly for the any devaluation of the analyst community and our investors. Steve T. Sakwa \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC :  But I guess from a market perspective where you looking to kind of proven in the Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Chicago are you looking the kind of sell maybe in the Boston, and in the St. Louis where you have one, two assets and maybe those markets on quite a score. Scott E. Peterson:  At this point the BOEs when we proven the non-core markets that will be throughout right sale. The joint venture would be in core markets really want to retain an interest and retain management of the asset. And each joint venture \u2013 this joint venture is being structured in the similar way to the prudential joint venture with retained 20% interest as management and property management fees as well as promote on cash flow in back end. Operator : The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. John Bejjani \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Hey, guys is that kind of $20 million or so quarterly G&A run rate is that fully incorporating the mid market sale teams up or how much further do you see this growing? Matt Miszewski :  Yes, the G&A numbers do have baked into them, the entire mid market sales additions, so we\u2019ve completed that process from a mid market perspectives, across G&A in total we do anticipate that we\u2019ll see a mild increase this year that also important to remember that this is already baked into guidance. And I would like to point out as the head of sales and marketing that additional cost in my area always result in higher revenue. So we continue to see great steady progress on our strategic plan. John Bejjani \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great, thanks and just one quick follow-up on the Turn-Key JV, you guys have been talking about this for a better part of the year at this points, is there anything you can show on the status there and what\u2019s the delay, let\u2019s call delay at this point. A. William Stein :  John I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d say there is a delay, we\u2019ve taken out multiple counter parties, we have identified one counter party, terms have been negotiated, and now that you have the process of sourcing debt as well and all the conditions that are associated with the debt arrangement. So I think we\u2019re making good progress and I think perhaps there was a bit of delay earlier in the year, as we were looking at generating capital from asset sales. But now, we\u2019ve more or less side the asset sale program and have a sense for the sequence there. And we have a view as to how the joint venture would fit into that program. Operator : The next question will come from Jon Peterson of MLV & Company. Please go ahead. Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co: Great. Thank you. Just a quick question on the guidance (indiscernible), but in terms of dispositions obviously that have pretty wide range I know you said you are going to give more details after Labor Day, but on the cap rate the ranges from 0% to 12%. I was hoping you guys kind of elaborate on what to expect, obviously 0% assets to negative cash flow. I\u2019m just curious what percent of 0 to 400 would kind of fall in that bucket. I guess how do I think about that really wide range and what you guys see it realistically following now that? Scott E. Peterson:  Yes. I apologies for the wide range as you can imagine it's kind of tough to try to ballpark that it's a little early in the process to nail it down. But I think it's reasonable to expect that the average cap rates for the dispositions will be below our employee portfolio cap rate. Is that helps. Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co: Okay. All right, that\u2019s fair. And then go ahead. A. William Stein :  No, that\u2019s okay. Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co: Okay. And then in terms of debt maturity is just hoping for an update you got about $130 million of secured debt maturing I think alone in November of this year and $375 million of unsecured notes in July of next year. Just what can we kind of expect in terms of how you guys plan to refinance that debt? Matt Miszewski :  Yes, sure. This is Matt. Over the balance of this year, our thinking is we\u2019ll effectively repay most of the secured debt that's maturing through our revolver. We do have in our guidance and additional capital raise and additional U.S. bond late in the year that you can say effectively would be part of that refinancing. And then in terms of next year, we are still putting together our capital plan, but I would think we given our rates are today in terms of the large the first bond maturing we have mid-next year that we should be able to refinance that on the longer-term at effectively the same cost. So basically take out of five-year paper with ten-year money. So we feel very confident about our ability to fund the business through 2015 at this point. Scott E. Peterson:  We\u2019ll be generating a liquidity through asset sales as well as the joint venture we talked about, which will not only \u2013 it\u2019ll pay down debt as well as keep leverage in line. Operator : The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Thanks. Just wanted to comeback to demand that\u2019s driving sort of the optimism for data center fundamentals that Bill I think you\u2019re referenced in your prepared remarks. Sequentially supply seems to be up a little bit overall with Dallas and Houston up to Silicon Valley up really offset by little bit of decline in Northern Virginia. What can you tell us about what you\u2019re seeing in the demand side particularly, domestically? A. William Stein :  I\u2019m sure Jordan, well first of all we are constricting our supply and we see supply constricting from others as well. And demand is remained strong impact that might even be stronger than it was six to twelve months ago. So based on that I think, we think market rates will inflect. And then within our own portfolio we\u2019re seeing a positive cash market-to-market in 2015. Well I think it\u2019s important to note here, but there is definite difference between product offerings Matt mentioned that in his prepared remarks. And by that I\u2019m referring to share versus dedicated and we are seeing significant demand for our dedicated to end product and what would call national markets as well as the other markets while we have finished inventory. And that really lead to start conclusion that fundamentals are improving at least for our product. Matt Miszewski : And Jordan as you think about the shared back claim versus the dedicated infrastructure. You do not have to search long for approved points, right, largely reported over supply in Northern Virginia but I can't keep the two and dedicated solution that we have there on the shelf same situation in Dallas. So you don\u2019t need to search long and hard to find the approved points that dedicated offering that we have is different and therefore that supply is constricted. Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.:  Okay, and then just maybe as a follow-up given sort of the increase in the development spending guidance surrounding sort of this optimism around demand of fundamentals and the significant recovery in the share price that we talked about. How do you feel about raising equity here given sort of where you are in the leverage spectrum positioning the balance sheet for 2015. Matt Miszewski :  Yes, this is Matt, Jordan I think we said in our prepared remarks with some of the capital recycling initiatives that we have in our way. We don\u2019t currently have any plans to sell equity, we've got a plan for the year that fully funds all of the capital needs that we have keep it inline with the covenants and relevant leverage ratio\u2019s that we like to operate within particular in light of our upward revised stability outlook from S&P. So as of today, we don\u2019t have any plans in guidance to issue any equity. A. William Stein : And let me Jordan, I mean while the stock has done well, we still think it\u2019s trading on a discount NAV. and we also are looking at significant what we think is a significant growth in NAV due to improving fundamentals, inventory absorption and that\u2019s a value accretion through our development program. So we don\u2019t think it makes sense to sell equity at this level. Operator :  The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Jason Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Yes. It\u2019s actually Michael Bilerman with Manny in. Bill, you got a pretty good memory from a year and a half ago. I\u2019m curious on the distribution program, the 0 to 400. Is that all encompassing for this review that you did, I think Scott talked about 5% to 10% of the portfolio, which I think would be greater than 0 to 400 in this, they\u2019re are really low valued assets. So I\u2019m just curious sort of how big that portfolio is and whether you want to \u2013 you\u2019re instead after Labor Day, assuming not all the stuff will come in at that point. So can you just sort of give a little bit more color surrounding it? A. William Stein :  Yes, sure. I think the first part of the question. I kind of lost track here for a minute there, but we planned to initiate the program after Labor Day. So obviously, assets will bring it out. from that point, we\u2019re not going to hit the market with every asset that we intend to \u2013 that we have slated for dispositions at that point. And then I think the question was about the size\u2026 Michael Jason Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: You said 5% to 10%, which to me like greater than zero to 400 million. So I didn\u2019t know whether the basket of assets is identified to eventually look what it was in excess of 400 million. A. William Stein : Yes. So the basket of the high priority assets is in excess of that, and we\u2019re still finalizing which ones that we\u2019re actually going to be taken the market right after Labor Day. Scott E. Peterson: Hey, Michael. let me follow up though, the zero to 400 million are assets that will be sold this year that does not represent 5% to 10% of the portfolio that is slated per sale, that\u2019s just \u2013 that sequencing and timing, that\u2019s what would be sold this year. Michael Jason Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Right. So what I\u2019m trying to get a picture of is, how I assume you\u2019re going to continue this program to next year, as you said, you want to sell 5% to 10%. how big of a disposition plan to envision happening over the next 12 months to 18 months? We will be talking that 1.5 billion of assets \u2013 2 billion of assets. Scott E. Peterson:  I mean what I\u2019ve seen Michael, would say 600 million of proceeds roughly. A. William Stein : Yes. That\u2019s pretty close and that\u2019s probably over the course of the next eight or nine months. Michael Jason Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator :  Our next question will be a follow-up from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Just a quick follow-up Page 16 when I take a look at the same-store results, just kind of curious from an OpEx perspective, fairly large increases in utilities and other property operating expenses repair the maintenance and things like that, just kind of curious on why the big year-over-year bond is number one and what we should expect kind of going forward in regards to our run rate? Matt Miszewski :  Yes. Tayo, this is Matt. There\u2019s a couple of things, I mean some of the \u2013 some of that was as we expected in sort of including guidances, as part of our guidance we gave on margin, some of that is seasonal initiatives for preventative maintenance, to mainly just as a matter of timing. and additionally, as we\u2019ve been rolling out some of the data center services and the ecosystem features that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of that increase, which again, is all baked into the guidance that we provided. and we expect to be within the margins that we laid out as part of that guidance come in the end of the year. Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay, all right. Matt Miszewski : Thank you. Operator :  And the next question will be a follow-up from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead. Steve T. Sakwa \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC :  Thanks guys. I think that\u2019s my second question, I guess maybe for Matt, as you guys have thought about kind of the lease-up potential that it takes for an asset to get from kind of starting point to stabilization. I know that number had kind of got extended out almost 12 quarters and just given the leasing environment that you\u2019re seeing today and that seven months I guess number that you\u2019ve talked about from a tenant signing to sort of taking occupancy. Do you think that 12-quarter stabilization period has shrunk, or is in the process of shrinking and so what do you think the right number is today? Matt Miszewski : Yes. great question, Steve, I do think that the number is shrinking and what I\u2019m looking for in the data is a pattern I can sort of solidify myself to give you some guidance as to what I think the new number is. There\u2019s a number of things that go into that equation, the gap from signing to deployment is certainly one of those pieces, but the other correction that we made in the sales process helps to speed some of that up as well. So I would anticipate that we would be able to get to a more crisp number, as to what it takes for us to get fully stabilize on a building over the next few quarters. but it is improving, if I can give you a trend guidance, it\u2019s certainly improving. A. William Stein :  Steve, that might vary market by market though. So Northern Virginia is pretty brisk at this point and Dallas is brisk, Richardson. As Matt said, we can keep the inventory on the shelf. We built the shelf. we finished the data center and it will be fully leased within 12 months. Matt Miszewski : And Steve, with the focus of new discipline that we have here you can expect that our focus will remain on increasing that ROIC by leasing existing inventory, but also leasing into the markets that are similarly hot that Bill just described. So you should see, like I said, I think you should see market-to-market differentiation, but you should see a constriction of that time to stabilization. Steve T. Sakwa \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC :  Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question will be a follow-up from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hey, we just are confusing. it\u2019s Manny here with Michael. I had a quick follow-up on the dispositions. Would you ever consider selling some of those pre-stabilized assets to both help the ROIC, maybe bringing some incremental proceeds and just sort of move that along especially ones that have been on that schedule for a while now? Matt Miszewski : Yes, absolutely. As a matter of fact, I think that you\u2019ll see that some of that\u2019s around the \u2013 are in the list of high priority candidates. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: And then when you said Matt, earlier $600 million of proceeds, did you mean $600 million gross or net? Matt Miszewski : There are gross proceeds. I think maybe, in this probably net of sales expenses on that, but pretty close. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Got it. thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. The Digital Realty 2014 second quarter earnings conference call has now concluded. We thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, and thank you, all, for joining us. I'd like to start today by providing a quick update on the progress that we've made toward the strategic initiatives we laid out 6 months ago. These are highlighted on Page 2 of our presentation. First, we made continued headway on leasing up our existing inventory during the third quarter. We have, likewise, made steady progress towards our top priority of driving improved return on invested capital, which is up 30 basis points over the last year. With respect to our capital recycling initiative, we took the first tangible steps towards pruning the portfolio to narrow our focus on the core. We also closed a significant turnkey data center joint venture transaction during the third quarter. Our capital recycling program is designed to refocus our geographic footprint and enhance the consistency of our product quality. This program will set the stage for a faster, more sustainable pace of growth in 2016 and beyond even if it does create somewhat of a headwind to earnings growth next year. If we have to choose between long-term value creation or near-term growth in FFO per share, we will choose the former. We plan to exit several secondary markets, but we've also identified a handful of select global markets, notably in Germany and Japan, where our customers would like us to have a presence. We plan to enter these markets with our customers over time. Scott Peterson will cover our capital recycling efforts in his remarks. But suffice to say that we believe capital is precious, and at current pricing, we view the equity embedded within our existing portfolio as a better source of capital than the public equity capital markets. In addition to refining our focus, we expect our capital recycling initiative will also drive tighter utilization of our asset base and will, likewise, contribute to improvement in our overall return on invested capital. Turning to our Global Alliances Program. We recently announced a joint marketing alliance with VMware and agreement with Carpathia to make our respective product offerings directly available to each other's sellers. In addition, we're in the process of significantly expanding the number of cloud service providers participating in our global cloud marketplace. Our enterprise customer base is accelerating their adoption of the hybrid cloud model. Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable our customers' needs by facilitating direct access to large and growing cloud service provider network within our portfolio. Existing customers accounted for almost 90% of our third quarter lease signings, but we have also added nearly 80 new logos year-to-date. These have included multiple instances of cloud production for a global software powerhouse currently servicing over 400,000 customers and one of the world's largest enterprise software providers currently serving clients in over 130 countries by supporting their cloud platform. Moving on to inventory management. As discussed, we are committed to a much more disciplined approach with respect to development risk going forward. We have primarily transitioned to a build-to-order inventory management program. As you can see from the development life cycle schedule on Page 30 of our sup [ph], our active data center construction projects are now 86% pre-leased. With progress against these initiatives in mind, I'd like to take a moment to share with you why I believe we have such a durable business. For starters, we have a world-class roster of customers with excellent credit. These customers tend to sign relatively long-term leases. They typically make a significant investment of their own capital within our facilities, and as a result, they have a high propensity to renew their leases at expiration. Our top 50 customers account for roughly 70% of our NOI. This level of concentration allows for diversification, but it also tips the 80/20 principle scale, contributing to a comparatively low cost of sale and a less operationally intensive business model. These attributes underscore the stability of our cash flow stream, which has earned us the lowest cost of capital in the sector, supported by the residual value of our real estate. We've also been able to attract and retain a base of incredibly talented and hardworking employees from around the world, whose skills and dedication would be nearly impossible to replicate by any competitor and thus represents an important source of competitive advantage. In short, we are confident in our competitive position. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we plan to strengthen our position by driving greater profitability per unit through our existing footprint. In addition to emphasizing asset utilization, we aim to drive additional revenue through capturing a greater share of customer wallet via product diversification, exploiting opportunities for open and paid peering and driving the pairing of cloud service providers with our large enterprise clients. Finally, let's turn to the macro outlook laid out on Page 3 of the presentation. As you are surely aware, geopolitical uncertainty has risen over the last several months, while the outlook for global GDP growth has slipped a bit. In contrast, the U.S. economy has remained relatively resilient, although growth has been modest. Data center demand is not directly linked to the price of oil or to U.S. payrolls but is secular in nature and is growing faster than GDP. In addition, supply is being consistently absorbed at the sector level, and we expect continued gradual improvement in data center fundamentals. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives. Scott E. Peterson: Thank you, Bill. As shown here on Page 4, we closed a $187.6 million joint venture during the third quarter with Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT for a turnkey data center located in Ashburn, Virginia. We sold an 80% interest to Griffin Capital, and we retained a 20% interest in the joint venture. We will continue to manage the property and receive management fees. The transaction valued the property at a 7.05% cap rate or $20,600 per kilowatt. We're pleased with this transaction, as it provides meaningful price discovery for turnkey data centers and establishes a new capital partner relationship. On last quarter's call, we indicated we would begin marketing non-core assets for sale shortly after Labor Day. We have identified an initial pool of 9 properties for disposition. As detailed in our press release, we brought 5 of these assets to market, and we booked a $13 million impairment charge during the third quarter to write down 2 of those assets to their estimated fair market value. Leasing activity at the 4 remaining properties has picked up considerably over the past 90 days, and we are in the process of finalizing some new leases, which has affected the timing of bringing these properties to market. However, this should increase the value of these properties and maximize proceeds to our shareholders. In addition, several of these assets were encumbered by CMBS debt, which has -- which was paid off in September. These 9 assets represent roughly the first 1/3 of the properties under evaluation for the capital recycling program, which comprises roughly 5% to 10% of the portfolio. This initial portfolio has some winners and some losers but on balance, we expect to recognize a gain well in excess of any impairment charges or losses. We have been encouraged by the early indications of interest we have received, and we expect our capital recycling program will contribute to our objectives of narrowing our strategic focus, funding future capital requirements and driving improved return on invested capital. I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to discuss our current leasing momentum. Matthew J. Miszewski: Thank you, Scott. As you can see here on Page 5, we signed new leases totaling over $31 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter. Our recent leasing activity has been remarkably consistent. You may recall that the $47 million we reported in the first quarter included a $12 million direct lease with a formal subtenant at a Powered Base Building in Santa Clara. Excluding that one lease, we have signed between $30 million and $35 million every quarter this year. Colocation revenue accounted for over 15% of our leasing activity, again, this quarter. Our mid-market segment has delivered a consistent contribution of between $4 million and $6 million in each of the past 3 quarters. This segment is representative of the steady pace we are seeing across our sales platform but has also been partially responsible for smoothing out some of the traditional lumpiness in our quarterly leasing activity just as we expected. Turning now to Page 6. Cloud, content and social media had been the major drivers of our recent leasing activity and accounted for nearly 75% of our lease signings in the third quarter. We believe this demand represents a secular trend rather than a onetime thrill, and we believe we are still in the very early innings. Cash rents on renewal leases rolled down by 6% as shown on Page 7. The primary driver was a large lease with a financial services tenant in Northern Virginia that was signed at peak rent, which we have highlighted on the last several calls. Needless to say, releasing spreads on Powered Base Building renewals remained quite healthy. The face rates on Turn-Key Flex leases signed shown here at the bottom of Page 8 were lower than last quarter albeit due to market mix, reflecting a concentration of activity in lower-cost North American market, primarily Ashburn, Virginia. On a like-for-like basis, face rates were flat to up slightly, and returns are right in line with our expectations. In addition, net effective leasing economics continue to steadily improve. This improvement reflects the gradual recovery in data center fundamentals as well as the behavior changes driven by our new sales compensation program and tighter underwriting discipline as a function of our revamped investment review process. These trends are indirectly reflected in tenant credit quality. Fully 60% of our third quarter leasing activity was with investment-grade credits. We also turned down several large potential deals with exceptionally strong credit tenants during the third quarter due to terms that did not meet our underwriting criteria, both economics as well as noneconomic. We believe our disciplined approach will lead to better returns for shareholders in the long run. In addition to leases signed, lease commencements were likewise stable. As you can see from the chart at the bottom right of Page 9, the weighted average lag between signing and commencement ticked down to 5.5 months and has settled consistently in the 6-month range. We leased a total 14 megawatts during the third quarter, 6 of which were finished inventory. We placed several megawatts in service during the third quarter, and we did get back 2 megawatts in Phoenix from a tenant that was in holdover status as of June 30 that we discussed on the second quarter call. The bottom line is that we generated 1 megawatt of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool during the third quarter. As you can see here on Page 10, we have made steady progress towards our objective of leasing up existing inventories since our Investor Day last November. Incidentally, these numbers are as of September 30. We've absorbed 2 additional megawatts since the end of the third quarter. Despite the space we got back in Phoenix during the third quarter, our historical data center tenant retention track record has been quite strong. As shown on Page 11, we have traditionally retained 84% of data center lease expiries. Leasing non-data center space has not been our forte and is part of the reason we are moving to rationalize our portfolio. That said, we have very recently been able to generate some positive leasing momentum at several of our non-data center properties. The incremental NOI should drive greater proceeds from non-core asset sales than anticipated just a short while ago. Turning now to supply on Pages 12 and 13. It's interesting to see that available inventories shrank a bit in both the highly scrutinized Northern Virginia market as well as Silicon Valley, whereas we saw a modest uptick in Chicago and in Phoenix over the past 90 days. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to talk you through our financial results. Matt? Matt Mercier : Thank you, Matt. As Scott mentioned, we closed a $187.6 million turnkey joint venture during the third quarter, and proceeds were used to pay down $130 million of CMBS debt at 5.65%. Debt to EBITDA improved 1/10 of a turn to 5x, as you can see here on Page 14. We still have a U.S. dollar bond offering contemplated in our guidance for later this year. As shown here on Page 15 of the presentation, our credit spreads have tightened considerably over the course of the year, and we believe the current interest rate environment is attractive. We also believe it is prudent balance sheet management to finance long-lived assets with long-term capital, and we expect to tap the corporate bond market either later this year or early next year. Turning now to operating performance. Portfolio occupancy ticked up 20 basis points, the second consecutive improvement in occupancy. We expect to finish the year at or slightly above the current level of 93%. As Matt indicated in his presentation, cash releasing spreads were negative in the third quarter, driven by the large roll-down in Northern Virginia. We are not out of the rental rate roll-down woods quite yet, but we have worked our way through the worst of the above-market lease expirations within our portfolio with a few notable exceptions, particularly in 2016 rollovers in Northern New Jersey. As market rents continue to improve and as we address the remaining roll-downs, the mark-to-market should begin to approach 0 and turn consistently positive over the next couple of years. Same-capital cash NOI growth was 5.9% for the third quarter, above the high end of our guidance range, and we've raised our organic growth forecast for the full year by 50 basis points to between 4.5% to 5.5%. We've also whittled down the incremental revenue from speculative leasing embedded within our forecast to a very manageable 0 to $5 million for the remainder of the year. We've lowered our CapEx guidance for development spending by approximately 5% at the midpoint. We have the ability to self-fund our near-term capital requirements with proceeds from asset sales, and we currently have no plans to revisit the public equity market anytime soon. At the bottom line, we've raised the low end of the guidance range for 2014 core FFO per share by $0.05. The upward revision to our bottom line forecast while tightening our budget for development spending speaks directly to our renewed underwriting discipline and emphasis on return on invested capital. Later this year, we will celebrate our 10th anniversary as a public company. As you can see from the charts here on Page 16 of the presentation, we've generated positive year-over-year growth in both dividends and FFO per share every single year of our public company existence, including the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, and we expect 2015 will be no different. Bottom line growth will likely be modest next year, and organic growth will be the primary driver as external growth will be muted due to asset sales. We will also face a tough comp in the first quarter due to the $850 million long-term capital raised in March and April of this year. We will provide formal guidance in January, but we expect to generate core FFO per share growth next year in the low single digits. And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill. Arthur William Stein : Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up by recapping the highlights from our third quarter results as outlined here on Page 17. We signed over $31 million of new leasing during the third quarter, including a $5 million mid-market contribution. We leased nearly 6 megawatts of finished inventory with 1 megawatt of positive net absorption. We registered a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in occupancy. We delivered 5.9% same-capital cash NOI growth and raised our organic growth forecast for the full year by 50 basis points. Our third quarter core FFO per share beat consensus by $0.02. And finally, we raised the low end of the range for 2014 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. We believe these results demonstrate consistent execution on our strategic objectives. Our approach to capital recycling and disciplined leasing standards also demonstrate our renewed focus on generating long-term shareholder value in everything that we do. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, and I would like to thank our outstanding global team of employees without whose contributions, these results would not be possible. And now we are pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vance Edelson at Morgan Stanley. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I wanted to give you a chance to discuss outsourcing more. You mentioned that existing customers drove 90% of the growth, but you also added the 80 new logos. Is outsourcing still on the rise and that's what's supporting the 90% figure? And similarly, are the 80 new logos a sign that those companies are perhaps outsourcing for the first time? Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. Thanks for the question, Vance. We do see outsourcing to be a continued trend that we discussed with our customers on an ongoing basis, and we really see it in both of the segments that you identified. Existing customers, especially our large enterprise existing customers, continue to be on the road for outsourcing their IT as well as their business processes, and we're there to support them. Maybe surprisingly, the new logos that we signed in both the large enterprise segment as well as the mid-market segment have a similar interest in outsourcing maybe for different reasons. The mid-market companies simply don't want to get started behind an operationally expensive set of processes, and our large enterprise customers have found a need to preserve some of their capital and to invest in strategic initiatives. But for both of these segments, outsourcing remains incredibly important for Digital Realty. Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, great. And then as a related follow-up, could you describe the momentum that the mid-market segment has? It seems like a relatively new initiative and yet the new leases signed seem to have leveled off to some extent. Is that something we can expect to see growing in the coming quarters? Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. We see -- we're very pleased with the progress that we've seen in the mid-market since we announced its -- announced the initiative last year. We've seen that team really step up and consistently generate now between $4 million and $6 million in revenues over the past several quarters and a very large quarter in revenue production in Q4 of last year. So we couldn't be happier. Really, if you keep in mind that we basically grew a business that was producing between $1 million and $2 million of quarterly revenue, now we've increased that to $4 million to $6 million participation. So we're extremely excited about the progress that the mid-market team is making and the mid-market sales team combined with the operational team that supports that set of products. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes. So kind of a related question to the previous one. The connectivity initiative, whether standard connection at your own sites or OPEN-IX, I wonder if you have an update on that. And then the colocation segments, as distinct from the mid-market initiative, it looks your colo rental rates increased, and I wonder what drove that. Was that deal size or geographic mix? And then another kind of observation, it looks like the Turn-Key rent dropped in Asia-Pac, and I wondered what drove that? Matthew J. Miszewski: You managed to get a lot of questions in one question, but we'll try to address all of them. First of all, the connectivity initiative -- in terms of the connectivity initiative, we're extremely pleased with the progress that the operational team has made, and we moved the product ownership under the sales and marketing umbrella over this past quarter, 1.5 quarters as well. Connectivity has -- the network ecosystem project under connectivity, as you know, started in Europe and has moved its way throughout the United States. We've connected up major data centers in campuses within the United States, and we're in the process of doing the same thing in Asia Pacific. And so we're pleased to announce that we not only have completed most of that process but that we're starting to see the results as well. We measure the results of many of the partnerships that we do by the amount of GAAP rental revenue that they're able to influence. And the network ecosystem, in and of itself to date, has already influenced over $39 million of GAAP signings to date. Probably more important to that is that the network ecosystem really underlies our customers' desire to tap into the power of the hybrid cloud. This gets to the dual magnet metaphor that uses Bill uses from time to time when he talks about cloud service providers that exist within our data centers, in large numbers, the large portion of our revenue and how that attracts the large enterprises that are coming to our data centers and those large enterprises that we have also attracting additional cloud service providers. By combining that combination of great customers with the network ecosystem that we now have deployed, as well as the global cloud marketplace that we're looking to expand this fiscal year, it's important to realize that this is really the connectivity that was missing to enable the hybrid cloud for our customers. So we're extremely excited about that. I'm glad that you called out the colocation product and rental rates, in particular, for that individual product and that -- it's important to remember that, that product actually goes across multiple segments. So we do sell colocation into the mid-market segment as well as into the enterprise segment. And the increase in rental rates, I think, you've identified it already, really goes around the deal sizes that we landed within the quarter as well as the geographic diversity. Markets rates are different for colocation -- the colocation product in multiple markets, and we happen to be either lucky or smart enough to have landed them in the right markets this quarter. We'll see a slight bump in the rental rates. Was the third -- the third question, I believe, was on the TKF rental rates. Is that correct? Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Correct. Matthew J. Miszewski: So in particular, in Asia Pac, I think your question sort of focused in on the TKF rental rate numbers in Asia Pacific, and we did have -- we had to call out that we did have one large deal that we secured in Hong Kong, which we view as a onetime event, was a very strategic partner. We went into that deal for very specific reasons between the 2 partners, in particular, to open up some market opportunities that were closed off to us before. We believe we successfully completed that set of transactions and that this one lease is really a onetime event. It really highlights that we're able to make strategic decisions in concert with our greatest partners and our greatest customers throughout the world. Operator : The next question is from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Can you talk a little about your weighted average lease term? I noticed in the quarter, it was down to 6.3 years from 6.8 last quarter. Just maybe talk a little bit about why that number shifted so notably from Q2 to Q3. Matthew J. Miszewski: So Ross, thanks for the question. The shorter lease terms, we need to understand in a context of the duration of those leases that are being signed as well as understanding that obviously it's an average. So we're still seeing some good lease terms come in. And -- but I understand that we're comfortable signing shorter-term leases in the marketplace where we really believe that the fundamentals inside that marketplace are improving, especially at the time of potential expiration. Also important for everyone to remember that our retention rates remain high. So we are comfortable with this shorter initial term. It's also become a little bit of a trend in the marketplace for folks who initially say they want a smaller term to actually go ahead and take their additional option earlier in that process. So maybe a tip box in terms of procurement, but we're seeing those people renew early in some cases or do must-takes early in some cases as well. In essence, what all this signals is that the fundamentals in this market are improving. Arthur William Stein : Ross, let me add to that, that we also see the same company that are doing shorter-term leases, putting significant investment into the premises even though they might be doing a 5-year lease. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : As a follow-up, not really much related, but what is -- what should we all expect, Bill, on the timing for the, I guess, full CEO announcement. Is that happening before NAREIT, before year-end? What can you tell us at this point? Arthur William Stein : So Ross, we have bet here internally as to which question it would be, but... Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I'm surprised to think we... Matthew J. Miszewski: I am also. Arthur William Stein : So we have heard that question before. The answer to the question is that we fully expect that it will be before year-end. That's what we've said, really, since the transition was announced last March. And as we also indicated, the board back then and still is comfortable with the current leadership that's in place, but the focus remains finding the right candidate and that is unquestionably the priority. Fortunately, in the interim, the stock has performed well. We're up over 40% since March. We've outperformed the RMZ by 2,000 basis points, and we remain focused on executing our strategic vision. And thank you for the question. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut at Evercore. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Great. I guess, my first question is really about sort of your view on the global market. You guys have a great success in Asia Pac, and at a recent conference, your fastest-growing customer talked about going to dozens of new countries in the next few years. So I was just wondering what your perspective was in terms of expanding your footprint globally beyond the markets that you're currently operating in. Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So Jonathan, we do. And I think as Bill said in his initial statements, we will certainly look at new opportunities with our great customers in tow. But important to also understand that our -- one of our focuses -- one of our strategic focuses within sales and marketing is targeting at the beginning as well as targeting expansion with companies that have a stated desire or already active in global expansion that matches our existing portfolio, where we happen to have existing inventory or shell available. So that alignment by us to sort of generating demand across companies that have a desire to grow globally matches our current footprint in terms of what we have existing inventory in pretty darn well. We also happen to find out that those customers stay with us longer. They're happy to give us longer lease terms, and they're much more easy to satisfy in terms of customers because their value expectation is aligned very well with the value that we provide. I think Bill mentioned in his opening statements 2 geographies that were of interest. Maybe I'll turn it over to Bill to see if he wants to talk a little bit more about future potential expansion. Arthur William Stein : And Jonathan, so I've mentioned Germany and Japan. But in addition, I mean, we -- if we have a -- I'm sure we both know the customer you're talking about. But if we have a strong customer that wants us to go to a certain market, and in this particular case, this customer is, they lease multiple megs from us at one time. So if we can get comfortable with the demand in that market, and we can get comfortable with other risks, so currency risk, political risk, we can structure ample lease term to mitigate risk. And we have a customer that's taking a significant percentage of a building, then we are -- will be more willing to look into a new market. Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : That makes a lot of sense. Just as my follow-up question, are there any markets that you're concerned with? There's a recent report out that the big 4 markets in Asia Pac are going to see something like a 40% inventory increase over the next 12 to 24 months. Are there any markets that you're concerned about in terms of inventory? Arthur William Stein : We haven't seen that in Asia at this point. We're seeing really good absorption in our 2 Australian markets. And in Singapore, we're basically full. And Hong Kong is filling rapidly, too. So we haven't seen the evidence of that. We -- there had been commentary about excess supply in North American markets in Silicon Valley and Virginia, in particular. But once again there, we've seen significant absorption of our inventory. In fact, we can't even keep up in Northern Virginia. I think basically, the difference to maybe the type of product that we're delivering to the market, and we do provide the 2-end solution, a dedicated infrastructure. And I suspect that if there's commentary about excess supply, it's probably the share in infrastructure product. Matthew J. Miszewski: That's an important distinction, Jonathan, that Bill is making. As I look at our 12-month future pipeline, I see a good dominant part of that being the customers that regularly buy the dedicated solution from us here at Digital. That doesn't foreclose us from making sure we truly understand the customers' needs in the 4 big markets in Asia Pacific. But as opposed to our competition who is testing the waters, we've got a proven product that we're able to deploy and have successfully deployed over the past 5 years. We certainly will look at continuing to do that and then exploit any future opportunities that we see. Arthur William Stein : Thank you, Jonathan. Just to point out, in Hong Kong and Singapore, in particular, land is tight. So it really is hard to get sites there. I know there's one of our competitors is bringing on a site January 1, but I think that's really the only one that we'd be concerned about in Singapore. Operator : The next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I just wanted to echo Jonathan's comments on great execution during the quarter. First question, Bill, you did discuss in your commentary about turning down quite a few deals with larger tenants because you weren't happy with the economics or the terms or what have you. Could you just kind of give us a sense of what some of those type of deals were that you turned down? And if whether you would have actually accepted those kind of deals a year to 2 years ago. Arthur William Stein : Well, I don't know that those deals would have existed a couple of years ago. But the -- I think that my biggest objection to these deals was the customer's attempt to transfer what I thought were the customer's business risks to us for a standard of conduct within the data center's four walls that was quite low, a simple negligence as opposed to gross negligence or willful misconduct. So what I'm referring to is indemnity clauses for basically mistakes or omissions inside a data center by the operator, what the right standard of conduct is. And we've held to a standard of willful misconduct, and we do not indemnify for consequential damages. And in this case, we have customers that are looking for a lower standard and a broader scope of indemnity. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : So if it wasn't the case of the pricing on the deals or anything like that, it was more along some of the operational risks you would have to take if you actually accepted these deals. Arthur William Stein : Yes. Not so much, that's why I made the comment in my remarks about being focused on long-term value creation. And these were deals that would have been very beneficial to short-term FFO growth. But at the end of the day, we're focused on residual value as well and what types of risk we might be creating for the long term. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Great. And then just my second question, excluding the financial clients this quarter, could you give us a sense of what GAAP, as well as cash mark-to-market, would have looked like, excluding that large roll-down? Matt Mercier : Yes. Tayo, this is Matt. I don't think we have that breakout at our fingertips, but we can follow up at a later date. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just want to go back to the non-core dispositions with the 9 assets currently in market, guidance goes up to $400 million for the year in terms of the range. Just trying to get a sense of over the balance of this year as well as '15. I guess, the 9 represents about 1/3 of the non-core that you've identified. I mean, how much of that non-core do you think could go between now and the end of next year? Matthew J. Miszewski: In the first group that we have, that will all likely transact between now and the end of this year in January, and that total volume's about $260 million in proceeds on that. And we expect to add -- I'll give you a little more information there. We think that will go at an average cap rate, overall, of about a little over a 6 cap rate on that. We then have 3 other -- then we have 2 other groupings of properties that we're looking at. The next grouping is a group of 6 assets that are more, rather than being non-core, these are more non-core data center assets. And we're going through the valuation process of those right now. So it's a little early to give you any indication. But we'd expect that the ones of those we do bring to market would be brought to market first quarter. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then on the internal growth side, you obviously raised the same-capital outlook by 50 basis points. In past presentations, you've talked about sort of an ongoing business model that talks about sort of 4% to 5% growth. I guess, is there any reason to think that 2015 should stray significantly from what we saw here in 2014 and sort of relative to that longer-term outlook? Arthur William Stein : Yes. I mean, as we -- Vincent, as we said, we'll give specifics on 2015 guidance later this year, and we'll -- at that time, we'll break down all those components as we have -- as we've done the last several quarters, but we're not at a point where we can provide that detail at this time. But we'll definitely have it when we give formal guidance later this year. Operator : The next question comes from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I think you touched on a little bit sort of post-quarter end leasing but curious more in terms of the seasonality that the portfolios historically experienced in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. Are you still expecting, maybe for Matt or for Bill, the same sort of historical seasonality? Or would that -- should that pick up in the fourth quarter? Or has that been somewhat muted as well by the mid-market strategy? Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. So the seasonality is interesting, given the launch last year of the mid-market strategy. In general, we're pleased with our sales and marketing team, Jordan being able to generate consistent results that are in line with our plan. We consider quarters like this to be successful quarters when they meet the plan. And you touched on one of the drivers, which, of course, is the mid-market initiative, which, if you remember, seems like way back. It wasn't that long ago when we announced the initiative. Part of the purpose of it was to smooth out the revenue lumpiness that came from the large enterprise segment. And I think we've been fairly successful at doing that. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of wiping out the lumpiness of the large enterprise segment is the perceived seasonality of the past may look a little less certain, and so we need to get a little -- a few more quarters under our belts before we can identify what the true seasonality is, given the new set of products and new set of markets that we're addressing. We do think that our -- the seasonality will reflect customer demand, which have relatively unique drivers. So inside an individual vertical, for instance, financial services, I'm having 2 sets of conversations, one with a company that has a large deployment that needs to go live in the first half of next year, and we're having that conversation. We'll strike a deal this quarter. And the other one, who wants to start the conversation in Q2 but will deliver the actual project in Q4. So unfortunately, seasonality is also at the call of our customers' internal calendars. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. I guess, as a follow-up, maybe for Scott, on pricing and cap [ph] achieved. Obviously, the joint venture helped us sort of shed some light on pricing this quarter. I'm curious, do you think pricing achieved on this transaction is somewhat representative overall of the portfolio of assets, sort of excluding the platform value, especially, obviously, as it relates to Turn-Key? Scott E. Peterson: Yes. Yes, just remember data centers are kind of complicated, but we happen to like this comp very much. This is a good cap rate, 7.05%. But also when you keep that in light of the price per foot and the price per kilowatt that this traded at, I think this is a very good comp. And it shows that the private demand and pricing continues to grow for these assets, and we're also very happy with these access to another source of capital for our program. Operator : The next question come from Matthew Heinz at Stifel. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I'm interested to hear more about the Global Alliances Program, realizing it's still very early in the process. But I guess, just hoping to understand how receptive existing customers have been to these offerings, particularly within the enterprise segment and then maybe the balance of engagement between mid-market versus wholesale customers. And then as a follow-on to that, I'm hoping you could just collaborate on sort of how you view the cloud marketplace initiative, I suppose, in terms of whether you see it as a value enhancement to the existing service and connectivity offerings. Or is it more of an up-sell opportunity with sort of longer-term implications around ARPU? Matthew J. Miszewski: So in terms of the Global Alliances Program, the program, when combined directly with the network initiative, has influenced an awful lot of the deals that are out there. But what's interesting is -- what we're trying to enable is something that we're not unfamiliar with. When we -- Scott started in this industry 10 to 12 years ago, we became a carrier-controlled data center provider because of our customers' perceived challenges with network operator-owned data centers. And so that shift in market dynamics allowed us to bring carrier-neutral data centers to the fray and allowed us to capture that market opportunity. We're seeing something similar here, and it sort of will answer both of your questions. The Global Alliances that we're striking are meant to give optionality to our customers that they're asking for. The wider array of that optionality is what we need to provide as data center providers. So that no matter what direction our customers want to go to enable their hybrid cloud ambition, they can do it within Digital Realty property. And so again, as I stated earlier on the hybrid cloud question, what we do here allows our customers to truly connect their services to data centers that they might have inside other Digital Realty data centers, but also they can connect to cloud providers outside of that venue, and they can connect to cloud providers that are not within Digital's own network services. So our network service partners can now securely connect those enterprise clients to all of their assets as well as to internal private clouds, and so what we're seeing is something very similar to the process that we came into a few years ago. So now instead of it being carrier neutrality, it really is cloud service provider neutrality, and part of our partnership efforts or Global Alliances efforts is to make sure that we're able to bring the right cloud service providers to the foray. That worked this quarter in VMWare as well as in Carpathia. Our providers that our customer said they wanted to connect to more directly within Digital's data centers, we're being able to provide that sort of connectivity to them, and we see that as the end in and of itself. If you think about the global cloud marketplace as well as the rest of the partnership ecosystem as an amenity that is now necessary in a modern data center as we move our customers from wanting simply to store data in a data center to want to actively exchange data within a data center and within multiple data centers, that's really the key that we're trying to provide to those customers. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then just very quickly, is there -- do you see any potential for a special distribution of the gains from the joint venture? Arthur William Stein : So our board meets next week, and the board sets the dividend. So it's something that we're looking at. Basically, the trade-off is going to be a pullback of the first quarter dividend or special dividend, and we haven't decided on that. And even if we had decided on it, we wouldn't jump ahead of the board. Operator : The next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman at Citi. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : If I look at your lease rollover schedule, it looks like you still have a fair amount of PBB leasing to do this year, and those rates are well above average. Was wondering if you can give us some insight as to what that is and how that's going to get addressed. Matt Mercier : Manny, it's Matt. Actually, that -- the vast majority that's already been released is actually renewal -- or a re-lease we signed back in the first quarter, and it's going to roll, I think, slightly either flat or slightly up on a cash basis. So that is -- that's already taken care of. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And great, and then maybe you can help me get one other piece of disclosure. On the market-by-market disclosure, it looks like the megawatts went up in Northern Virginia, but the rentable square footage to occupancy and the lease square footage all came down. I realize that, that might be tied to the most recent JV. But I was just wondering how those could go in different directions. Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. I mean, we'll have to -- I don't know. Obviously, as you know, Northern Virginia is probably one of our most active markets in terms of development. So I'm sure it has to do with the development activity that we're bringing online as well as the joint venture that came out. I don't have the specifics, but I'm sure it has something to do with those 2 interplays. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Douglas at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It's obviously been a while since we've seen Digital acquire in the space, and I'm wondering if you could maybe comment on how you're thinking about consolidation now, given the strength in your stock this year and maybe some of the criteria you look for in a target. And then second, you touched a little bit on the macro outlook, and I'm wondering if you could comment specifically on the leasing environment you're seeing in Europe and also maybe FX impact you saw in 3Q and expect for 4Q. Scott E. Peterson: Yes. Stephen, it's Scott. To answer that, we're always in the market looking at M&A opportunities, and we keep abreast of everything, whether it's kind of near term or long term out there. There hasn't been anything very compelling lately. I think our primary focus is always how are we adding value to our shareholders when we look at these. I think there are many opportunities that we look at, which would give us the chance to get only larger and not better or more profitable for our shareholders. So I think our first and foremost goal on all those is to do something that's going to be compelling for our shareholders. And off late, we haven't really seen anything that fits that bill. But we are always -- we're always looking at opportunities, and we'll always pursue those to the extent we think we can do something positive. Matthew J. Miszewski: Yes. And so on the lease, we'll do this in 3 parts, Stephen. On the leasing side in Europe, without divulging the large enterprise software maker's name, we did see some great activity with what we call a potential franchise account happening within continental Europe this quarter. And probably more important, as I look forward in the next 2 quarters as well as the 12 months looking forward, we see a very healthy pipeline for the properties that we currently have in Europe as well as some of the properties that we have looked to develop in the past. Matt Mercier : Yes. And this is the other Matt. We -- on the FX issue, we're about 80% hedged in terms of our FX exposure, so it takes a pretty material movement to have a meaningful impact on our bottom line. If rates had remained unchanged versus last quarter, our FFO in Q3 would have been about $0.005 higher. And I think that speaks to the advantage of being an investment grade rated since it allows -- we can fund in multiple currencies, and as you know, we raised a pretty large sterling deal earlier this year, a long-term bond. And overall, I think we've raised over $1 billion in sterling since in the public market. So this goes to show what having a strong balance sheet can do for you in terms of hedging your risks. Arthur William Stein : And Stephen, let me just sort of pile on here. The -- if we were to find an acquisition that were attractive, public equity is now no longer our only source of equity, as we now have a -- of what I think is fairly reliable source of private capital as well for deals of that type. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session and concludes the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Stein : Thank you, John. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us. We had a very good year in 2014 and I would like to begin today by providing a quick update on the steady progress we've made towards our 2014 strategic initiatives shown here on page 2 of our presentation. First and foremost, we made significant headway leasing up our existing inventory during the fourth quarter. The improved utilization of our existing asset base has contributed directly to a meaningful uptick in our return on invested capital, which is up 60 basis points over the last year. Given the size of our asset base, this is a remarkable turnaround. Scott Peterson will provide greater detail on our capital recycling initiatives in his remarks, but we have completed our comprehensive portfolio review and have identified assets that no longer fit with our strategy or investment criteria. As disclosed in our press release, we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter on three underperforming properties to write them down to their estimated fair market value at year end. As we stated last quarter, the bucket of non-core assets includes some winners and these three properties are clearly the losers. But on balance, we continue to expect to recognize gains at least on par with any impairment charges or losses. We began marketing for sale the first few non-core assets late last year. During the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of one small investment and subsequent to year-end, we closed on the sale of a non-data center building in suburban Boston. We have clear line of sight to reaching the low end of the range for our dispositions guidance and we remain pleased by the execution we're achieving on the sale of our non-core assets. The implementation of our capital recycling strategy is resulting in steady progress towards our objectives. The global alliances program concluded a successful year in terms of adding demand to our sales team's funnel. The channel program alone added $3 million of mid-market opportunities in the latter part of the year. In addition to expanding our global cloud marketplace to include a broader array of cloud service providers, we have also expanded our cloud connect product to include services from partners such as Zayo to enable our clients to immediately connect their hybrid cloud. We saw the first orders for this new product within weeks after rolling it out. We're also seeing demonstrable demand from our alliance partners to leverage their sales force against the Digital Realty product offering. As you know, the enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base and cloud service providers find our portfolio to be highly desirable in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. But this attraction is mutual and our global footprint, our scale and our cost structure represent significant competitive advantages for landing the intersection of cloud and enterprise within our global portfolio. Moving on to inventory management. We pulled in the reins considerably on speculative development in 2014. As mentioned, we've made good headway leasing up our finished inventory and as our stockpile has dwindled, the risk profile of our development pipeline has decreased. As you can see from the development life cycle schedule on page 34 of our supplemental, our active data center construction projects are currently 83% pre-leased. Given our position of relative strength, we're comfortable today building out small increments of capacity without a signed lease in a handful of select markets where we have clear visibility on demand, primarily Northern Virginia, Dallas, Chicago and Singapore. Turning now to our human capital. As previously announced, Jim Smith and David Schermacher will switch roles effective March 1. This rotation provides an opportunity for the further development of both of these talented executives. I also believe that the new roles will play to their respective strengths. I expect Jim Smith, whom many of you know, to excel in a more customer-facing role. Conversely, no one in the organization is better situated to understand our clients' evolving technical specifications than David Schermacher, the current head of our technical operations group. Our traditional Turn-Key design has served us well, but there's no reason we can't endeavor to improve upon our existing product offering and potentially reach an even broader addressable market. Neither Jim nor David will be married to existing processes or cost structures and both will bring a fresh perspective to their new responsibilities. I'm incredibly optimistic that each will be able to unlock significant value for our shareholders. Likewise, I'm pleased to announce that Krupal Raval, whom many of you also know, has been appointed to the post of Senior Vice President of Finance for the Asia-Pac region, effectively functioning as our regional CFO. He began his new role in Singapore on January 1 and has already begun to have a positive impact. Finally, let's turn to the macro outlook laid out on page 3 of the presentation. Rough three fourths of our portfolio is concentrated in the U.S. and the domestic economy remains a relative bright spot on the global landscape. Clearly, the drop in the price of oil and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar are the most significant macroeconomic developments since our last call. In short, while GDP growth is beneficial to IT spending, data center demand drivers are secular in nature and demand continues to significantly outpace GDP growth. The positive net absorption we have registered within our portfolio has been mirrored at the sector supply level and landlord leasing economics are consistently improving. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives. Scott Peterson : Thank you, Bill. During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of a small investment we made a little less than two years ago in a developer of data centers in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico. We invested approximately $17 million and the sale generated net proceeds of roughly $32 million. Given our comparatively short holding period, we generated an unlevered IRR just over 50% on this investment and recognized a $15 million gain on sale in the fourth quarter. Since this was a gain on investment, rather than a gain on the sale of previously depreciated real estate, the gain is included in NAREIT defined FFO although we have backed it out in our presentation of core FFO. In the execution of our capital recycling program, our team has been focused on maximizing proceeds for shareholders. We've allocated two investment professionals who typically work on acquisitions to oversee this process. On our third quarter earnings call, we announced that we had identified an initial pool of nine assets for disposition. Of these nine properties, one has been sold, two are in advanced contract negotiations, one property was 100% vacant when identified, but our team now has it fully leased and it will be marketed within the next few weeks. The remaining five properties are undergoing similar value-add efforts which we believe will result in better proceeds for our investors. During the fourth quarter, we determined to bring an additional eight properties to market. Once our business plan changed from hold to sell, three of these properties no longer cleared the impairment accounting recoverability test and we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter to write these three properties down to their estimated fair market value as of December 31. While conditions are always subject to change, we do not expect our capital recycling program to result in any additional impairment charges at this time. Of these next eight properties, five will be brought to market in the coming quarter, two need some additional leasing and the final property will likely be sold to a user if they continue to pursue it. We closed on the sale of our first non-core asset, a non-data center property in suburban Boston, subsequent to year-end. We sold this property to a regional investor for $184 per square foot and a 5% cap rate. The sale generated net proceeds of approximately $29 million and we expect to recognize a $9 million gain in the first quarter. We reported last quarter that leasing activity on non-core properties had picked up considerably over the preceding 90 days. I'm pleased to report that we were able to finalize signatures on several key leases during the fourth quarter. You may have noted from our supplemental disclosure package that recurring capital expenditures were up significantly in the fourth quarter. This was almost entirely due to leasing costs on these -- on the two leases at two non-core, non-data center properties, one in the Mid-Atlantic and one in the Bay area. These two leases represent approximately $4.5 million of annual NOI and the average lease term was over 10 years. This leasing activity should generate significantly greater proceeds for our shareholders from the sale of these two non-core properties. And now for a real-time update on data center leasing dynamics, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski. Matt Miszewski : Thank you, Scott. As shown on page 4 of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling approximately $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter. Mid-market revenue accounted for over 10% of our leasing activity and this marks the fifth consecutive quarter that our mid-market segment has delivered a consistent contribution of between $4 million and $8 million. This segment has had the intended effect of smoothing out some of the traditional lumpiness in our quarterly leasing activity and we're making steady progress towards our goal of doubling the size of this business from 4% to 8% of revenues within a three-year time frame. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content were the major drivers of our leasing activity throughout 2014 and the fourth quarter was no exception. These workloads accounted for nearly 75% of our fourth quarter lease signings. In addition, existing customers accounted for nearly 90% of our lease signings again in the fourth quarter, but we also added 21 new logos in the quarter, bringing our full year total to 100. Turning now to page 5. Cash rents on renewal leases were positive on average with a slight roll-down on Turn-Key leasing offset by positive cash re-leasing spreads on power based building renewals. The chart on page 6 puts our full year lease volume in perspective. And while Turn-Key rates shown here at the bottom of the chart can be skewed by geographic mix in any given quarter, the full year results clearly tell the tale of a market rent trough in 2013, followed by the beginning of a recovery in 2014. In addition to leases signed, lease commencements were likewise healthy. In fact, 2014 was a record year for lease commencements. The weighted average lag between signing and commencement held steady at five and a half months and has settled consistently in the six month range for the past six quarters. We leased a total of 20 megawatts during the fourth quarter, almost half of which was finished inventory. And we generated 9 megawatts of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool during the fourth quarter. As you can see here on page 7, we have made steady progress towards our objective of leasing up existing inventory. Most notably, we shrank the finished inventory balance in Phoenix by 4 megawatts during the fourth quarter. We now have just 2 megawatts of inventory remaining in Phoenix, a dramatic reduction from 11 megawatts as of our Investor Day in November 2013. At the portfolio level, we now have 23 megawatts of finished inventory remaining, down 45% since Investor Day. Going forward, it is entirely possible that the reduction in our stockpile of available inventory coupled with tighter lease underwriting discipline may impact leasing velocity in future periods. However, we remain confident that our focus on profitable growth is translating to improved net effective leasing economics and better returns for our shareholders. Turning now to supply on page 8. You can see graphically here what we mean when we talk about the rationalization of supply in the data center industry. We have consolidated the third quarter supply snapshot on the same page as the fourth quarter, which visually highlights the sharp reduction in availability within the Northern Virginia market. The absorption of sublease space in Northern Virginia has been well-documented, but sublease availability in Silicon Valley came down a bit during the fourth quarter as well. A portion of this was the block in our Santa Clara portfolio, which we alluded to on our second quarter call. We successfully negotiated a lease termination fee from the existing Internet enterprise tenant and we were able to immediately re-lease the space to a cloud service provider. The existing lease was a power based building structure, but the space had been highly improved by the former tenant and we were able to re-lease it at Turn-Key rates. We will have to invest some of our own capital, but we expect to generate a very attractive return for our shareholders on this transaction. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to take you through our financial results. Matt Mercier : Thank you, Matt. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Digital Realty celebrated its 10th anniversary as a public Company. So I'd like to start here on page 9 and take this opportunity to recap the track record we've established. Over the last 10 years, DLR has generated annualized total returns of 22%. This is the single best performance in the REIT universe over this time frame and represents over 1400 basis points of annual outperformance relative to the RMS. We have generated mid-teens compound annual growth in both dividends and FFO per share from 2005 to 2014. We have also generated positive growth in both dividends and FFO per share every single year. As represented in the chart on the top left of page 10, Citi Investment Research recently published a report titled Don't Forget About Those Dividends and identified Digital Realty as having generated the second highest compound annual growth in dividends per share within the REIT industry over a seven and nine year period. Perhaps even more importantly, this growth has been achieved with a low volatility. We're one of only 10 REITs among the 140 constituents within the RMZ to have increased the dividend each and every year since 2005. This is a track record that we believe warrants a Blue Chip valuation rather than the discount by almost any measure as shown on page 11, at which we trade relative to the REIT universe. Similarly, moving on to page 12, we believe our balance sheet stacks up favorably relative to a Blue Chip peer group. It's worth noting here that debt to EBITDA improved another 2/10 of a turn in the fourth quarter to 4.8 times. I would also like to point out a change to the balance sheet presentation as of December 31, 2014. Five assets have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet related to our disposition program as Scott discussed. While we're in various stages of the disposition process on a broader group of assets, these five were the only ones to meet the requirement to be classified as held for sale as of year-end. The accounting treatment is to collapse the net book value of these assets and liabilities of the properties held for sale into their own lines on the balance sheet. Divestitures aside, our investment grade credit ratings are supported by the diversification of our customer base as well as our geographic footprint. As shown on page 13, our exposure to the current hot spots is manageable. We do have exposure to net data centers, formerly known as Net2EZ. However, we believe their operation at our El Segundo data center less than two miles from their headquarter is significantly cash flow positive. In addition, Net2EZ represents less than 1% of our total revenue. We have judiciously avoided exposure to Bitcoin mining credit. So we do not expect to see any impact to our customer base or rent role from the drop in the price of Bitcoin. We view the energy sector as attractive in the long run and we have identified it as an underpenetrated target vertical. Oil patch customers currently represent less than 2% of our total revenue stream. However, though we have limited exposure in the near term. Similarly, we like the Houston market in the long run, but there's little doubt that the regional economy will be negatively impacted from the drop in the price of oil. Our exposure is limited, with less than 1.5% of our portfolio concentrated in Houston. In terms of oil, the direct impact on our cost structure from a $10 swing in the price of a barrel of oil is considerably less than a penny per share. Moving on to foreign currency. As Bill mentioned in his remarks, the U.S. represents roughly three fourths of our portfolio. We're exposed to non-U.S. dollar currencies on the remaining one fourth of our portfolio. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of reported earnings, however, we're exposed to currency translation swings, primarily in the pound and euro. We indicated in early January that foreign currency translation was expected to represent an earnings headwind of a little over 1% and the dollar has strengthened further since then, particularly against the Euro. It is important to keep in mind that while having a global portfolio exposes us to currency risk, it also enables us to satisfy the international data center requirements of global enterprises and cloud providers, which is a key competitive advantage. We remain comfortable reiterating core FFO per share guidance within a range of $5 to $5.10. However, if the dollar continues to strengthen and if we prove unable to collect rent from Net2EZ for the remainder of the year, then we would likely be trending towards the low end of the range. It is also worth noting that we expect the quarterly distribution of core FFO to be back end weighted, with the split roughly 48 to 52 between the run rate in the first half and the latter half of the year. Moving on to operating performance. Portfolio occupancy ticked up another 20 basis points sequentially to 93.2%, the third consecutive improvement in occupancy. We do have several known move-outs in 2015, however, primarily power based building expirations on the West Coast. And we expect portfolio occupancy to dip in the first quarter and again in the third, before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year. Our leasing activity's off to a good start in 2015 and we have whittled the incremental revenue from speculative leasing embedded within our forecast down from $25 million to $30 million in early January to $20 million to $25 million as we speak. This progress is one of the primary variables that gives us comfort reiterating guidance despite the foreign currency headwinds. I would now like to take a moment to highlight some of the further disclosure enhancements we've made this quarter, as detailed on page 14. First of all, we have broken out construction in progress and land held for development on the face of the balance sheet. Second, we have provided new net effective rent disclosure on the leasing activity pages in the supplemental. Third, we have disclosed IT load by property for the first time in the supplemental. Although please be sure to note we have presented IT load only for Turn-Key and colocation data centers, not for power based building footprint. Fourth, we have also slightly rearranged our joint venture schedule to make it easier to arrive at cash NOI. Fifth, per NAREIT's request, we have included FFO guidance under the NAREIT definition in addition to our measure of core FFO. And finally, beginning in 2015, we will present a more stringent classification of property level CapEx. The puts and takes of our prospective CapEx reporting are laid out on page 15 of the presentation. The upshot is that we will strip out all property level capitalized expenditures from the enhancements and other non-recurring CapEx category, which will then be comprised solely of capital spending on our network fiber initiatives and software development costs, primarily our DCIM or data center infrastructure management solution. This category previously included approximately $25 million of capital spending that has been deemed to be either discretionary in nature or related to non-core properties and has been cut out of the budget all together. Roughly $40 million consisted of infrequent expenditures for capitalized replacements and upgrades which for all intents and purposes amounts to property level spending that should be classified as recurring CapEx. Conversely, recurring CapEx previously included approximately $25 million of first generation leasing costs which should be classified as development spending. Taking a step back, it's important to note that we're not making any changes in accounting policy. These costs have always been and will continue to be capitalized to the basis of their respective building. We're simply adopting a more conservative approach in terms of the categories of capital spending that we deduct from FFO to arrive at AFFO. We hope that you find these disclosure enhancements to be helpful. We aim to continuously improve the transparency of our financial disclosures and as always we welcome additional input from analysts and investors. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Bill for closing remarks. Bill Stein : Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our 2014 highlights as outlined here on page 16. We leased a total of 67 megawatts last year, including 28 megawatts of finished inventory and we reduced the finished inventory balance by 20 megawatts. We improved our return on invested capital by 60 basis points. That does not include the benefit of impairments, by the way, which boosts ROIC by another 10 basis points. We reversed the declining occupancy trend and finished the year up 60 basis points on the heels of three consecutive quarterly upticks. Same capital cash NOI grew 4% and we reached $1 billion of NOI. We put up 7% growth in adjusted EBITDA, 6% growth in FFO and 4% growth in FFO -- in core FFO, despite terming out over $850 million of long-term capital and selling or contributing properties that generated over $20 million of NOI. We further de-leverred the balance sheet and brought debt to EBITDA down from 5.4 times to 4.8 times. We closed out the year with a $0.03 beat in the first quarter and finally, we delivered a 41.6% total return to our shareholders, outperforming the REIT index by 1100 basis points. In short, 2014 was a very good year in terms of consistent execution on the strategic initiatives that we laid out early last year. We have work yet to be done, however and we will continue to update you on these objectives. In addition, we will look forward to sharing with you our top priorities for 2015 on our first quarter call. I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who are responsible for delivering the success we achieved in 2014. And now, we will be pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Schildkraut : The results look pretty solid here and I thought the commentary about renewal pricing in the fourth quarter was very positive. I think it was up 6% on a cash basis. But when I take a look at your November deck and your expectations for GAAP and cash rent renewal rates for the full year, it seems like the full year numbers came in a little bit lighter than you were anticipating in November. I was wondering if you might walk us through some of the puts and takes as we look at that presentation versus what happened at the end of the year. Thanks. Matt Mercier : We continue to see market rents improving long-term and all of that is driven really by a more rational supply level as we walked through in the deck in the introductory remarks. We've talked over last year and during the last presentation about some of our above market leases. The majority of those -- important to remember, the majority of those above market leases have now been resolved. We expect in 2015 that those renewals will roughly be flat. It's important to remember and we want to make sure we talk about this, that some -- there are some above market lease exposure that we do have in 2016. But if you look back at FY14, it was down about 0.9% and in Q4 was up about 0.3%. So we expect that the market rent improvements over 2015 -- in 2015 will help to mitigate our exposure and that goes back to our belief that the fundamentals in the industry are truly improving. Jonathan Schildkraut : And as a follow-up then, just to confirm, looking at your guidance from the beginning of January to now, in both cases you guys are talking about positive rent roles on a cash basis. So you continue to be somewhat positively disposed to spot rate pricing. Wondering if you've seen any change in the marketplace between then and now, about six weeks' time period. Thanks. Matt Mercier : In terms of January to now, I don't think we've seen any fundamental changes. We continue to see the fundamentals improving and we expect a slight improvement over the year. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Yes. Related to that last point, I just wondered about spot pricing and on a like for like basis, are there any differing trends that you're seeing by region for similarly sized requirements, say six months ago, 12 months ago, versus right now? And then on the mid-market growth, I wondered how much of that growth that you quantified came from new logos. Matt Mercier : We do see some regional performance dynamics, stability in Northern Virginia, moderate to or slight to moderate improvement in Chicago and in Dallas. And in Asia-Pac, we see strong cash indications that our investment in Asia-Pacific in particular in Singapore and Hong Kong continue to have an upward trend for us. We see that stability. I think in my opening comments, I made some remarks about both the amount of revenue that we see from existing and repeat customers, seems to be relatively stable around 90% from quarterly -- in terms of quarterly performance. And then we did add 100 new logos last year, which we think is a good coupling of growth from our existing client base and then new logos coming primarily from our mid-market efforts. Jonathan Atkin : Right. And then the tenant type, there's a pie chart at the bottom of page 13 of the presentation and I just wondered, is there any particular vertical or type of tenant that you would see yourselves indexing more towards in the future? Matt Mercier : Yes. So we try to think about it in terms of workloads for us and in workloads I covered a little bit about smack workloads. I do get entertained by the guys around the table here today using the word smack, but it's social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content. We continue to see a significant amount of additions from each of those workloads. We do have a vertical focus as well. When you talk about the areas where we're incredibly strong and dominant, financial services continues to be one of those great verticals for us, both across the large enterprise space but also starting to pop up a little bit more in the mid-market space as well. And then traditionally our IT Telco and cloud verticals remain extremely strong. You did hear a little bit of a mention of oil and gas in the preparatory remarks and energy all up. We consider ourselves to be underpenetrated in that vertical, but some of the activities and macroeconomic effects that are happening right now will tend to tip some of those folks to think a little bit differently about their data center deployment. And we would certainly expect that they would look at a provider like us as a way to resolve some of those interests. And then healthcare, I would consider an underpenetrated vertical for us as well. And in healthcare we've seen a significant uptick last year and that continues again in Q1 this year. One of the verticals, our intention is to go after more penetration through our partner activity is the public sector vertical, which I've got a personal interest in. We've got some fantastic partners including Carpathia that is just one of the partners that we intend to go to market through to help us over-penetrate that vertical. Operator : The next question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vance Edelson : Could you give us your views on the recent Telecity merger announcement in Europe and whether that has any effect on your European strategy? Were you thinking of stepping up your European colocation presence there and might this news open any doors in that regard? Or do you see yourself as more conservative when it comes to any type of expansion or the evolution of this strategy in Europe? Scott Peterson : Yes, Vance, this is Scott. My first comment will be regarding the announcement. We clearly -- we track all the public and private companies in our industry and we're going to continue to monitor this closely. Clearly, consolidation is appropriate as our industry evolves. I'm not sure if anybody wants to handle -- I don't think we're really thinking this is going to change our strategy and our penetration in that region at this time. Vance Edelson : And then as my quick follow-up, with the pendulum swinging some between build to order, which you mentioned a few months ago you had transitioned to and now you're comfortable building out in small increments I think you said without a signed lease and in certain markets, is the pendulum going to swing more in that direction do you think in that more cities could become attractive for speculative builds? Or do you think this is just a near term opportunity and build to order becomes more dominant again going forward? Scott Peterson : I think that given our abilities to shorten up the delivery time frames that build to order will continue to be a very significant part of our portfolio. But having said that, we're constantly evaluating markets for speculative development potential and as Bill said right now, there are a handful of markets that are appropriate. If you were you to track that over time, you would see that it has changed and evolved over the past several years. So we continue to revisit that on a regular basis and we look at the supply and demand and investment potential in these markets. A we will make determinations as to where speculative development is appropriate based on our evaluation of those opportunities. Operator : The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao : Just wanted to go back to the question on the same capital growth, 4%. I think that was expected to be more like 4.5% to 5.5% as of last quarter. Just curious, is that mostly just FX headwinds that caused you to miss on that front, or was there something else going on? And just as a corollary, since the dollar has strengthened some more, there might be some puts and takes on other line items in the guidance, but does that suggest that you're tracking towards the lower end of the range for same capital growth for 2015? Scott Peterson : So in terms of 2014, we're obviously pleased with our 4% growth in same capital cash NOI. There was a little bit of FX headwind in the fourth quarter as well as some additional unanticipated expenses, primarily some non-routine generator maintenance at some of our properties in the same capital pool that contributed to the -- to missing what we had expected. But again, we're pleased with the 4% growth for 2014. In terms of 2015, we do conservatively budget and forecast for currency. We typically have a little buffer between where rates are when we go through our process and take a little haircut off of that. I would say at this point we're still comfortable with that range. But as we said overall, in terms of all the guidance metrics that if rates continue to deteriorate, that would obviously have an impact and push us down towards the lower end of the range. Vincent Chao : Just going back to the disposition, I think last quarter the first nine assets, first bucket was talked about in the $260 million range. I think that was potentially to be sold in the fourth quarter. Just curious, should we be thinking about that $260 million on top of the current guidance for 2015 of $175 million to $400 million or is that just blend into the $175 million to $400 million for 2015? Scott Peterson : It fits in that number, the $175 million to $400 million. Operator : And the next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya : Just in regards to the leasing activity during the quarter, just a lot of it was non-technical space. Just curious what exactly that was. Matt Miszewski : The non-technical space was primarily office space and I think we covered a little bit of the detail of that in the introductory remarks. Matt Mercier : Scott talked about that related to the -- sorry, this is Matt, the other Matt. Scott talked about that related to some of the assets that are on our disposition list. So that relates to some leasing we did at some of the non-core, non-data center assets and related to some of the recurring capital that was talked about as well. Operator : And next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Just two related -- a question and a follow-up. So as relates to the product innovation and connectivity, I was wondering if you can just give us an update on your current thinking there, perhaps what's evolved in terms of how you're thinking about building out that product set. And then the second question, a follow-up to that, as it relates to the mid-market success, I was wondering if you could talk about what particular locations you're seeing the most success with that right now. Thanks. Bill Stein : This is Bill. We clearly had very good success for what is known as our 2N product which is our current offering and that's demonstrated by the very strong leasing results we've had this past year. But we also continue to evaluate the best ways that we can provide solutions to our customers' needs. And as needs change, we remain committed to partnering and providing the best solutions possible to meeting those needs. So to sum it up, we would see -- I think what we're going to have two products out there, where one would -- actually, we could have a range of products, but we're going to have our traditional 2N product. We will be designing something that provides the flexibility to offer different levels of redundancy. Colby Synesael : And that would be through a partner? Matt Miszewski : Part of your question was I think regarding cloud and connectivity, the ecosystem products that we continue to work very closely on. I would say that you will see a heightened focus in 2015 on cloud connectivity products, both products that we manage directly as well as products that are managed by some of our fantastic partners that I mentioned as we move forward. And then our ecosystem and our Open-IX initiatives continue to be well underway and are seeing a great deal of success. And we now landed open Internet exchange operations on both coasts. In fact, in the 365 main in the most recent installations in 365 main, we've now connected 17 customers directly, 14 of them are in provisioning rights now and nine are pending agreements. And these are the names you would expect, Netflix and the like. So while we talk about that Open-IX initiative being long-term, we're starting to see the rhythm really pick up. And then Bill and I talk on a regular occasion with folks who provide advanced services such as remote peering and that's really an option that could help to accelerate or speed up that transition. So we're thrilled to see further adoption of our ecosystem products, Open-IX initiatives that we do through partners and then we will see some additional products moving forward. To get to your mid-market question, there's a couple of answers to that. But our best performance from a regional perspective is currently coming out of our West Coast team and I know they're listening to the call, so hopefully they just cheered downstairs a little bit. But the West Coast team is doing a pretty good job of performance. In terms of where that is landing, we're seeing a little bit of a mixture of landing places, both in the west, but also our fantastic asset management portfolio and sales teams in the Northeast have been doing a continual great job in the Boston and surrounding markets as well. Operator : Next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Question regarding the recent consolidation that we've seen. So interaction in Telecity and Latisys recently, thoughts on the future, any uptick? This uptick in consolidation, do you think we will see a little bit of a land grab here? Do you think we will see further consolidation across the space as folks look to maintain or increase market share? Matt Miszewski : We obviously looked at lattices. I think what you will see, what I think you're going to see is a fair amount of private companies that come to market. The public companies have some unique factors. And those factors are basically multiple related and cultural related. And you really I think need to have both to make it work and so it makes it really hard to predict what's going to happen on the public front. But I do think that with the stock price is recovering in the public sector, you're likely to see more private portfolios come to market and the public companies would have bids for those assets. Scott, do you have anything to add? Scott Peterson : I think that's spot-on. I think as you see the industry evolve, you see companies trying to expand their product and service offerings for their customers as well as their geographic footprint. So I think you will see that and I don't know if that would qualify so much as a land grab, if you will, but I think it's trying to be a more integrated solution offering to their customers. And I think it's probably, as I said of before, I think it's a reasonable thing to expect as this industry continues to evolve. Matt Mercier : Jordan, I think you've got unanimity amongst the senior leadership team here at Digital, that we look at everything that happens in the industry, but there's two driving components. There has to be strategic fit. If there's strategic fit, it's something good to look at. But then the economics have to make sense for everybody as well and I don't think we've seen that alignment yet. Bill Stein : Said differently, we're not going to do a deal just to get bigger. There has be a strategic rationale for it as well. Jordan Sadler : Along those same lines, Bill, strategically you spent 2014 taking up inventory successfully, leasing quite a bit of it, improving the return on invested capital. What do you foresee and what's the strategic plan for the balance sheet going forward? Do you stay the course on the inventory which seems to be getting a little thinner, or do you build out a little bit more speculatively? I'm just noticing the CapEx guidance, the spending guidance for development is pretty flattish year-over-year. Matt Miszewski : Well, we tried to address that earlier. I did in my remarks. But we plan to add some speculative inventory in our high demand markets and those markets are Northern Virginia, Dallas, Chicago and Singapore. So we will take speculative risk there as long as we have clear visibility on the demand. Scott Peterson : And remember, right, 23 megawatts of finished inventory really represents about 5% of the total IT load that we've got out there. We made progress leasing it up last year. I think we're going to continue steadily making that progress and meeting the expectations that Bill helped set for these. Operator : The next question will come from Jon Petersen of MLV and Company. Please go ahead. Jon Petersen : I was hoping to get a little more color on your Southwest Mexico investment, redIT I believe is the firm you were invested in. If you guys were able to get a 50% IRR over an 18 month time period, curious why you would sell at this point. I assume it's a desire to simplify, but with returns that well, just curious to get more color on why you stepped away from that investment,. Also if you have any other investments in small data center companies like that you're looking to sell. Scott Peterson : I think our only regret on that is we didn't have a lot more money invested in it. It was just a unique investment. It was a great way for us to get exposure and access to that market. As it turned out, a strategic buyer showed up with a compelling bid and it was really one -- we weren't really in a controlling position on that. It was one that was really hard to refuse. Hard to argue with taking a profit like that. Bill Stein : And RedIt was a company that we had sold consulting services to. That was really how we got in the door in the first place there. Jon Petersen : And then just a follow-up. I believe on the call you mentioned that in the first quarter and third quarter you expect occupancy to dip down due to power based leases. Curious if you can quantify a little more how large those leases are and what condition the data centers will be in as power based leases and what you will do in terms of re-leasing. Will you convert them into Turn-Key? Matt Mercier : One of the assets in particular is downtown San Francisco CBG asset that we're looking at a couple different alternatives for that property. The other one is also outside of San Francisco, CBD and it's a property that we've had history of taking back shelf space which it will be when the tenant expires converting it to Turn-Key and leasing it successfully. So I know that's the likely action plan for those -- the majority of that space that we've talked about. I think in terms of hit to occupancy, I'm quoting off memory here, but I believe it's roughly 15 basis points for each of those, 0.15% for each of those spaces. Operator : Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Emmanuel Korchman : If we focus on the impairments for a second, looks like a couple of them you had completed redevelopments in 2011, 2012. One of them looked like a data center. What went downhill there that you got to a point where you had to take impairments on them even if you are selling them? Matt Mercier : I think it was one where it was just part of an overly exuberant development program at the time and in those markets probably had fairly -- well, they did have fairly thin demand at the time. And so it was probably one of those projects that we wish we could have a mulligan on. Emmanuel Korchman : And then forgive me if I missed, but did you give a revised backlog number since you don't provide a commencement schedule anymore in the presentation? Bill Stein : No, we don't have a revised backlog number. Operator : And our next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz : So appreciate some of the new slides you gave us around historical return metrics, valuations versus broader REIT universe. But I'm just thinking given the recent lift in public data center peer multiples, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on where we stand now relative to private market multiples and how those spreads might be changing or influencing how you think about the outlook for external growth activity once the efficiency initiatives have run their course. Scott Peterson : A part of it gets back to what we said is we're always looking at opportunities and we try to evaluate them by is there a strategic fit, does it do something for our Company, but just as importantly does it do something for our shareholders. There have not been a lot of, as you know, a lot of big private market transactions over the last couple of years. Most of them have gone public. I think the valuations have trended pretty closely between private and public right now, which creates a little bit of friction as it relates to trying to do accretive transactions. Will that change in the future? I have a feeling there will be some changes there. But with public market valuations being so readily accessible, the private market guys look to that to value their portfolio. And they don't really want to leave a lot on the table for the acquiring Company and their shareholders. Matt Mercier : And sorry, just to follow up on the question that Manny had. If you look at page 7 in the presentation, the backlog we have right now is $108 million. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Jonathan Schildkraut : I was just looking at your top 20 customers and there seemed to be some notable movements amongst those customers. I thought most surprising was to see Facebook jump up into the top five, especially since we've seen them do some subleasing in some other facilities. I was wondering if there was any incremental color you could offer around movements in the top 20 customers. Thanks. Matt Miszewski : Sure. So we're always happy to see Facebook move up inside our top 20 list. We've had a historical fantastic relationship and that relationship continued in 2014, especially in Q1 in 2014. So in particular, we also are very solid behind the demand that that particular set of transactions has behind it. So we're very satisfied that their take in 2014 with us is a very long-term relationship in a market that is growing even faster from a social media perspective than is the U.S. market. Other notable moves, of course we've expanded our exposure to IBM as part of their SoftLayer acquisition. And we welcome that continued movement and that continued relationship across the whole organization. We were lucky enough to have a great relationship with SoftLayer as they started out and as they grew and as they were acquired we were able to strengthen our relationship with an existing client at IBM and now we're happy to rank them currently number two in the list. But the rapid growth is how we say rapid, so number one might be at risk in a little bit. But we're thrilled to have them amongst the movers and shakers in the top 20. Bill Stein : Let me add to that. Let me add to that too, Jonathan. If you look at the IBM in particular, they're now in 16 locations with us around the world and that's something we're particularly proud of. I think next quarter you will see additional movement on this list and possibly some new customers of moving onto this and moving up pretty quickly. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James and Associates. Please go ahead. Bill Crow : Bill, I want to go back to the M&A discussion briefly. The INXN Telecity deal, our T&T guys think that would have been a great addition for your Company and a great position you to compete against Equinix. Maybe a negative for them. You said you looked at it. I'm just wondering what caused you not to pursue it or did you pursue it but you lost out financially or it's just not the right time for your Company to pursue something like that? Bill Stein : First of all, Bill, this was really an off-market deal. So neither one of these companies was marketed to the broader data center universe. And if you think back on where we came from last year, it's only recently that our stock price has recovered and give us currency. We've been really focused on the five goals that I laid out last year and we've obviously made very good progress against that. But I think it's fair to say that while we've tracked really both companies, we felt that we weren't ready to take something on like that at that time. Operator : The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Yes, so I was interested in the exposure to Houston and the oil and gas sector and are those 1.3 and 1.9%, are they mutually exclusive or is there some overlap there? And in particular, I think in a more fundamental level I'm just interested are you being cautious when you put that exposure on your slide or are there concrete signs and customer behavior that are leading you to take a more cautious stance? Matt Miszewski : So to address the first, there is overlap between those two as you can imagine. There's a number of parties in oil and gas that are located in Houston. Those are, as of 12/31, that is our exposure to both those sectors as laid out. I don't think there's anything else to add on top of that. Scott Peterson : I think that Jonathan, the interesting part of our corporate strategy of diversification of the client base is something that shines here that we're not overexposed to any particular industry when they go through tough times for their own industry. But as I was stating, woe be me to suggest that under penetration in a vertical is a good thing, but under penetration in this case could potentially lead to opportunities. So we certainly hope that the reduction in the price of oil allows some of the folks in the Houston area to reconsider some of the deployments they are thinking about making or some of the deployments they have made, especially if they're looking at the renewals. And they look at a data center operator that could provide them with a much lower total cost of ownership with their data center facility. Operator : Our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya : Additional question. Bill, just was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Board's mindset and how they're thinking about the replacement for the CFO role, specifically what they're looking for and if there's a sense of timing of how soon that could happen. Bill Stein : Sure. Well, we've engaged a search firm and they've generated an initial list of candidates. So we're considering both internal and external candidates. I think we have very strong candidates in both categories. In terms of background, my bias here is to find someone who is experienced in capital intensive industries because of the need to have sophistication in terms of balance sheet management. And I think real estate would clearly give you that. And I think Telco and some networking would do that as well. The advantage of real estate is that not only do you get balance sheet management expertise, but you also get hopefully connections or contacts with institutional investors in the real estate community. In terms of timing, suffice to say that I hope this will be done in less time than it took to find the CEO. I would expect that since we're running the process here that that's what will happen. And I don't know that that we will have a new CFO by the time of the next call, but it would certainly be nice if we could from where I stand. Tayo Okusanya : Just one quick other minor question from me. More of a numbers question with the same store NOI for the quarter, just a couple of big moves on the operating expense side especially with property taxes coming down so much. I just wanted to understand that a little bit better. Matt Mercier : We continually look at our portfolio and find where we can work to get the properties reassessed. And we had expected to achieve a number of lower reassessments for properties in our same -- in the same capital pool. We didn't hit all of them but we got the majority of them and that's what's driving the decline in property taxes over the prior year. Operator : And our next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : I wanted to follow up on the M&A discussion a little bit within the market. You mentioned I think, Bill, in response that you would look to do something that was more strategic. You wouldn't look just to get bigger. I'm curious how you would define strategic, if that would be by vertical or product or more geography. Bill Stein : Really any of the above. So new markets, new products, new services, vertical expertise as well. Scott Peterson : Jordan, as a follow-up, Jordan, we spent a fair amount of time looking at the lattices deal and we were short listed on that and had great respect for the team there and the Company. But it was one where the pricing was going to a point where it really wasn't going to be very compelling for our shareholders. And as a result, we weren't the most aggressive bidder on that. Jordan Sadler : Okay. What we can take away from what seems like a hard look at the lattices deal is as opposed to last year when you weren't necessarily ready and you were more focused internally, today given the recovery in the stock and the currency, et cetera and in the portfolio and the ops, that you are more ready relative to last year? Bill Stein : That's right. Scott Peterson : Yes. I would agree with that. I think we always evaluate an opportunity based on how well it fits within our strategy, how well it fits within our current portfolio, what it does to enhance our company and our growth prospects and just as importantly is it a compelling investment for our shareholders. Operator : The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman. Bill, your talk about Telecity interaction, you talked about where your stock was last year and your desire not to get involved given your cost of capital. Given UK takeover rules and it's a nonbinding deal, that wouldn't preclude you from getting involved at this point, right, if you have the confidence in where your stock is and your cost of capital? Bill Stein : That's true. Michael Bilerman : So is that something that would be on the table post? Bill Stein : Michael, as I said we're going to continue to monitor this transaction as it evolves very closely. Michael Bilerman : And then just in terms of the backlog, I thought you said page 7 but I'm looking at page 7 and that's absorption of finished inventory. Matt Mercier : I misspoke. It isn't in the deck. It is $108 million as of the end of the year. Operator : Our next question will come from Trent Trujillo of UBS. Please go ahead. Ross Nussbaum : It's Ross Nussbaum here. Sorry, I'm on the cell phone. The impairments that you took in the quarter, are those three assets, assets that are included in the held for sale bucket or were these re-evaluated separate from that? Matt Mercier : They're in the held for sale bucket, that's what ultimately, I'm sorry. Matt Miszewski : This is Matt. They are not part of the held for sale. Held for sale basically in order to qualify, we do the impairment analysis essentially as one of the first step. Held for sale usually comes along when you're much further along in the process and you've hired a listing broker and you have all your marketing materials. And so those three assets are not part of the held for sale pool. Ross Nussbaum : But it sounds like you're contemplating closing of those later in the year. Scott Peterson : Yes, they've been identified as properties for disposition they don't meet the technical qualification of held for sale, but they are on the list of assets to be disposed of this year. Operator : And our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Sorry. I didn't realize it was only two and then you go. The question I wanted to ask was continuing a little bit on the impairment. You talked in relation to a question before that the impairments was because you are going to sell the assets so you have to go down and see what the value is relative to what you were carrying them were. Manny asked about one of the assets, you said we wish we could have taken a mulligan on that one, we wouldn't have made the investments that we did. Have you guys gone through -- and I know impairment accounting is very different than NAV or asset value accounting, but I'm just curious if you have done a full analysis? And I know you guys have presented your NAV before, taking the NOI and just putting a cap rate on it, but I'm curious whether you've actually gone through and said well, let's value each asset as if we were going to sell it to be able to tease out whether there's any other issues like these three assets that would be in the portfolio on a mark-to-market sale basis versus a cap rate analysis on current NOI. Scott Peterson : What we have done is we took all of the non-core, non-data center assets and we took any of the ones that we might qualify or characterize as underperforming or at risk of underperforming, because maybe short-term nature of leases, as well as any property or project that was going to require significant capital investment over the coming years. And we evaluated each one of those for its current investment potential to identify which ones we think we might have issues with, whether it is to sell them or we might have valuation issues. So yes, we did. We have gone through all that. What we haven't done to balance all that out is we didn't go and then do a fair evaluation of properties like in Chicago where we bought that with $14 million of NOI and now what, do we have $72 million of NOI there. We probably created $600 million, $700 million of value there. I would say on balance if we did that fairly, the winners would vastly swamp any of the marginal players in that. Michael Bilerman : And the effective cap rate on current NOI for those three assets would be what? Scott Peterson : It would be below our current implied cap rate in our portfolio, quite a bit. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. The Digital Realty fourth quarter and full year 2014 results conference call has now ended. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein. Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had a solid first quarter, and I would like to begin today by providing an update on the progress that we've made towards our strategic priorities, which you can see laid out on The Way Forward slide on page two in the accompanying presentation. First and foremost, we achieved a 40 basis point sequential improvement in our return on invested capital during the first quarter. This was driven primarily by the burn-off of straight-line rent and consistent lease-up of development projects. This comes on the heels of the 60 basis point improvement that we achieved for the full year in 2014. Given the size of our asset base, we believe that this is a truly remarkable achievement. I should point out that we have likely realized the bulk of the improvement that we expect to recognize this year in the first quarter, and this measure is likely to plateau for the balance of the year. You can be assured, however, that we are not content to rest on our laurels, and we will continue to strive to optimize the return on our asset base and drive greater profitability on every square foot in our portfolio. Of course Scott Peterson will provide greater detail on our capital recycling initiatives in his remarks, but we achieved solid execution on asset sales at very favorable pricing, harvesting capital to fund significantly higher-yielding investments in our development pipeline and enhancing the quality of our portfolio in the process. We now have realized $95 million of gain on three asset sales so far this year. As we stated last quarter, we expect gains on non-core assets sales to more than offset the impairment charges we took last year. And we are well on our way to the tipping point. I'm proud of the job that Scott and his team are doing. The execution of our capital recycling strategy is clearly resulting in steady progress towards our objectives. Shifting gears now to our customers business. It has become clear that the cloud is revolutionizing the delivery of IT across the corporate world. As you know, the corporate enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base, and cloud service providers find our portfolio to be highly desirable, in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. As you've heard me say on previous calls, the attraction is mutual. And our global footprint, high-quality product and proven operating track record represent significant competitive advantages for landing the intersection of cloud and enterprise within our global portfolio. We're also adapting our product offering to accommodate diverse IT workloads, incorporating hybrid clouds and value-added vertical solutions. We aim to deliver what our customers want on a global basis, where they want it and add a value in line with their needs. We are making steady progress and we look forward to continuing to update you as we deliver a more agile deployment method. Moving on to inventory management, as you know, we have made significant headway leasing up our finished inventory and improving the risk profile of our development pipeline in the process. We have reduced our finished inventory balance by 40% since our Investor Day in November 2013. And our active datacenter construction projects, which are expected to deliver stabilized cash yields in double-digits, are currently better than 80% pre-leased. Based on the current positioning of our existing inventory and the strength of our sales pipeline, we are moving forward with new investment in key markets in a disciplined manner. During the first quarter, we began construction on 12 megawatts across Silicon Valley, Chicago, northern Virginia and Dallas. These projects were 52% leased at quarter-end, but now are 90% leased one month later. We are tracking strong demand from new and existing customers in each of these markets and we are confident in our ability to lease up incremental capacity at attractive returns. Turning now to our human capital, as most of you are well aware, we have further strengthened our existing senior management team with three key hires over the past few weeks. As mentioned earlier, Andy Power is our new CFO. We have worked with Andy for more than a decade and we look forward to leveraging his capital markets expertise and relationships in the financial community to support our longer-term growth, while prudently managing our balance sheet. In addition, Jarrett Appleby and Michael Henry recently joined the company as our new Chief Operating Officer and Chief Information Officer respectively. We believe that Jarrett will ensure significant alignment between corporate strategy and operations, while enhancing our ability to deliver the most efficient and effective solutions to our customers. We expect Michael to facilitate the use of information and technology to unlock more value for our employees, our customers and our shareholders. We are confident that new hires of this caliber will serve to deepen our bench and strengthen our culture. With a tailwind of improving datacenter fundamentals at our back and these crucial leadership pieces in place, our entire management team is laser-focused on delivering upon our strategic objectives. With that in mind, let me pause here for a moment to ask that all of you mark your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day on September 15. At that time, we will be prepared to unveil a comprehensive strategic plan which will go beyond the initial objectives that we outlined for you last year. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to take you through our financial results. Matt? Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance : Thank you, Bill. We reported first quarter 2015 core FFO per share of $1.27, $0.03 ahead of consensus estimates and ahead of our own expectations. The upside relative to our internal forecast was primarily driven by timing of asset sales as well as repairs and maintenance expense. On a year-over-year basis, core FFO per share was down a little less than 1% from $1.28 in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, however, core FFO per share would have been up a little over 2%. As a reminder, roughly three-fourths of our portfolio is concentrated in the U.S. and we are exposed to non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the pound and euro, on the remaining one-fourth of our portfolio. As I'm sure you're all aware, the U.S. dollar strengthened considerably during the first quarter and our reported earnings were impacted by currency translation swings as shown on page three of the presentation. The strong dollar shaved approximately 250 basis points off the year-over-year growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and same-capital cash NOI. At the bottom line, FX represents a 300 basis point drag on our year-over-year growth in core FFO per share in both the first quarter as well as full-year forecast. It is worth recalling that we manage currency risk by issuing locally-denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. We are well hedged with less than 15% of net assets denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. In addition, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposes us to currency translation exposure, it enables us to satisfy the international datacenter requirements of global enterprises and cloud service providers, which represents a key competitive advantage. Turning now to page four, you can see the $0.05 impact from the additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the first quarter, represented by the red block. This additional currency headwind has been almost entirely offset by later closing on asset sales than initially projected. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising our core FFO per share guidance by $0.03, entirely due to an increase to our sales plan. The narrowing of the gap to 3.7 months between the signing and commencement date on first quarter leasing, along with a strong start to the second quarter, have already enabled us to hit nearly two-thirds of our initial target for incremental revenue from speculative leasing. Consequently, we are raising the incremental revenue target by an additional $5 million, which accounts for the $0.03 raise to core FFO per share guidance. Incidentally, we have also added two new rows to our guidance table to more clearly spell out the progression of incremental revenue from speculative leasing. We're also introducing core FFO per share guidance on a constant currency basis of $5.18 to $5.28, which represents year-over-year growth of 4.5% to 6.5%. Investment activity will always be a wild card, but going forward, we expect our sustainable growth rate to look more like constant currency guidance than as reported. Turning now to operating performance, same-capital occupancy was in line with previous quarters at 93.4% and we have had success backfilling the very modest vacancy uptick from the first quarter. The total portfolio occupancy decline was anticipated and was flagged on our fourth quarter earnings call. We commented last quarter that we have several known move-outs in 2015 and we expected portfolio occupancy to dip in the first quarter and again in the third quarter before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year. The primary driver of the first quarter occupancy decline was a non-tech lease expiration at 1900 South Price Road in Phoenix, which was underwritten at acquisition as a redevelopment project with the expectation that this tenant would vacate when its lease expired. Our cost basis in this property is a little over $100 per square foot and the expiring rent was $13 per square foot. This asset is adjacent to our 2121 South Price Road property and we will continue to monitor market conditions to determine when it may be appropriate to start the next phase on our Phoenix campus. Shifting gears to leasing activity. Cash rents on renewal leases signed during the first quarter rolled down 3% on a cash basis, but rolled up 10% on a GAAP basis. Matt Miszewski will cover releasing spreads in greater detail in his remarks. Same-capital cash NOI was up just 0.6% during the first quarter. As shown on page three of the presentation, FX represented a 250 basis point headwind. And on a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI growth would have been a little over 3%. The same-capital growth rate was also negatively impacted another 80 basis points by a reserve related to pre-petition rent for Net Data Centers, a tenant at two of our properties in L.A. which filed for bankruptcy during the first quarter. Since filing for bankruptcy, the tenant has remained current on all post-petition scheduled base rent obligations and we received May rent yesterday. For the full year, we now expect same-capital cash NOI growth to trend toward the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but toward the lower end of the range on an as-reported basis. Incidentally, we have revised our 2015 mark-to-market guidance from slightly positive to slightly negative on a cash basis. However, this is entirely due to the early renewal of an above-market 2016 lease expiration and not due to any erosion in market rents. To the contrary, we see modest improvement in face rates and meaningful improvement in net effective rents. As you can see on page five, we believe our balance sheet stacks up favorably relative to a Blue Chip peer group. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.0 times as of the end of the first quarter, half a turn below our target of 5.5 times. Proceeds from asset sales received since quarter-end have been used to further pay down debt. We could conceivably take leverage up to six times in a pinch with a clear plan to bring it back down to 5.5. Based on our existing cash flow stream, levering up by one turn would create nearly $1 billion of borrowing capacity. Of course as we continue to grow EBITDA, the incremental cash flow creates additional borrowing capacity as well. We recently gave notice of our intent to redeem later this month the $375 million of 4.5% bonds scheduled to mature in July. We continue to believe the current interest rate environment represents an attractive opportunity to lock in longer-term capital at historically low rates. We will look to opportunistically tap the fixed income market to continue to term out debt in a prudent manner and we will evaluate U.S. as well as non-U.S. currency issuance. Turning now to the chart on page six, the pronounced drop in straight-line rent is one of the key highlights from this quarter's results. The steady downward trend in non-cash rental revenue is a direct reflection of the revamping of our sales compensation program and a more disciplined lease underwriting standards over the last year. We have not traditionally provided guidance on straight-line rent, but the average analyst estimate is approximately $75 million for the full year. We do expect a modest uptick in the quarterly run rate from the $13 million we recognized during the first quarter, but we expect straight-line rent for the full year to come in around $55 million to $60 million, well below the average analyst estimate. This will clearly have a positive impact on AFFO. The CapEx deductions in our AFFO reconciliation are also down from the fourth quarter. I would like to remind everyone of the more stringent classification of the property level CapEx we announced last quarter. I won't go into the ins and outs of the changes in classification, but for ease of reference, we have provided here on page seven the same detailed explanation we included in the deck last quarter when the change was originally announced. The bottom line is that while there's some movement in terms of geography, the change in presentation does not have a material impact on our 2014 AFFO calculation. And the primary drivers of the improvement in AFFO in the first quarter of 2015 includes lower leasing volume and the previously mentioned burn-off of straight-line rent. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to provide an update on the current datacenter leasing environment. Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Thank you, Matt. As shown on page eight of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling approximately $21 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter. We've stated for the past several quarters that there was a distinct possibility the rationalization of our available inventory, coupled with tighter lease underwriting discipline, might impact leasing velocity at some point in the future. That clearly happened in the first quarter. However, we have also maintained that our focus on profitable growth would translate to improved net effective leasing economics, highly targeted capital deployment and better overall returns for our shareholders. That prediction was also borne out in our first quarter results. As Matt noted in his comments and as you can see from the chart at the bottom of page nine, the weighted average lag between signings and commencements was less than four months in the first quarter. In addition, the average return on our first quarter leasing activity hit the high end of our 10% to 12% return expectations and was over 100 basis points better than the average for the full year of 2014. This is a reflection of both our tighter underwriting discipline and overall improved inventory management as well as the continued firming of datacenter supply and demand fundamentals. I'm also pleased to report that the second quarter is off to a strong start and we signed another $16 million in the month of April, bringing the year-to-date total to $37 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our mid-market segment contributed $3.8 million to the first quarter signing volume, which represented 18% of our total leasing activity. This is roughly in line with the recent trend, although the contribution this quarter was at the low end of the $4 million to $8 million range we have come to expect from this segment. I should pause here to point out that we revised our definition of colocation to less than 300 kilowatts to better align our sales force with our customers. As a result, you will see an increase of a little over $20 million in colocation revenue from last quarter's supplemental to the current quarter. Clearly, this is not how we intended to reach our stated objective of doubling the size of this business from 4% to 8% of revenues within a three-year timeframe. We will continue to update you on the progress towards this goal, and we are frankly a bit behind schedule. The mid-market segment has been punching above its weight, but the rest of the pie is much bigger and is also growing. The mid-market segment accounted for most, but not all of the 22 new logos we added year-to-date. We also welcomed a large new financial services customer to the fold during the first quarter. Our business mix was slightly skewed as a result, and social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for a little less than half of our first quarter 2015 leasing activity compared to 75% for the full year in 2014. New customers represented 35% of our first quarter lease signings and existing customers accounted for the remaining 65%. Turning now to page 10, the cash mark-to-market on datacenter lease renewals turned negative for the quarter as the positive cash releasing spreads on Powered Base Building renewals were more than offset by a big turnkey roll down. The primary driver of the negative turnkey mark was an early renewal of a 2016 expiration. On our third quarter call, we flagged a handful of 2016 rollovers in Northern New Jersey as the worst remaining above-market lease expirations within our portfolio. The early renewal we executed during the first quarter enables us to address a significant chunk of that 2016 Northern New Jersey rollover. You can see from the inset chart here on page 10 that while the current year expected turnkey cash releasing spread drops from negative 2% to negative 6%, the expected 2016 mark-to-market improves from negative 12% to negative 2%. This early renewal was with a large and growing customer for an additional five years beyond the 2016 expiration. There is no change to the in-place rent prior to the original expiration date and the transaction did not require any tenant improvements. While we would certainly prefer to see all of our leases roll up at expiration, this is a positive overall outcome and a testament to the strength of our long-standing customer relationships. We leased a total of 11 megawatts during the first quarter, roughly one-third of which was finished inventory although it was offset by deliveries and expirations, so the finished inventory balance ticked up slightly to 25 megawatts. Nonetheless, the balance is still down 40% since our Investor Day in November 2013. Turning now to supply, as you can see here on page 12, we saw some additional positive net absorption in the Silicon Valley market during the first quarter. You can see represented on the chart here some modest new construction underway in the Chicago market over the last 90 days, but on balance, market conditions are generally in equilibrium. The current supply environment remains rational and broadly supportive of continued gradual improvement in datacenter fundamentals. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives. Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Thank you, Matt. As Bill alluded to in his comments, we are achieving solid execution on our capital recycling initiative. We've closed on the sale of three non-core assets so far this year, totaling over $205 million and generating gains on sale of approximately $95 million. The weighted average cap rate on the two income-producing properties was 5.7%. Last quarter, we announced the sale of 100 Quannapowitt, a non-datacenter property in suburban Boston, to a regional investor for $184 per square foot at a 5% cap rate. This sale generated net proceeds of approximately $29 million and we recognized a $10 million gain on the sale during the first quarter. We also sold a vacant former datacenter in Southern California to an industrial developer for $14 million or $206 per square foot. This sale generated net proceeds of approximately $14 million and we recognized an $8 million gain in the first quarter. Last week, we closed on the sale of 833 Chestnut, a high-rise building in Center City, Philadelphia, for $161 million or $228 per square foot at an 8.5% cap rate on our 2015 contractual cash NOI. The sale is expected to generate net proceeds of approximately $150 million and we expect to recognize a gain of approximately $77 million in the second quarter. A portion of this property had been built out as datacenter, but the bulk of the tenancy was healthcare-related, a reflection of a vibrant university research and hospital cluster in the immediately surrounding area. The building was marketed for sale as a medical office building and the buyer was a leading healthcare REIT. Proceeds from these asset sales have initially been used to pay down the balance on our line of credit, but will ultimately be redeployed into our core business, primarily funding our development pipeline. We expect to earn stabilized cash yields in the 10% to 12% range on our development projects which we believe represents a very attractive spread relative to the exit cap \u2013 cap rates on our asset sales. In addition to the three non-core properties we have sold to date, we are actively marketing three assets for sale and we expect to bring another five to market as a portfolio package during the second quarter. The rest of the properties targeted for sale are currently undergoing various value-add efforts. We believe this approach will result in better proceeds for our investors, which is the primary objective of our capital recycling program. And now, I would like to turn the call back over to Bill for his closing remarks. Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Scott. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our first quarter 2015 highlights as outlined here on page 14. First and foremost, we picked up another 40 basis points of improvement in our return on invested capital followed by the 60 basis point improvement we delivered in 2014. We achieved favorable execution on our capital recycling program with the sale of three non-core assets, realizing approximately $95 million of gain on sale and generating $190 million of net proceeds, which we expect to redeploy at attractive spreads. I also want to point out here that the cap rate on 833 Chestnut was 5.8%. I believe Scott said 8.5%. So... Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Oh, did I? Sorry about that. Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer : The balance sheet remains positioned for growth with debt to EBITDA at five times. We beat first quarter consensus estimates by $0.03 and we raised 2015 core FFO per share guidance by $0.03 based on the strength of our leasing pipeline. And finally, with the remaining critical pieces now in place, the entire senior leadership team is laser-focused on execution. In short, we continue to consistently execute on our top priorities that we set forth early last year and have since updated as the way forward for our company in 2015. We believe that we have a unique, competitive footprint that can be leveraged further to the benefit of our shareholders. I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter. Once again, I'd like to remind you all to mark September 15 on your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day. And now, we will be pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thanks. I think you mentioned a few reasons for the reduced lag between signing and commencement, which is great to see. But the press release seems to suggest that it's the robust demand and the shrinking supply as part of the reason. And I want to make sure I understand that element of it. Is it that better supply and demand dynamic gets tenants to commence faster because of the competition for that space? Or is it really the other factors that you mentioned that are driving the shorter time interval there? Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Hey, Vance. I believe that you got it right. Primarily, the demand and supply characteristics are driving folks to do a few things, first of all, to make commitments a little bit earlier than they had before, but also to make sure that they're deploying those ideas in a faster way as well. So that reduced supply and that increased demand that our customers are feeling across the datacenter industry is really helping to reduce that lag. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then for my follow-up, on the 833 Chestnut sold post the quarter, I understand that it was non-core. But do you have a feel for how much of the upside from the building was left on the table? In other words, the 5.8% cap rate based on this year's expected NOI, was it your impression that those numbers were going to grow in 2016 and beyond given the vibrant nature of that market as you describe it? Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : It would grow a little bit in 2016, there's some free rent that's going to burn off, so you have contractual bumps in all of that. There'd been a big expansion from the hospital there which really took up the bulk of the vacant space here, so there's a little bit of upside left there, but really to a large extent, the building was pretty well stabilized. Operator : The next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Yes. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about M&A, there's been quite a few transactions happening in this space. Earlier comments that were made seems like you guys are looking to grow your colocation business even faster. As you indicated, you feel like you're a little bit behind. So just kind of curious whether M&A is a solution to this? Or whether you still think you can build it organically to hit your target? Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. As you can imagine, we see all the transactions that are out in the marketplace and we look at and evaluate all of them. We try to judge them by their strategic fit and value to our company as well as whether they represent an attractive investment for our shareholders. We'll continue to judge all future opportunities that way. And certainly, we'll look at every M&A opportunity that's out in the marketplace. Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : And Tayo, this is Matt. So in terms of whether we see the growth on the colocation product in inorganic or organic, we see a significant amount of potential organic growth, and so that certainly frees the rest of the company up to make smart decisions on the M&A front. Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then just one follow-up on that point, I mean I assume you guys saw all the transactions that have happened or are going to be happening. Is there anything thematically that made any of those \u2013 that made all those acquisitions unattractive to you? Was it really pricing, was it really the product mix? Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. I think generally, if you look at the transactions that have occurred to date, they haven't had a great strategic fit, and we can look at Cervalis as one. It was concentrated in the Northeast, had a lot of financial services customers there, both of which we have a great deal of exposure to between the geographic exposure in our portfolio as well as financial services firms, so it didn't really represent a strategic opportunity for us. Operator : The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation and available capacity. I know that during, Bill, your prepared remarks and Matt, yours as well, you talked a little bit about inventory. I think you mentioned 25 megawatts of available capacity. But you also mentioned that you had built out or were in the process of building 12 megawatts in four markets, which you identified for us last quarter as markets that you'd be willing to speculatively put capital into, Silicon Valley, Chicago, northern Virginia and Dallas, and that now, 90% of that capacity was leased. So maybe if you could just kind of bring us up to date on your willingness to add speculative capacity to certain markets. And with, I guess, 1.2 megawatts of available capacity from the construction pipeline in those four markets, maybe some perspective on those four markets in particular. Thanks. Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Jonathan. We try to stay ahead of demand in the markets where we have great visibility on demand. And so, I think you can see us adding a new shell in Northern Virginia. In fact that's under construction right now. We have a site in Singapore as well. It's a redevelopment site. And that will hopefully be delivered by the end of this year or early next year. And so we, as I said, we have good visibility and \u2013 because of the partnership that we have with our clients and we try to match their demand around the world. Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : And, Jonathan, in the other core markets, we see continued demand, but the uptick of space and demand in Dublin in particular, as well as Amsterdam in Western Europe, become interesting targets but the four that we named really are the priorities with Singapore coming up right up behind it. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. I guess as a follow-up, I'm going to ask a different question, but is there a special dividend coming given all the gains on the asset sales? Thanks. Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance : Yeah. Hi, Jonathan. This is Matt. I mean we'll evaluate the dividend as we move through the year. But right now, we're not projecting any special dividend at this time. And we'll evaluate it once we get a little through the year and some of the additional dispositions come to fruition. Operator : The next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. When I look at the first quarter GAAP new lease revenue signings, call it $20ish million, I know you cited that you had an increased focus on return on invested capital. But is that really any different than the focus that you had in, call it, the second half of last year when you were doing, call it, almost double that leasing activity? So I guess I'm just sort of wondering, did anything change in terms of getting even more conservative? Or did everything that you've been sort of working toward the last year start really sort of clicking in a bit more in the first quarter? Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Thanks, Ross. You made the room laugh because I'm the only liberal in the entire organization, so I'm hoping that it didn't tip to being more conservative. In essence, the question you're asking is, is there something that's different in the fundamentals, are the fundamentals potentially weakening? I really and truly believe that that's not true. You saw some of that conviction come through in the revenue-based beat and raise that we put out, but even more importantly, the discipline \u2013 the conservative nature of the discipline we do now have has led us to close deals when they're right for Digital Realty and not simply right for the calendar. And so, I'm thrilled that in April we were able to close an additional $16 million in GAAP, bringing the total around $37 million. And I am actually looking at my phone because there's an additional $2 million in GAAP that's in processing right now. So April was another sign that there is significant strength and that strength continues in the market. In addition, I was comfortable, as comfortable as I can be, raising guidance on our incremental revenue from speculative leasing based upon the progress that the team has made to date as well as that shortened lag time between signings and commencements, getting it down to about 3.7 is impressive. I'm thrilled to say that so far in Q1, we've improved that lag number even better. In addition, we've got some better visibility into the year, so I'm able to make that commitment and be comfortable raising guidance on incremental revenue because of that visibility. So the team has been \u2013 would I like the Q1 new lease signings number to have been stronger? Certainly. But the team has been successful in shrinking inventory, having 100 basis points improvement on return on invested capital for Q1 as opposed to 2014, and continuing to burn off the old incentives program and lowering straight-line rent I think are some great metrics that show some strength in this industry. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And as a follow-up, I just wanted to talk a little more about colo versus wholesale, and I don't want to take \u2013 steal the thunder from your Investor Day this fall, but it smells a little like, Bill, you're thinking about making a significant strategic shift here in moving the company away from being sort of a more traditional plain vanilla wholesale player into a datacenter company that's a little more, I'll call it, vertically diversified, if you will, am I going too far that it smells like this is a pretty big strategic change you're thinking about? Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Well I mean we haven't been 100% wholesale for a while, not since we bought 365 Main. We've had a retail component to the mix, and so I wouldn't say that there's a revolution underway in the strategy. I think there could be an evolution in our strategy. Jarrett Appleby has joined us because he clearly has some deep expertise in that area. And I would expect that we'll be able to generate some additional revenue from new products and services sold to the existing footprint as well as new customers. Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : And, Ross, I think it's important to \u2013 there's a couple of dynamics that may look to be shifting. The difference in colo and wholesale is one of the shifts to pay attention to, but the new delivery methodology that we're embracing will enable new vertically-oriented solution sets and differentiated IT workloads to land inside our current facilities and inside any of our brand-new facilities with a lot more ease. Operator : And the next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. We've been hearing more about customers coming in with a wider range of redundancy requirements, which is kind of driving greater variability in base rates and making pricing comparisons a little more difficult. I'm wondering just how much of this you're seeing within your customer base? And how it might be impacting underwriting or perhaps how you look at risk-adjusted returns? Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. So, Matthew, we have seen a number of different requirements come from our customers. Generally, when they talk about them, they'll talk about them in business terms. But the core behind it will be a difference in resiliency that in the past, we haven't necessarily been able to hit. Currently and in the future, we now will be able to hit because \u2013 not because of a new product, but because we're deploying an entirely different method as we move forward. So that new deployment methodology will allow us to satisfy our customers' needs with regard to resiliency, whether it be 2N, which is a fantastic business that we have and a fantastic business that we will have going forward, whether it be N+1 on certain components or even in the rare case, that it'll be an N componentry organization that we need to address. The flexibility of our new deployment methodology will allow us to do that. Now there will be some adoption timing, right, so we'd need to build out in this new way and deploy in this new way. We expect the impact to start showing up in the fourth quarter of this year and in early 2016. But it will really enable Digital to finally globally deliver what our clients want, where they want it at a value in line with their needs. And as Bill said in his comments, this is really designed to accommodate these diverse IT workloads that people are now trying to locate with different resiliency requirements, incorporate hybrid cloud in the planning as well as to allow us to address some value-added vertical solutions that we're going to be able to bring to market. So really, this provides the openness and agility that our clients have been asking from us in order to accelerate their growth. So we're really just focused on meeting customer needs. Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Matthew, if I can add to that from an underwriting perspective. We are highly focused on the different requirements that our customers will ask us, particularly you see this a lot in build-to-suits, whether that's increase redundancy or lower redundancy. And we're very focused on \u2013 do we have to amortize specialized improvements over the leased term or do we have to expect that we're going to have some capital expenditures at the end of the lease term to raise the quality level of the facility. So we're very focused on it and include it in our underwriting. Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious if currency volatility is at all impacting your investment decisions in terms of overseas development? And I guess whether we might see an acceleration in European or Asia Pac expenditures to kind of take advantage of the stronger dollar? Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance : Yeah. I mean this is Matt. In terms of the currency volatility, I mean, that's what, like we mentioned in the remarks, we're able to hedge our investments in any currency that we've deployed and we'll continue to do that, so we're looking primarily for the best investment return we can because we know that we'll be able to hedge that investment properly throughout the world as we've demonstrated, being 83% plus hedged on all our foreign assets today. So we, again, we look at it from where we can deploy capital and get the best return and because we know that we'll be able to hedge that investment properly and reduce the risk accordingly. Operator : The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. So I wanted to go back to the M&A discussion a little bit. There was a reference in the response I think by you, Scott, regarding strategic fit. And I guess I'm curious, as we think about potential investment opportunities going forward, M&A or otherwise, are you guys focused more on product and/or geographic diversity and sort of strategic changes to the portfolio? Or would it be more like the DLR we knew from years past where these were sort of bolt-on accretive acquisitions? Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. There are kind of two answers to that. So I think if you were looking at a more horizontal integration where we bought another datacenter provider that it could be a lot easier to view that as a bolt-on acquisition that might be more financially oriented, although we have to be very careful given the current valuations in the market that we're underwriting the assets that we're getting accurately and keeping in mind all the potential risks that are associated there. I think if you're looking at something that might be considered more vertical, then the discussion focuses initially a lot more on the strategy. And I think if you look at a lot of the trades that have occurred in the market, they've been regionally concentrated, maybe secondary markets, don't necessarily integrate well in our geographic portfolio or their specific assets may not match up as well. In addition to that, you look a lot at the platform and the people that are running it and how attractive are they to your organization and how well would they integrate. Lattices would be a good example of one; great asset, fits geographically, like the company, all the senior leadership team was going to leave and really didn't get a platform with that. And so, I think when you look \u2013 everyone's been a little bit different when you look at them, but there hasn't been a really great fit in those sorts of companies that have come to market. And so, it's been more of that than really a valuation argument so far. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. As a follow-up, I guess, for Bill, I mean, how important is accretion today in an investment opportunity given sort of where you are positioned today or how you may want to be positioned as you look at opportunities? Does it have to be FFO accretive? Or how should we be thinking about it? Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer : We certainly have a strong preference for investments being FFO accretive. We obviously would look at efficiencies that could be achieved, both on the operating side and the capital side, but we do believe that any investment we make for our shareholders should be accretive. Operator : The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi, guys. Just want to go back to the conversation about some of the more flexible deployments that you're going to be offering in the future here. So I think there was an expectation of some product being available in the third quarter. Just curious if there's anything that you can share with us in terms of demand for that product, if there's any marketing going on yet in terms of what you're going to be offering the market and just how that's being received. Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah, Vince, so a couple of things. We did business requirements gathering on the front side of what I won't call product development, but is a new deployment methodology that we have. So we met with our customers early to figure out if there was a significant amount of revenue on the table that we were missing. And we're clearly satisfied that there was and that there would be a good product market fit for the new solutions that we're bringing to market. So we did that on the front side. And then as we deploy, similar to in software, there's a big of an agile method that we've done in order to get some proof of concepts out, some early thinking on what that design could be. That's what you heard us reference in terms of potential 3Q availability of what we would call internally a new methodology. You're going to see some of that new product hit the market before the end of the year, and then you should see sufficient amounts of it at Q4 and then moving into 2016. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And just going back to the M&A conversation, so we talked Lattices, Cervalis and why maybe those didn't fit strategically. Just curious, Telx is out there, potentially exploring options. Can you talk about the strategic fit there and how that might or might not fit? Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. I think \u2013 well, you don't know anything more about the Telx opportunity than we do. There's an article that's been written. There's nothing out there right now to address directly. I think it's reasonable to assume that there's some compelling strategic rationale around that. But beyond that, it's impossible to make any other further comments until there's something to look at. Operator : Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Matt, maybe just \u2013 so that I'm understanding this correctly, you guys did $21 million of leasing in the quarter. But if I look at your backlog commencement schedule, it looks like a lot of that is going to be commencing in 2016 and 2017, and I was wondering how you reconcile that to the 3.7 months average commencement timing? Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance : I don't \u2013 I mean, I don't think that's \u2013 we'll have to go through the details of the backlog because things shift. But like you said, the \u2013 since the average lag is 3.7 months, the majority of that leasing in the first quarter we expect to commence this year. And again, that's why we've increased the sales guidance for the year and is what's contributing to our raise in core AFFO guidance as well. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then to switch topics back to 365 Main for a second, the actual 365 Main asset looks like it's been losing occupancy for the last three years. Is there something happening there that's underlying that vacancy increase? Or is something else going on? Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : So 365 Main \u2013 first, 365 is a more of a pure play in the colocation market than we have anywhere else in our portfolio, and so there certainly is churn management that they have to do there, that we don't have to do elsewhere. We've also been very happy to see expansions coming in from the existing client base that we have at 365. And then the last piece is that with the installation of AMS-IX and eventually other Open-IX initiatives, we fully expect 365 will be able to take advantage of the new connectivity options that we have there and the new open infrastructure that we have, which will allow for new providers, new content providers that had historically not located within that facility to be able to install inside 365. So we think that while it's a little bit different than our traditional properties, we've got a pretty good plan and we're working that plan pretty well. Operator : The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I guess first on the dispositions, I appreciate with the cap rate information; we could buy back into it. But I was hoping you could tell us how much core FFO is associated with the properties that you're selling? And then you mentioned, I guess earlier on, John, about softball questions for Jarrett. And I guess I'd throw one out there. And I was wondering, Jarrett, based on where you've worked historically, or at least previously, what are some of the low-hanging-fruit opportunities you see with DLR in terms of transitioning their colocation strategy perhaps a little bit aggressively? Matt mentioned during his comments that they're a little bit behind schedule. Just curious if you see anything that you think could put them back on schedule? Thanks. Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance : Yeah. So in terms of the dispositions we've closed to date, that's impacting core FFO around $0.04 for the year, $0.04 to $0.05 in \u2013 so that's the impact for this year. And then in terms of full-year impact for what we expect to sell in terms of our total capital plan, it's around $0.07, but that obviously depends on the ultimate timing of the sales of the rest of those properties in that disposition plan. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Is that an annualized number \u2013 the $0.07, I'm sorry, is that an annualized number of $0.07? Or is that based on the timing you guys have already assumed in your own guidance? Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance : Yeah. That's the fiscal year 2015 impact, so it reflects the timing of the sale. Operator : Our next question... Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : Hey, Colby... Operator : I'm sorry. Go ahead. Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, I was just going to answer Colby's question, operator. In terms of the second part, just week three into the journey with Digital, one is from a culture side, I think the solutions are evolving. But in the theme of hockey season, go where the puck is going. I've been looking at Digital for quite a long time. And in terms of this opportunity, I'm pleasantly surprised with where the future of particularly the cloud, compute and service providers are going and where they live. So if you look at the Digital Realty campuses, these are really enabling hybrid cloud. And I think there's some great opportunities for connectivity options. I just was on a wonderful tour for the grand opening with Rackspace in the UK and seeing the capabilities there. I hope to apply the knowledge I've had over the last seven years in this space in terms of really driving some of the product engine around the solutions that we have and taking great advantage of the team we have here and the assets. So we'll definitely be working on that this summer as a team and talk about it at Analyst Day. Operator : The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thank you. It looks like you guys reduced your earn-out contingency on the Centrum portfolio by roughly $45 million in the quarter. Can you explain why this change was so large? And more generally, how has the Centrum portfolio performed the past few years relative to your underwriting? Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. Sure, John. I'd be happy to address that. The answer's a little longer than I think you're going to hope for. It really has to do with the structure of the original deal, the accounting treatment of the earn-out. And then finally, I can address the asset performance. But when we acquired the Centrum portfolio, a central component of that was we only paid for the income-producing portions of the portfolio. And so, we paid a multiple based on the EBITDA that was in place. So essentially we got all of the vacant space for free. So a big part of the negotiation was well, how do we come up with a value for the vacant space? And we arrived at this earn-out methodology, which had a three-year tail on it. And there was a calculation as to how we might pay for that additional space as it was leased. So the good part about that is you actually get all that vacant space for free. And now that that earn-out period is expiring in July, whatever hasn't been leased at that point is going to be ours for really zero basis on that within the construct of the deal. From an accounting perspective, we have to have a reserve for the earn-out. So you have to be conservative in the way you run those calculations. And you calculate your reserve based on leasing all of the space. So we had to assume that it all got leased. Well, at this point with it burning off in July, there's no reasonable expectation of any additional events that would give rise to an earn-out payment. So as a result, we were able to unwind that reserve. As it relates to the asset performance, it's performing better than when we acquired it. It's performing better than underwriting. And so we're extremely happy with the performance of it both to date and in the future. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up, can you speak to supply/demand dynamics in London and your key European markets more broadly? Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. So John, the supply and demand characteristics in London are roughly in equilibrium right now, so we're happy with the pricing position that we've got in London. Of course we just launched the Rackspace, as Jarrett mentioned in his comments. We just launched the Rackspace piece in Crawley, UK and we do have some available dirt there as well. Across the rest of Continental Europe, we see consistency with the comments that I just made with regard to supply and demand in the UK, with sufficient balance within Amsterdam, as well within France where we have a small amount of market-ready inventory left. And then a little bit of a distortion in parts of Germany where there is a little bit of excess demand and not exactly enough supply to satisfy the market dynamics there. When you push out to the edge, components of the datacenter industry, there may be a little bit of distortion out towards the edge simply because we \u2013 the datacenter industry in Europe as well as the datacenter industry in the United States haven't focused on that over the past decade, but I would expect that picture to clear up in the next five years. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I'm wondering if you can maybe help us think through the shape of the year from an FFO standpoint just as you look at what your leasing pipeline looks like, the churn that you talked about in third quarter and the more extended timeline on some of the asset divestitures. And then second, just a quick follow-up on Telx; I'm wondering if you can maybe just comment on how you view any potential risk to that relationship if that asset were to fall in someone else's hands. Thanks. Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance : Yeah. So this is Matt. In terms of the FFO outlook for the year, I mean yeah, as we noted, we overachieved on even our expectations for the first quarter. And as we noted, a lot of that was due to disposition timing as well as some timing on repairs and maintenance. So as that pushes out as evidenced by 833 Chestnut, which sold in the second quarter, along with some catch-up on some R&M that wasn't spent in the first quarter, we're looking at the second quarter as well as some additional G&A that usually comes as a result of some of the board grants that are issued and vest immediately and that usually happens annually in the second quarter. We're expecting a slight downtick in the second quarter and then sort of a hockey stick from there as all the backlog leasing kicks in and the rest of the speculative leasing that we expect to \u2013 expect to sign commences. So we're looking at accelerated back half of the year. Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : And, Stephen, with regard to your question about what that shape of the pipeline looks like, we can give you advanced look of shape of the pipeline in our Large Enterprise segment and the square footage \u2013 it seems that just about once a year, I update this, the square footage existing in the pipeline for Large Enterprise sales remains roughly equivalent to what it was about 12 months ago. But we did of course add additional streams of income, including the mid-market attack and colo products. So we see some potential improvement, especially over Q1 as we move forward. That visibility was part of what allowed us to beat and raise. And then the last piece is that with some of Jarrett's involvement, we've been able to uncover and unlock certain additional cash performance that should help us to increase revenue per square foot in the existing portfolio that we have. So the shape \u2013 if this was the State of the Union, I would say the State of the Union is strong. Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : And on the last point, first of all, Stephen, I'd like to compliment you on getting three questions in on your one question there. But the last one on Telx, we don't view that somebody else acquiring them poses a significant risk. That relationship and economics are governed under contracts and we view that as being an extension of the status quo. Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. The Digital Realty first quarter 2015 earnings conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I'm happy to report that Digital just completed another solid quarter, marked by strong execution against our core strategic objectives. I'd like to begin, as usual, with \"The Way Forward\" slide on page two of our earnings deck. We continued to make progress towards our top priority of driving improved return on invested capital. And we achieved a 20-basis-point pickup during the second quarter, building upon the 100-basis-point improvement we delivered over the previous five quarters. In terms of recycling capital, we realized a $77 million gain from the sale of one non-core property, and we are in active negotiations on several others. Scott Peterson will provide additional detail. As you know, we've put a great deal of effort into stabilizing the business and derisking the development pipeline over the past year and a half. With respect to inventory management, we have reduced our finished inventory by nearly half since our Investor Day in November 2013. And our $630 million pipeline of active data center development projects is over 80% pre-leased at stabilized cash yields, just below the high end of our 10% to 12% target range. From the current position, we believe we are in solid footing to pivot towards the next phases of growth for Digital Realty, particularly with the recent addition of several key executive-level hires, notably, including Andy Power, Jarrett Appleby and Michael Henry. I'm very pleased with the progress that the entire Digital team has made on each of the strategic objectives spelled out here. But today, I'd like to focus, and I'm sure most of you will too, on the red call-out box highlighting innovative product offerings, colocation and ecosystem initiatives. As you are all aware, just two weeks ago, we announced an agreement to acquire Telx, a leading national provider of colocation and interconnection data center solutions for $1.9 billion. We believe Telx fits squarely within the box in terms of our strategic priorities, and that is product offerings and geographic footprint are highly complementary to our current portfolio. Page three really highlights the complementary nature of the transaction. Our existing business consists primarily of meeting the large footprint data center space and power requirements of creditworthy customers. Telx's colocation business is very similar, but in smaller increments to a far greater number of customers. Over time and in select environments, if a critical mass of customer concentration is achieved, an ecosystem may blossom, which is the necessary precursor to the interconnection business or the exchange of traffic within a data center. As indicated by the bubbles on the right-hand column, interconnection represents nearly half of Telx's top line and has grown at a very healthy rate. It's important to understand here that by combining our businesses, we are creating an even more differentiated business model, with a strong, large footprint business and a solid, rapidly-growing colocation business within a truly interconnected network. In essence, we are widening and deepening the economic moat between ourselves and our competitors. There are significant barriers to growing our portfolio of either a global large footprint platform or a colocation and interconnection business, but with all three under the same roof, we believe that the sum of the parts will truly be greater than the whole. In addition, the properties that make up the physical infrastructure are almost entirely owned by Digital. This makes future growth that much more significant since we control our own real estate and the residual value from incremental growth opportunities accrues to us rather than a third-party landlord. In the long run, we believe this will further set us apart from our competitors in terms of products and services offered. Now turning to slide four, we have consistently stated that our key acquisition criteria are focused on investments that are strategic and complementary to our existing business and also financially accretive and prudently financed. We believe Telx checks all of those boxes. This deal makes strategic sense for several reasons : First, Telx is a leading colocation and interconnection business that is extremely complementary to our existing platform and is concentrated in top tier markets in the U.S. In addition, this deal allows us to obtain a robust and extremely difficult-to-replicate interconnection ecosystem in one fell swoop. The combination also sets the stage for future upside from cost synergies, significant revenue synergies and embedded growth potential from expanding Telx's offering across our global portfolio and leasing up Telx's underutilized properties in our own backyard on the West Coast. And finally, we expect to achieve these benefits while enhancing our standalone growth trajectory and funding the transaction in a manner consistent with our leverage targets. Our core competency remains providing space and power to our existing customer base. This acquisition allows us to broaden the range of customers and provide even more choice on an open carrier-neutral platform. The transaction will not fundamentally alter our relationship with our customers. But what it will do is provide them a one-stop shop where they pick and choose from the entire range of data center solutions that best fit their needs. That open platform is extremely compelling. We are focused on serving the needs of our entire customer base from enterprise customers to strategic channel partners and managed service providers who sell through to corporate enterprise IT requirements. We have a unique opportunity to provide an open environment that gives our customers a choice of varying levels of redundancy, footprint size and connectivity options. While this acquisition expands our product offering, we will, of course, remain true to our real estate roots. And we are keenly focused on maximizing the return on our existing asset base. We expect to drive higher returns on every square foot, on every kilowatt in our portfolio, by augmenting our existing product offering with a wider array of size, power and redundancy requirements and by bringing core interconnection networking capabilities to our data center campus environments around the world. In some instances, this will mean partnering with customers to enable their managed services, thereby monetizing the tremendous value of our global footprint with minimal incremental costs. Our ability to do so is unique among data center providers. We will provide a full review of how we see Telx fitting into our strategy going forward at our Investor Day in Aspen now scheduled for October 6. I look forward to seeing you all there. And now, I'll pass the call over to our Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson, for a deeper dive on our underwriting of the Telx acquisition. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Thank you, Bill. Picking up here on page five, I'd like to first highlight the attractive growth profile of this business. As you can see from this chart in the upper left quadrant, the top line has grown at over 20% compound annual growth rate and the interconnection business has grown even faster. The drivers have been volume growth along with pricing power as reflected in the charts on the bottom half of the page. We view the interconnection business as high growth and highly desirable with high barriers to entry. Top-line growth has also historically translated to growth in cash flow as demonstrated by the core EBITDA time series in the upper right quadrant. I'd like to pause for a moment to focus on the absolute numbers in this chart and to clarify a few points here. For starters, I can tell you that we underwrote projected EBITDA of $148 million in 2016, which represents 11% growth from the $133 million run rate core EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter. I would like to point out that core EBITDA excludes $22 million of non-cash deferred rent expense paid to third-party landlords in 2016. The rent that Telx previously paid to Digital will be an intercompany elimination going forward. We do intend to run Telx as a standalone line of business reporting to Jarrett Appleby. We also underwrote $15 million of cost synergies, primarily redundant corporate overhead, of which $10 million runs through the P&L and $5 million represents capitalized compensation costs. It is important to note that our $148 million of projected 2016 EBITDA does not include any cost synergies. We also have not factored any revenue synergies into our near-term underwriting expectations, although we believe the longer-term revenue synergies could be quite meaningful. The EBITDA multiple is in the eye of the beholder, but since the transaction is expected to close late this year, we view 2016 as the most appropriate time period, and on that basis, the transaction represents a multiple of a little less than 13 times. Taking synergies into account, the EBITDA multiple would be right around 12 times. The next slide on page six has received quite a bit of attention. And I would like to clarify several points. This is intended to be an illustration of the embedded growth potential from leasing existing built colocation inventory and improving utilization rates at underutilized properties. It is not meant to tie to our 2016 EBITDA projection. The concept behind this is simply raising the utilization rates for properties below 70% up to 70%, and properties below 80% up to 80% utilized, while leaving those above constant. The potential incremental revenue from reaching 70% and 80% utilization has been revised from $47 million and $75 million respectively to the $37 million and $65 million you see here on page six. I would also like to point out that the properties shown here represent a subset of the Telx portfolio. If you tally up the number of properties shown in white at the bottom of the bars, you should arrive at 15 out of a total of 20. The utilization rate for all 15 of these properties is less than 80%. In fact, the average utilization for the 15 properties shown here is 57%. Consequently, reaching 70% utilization would represent 1,300 basis points of lease-up on this subset and reaching 80% utilization would represent 2,300 basis points of lease-up. In term of our underwriting the $148 million of projected 2016 EBITDA, we've been discussing contemplates lease-up of the overall portfolio utilization rate from a current 68% to a little less than 79%. Of course, that includes the five properties that are above 80% utilized and represents approximately 37,000 square feet of new leasing. The corresponding utilization rate on the subset of these 15 properties would be between 75% and 80%, when excluding the impact of potential expansion at these facilities. Said differently, our 2016 underwriting essentially contemplates that we will achieve some but not all of the embedded growth potential represented on this slide. I would like to be clear about the corresponding capital investment. Reaching 70% utilization requires a capital investment of approximately $15 million, and reaching 80% would require an additional $25 million. Our 2016 underwriting includes roughly $45 million of expansion capital, which includes some CapEx to create additional inventory. Separately, we have underwritten a little over $30 million of recurring capital spend in 2016, which we would deduct from FFO to arrive at AFFO and which represents roughly 20% of EBITDA. I would like to point out that a significant portion represents capitalized leasing costs rather than physical maintenance CapEx. The final point I'd like to make on this slide is to note that the empty sellable square footage within the Telx portfolio is somewhat analogous to a development pipeline in traditional real estate terms and really represents their finished inventory. If you zero in on 60 Hudson, you will see that it represents most of the lease-up opportunity in the table on the right and you can see from the bar chart, it is currently 49% leased. However, almost all of the vacancy at 60 Hudson reflects expansion space taken down in January of this year. Prior to taking down that expansion space, 60 Hudson was 85% utilized. Turning to the geographic overlap on page seven, Telx is headquartered in New York and has a very strong presence on the East Coast with leaseholds in three highly strategic Internet Gateway buildings in Lower Manhattan. Telx has a direct lease with the owner of 111 8th Avenue, the third largest building in Manhattan and one of the key Internet hubs on the East Coast. Digital also has a leasehold interest in 111 8th Avenue, and Telx in turn subleases a portion of this space from us. In addition, we recently moved out of the property management office we kept at 111 8th Avenue, freeing up 3,000 square feet of prime inventory, which we expect the Telx sales force will be eager to begin market upon closing. Based on Telx pricing of 111 8th Avenue, this represents a potential $3 million to $4 million of incremental EBITDA. Just to be clear, however, this is not included in the $148 million of EBITDA we had projected in 2016, although to be fair, neither is the $4 million of capital that would be required to build out this space. Finally, as you can see from the summary performance statistics on the left-hand side of the page, the three West Coast properties are less than 50% leased. We see significant embedded growth potential from these underutilized properties in our backyard on the West Coast. In addition to the upside from lease-up, we see significant opportunity to roll out the Telx platform across our global portfolio, particularly in our campus environment. As you can see from the overlapping logos at the top of page eight, Telx has an existing presence in our campuses in Chicago, Dallas, New York and Silicon Valley. The overlap speaks to the complementary nature of the transaction, but the campus environments in Ashburn, London and Singapore, where you don't see a Telx logo, represent the most promising value proposition from the combination of the two platforms. Turning to page nine, echoing Bill's points about our real estate roots and this deal being the best fit for Digital Realty, as you know, Telx leases 11 of its 20 properties from us. In addition, Telx owns the two properties pictured here on this page. As a result, we will own outright over half of the real estate in this portfolio. The mix of owned versus leased real estate compares quite favorably relative to most other colocation businesses, and the overlap of Telx's footprint within the envelope of our buildings should help mitigate integration risk, especially relative to the underwriting risk of the unknown in a typical arm's length transaction. The customer data on the next page clearly demonstrate that Telx has effectively achieved a robust interconnection ecosystem within its portfolio. Telx is a well-diversified customer base with over 1,250 customers of whom more than 80% are connectivity-centric from within the telecom, cloud and IT verticals. In addition, while Telx's customer contracts tend to be shorter duration than our traditional lease terms, the stickiness of the customer base is highlighted by the average customer relationship of over nine years. Page 11 underscores the strategic fit by demonstrating the impact of the transaction on our existing book of business. We have publicly articulated a goal of doubling the top-line contribution from our colocation business and the Telx transaction accomplishes this objective. The combination of Digital Realty's global, large foot data center platform with Telx's robust colocation business will open avenues of growth for well over 1,000 combined customers worldwide. As outlined on page 12, the new combined entity will have enhanced scale, a diversified product mix and a stronger growth profile. Pro forma enterprise value is expected to be approximately $17 billion, and the business mix will be a little over three-quarters large footprint data center, 14% colocation, and 9% interconnection. Turning briefly to capital recycling, we closed on the previously announced sale of 833 Chestnut Street for $161 million or $228 per square foot at a 5.8% cap rate on 2015 budgeted cash NOI. The sales generated net proceeds of approximately $150 million and we recognized a $77 million gain in the second quarter. We also brought a portfolio of five non-core data centers to market during the second quarter and we have recently begun fielding initial bids. We are actively marketing an additional three assets for sale, which are currently in various stages of negotiation. We also signed a key long-term lease renewal with a single tenant in a non-core office building during the second quarter and we will likely begin marketing this property for sale at year end if the tenant does not exercise its six-month purchase option. We also acquired a redevelopment project in Singapore for $45 million. Construction on the redevelopment project is already underway and we expect to deliver the first three Turn-Key Flex data center suites by early next year. Finally, we also acquired a small land parcel in Melbourne adjacent to our existing park for approximately $2 million, although future development on this site will be subject to market conditions. We continue to believe that minimizing speculative development risk translates to healthier data center fundamentals and better returns for our shareholders. However, we are also mindful of our customers' growth needs and we are proactively investing to support their growth, particularly on our campus environments in core markets. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to provide an update on the current data center leasing environment. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Thank you, Scott. As shown on page 14, we signed new leases representing a little over $37 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for over 80% of our second quarter lease signings. Existing customers represented just over 90% of our second quarter leasing activity, and we added 16 new logos in the quarter, bringing the full-year total to 35. Our colocation segment contributed $3.7 million or 10% of our second quarter leasing activity. This was at the low end of the segment's recent quarterly run rate, largely reflecting the success we have had supporting the growth of existing colocation customers and some larger footprint requirements of greater than 300 kilowatts. You may recall that earlier this year, we revised our definition of colocation to less than 300 kilowatts, to better align our sales force with our customers. We haven't traditionally called out colocation re-leasing spreads in our earnings, but it is worth noting that the mark-to-market on colo renewal leases was up 10% on a cash basis during the quarter, and re-leasing spreads were positive on over 90% of the colocation deals we executed during the second quarter. We commenced leases totaling $65 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, a record high for lease commencements. The backlog came down by roughly $30 million as a result from $104 million last quarter to $73 million currently, which you can see reflected in the chart on the top half of page 15. The weighted average lag between signings and commencements also reached a record during the second quarter at 2.5 months, as shown in the chart on the bottom half of the page. Turning to page 16, cash re-leasing spreads were positive on Turn-Key as well as Powered Base Building renewals during the second quarter. We still have a few above-market leases scattered throughout the portfolio, but the overall mark-to-market continues to steadily improve as market rents are on the upswing and we are gradually cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. We leased a total of 21 megawatts during the second quarter, more than offsetting deliveries and explorations and generating 3 megawatts of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool. As Bill mentioned and as you can see from the chart on page 17, the finished inventory balance is down by nearly half since our last Investor Day in November 2013. We remain keenly focused on maximizing the utilization of our existing asset base, but we are also taking steps to be in position to support our customers' future growth requirements, particularly on campus environments in core markets. In addition to our land bank, our investment in shelf space enables us to move quickly in response to demand and meet our customers' needs. Turning now to supply on Page 18, the positive net absorption we have registered in our own portfolio has been mirrored in most major markets. As you can see, Houston is the only major market that registered any meaningful uptick in new supply over the last 90 days. As you may recall, we have limited exposure to Houston at less than 2% of total NOI. In contrast, Dallas and Phoenix, where we do have a more meaningful presence, both tightened noticeably during the second quarter. Face rates have yet to register significant improvement, but the supply situation remains rational in virtually all major markets. Data center demand remains robust, concession packages are firming and net effective leasing economics are continuing to trend in the landlord's direction. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Matt. We reported 2Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.30, $0.05 ahead of consensus estimates. The outperformance during the quarter was driven by a combination of several factors including : $0.02 from successful property tax appeal in the Central Region and the reversal of a property tax accrual due to the lapse of a statute of limitations in the West Region, $0.02 from the early commencement of several large leases upon completion of all landlord obligations and transfer to tenant control during the second quarter, and roughly $0.01 from delayed timing of property operating expenses, asset sales and a somewhat lighter foreign currency headwind. As shown on the next page, however, FX represented roughly a 300 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top line to the bottom line. In terms of operating performance, portfolio occupancy improved 140 basis points sequentially to 93.5% and same-capital occupancy ticked up 10 basis points sequentially to 94.8%. As a reminder, we do expect portfolio occupancy to dip in the third quarter due to a couple of known Powered Base Building move-outs in the Bay Area, before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year. As Matt noted in his remarks, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for both Turn-Key and Powered Base Building renewals during the second quarter. We've revised our full year forecast from slightly negative to slightly positive and we are encouraged by the gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio. As shown on page 20, same-capital cash NOI was up 2.8% in the second quarter, squarely in the middle of our 2% to 4% guidance range. However, it is worth pointing out that on a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would be up 5.5%. For the full year, we now expect organic growth to trend towards the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but towards the lower end of the range on an as-reported basis. I would point out that Net Data Centers, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, is a tenant at two of our properties in LA. They remain current on all post-petition obligations and have until September 21 to accept or reject their leases with us or to request an extension of this deadline. While Net Data Centers is still in the process of evaluating its options in future operations, we remain comfortable with our position. Turning now to the balance sheet on page 21, debt-to-EBITDA stood at five times at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and roughly a half turn below our 5.5 times target. As you know, we executed a forward equity offering the week before last to fund a portion of the Telx acquisition. Upon fiscal settlement, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $685 million. I would like to take just a moment to discuss the forward sales agreements. In the interest of time, I won't dwell on mechanics here, but I would like to point out that we have included a slide here on Page 22 that does provide some detail on the mechanics for those who may be interested. I would also like to reiterate that the public offering was executed by forward sales agreements for deal structure purposes. Acquiring Telx at the REIT level rather than the operating partnership level was the most efficient structure. And we were able to facilitate that structure by selling common stock through forward sale agreements. It's also worth noting that the public offering has occurred, that we've locked-in the pricing at $68 per share and net proceeds approximately $685 million, subject only to adjustments for interest and dividends paid and the forward structure does not represent an overhang on our stock. Several of the underwriters borrowed the stock from securities lenders to sell to the equity offering participants. And when the forward sale agreements are physically settled, those underwriters will simply deliver proceeds to the company in exchange for newly issued shares. To be clear, the newly issued shares will not be issued to the public. The shares will be issued to the participating underwriters who will then return the shares to the securities lenders from whom they were borrowed in connection with the public offering. Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to briefly address guidance as well as the financial impact of the Telx transaction which we expect to close later this year. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising core FFO per share guidance by $0.02. A portion of the beat during the quarter is essentially timing-related, particularly asset sales which we still expect to execute and property operating expenses, which we still expect to incur. Similarly, the property tax reversals during the second quarter were one-time in nature. In addition, G&A is trending higher than we previously expected. We also upped the long-term debt issuance assumption in our guidance from roughly $300 million to $700 million, up to $500 million to $1 billion. While we will incur additional capital carry costs, which will depress earnings in the short run, we believe it is proven to lock in long-term capital, particularly in a rising rate environment. I would also like to point out that our guidance remains standalone for Digital-only and does not include any financial impact from Telx. With regard to Telx, we tend to round out our financing for the transaction with a combination of preferred equity and bonds. We expect the Telx acquisition to be roughly 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016 and roughly 3% accretive to AFFO per share. We realize we've run long today. So, we'll save Bill's closing remarks for the end of the call. And we'll now open up the lines to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. So I guess this is my first question, Bill, you mentioned the additional uptick in ROIC by 20 basis points after last quarter's more sizeable gain, which means we're probably pushing double-digits now. How should we think about the upside going forward and do you think this metric might plateau a bit from here? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think we're actually in the low 9%s with that. We were at 8% and I think we're now at \u2013 if my math is right in my head, about 9.2% \u2013 9.5%. John's giving me the 9.5% sign here. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, pushing 10%. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Pushing 10%. That's right. And obviously, we think that the Telx deal will be [audio skip] (33:31) for the long haul. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then as my follow-up, I think there was mention of cycling through the peak vintage expirations now. Could you add any granularity there around the vintage of leases rolling off these days, how many are from the recession era and how might that play into the mark-to-mark pricing strength that you expect going forward? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : We would have to get back to you with that precise data. We don't have that right at hand. Operator : And our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Slide 18 gives an interesting overview of the supply dynamic \u2013 supply-demand dynamic. And I wondered if you could qualitatively round out the picture of how you would characterize Europe as well as Asia-Pac. And then my follow-up is just related to the CapEx that you talked about associated with filling up the Telx inventory, the $15 million and the $25 million, I didn't quite understand what that consists of. Is that sales CapEx, meaning cabinets and cages or were there other factors in there? Thank you. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : So, thanks Jonathan for the question. In terms of supply and demand dynamics in Europe and APAC, we're looking at supply and demand dynamics that are roughly equivalent to the report out that we gave last quarter in terms of the supply. The supply characteristics in London remain in balance for us. And we feel that we've got sufficient supply for us to hit the demand on both our Crawley campus in terms of land bank that we've got, as well as shell that we've got available to us in our Woking campus, as well. We continue to have significant supply available to us in land bank in Amsterdam in Europe. And in Asia-Pacific, as Scott mentioned, we recently closed on an acquisition in Asia-Pacific in Singapore, so we continue to have a considerable amount of supply to hit the needs for the demand in that region, as well. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : And then on the CapEx side, Jonathan, yeah, that consists of cabinets, cages, installation expenses and commissions (36:08) those sorts of things. Operator : Our next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jon Petersen - Jefferies: Great, thank you. I wanted to ask about the development pipeline, the size of it's down about $100ish million from where it was last quarter. Just curious about the conscious decision ahead of the Telx acquisition, just trying to kind of save capital, or whether that's you guys being more conservative than just a lack of opportunities for new development. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey John, this is Andy Power. I can speak to that a little bit. I don't think this was anything about saving capital. We kind of looked at funding the Telx acquisition on to itself and have laid out now the equity done and we'll look to go do preferred and bonds in the latter half of the year. Sitting on the Investment Committee over the last three months as a new participant, I think it's just been very focused on getting the timing of our investment as lined up as close to our \u2013 where we see demand. I don't think there was a purpose kind of preservation or capital there. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yes, Jonathan, this is Matt. In terms of development pipeline that we've got, you'll notice that we've got about 80% pre-leased in terms of developments that are happening, and we've experienced a great amount of participation in terms of reacting to demand with our just-in-time development. So we think that's working well in our favor. Jon Petersen - Jefferies: Okay. And then in terms of Telx, I'm kind of curious about the mechanics of integrating that portfolio with, I guess, some of your colocation properties is what makes the most sense. So I guess you could use maybe like 365 Main St as an example. I assume you'll be taking the Telx brand and infrastructure into a facility like that. And so, l guess, the process of doing that and realizing the revenue synergies, is it just buying dark fiber between that and the Telx facility? I'm just kind of \u2013 if you could just kind of explain how you go about integrating the Telx platform, kind of maybe you can quantify what the revenue synergies might be. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : So, first of all, a great question. First of all, we're treating it as a line of business, both as an asset or a campus, tethered into our campuses, taking their interconnection hub and connecting it to our data center campuses. And because of the prior relationship as they were a client of ours, we have that already set up in most of the markets out there. So our first stage is connecting that. The second is we've looked at the assets as a combined entity, as a line of business for the product. So for colocation and interconnection products, we want to integrate that, all our legacy colocation properties into the portfolio and productize it. And then we're going to leverage the product expertise they have in colocation and go to market around that and the interconnection and networking services. So the first step is give them basically our capability, integrate it, and then we want to launch it as we were saying on a worldwide basis in the major markets where we can add colocation to their portfolio. Operator : The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : All right. Good evening, thanks for taking the questions and also thanks for all of that additional disclosure on Telx in the presentation today. It was very helpful. I'd like to ask just about the progress really with your sort of top customers, certainly noticed that the top 20 customer list moved quite a bit, but really saw a lot of progress with some big names here, IBM, which has been sort of continued success story for you, but also LinkedIn and Oracle. I was wondering if you might provide some additional color as to what's going on with some of those big customers. Thanks. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah, Jonathan, this is Matt. Thanks so much for the question. And my team in particular looks at moving amongst those top 20 with great interest as well. We're thrilled to have IBM at the top of the list and, in particular, with regard to the workloads that we're landing with them. I talked a little bit in my prepared statements about the continued persistence of the SMACC-oriented workloads and movement amongst the top 20 is really sort of testament to the ability of Digital's great operational team to be able to provide solutions that match the needs of those SMACC workloads. IBM is a great example of that. A good deal of those workloads happen to be soft layer-oriented public cloud. Oracle also was very happy to break itself into the top 20 this quarter with their public cloud offerings as well. And on the social side, we continued to expand our presence with LinkedIn. What's great about these particular types of clients, Jonathan, is not that we get one-time wins with them, but they have a tendency to be repeat hitters and continue to grow with us, not just in one location, but in all of our portfolio assets throughout the world. So it's a great win for Digital. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Great. And as a follow-up, I'd love for you to maybe give us a little sense as to how we could connect some of the big cloud players you have in terms of the Digital portfolio of customers into the Telx business. You know, one of the numbers that really jumped out was sort of the very limited penetration Telx has to-date in terms of the cloud vertical for their revenue base. I think it was 8%. So I'd be interested to hear how you can match up sort of the Telx asset and value proposition with some of the core customers that you have in your base. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah, Jonathan. Great. It really was sort of, again, testament to the combination of these two organizations making a heck of a lot of sense. Our ability to connect the cloud workloads that we've got in terms of IC core with Telx interconnectivity is absolutely incredible. So if you look at the number, the number of customers that we'll now be able to work together with, over 1,200 customers, to take from Telx's facilities, connect them into our cloud workload, it sort of reminds folks of several of the things I've said on a number of the past earnings calls, which is the hybrid cloud environment and connecting those cloud instances with enterprises is the magic that Digital can bring. And now Digital can bring it faster and better with the combination of Telx. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : And just a bit on two concrete examples of that. If you take their network strength, Jonathan, in markets like Ashburn and Dallas, where we traditionally have folks connecting through other locations into our sites, we're going to go directly and offer that product directly into our sites into the cloud compute engines. So you get the power of what we have in power and compute engines directly connecting into our sites. Operator : The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Two, if I may. So like Jonathan, just really appreciate the information you guys provided on Telx. Very helpful. I guess, to that point, seems like there's a lot of low-hanging fruit to simply increase the utilization rates within Telx's current facilities and then, perhaps, leveraging off of some of DLR's facilities in those same markets. But when do you think you'd be ready to actually expand the Telx presence internationally? It seems like that's a really big opportunity when you could actually bring it into some of the markets that you're already in, in areas like Europe and in Asia. And then my second question, just more to the guidance. I was wondering if you could just talk about the pacing of speculative leasing. I see that it obviously increased another $10 million in terms of what you're able to write off in the second quarter. But how does that compare to what your expectations were going into this year? Thanks. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Colby, I'll take the first one on global expansion. We are looking to expand globally really in early 2016. Some of the markets that we outlined there as Phase I, London and Singapore and Dublin, are low-hanging fruit for us. And we're doing development projects in other markets. In every single data center campus now, we're building our colocation and interconnection capabilities. So you'll see that expansion start in 2016. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. And, Colby, just really quick on your second one and I'll turn it over to Andy, too. Recall that we raised guidance on leasing last quarter, and we feel real good about the remainder of the year. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Not much more to add to that, Colby. We're on track. Operator : Our next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Please go ahead. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Good evening, guys. Maybe to elaborate a little bit on the sales cycle, I think if I was reading through the release right, two and a half months maybe was the average commencement time between signings and actual commencement. So, I don't know if that was a mix issue or you're just seeing kind of greater demand coming through faster? Any color would be helpful. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. Dave, so in terms \u2013 we've had a focus on reducing the gap from book-to-bill for some time. And we certainly think we've gotten to a sweet spot. I think that the 2.5-months gap is a little bit of a mix of customers in this particular quarter. I wouldn't suggest that the 2.5 months will stay that way ongoing, but we should be in a sweet spot in that 2.5-month to three-month range. Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then maybe Andy or Bill, maybe talk a little bit about leverage and the idea of \u2013 I know you issued the equity, but not taking leverage down a little further using the growth profile of Telx here as an excuse to maybe delever and move a little faster on that side of the equation. So thoughts about the asset sale plan and leverage overall would be helpful. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Dave, this is Andy speaking. We feel quite comfortable now that we've got the $700 million approximately of equity off, pro forma for the Telx acquisition, which will likely close later in the year, we are below our 5.5 times target. Based on some of the things we've already said, we do think we're buying a very attractive business with some embedded growth in it. So it spurs some of the EBITDA which will bring us down, as well. But we think the balance sheet remains positioned for growth pro forma for the equity we just raised. Operator : The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to go back to the accretion that you talk about for Telx, the 1% on FFO, 3% for AFFO. I just wanted to clarify because you talked about a lot of different ways you can check value here, but do those numbers include any of the synergies you talked about on the cost side, the $15 million, and that presumably doesn't include the revenue synergies, but just wanted to clarify on the cost side. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Vin. The synergies that we've underwritten, the 1% and 3% to FFO and AFFO respectively, they include roughly $15 million of expense synergies, of which roughly $10 million flows through our P&L. The other $5 million is really the capitalized items. They do not include any revenue synergies. While we think the revenue synergies could be quite significant as we've already discussed, we have not included them in our underwriting for 2016 financial impact. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the sales force at Telx there, and I know there is going to be some folks leaving at the sort of the executive level. But since the deal has been announced, have you had discussions with some of the key sales guys there and have any sense about what the, you know, turnover might look like as a result of the deal? Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : This is Jarrett, they're a highly qualified team. They're very focused on their community, you know, 95% of it is in five vertical segments. Matt and I are totally aligned on, you know, going after and retaining the top talent and they seem very interested. We're going to give them a heck of a lot to sell. It's going to be a global platform and leveraging the relationships of 1,250 customers now worldwide and also giving them capabilities that only Digital can bring in that community. So, I think the leverage of the two is very, very [audio skip] (48:58). Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. Vin, we've had a great relationship, as you know, with Telx as one of our major customers and with the leadership over there being so ingrained with ours over here, we had a great relationship in the past and we look forward to continuing that relationship a little more directly in the future. Operator : The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi, thank you. Bill, one for you on this deal being a sizeable M&A transaction, particularly, the largest transaction you're overseeing since you're sitting in the CEO chair. It's easy to see the success we're seeing in the colocation and interconnection businesses in particular, and how sort of layering that up over the DLR platform would make sense intuitively. But you're also buying from a private equity smart seller, if you will. And my question is really how do you mitigate the downside? I mean, I want to straight-line the growth here up into the right, like everybody else. But I also want to understand how do you mitigate the downside risk in sort of the near-term to intermediate-term? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Well, that was obviously all part of the underwriting process. One of the things we looked at was the churn that Telx had. And it was \u2013 their customers are incredibly sticky at roughly 0.6%. And the average life of their customers is over nine years. So, while the contract duration is short compared to ours, their customers do stay with them, and that was an important piece of our underwriting in terms of looking at potential downside. We've also \u2013 I mean, Matt mentioned that the re-leasing spreads on our colo business were up 10% this last quarter, and that gives us some encouragement as well in terms of how to underwrite the rents on this business. We'd underwrite them as up 10%, I think we underwrote them \u2013 I'm looking at Scott here, probably flat. But \u2013 he's nodding. But the point is, we're seeing a lot of demand in the colo business and pressure on rents. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : And I think I would add to that, at a 68.5% utilization rate, all we have to do to protect the downside is maintain that. We have an awful lot of potential growth if we just fill up the space that's already built and available. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. And Jordan, we see our customers coming to us with a multiplicity of demands and now we're able to hit them together. So, I know it's been said before in M&A transactions, but combination of Telx and Digital is better together. We think that the value we are able to hit as one organization will increase the value to our customers and that we'll capture that value here at Digital. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And just as a follow-up to that, in terms of reporting structure, I think I heard that Jarrett, you'd be heading up the, I don't know, if with the integration or just heading up sort of the Telx within Digital. But does that include the sales effort or is that going to be managed by Matt? Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, that will include the sales effort. Matt and I are coordinating how to support global accounts. He's got some tremendous relationships. We're working through that process right now. But it is a line of business, and we want to build out the product, keep a focus on those clients and keep serving them, and I think bringing in additional assets into that portfolio capability. Operator : The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good evening guys. Scott, I think when we were going through the slide deck, you had mentioned that the numbers on page six had come down from when you had previously given them. Was there a specific driver that would bring those potential incremental revenue numbers down? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : No, nothing changed. It was in the heat of pulling everything together quickly, there was an error in the sheet, and so it was just \u2013 it was a mistake in the numbers. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then maybe more broadly on strategy, how do you manage the challenge of now offering extremely similar product to what a lot of your customers are offering, sort of a different position than this company has ever been in before? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Well, first, in terms of commitment, we are really focused on serving many of the same clients. We're very focused on the service provider community and strategic channel partners. What we didn't want to do is pivot our company in a heavy enterprise direct focus. So, we've aligned with Matt and the Telx team on really selling through and supporting their strategic channel partnerships. Colocation is very complementary to support the ecosystem, and folks need smaller footprint, so we needed the product and service capability there. But you won't see us getting in the line of business like others, moving into the managed service phase and competing with our customers. Operator : Your next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Is all of Telx's earnings going to be considered good REIT income, and are you planning on pursuing a private letter ruling to confirm what your beliefs are? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Ross, this is Andy. So, Telx has roughly 49% or 47% from colocation, equal parts from interconnection. The colocation is clear good REIT income, as is the interconnection, and we already have a private letter ruling for the interconnection. There's a small percentage of income, really fees paid on the installations that represents a couple percentages of the revenue that will have housing our TRS and offset by expenses at the TRS to minimize any tax leakage. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to confirm the financing. Your revised guidance in your supplemental talks about a $500 million to $1 billion unsecured debt deal in the second half of this year. Is that independent of the additional what, call it, upwards of $1 billion of bonds you were going to issue to help finance Telx? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So the page in our supplemental, that far right column, that is Digital-only, it has no capital or operating assumptions related to Telx. So essentially, we decided to increase our guidance by roughly $250 million at the midpoint. That incremental debt raised will be used to repay our revolver and hence we'll have a lower revolver balance and a higher percentage of fixed rate debt by the end of the year. As it relates to Telx, separate from what's on the page, the plan is the same. We've completed the roughly $700 million of equity that will close concurrent with the closing of the acquisition. The remainder will be funded with a combination of preferred equity and investment grade bonds. Operator : The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Hi, guys. I don't know if I missed this in any of the disclosures you've already released. But for 111 8th Ave, are you able to share the terms of Telx's lease or leases with Google? How much remaining term do you have? How do you view your process of retaining that space long term? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : I don't think we have that in the disclosure, but I believe with extensions in 111 8th Ave, it's roughly 10 years remaining. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Okay. Have you guys spoken to Google even for your own space, do they seem amenable to renewing those leases or is that a 10-year life there? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : We haven't gone out and try to extend it as part of this process. We made sure we're good from an assumption basis. As we move closer to that expiration, we'll obviously have to evaluate that with Google. And I think Matt has something.... Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yes. So Jon, we had had some conversations with Google when they had an interest in expanding their presence inside Manhattan. They've done that in an alternative way, so they may be a little bit more open to the conversation than they were, say, a year and a half ago. Operator : And the next question will come from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up to a previous question. But I'm interested in how you're thinking about the, I guess, the \u2013 how leverageable the existing Telx sales force is, as we think about expanding the focus to other Digital markets and how we should think about any sort of incremental sales investments there? And then second, maybe for Matt, I'm wondering if you could just talk about what the initial customer response has been to the Telx announcement and any kind of initial impact that's had on the pipeline so far, I guess, if at all. Thanks. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah, happy to answer both of those, Stephen, and if Jarrett's got some extra color, he'd be happy to add that as well. Interesting, inside the sales force at Telx, while they've been primarily a domestic organization right now, they do have an awful lot of sellers with international experience. So, we're excited about that because our intention is to take the incredible assets that Telx has and expand them, expand them internationally. And so, it's good to have some more talent. The second thing is that their vertically oriented sales force is not a regionally \u2013 only a regionally experienced sales force, so we'll be able to take that vertical experience and apply it across multiple regions both in North America as well as worldwide. Customer reaction has been fantastic. And in fact we're trying hard to keep everyone calm as we're getting towards the actual closing of the deal because people are interested in having lots and lots of conversations that we're not having until the deal closes, but I can tell you that the customer response has been fantastic. Operator : Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Bill, maybe we can follow up on the ROIC question from earlier. So, you're running at around, lets call it, 9% for phrase in (59:56) numbers, you're buying Telx at a 12 times or 13 times multiple. And I think your comment was that ROIC would actually go up on that? Maybe I'm just confused somewhere, but it doesn't seem like the math works. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey Manny, this is Andy. I can jump in and help on this. So, we're at 9.3% kind of our NOI, our cash NOI over our total gross investment book value, at first quarter, 9.5% second quarter, that's NOI, not EBITDA. When you look at our underwritten EBITDA, which we've kind of put out there of $148 million and you add back the G&A which you can get from looking at the pro forma that was in our filed 8-K, we see that investment closer to, I think, definitely north of where that 9.5%, so we see it slightly accretive to our existing return on investment. But, again, the other piece of it is we're not buying the stabilized portfolio as well, like when we deliver a development at 10% to 12%, and it's pretty much fully leased. We're buying a business which still have embedded growth and additional cash and upside to continue to grow that return on investment from the initial 20 assets in the portfolio. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks, Andy. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : That makes sense? Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): It does. Matt, just a quick question for you on backlog. So looks like you've had the numbers in 2016 and 2017 come down. Were those just commencing earlier? Why would the backlog numbers, especially in 2017, come down at this point in time? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Manny, this is Andy again. I'm getting a lot of points (1:01:38) handed off to me today, maybe this is my \u2013 because this is my first call. We had some \u2013 as part of the script, we had some early commencements. I think two tenants took \u2013 we've completed space, finished all of our landlord1 work, and we handed over the space and they took over possession early. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : But I still love you, Manny. Operator : The next question will come from Will Clayton of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, guys, thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could run us through the puts and takes of the Telx EBITDA margin and where you see the most incremental cost synergies being unlocked and how we can think about that margin as you subsequently scale the business. And then I have one more after that. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. This is Andy. So, I think the best place to start -- you can look at our pro forma that has the incremental EBITDA or you can take the core EBITDA from the 8-K and divide it by the revenue start. Obviously, on paper, the margin is going to look better because part of leases associated with their space to us get eliminated upon the transaction closing. I think we have to think about increments to it. First piece is the underwriting expense synergies, $10 million of the $15 million will flow through the P&L, so that will obviously be incremental margin enhancement off the bat. We're underwriting to deliver those for a full-year 2016 impact, so we'll work through our execution on achieving that through the end of the year and have that in place for a full year by \u2013 come December. And then on top of that, I think that there will be pretty high flow-through revenue contribution as we lease up what we see as an underutilized portfolio that has a significant amount of recently delivered space, and also as we kind of put to work some of Digital's talented team assisting on some of the West Coast assets as well. I don't have a number for you right there because we really \u2013 we haven't, in our underwriting, put a firm revenue synergy, but I think that will have a contribution to the margin as well. Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you for that color. And my second question was, can you provide some commentary surrounding the pace and the success of the capital recycling program to date? And more specifically, how we should think about the impact of capital recycling in the second half of 2015 versus 2016? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : So, I think the pace has been on target. It's been a little slower in some areas because we've pursued some value-add opportunities on a number of these projects, which are now coming to fruition; we've seen a lot of benefit on that. The Kato Road building that we leased up 100% is a good example of that. And the lease extension that we just signed for the single-tenant office building is another great example of that. So, it's taken a little longer, but I think the benefit to our shareholders has been very significant. I think what you'll probably see is that the remainder of the assets will largely be executed by the end of the year from the sales perspective. Operator : And our final question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great. Thanks. To the extent that you guys looked at Telx on an asset-by-asset basis, are you able to share what kind of cap rate or EBITDA multiple you assigned to the portfolio's key assets, specifically 56 Marietta Street, 60 Hudson Street and 111 8th Avenue? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. We didn't really look at it. I mean, we do look at it on an asset-by-asset basis, but we don't really do a full valuation on an asset-by-asset basis. We do projections, rollups for every asset in terms of generating our revenue and EBITDA projects. But we didn't really do a full analysis on each one. I will tell you on Marietta, though, we did spend a little time thinking of what the potential value of that asset might be. And you can get a very interesting array of outcomes on that, and some of which are quite impressive, to be honest with you. And hey, Jon, by the way, I want to get back to you on the 111 8th Avenue lease for Telx. It has an expiration date of 2022 with two five-year renewal options on it. So that takes you out to 2032 there. John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our second quarter 2015 highlights, as highlighted on page 23 of the deck. First and foremost, we picked up another 20 basis points of sequential improvement in our return on invested capital, following the 100 basis points we've delivered over the past five quarters. We tightened the commencement lag from 3.7 months in the first quarter to an exceptional two and a half months. The balance sheet remains positioned for growth with debt-to-EBITDA at five times. We beat the second quarter consensus estimates by $0.05, and we raised 2015 core FFO per share guidance from $5.03 to $5.13 range to $5.05 to $5.15. Finally, we made the exciting announcement entering into an agreement to acquire Telx, a leading provider of colocation, interconnection and cloud-enabling services. In short, we continue to consistently execute on our top priorities that we set forth early last year and have since updated as the way forward for our company in 2015. We believe we have a unique and competitive footprint that can be leveraged further to the benefit of our shareholders. I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter. Once again, I'd like to remind all of you to mark October 6 on your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day. Thank you all for taking the time to participate in today's call. That concludes our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Operator : Good afternoon and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John J.

William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. So let's begin on page two of our presentation by recapping the guidepost for our strategic plan that we laid out, Investor Day in Ashburn just a few weeks ago. Number one is achieving superior returns. We've always taken an investment management approach to our business and we remain focused on achieving the highest possible risk-adjusted returns at the asset level. This is entirely consistent with our emphasis on driving improved return on invested capital. And I'm pleased to report that we picked up another 10 basis points during the third quarter, bringing the total improvement since the fourth quarter of 2013 to 130 basis points. That's a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size. Next is capital allocation. We believe that we've established a respectable capital allocation track record and we plan to build on that success. In contrast to the past 18 months, we expect to be committing capital to expand over the intermediate term. We intend to expand on our existing campuses, expand in existing markets, and grow opportunistically in new markets all subject to the caveat that prospective investments must be accretive to our shareholders. We also intend to expand our product offerings. We are adapting our data center design to offer our customers a more agile solution. And Telx enables us to significantly enhance our colocation and interconnection offerings. Finally, operating efficiencies. We are keenly focused on running this business as efficiently as possible. This includes emphasizing investment on our campus environments where we can achieve significant economies of scale. We are also focused on process improvement and leveraging technology to streamline day-to-day functions. As we identify opportunities, we expect to realize significant benefits from these initiatives over the next several years. Let's turn the page to Telx. I'll begin by giving you a brief update on integration. Matt Mercier, who many of you know, led the first phase of our integration efforts through the closing of the transaction. Matt and his team led our efforts to formalize the combined organizational structure, define key business risks and objectives, identify bottom-up expense synergies while ensuring we maintain sales velocity and operational integrity, and he's done a great job for us. For that matter, the entire finance and accounting and investment teams did a great job, successfully raising almost $2 billion of capital in three separate transactions, along with underwriting and closing the transaction. The next phase of our integration efforts will be led by Chief Information Officer, Michael Henry. Michael has worked on many large acquisitions, most recently at Ericsson. His program is designed to ensure that we deliver the value we expect from the Telx acquisition, including product rationalization, go-to-market alignment and the overall customer experience. I should also add that we recently brought on an interim Head of HR, whose organizational leadership experience includes helping to guide American Airlines through its $11 billion merger with US Airways. I think it's safe to say that we will benefit from Cindy's perspective during this transformational event for our company. As you may recall, we've identified $15 million of expected cost synergies and we expect substantially all of these synergies to be realized in 2016. I know that you're all eager to see guidance including Telx and to learn more about the potential revenue synergies and how soon we can roll Telx out across our global campus network. In our view, it's far more important to get this right than to get it right now. With that said, let me outline our priorities for you in broad brushstrokes. The first order of business will be leasing up the existing vacancy within the Telx portfolio. It may not be sexy, but it drops straight to the bottom line. The next opportunity will be to turn over to Telx the pockets of inventory within our gateway buildings where they already operate. This includes space like the property management office that we previously kept at 111 8th Avenue. The next step will be to have Telx take over our existing colocation business, notably including properties like 365 Main in San Francisco, which we believe Telx will be able to operate very effectively. Next, we will turn to our domestic campus environments and look to build out a colocation and interconnection product offering on those campuses, notably including Ashburn, Dallas and Chicago. International expansion will be the final phase. Planning for each of these initiatives is already underway, although revenue synergies are likely to be realized beyond 2016. Moving on to capital recycling. We don't have much to report beyond what Scott covered at our Investor Day three weeks ago. As he said, we have seven properties on the market, shown here on page four. We expect to receive upwards of $150 million in proceeds from these properties and we expect our capital recycling program to be substantially complete by the time we report fourth quarter results. We will remain patient, however, and we will continue to close when our value-added efforts and market conditions enable us to achieve the best execution for our shareholders. Moving on to market fundamentals. As you can see here on page five, our recent leasing activity has been concentrated in our campus markets and with our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content along with financial and IT services. In addition, strategically expanding our Global Alliance program is a top priority as we invest significant resources to develop a program of world-class partners who help our clients deploy their mission-critical IT workloads and Digital Realty facilities. We are pleased to announce that during the third quarter, ClearSky Data and CompuCom became Global Alliance Partners joining our existing Technology Alliance Partners Program, including AWS, NaviSite, Rackspace, SoftLayer, Unitas Global and VMware. On a panel at a recent investor conference, I made the observation that data center demand is stronger today than it's ever been in our 11-year history as a public company. I think you've seen that momentum reflected in the recent leasing activity reported by our publicly traded data center peers and you may have also seen that we essentially hit the high end of the range for our upwardly revised speculative leasing target for the full year. Here's an interesting data point to demonstrate what I mean. Within the past five weeks, we have ordered 23 generators and have allocated 15 to projects scheduled for delivery over the next six months. Throughout the course of 2015 we've allocated between three to eight per month, so this represents a dramatic uptick in our level of delivery. Along similar lines, I am very pleased to report that earlier this week we went hard on the acquisition of a land parcel in Ashburn in close proximity to our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining Greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudoun County. It will support the development of approximately 2 million square feet in the build-out of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus. Turning to supply on page six. The big picture conclusion here is that most markets remain roughly in equilibrium and continue to gradually tighten. New supply in Northern Virginia ticked up during the third quarter, but we remain very comfortable with the leasing velocity in that market. We continue to closely match our new starts with customer demand and we continue to enjoy great success at healthy returns in Northern Virginia. Sublease availability in Silicon Valley continued to contract during the third quarter. Our view is that Silicon Valley has tightened considerably, consistent with third-party market commentary. Finally, let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. Global economic growth has clearly decelerated over the past 90 days and monetary policy remains very accommodative. In addition, much has been written recently about a potential slowdown in the tech sector. From where we sit, however, the rumors of the tech-wreck coming back to the future have been greatly exaggerated. For starters, cloud businesses appear to be some of the fastest-growing segments within the established, publicly-traded tech companies. In terms of a slowdown in the IPO market, it is certainly not uncommon to see a disconnect between public and private real estate market pricing. REITs periodically traded wide premiums or discounts to the underlying value of their portfolios and it doesn't seem unreasonable for private market valuations for tech companies to occasionally decouple from public market pricing. Valuation aside, however, one key difference is between the years 2015 and 2000 is that companies driving the Bay Area economy today have very legitimate business models, are generating significant cash flow and the drivers of the digital economy landing in our portfolio generally have very solid balance sheets with lots of cash and little or no debt. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our own financial strength. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Bill. As we pre-announced at our Investor Day, and as shown here on page nine, we signed new leases representing just under $33 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for over 70% of our lease signings during the quarter. Existing customers represented over 85% of our third quarter leasing activity and we added 16 new logos in the quarter bringing the full year to a total of 51 new logos. On page 10 you can see the weighted average lag between signings and commencement tick backup to 5.4 months during the quarter from the record low of 2.5 months in the second quarter. This was primarily due to limit a remaining finished inventory on the shelves. Going forward, you should expect to see this measure hover around the historical average of about six months. Turning to page 11, cash releasing spreads were positive across property types for the third quarter. In-place rents on the lion's share of our leases are now below market although we do still have several remaining above market leases notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix and individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter. On balance, however, we believe we have reached an inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by market rent growth along with the steady progress we have made cycling through peak finished lease expirations. Turning to our financial results on page 12, we reported 3Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.32, $0.05 ahead of consensus. The outperformance during the quarter was driven by a combination of a few items including a large property tax refund in the west region. This refund maybe one-time in nature, but it reflects the operational excellence of our proactive portfolio management approach. In addition, the current year contribution from speculative leasing was ahead of plan, foreign currency translation represented a bit less of a headwind than expected and we did get a slight benefit from delayed timing on asset sales. I would also like to point out the continued improvement in AFFO per share growth, specifically the non-cash straight-line rent and FAS 141 adjustments, both continue to trend down and our recurring CapEx spend was also down significantly this quarter. The lower recurring CapEx during the quarter is partially explained by seasonality, but in general, these trends reflect the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past year and a half as well as consistently improving data center market fundamentals. Please note that the AFFO includes $11 million of Telx transaction costs. Excluding these transaction costs, AFFO would have been $1.10 per share and our payout ratio would have been below 80%. The bottom-line is the quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating. In addition, FX continues to represent roughly a 300 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top-line to the bottom-line as shown on page 13. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising 2015 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. The upwardly revised range represents roughly 4% growth at the midpoint on our as reported basis and approximately 7% on a constant currency basis. I should point out here that our bottom-line FFO per share forecast includes the expected contribution from Telx, whereas the individual substance underlying the guidance reflects standalone results for Digital Realty only. Please keep in mind that the Telx transaction just closed in early October. We are comfortable raising guidance while absorbing Telx into our financial forecast. We expect to give formal 2016 guidance early next year, at which point we'll provide greater visibility on the impact of Telx on our combined operating performance metrics. In the meantime, I can confirm that we still expect Telx to be roughly 1% accretive to core FFO per share in 2016, and roughly 3% accretive to AFFO per share. In terms of Digital Realty's third quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy declined 90 basis points to 93.9%. As we stated for the past several quarters, the occupancy drive during the quarter was anticipated and we do expect occupancy to bounce back and finish up slightly by the end of the year. The occupancy decline was due to a few known power-based building move-outs, which impacted our tenant retention during the quarter as well, but I'd like to take a moment to provide some additional color on these non-renewables. In our experience, data center customers have a high propensity to renew unless their core business undergoes a material change and provided they've taken occupancy for their space. The two largest non-renewals during the quarter have both been targets of M&A activity and neither had occupied the space for years. In addition, a significant portion of the space that was technically not renewed has either been a re-lease to sub-tenants or is currently under LOI to be re-leased. Also shown on page 13, same-capital cash NOI was up 2.2% in the third quarter. On a constant currency basis, same-capital's cash NOI would have been up 4.5%. For the full year, we continue to expect organic growth to trend to the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but towards the lower end of the range on an as reported basis. I'm pleased to report that we are on the cusp of a happy ending to the Net Data Centers bankruptcy. As you may be aware, Net Data Centers completed sales of East Coast operations last week, clearing the path to emerge from bankruptcy. Net Data Centers has elected to assume all of their leases with us in downtown Los Angeles and El Segundo with no change to the in-place rents. They've remained current with us on all post-petition obligations throughout bankruptcy, and the only amount outstanding is roughly $1 million of pre-petition rent, which we have fully reserved. We expect to collect on the pre-petition receivable and reversed the reserve during the fourth quarter, which should represent upside of approximately $0.01 per share. We mentioned at our Investor Day that we had begun the process of recasting about $3 billion of global credit facilities. I'm pleased to report that we have over $4.9 billion of commitments to the credit facilities today, including more than $300 million of commitments for a new seven-year term loan. We expect to tighten pricing and lower the cap rate used to value our portfolio for calculating total leverage and unsecured leverage under the loan covenants. As shown on page 14, we expect to extend the maturity for the line of credit and the five-year term loan out from 2018 to 2021, and the new seven-year term loan would be scheduled to mature in 2023. We anticipate closing these facilities early next year. As you can see from the left hand side of the page, pro forma for the recast credit facilities, we have very modest debt maturities through 2019 with no more than $200 million coming due in any of the next four years. In 2020 and beyond, maturities should likewise be manageable with a well-laddered schedule. I would also like to note that we reached a milestone during the third quarter, with $1 billion of annualized adjusted EBITDA. Leverage dipped below five times as of September 30th, although we have since issued additional debt to finance the closing of the Telx transaction. Nonetheless, we expect to end the year below our target leverage of 5.5 times with the balance sheet positioned for growth. In summary, we just capped off another very busy, but very successful, quarter and we are focused on maintaining our current momentum through the end of this year and into 2016. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. My question is regarding production and general leasing. So volume, which you disclosed to us at the time of the Investor Day and we've obviously received over the past couple of quarters, has obviously reflected a little bit of a lighter inventory as you guys have aimed to lease it up and do more profitable deals. But I guess, as you're integrating Telx, and I know it's early days, I'm curious about what a realistic leasing or production number may look like on a go-forward basis relative to legacy Digital. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Thanks for the question, Jordan. This is Matt Miszewski. So, we would anticipate \u2013 and we're in the midst of actually baking the sales plan numbers for 2016, but we would anticipate similar results to what we've seen on a quarterly basis for the core DLR facilities and product sets with a slight uptick depending upon which region we're talking about and then a slight uptick with regard to the combination with the Telx inventory that's out there. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. But you wouldn't yet venture a guess in terms of what sort of growth, either top-line or on a quarterly basis, we should anticipate from a... Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : No, I wouldn't expect that. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : I wouldn't hazard a guess. And we'll make those comments in the next quarterly results. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Jordan, the plan is to have an announcement shortly after the first of the year where we will lay out the guidance for next year. That will include the assumptions for Telx as well as Digital. Operator : The next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. I was hoping you could talk us through how you're contemplating positioning the existing mid-market or colocation business as you think about consolidating Telx. There's clearly a meaningful pricing difference in that area versus where Telx space is being sold. And I'm just curious, as you contemplate your go-to-market for next year, how that product is going to be positioned with customers. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Matthew. Actually, it's a fantastic combination of the resources that we have currently in place in terms of the mid-market attack that we've been under for the last few years. And if you think about the new product set, it's okay to think about it in the following way as we get these definitions out into the market. The Telx facilities that we have and the Telx products that we have really satisfy a very concrete set of defined products fitting into that 0 to 300 kilowatt range, and then they have specific service levels that are attached to them. If you think about the mid-market approach, the sweet spot for the traditional mid-market team in Digital Realty has been between that 300 kilowatt space and 1 megawatt space for our clients. We're certainly in the middle of doing a branding exercise, but right now we've got a major product that we've had historically, called the Scale product, at about 1 megawatt and above. If you think about that 300 kilowatt to 1 megawatt space as a mini-scale as opposed \u2013 we're not finished with that particular product definition yet, but mini-scale or mini-wholesale, you'd be on the right track. So we'll be able to take advantage of the mid-market team that we fielded for the last year and a half, as well as a traditional Scale team that I have and the Telx team will fit right perfectly inside of our portfolio. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then just one for Andy, if I may. Talking about the increase in the signed to commencement lag up around five months, and I guess the expectation that we kind of stay at that level. You had been talking about an improvement in that area driving improvement in the straight line rent, in the pass-through to AFFO. As we think about our model, should we expect any change in that area going forward from the higher commencement lag? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Matt. So we ground that stat down as low as probably possible from a business perspective at 2.5 months. And it's really a product \u2013 you usually have to have a finished data center to go from a sign to commencement in that timetable. I think the more natural spot for that is closer to six months. I think you're going to see our straight line rents are non-cash and 141 suffering right around where they are today. I think the other more meaningful part of that is not giving ramps upon commencement, meaning customers take over 100% of their space the day they commence their lease versus staggered commencements which results in a straight line rent adjustment and a gap between the cash and the gap. And we're continuing to push that and that echoes back to the underwriting discipline that's been instilled here over 1.5 years. So I don't think that stat's going to be changed based on this time to commencement. Operator : The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good evening. Hey, Bill recognizing that the ink isn't dry yet on the Telx deal and you've got another one to chop there, but interactions out there with other dance partner. Any thoughts on what you might do next? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : What we're going to do next is integrate Telx. And I just want to repeat what I said in the remarks, Bill. Our highest priority is to successfully integrate this $1.9 billion investment. And so the focus is for the next two months on achieving the operating synergies and then rolling out through 2016, the revenue synergies. As far as additional inorganic growth, the criteria is as we've always stated, or as we've stated at least for the last 18 months which is to say we want anything we do to be strategic and complementary, and to be financially accretive as well as prudently financed. Yes... Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I was going to say given the recovery in the stock price, the valuation there, does that change at all your thought process on uses of capital? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : No. It doesn't. I mean if you think about Digital's history, we've been an acquirer of real estate and a developer of real estate. This is really our first major acquisition of an operating platform and we want to make sure that we do this right. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. And just add to that Bill, Scott here. We do keep tabs on everything that's going on in the marketplace and we're abreast of everything. But we don't want to lose sight of what our target is right now and that's getting Telx integrated properly and growing it within our platform. Operator : The next question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. You mentioned the plan to commit capital and grow in new markets. Could you comment on the need to build out the sales force in certain markets post the Telx acquisition? What's the rough magnitude that we're talking about there and what's the potential timing? Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Vance. This is Jarrett. We are in the process of reviewing their full pipeline and the customer. They've a healthy funnel in place. We will ramp up some level of resource and some market caps we've identified. But I think it's in the magnitude of five to 10 people, and to continue to grow. And again, you traditionally see some level of folks churn in your sales organization. So, I don't see any significant sales investment. All the underwriting was really consistent with what we did as part of the acquisition and the diligence we did. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : And Vance, across the whole sales force, we do expect to see some interesting dynamics where the efficiency of each one of the assets that we have on both of the sales teams would be able to enhanced by the mere existence of multiple products. So we're excited about that and that does deaden the need for us to hire additional staff. Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great color and then for my follow-up. Could you bring is right up to date on dispositions. How many are under negotiation, how many under contract and then what's the timing for bringing them through to fruition? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. I think the disposition program will be largely done by the end of the year here. We currently have one under contract that's going to close soon and we're negotiating a contract for others right now and then we've got a couple others that we are working on, just some value-add better sales outcomes projects on and so we hope to make some good progress on that shortly. Operator : And the next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. So, a quick question on Telx, and as you think about potentially growing that platform outside the U.S. into Europe, and I wondered your interest level in purchasing divested assets not platforms, but individual assets in case anything were to become available as a result of the pending merger going on over there between Equinix and Telecity. And then, on the different data center design that you talked about, if you could just sort of give us your updated thoughts on what the implications are on yields that you hope to achieve in cost to develop as a result of the new design? Thank you. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah sure. So the first part is European assets \u2013 individual assets that may come for sale. We've got a long consistent history of acquiring assets like that; certainly keeping our eyes open and see anything that may come about as a result of that pending merger. We also are looking at some select individual assets out there as well. You know obviously, we try to maintain all of our principles as it relates to that, whether it's with respect to individual assets. We want them to represent good value to our shareholders and they have to be assets that fit well within our existing platform or portfolio, but to that extent, we'll keep an eye on everything that becomes available there. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And Jonathan on part two in terms of the new design, I think there's two components. One, we did see an opportunity to really open up more opportunities. So the first thing was more agility to drive service levels and innovate the product. So in terms of the return profile, I think we're just looking that we'll cover more of the market, particularly in the M+1 design or the different SLAs associated with that product and the yield implications. And it also gives us ability to serve and not strand power for denser power solutions for those verticals and social, mobile, analytic, cloud and content. But again, our goal is to provide that high value to our clients and sell at the market rate which is what we're really focused on is serving those clients at the market rates. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. As we start to factor Telx into our model, I was hoping you can give us an update on what Telx's third quarter revenue EBITDA were, so we can start to think about that correctly? And then also, you did lower your, I guess, NAREIT-Defined definition of FFO. Obviously there're some puts and takes there from the Telx transaction, but I was wondering if you could just walk us through what happened there and how that should perhaps change as we go into 2016? Thanks. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey Colby, it's Andy here. So we literally closed the transaction October 9th, so we've gotten preliminary read-outs on the numbers, but obviously we haven't had our team go through and scrub all the financials and get to a comfort level and we want to tell the public markets where we're coming out. Preliminary view is that that they're on track from a revenue and EBITDA standpoint. Nothing is changing with our expectations for underwriting for 2016 or pacing. We did commence literally in conjunction with the closing, we commenced the execution of our synergy plan. We had a handful of executives depart on that day. We entered into transitional agreements with a handful of executives throughout the end of the year roughly and we've commenced on the rest of the expense plan which is expected to be done with and deliver on those synergies before the end of the year. That leads me to your second question. NAREIT definition doesn't add back the transaction expenses. So we will have transaction expenses associated with Telx and including severance they'll run through the P&L in the fourth quarter. Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: And do you expect those costs to be done as we go into the first quarter, or could there be a little bit of bleeding into the first quarter as you relate to those things as well? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : I think most of them will be done in the fourth quarter, the large majority of it. Operator : Our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Hey Bill, just want to go back to your comment about the demand being as strong as you've ever seen it, you mentioned the generator example. But I was just curious your development CapEx guidance did come down relative to prior. Just curious if you could provide some commentary on what was driving that? And then I have a follow-up. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, that's basically timing, Vin. The generators are a leading indicator and we would fully expect that the CapEx guidance will increase next year. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So... Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : This is Andy, just before you ask your second question. It's just a timing thing when you release shelves, when you spend the money to construct. So we basically release the shelf a little bit later, so the bulk of dollars are going to bleed into the next year versus this fiscal year. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. By that, do you mean so if it was $750 million to $850 million before, if you have a similar level for next year, does that mean we'll be sort of in the $1 billion-ish range just to make up for some of the timing? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : I think it'll be closer to the high end of what we've put out in Investor Day, plus or minus $50 million. Operator : And the next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Great, thanks. Actually just wanted to pick up on development spending for next year. Obviously, it sounds like you guys are going to be more aggressive in terms of committing capital to expand, but to do that, does that mean you're going to increase the amount of spec development in the pipeline? Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I don't think so. I mean we're signing a lot of leases right now for space that doesn't exist. So I think you're going to see a decent amount of pre-leasing percentage on everything that we develop next year. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Okay great. And then, just one point on guidance that I'm a little bit confused about. So in terms of the long-term debt issuance, you're still saying $500 million to $1 billion. I know you did $500 million in June and then another $950 million which I assume gets put in with Telx, not part of this guidance. I'm just trying to figure out between now and the end of the year. Are we still expecting another debt deal? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : So the table on page 10, all of the assumptions from the slightly positive renewals down to timing on the debt, are all standalone, do not include Telx at all. So you don't see $1.9 billion acquisition, you don't see the $250 million preferred, you don't see the $740 million of equity or nor the $950 million of bonds. We are factoring the impact of Telx in our end results here. So we really think we'll achieve this core FFO per share including Telx for two-and-a-half months in the results. But the financings do not include it. We've completed $500 million of debt this year with a green bond. We're still evaluating the potential Eurobond before the end of the year. Now there's only so many weeks to the end of the year, so that may roll into next year. Operator : And the next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Andy, if I look at your \u2013 sort of combining two pieces, your revised guidance as well as the walk to consensus, the $0.05 beat, I would think that the FX would probably replicate itself again in the fourth quarter. So was just curious why the top end guidance is going up less than the $0.05 that you beat by in the quarter, especially with FX repeating again. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Manny, the reason it's not up higher is that we're factoring a couple of cents, maybe up to $0.05, of potential dilution from Telx for the fourth quarter. That's not for 2016. Remember, we literally closed on 9th. Our assumptions for Telx 2016 include synergies being executed. We're working through that plan, but those individuals are still on the books. We have not consolidated our office space and haven't achieved some of those expense synergies. And it does include some of the underwritten growth, so there is some dilution, a couple pennies from Telx that brings down that high end. Does that make sense? Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sure. And then if I turn back to the commentary on commencement timing. Does that mean that you're going to have less take-up of the pre-stabilized space as you develop more new space and that's why you're going to six months? Or is it just that new space magnitude-wise is just so much bigger than the stabilized space or the pre-stabilized space that will be leasing? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : I hope we don't have less take-up of the pre-stabilized stuff. That stuff's already standing there, so it should be easier to attack from a leasing standpoint. And we're very focused on that in our sales discussions in our investment committee. I'm just saying that 2.5 months was a very low time from sign to commencement and feels like from looking at the business over longer time period when you don't have lots of standing finished inventory, six months is a closer amount to a regular time period. I think Matt wants to jump in and give more color as well. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah, Manny, thanks for asking a question to Andy that made him give me a cursed look. Our focus on the pre-stabilized space remains intent and I would say laser-focused as we've been saying around the table. And the history of the folks in my organization are such that that pre-stabilized space has become a pretty profitable target for us, so we're going to keep focused on it. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC : (43:02) in the prepared remarks, but could you give us a sense \u2013 you know what is out there that might be over market that's still in the portfolio that might need to be marked down, maybe magnitude or just some sense as to that. And then I'd like to circle back to a question I had asked last quarter and just sort of get an update. But you guys have the opportunity to host the big cloud platforms from a large footprint perspective, but also really drive connections within the campus environment to the enterprises, obviously something enhanced through Telx. But I'm just wondering in terms of seeing the demand for enterprise to cloud, cloud to enterprise, seeing that develop, if you have any update or perspective on where we are in the cycle. Thanks. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : So, Jonathan, I think your phone might have been on mute for the first second when you chatted, so maybe just make sure we answer your full question. On the mark-to-market piece, two examples are Northern New Jersey, where we obviously have a heavy concentration of financial services. A lot of activity that would happen on the backs of the financial crisis where there was a very tight supply market and we delivered and signed pretty great leases. And in that tight market, some of those leases have rolled down historically and there's onesie, twosies in that market to come. Another example is in Phoenix, off the top of my head, where we bought a portfolio. And when we bought the portfolio at the time, it had an above-market lease. We underwrote that, we factored that into what we paid the seller of that portfolio. And there's a lease or two in that market from that portfolio acquisition that will come through in the next year or two and roll down. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : And, Jonathan, this is Matt. The answer to your question on big cloud platforms and driving connections, that's exactly the strategy that we've been looking at executing before the Telx acquisition, but the Telx acquisition just makes it that much more crisp. We've been having conversations \u2013 Jarrett and I have been having conversations with most of our major customers and all of the major cloud providers in the space. And very specifically, we've started to see an interest on their side to not just land the large cloud compute loads in our facility, which we've become expert at, but also making sure that there's available colocation space right next to that at extremely low latency and providing some direct connect facilities so that they can connect securely as well as with low latency. So we're seeing increased demand, not just for the large cloud workloads to continue to land in our space, but to have those enterprise clients land right next to them in colocation space. In fact, I'm proud to announce that just late last night we were able to land another major cloud provider in our Chicago facility and that conversations have begun on just that structure. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : And just to build on that, Jonathan, I think what's really unique I think the industry is out there a lot with these cloud on-ramps and providers who are really going after the enterprise are providing cloud or managed services. What makes us really unique and different is our focus on the foundation and partners for the Scale. And we're seeing larger enterprises deploy right next to the compute engines and directly connect. So that is very much a unique pattern which makes us very compatible with partners who are focusing on the enterprise side of the business. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Bill, if you could, you mentioned the last five week statistic where you've ordered significant number of generators. Could you expound on that a little bit? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : We've only ordered the generators, Jordan, because we have clear visibility into the demand, which is to say that Matt's team has been busy signing leases, a decent amount of which has occurred at the end of the quarter so it's October business rather than September business. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay. That's fair. But it sounds like essentially it's correlated or related to a spike in leasing activity. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Perfectly correlated. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay. And then we've danced around the mark-to-market a little bit. But do you have a sense for what the mark-to-market looks like for next year? I know Andy just laid out the Phoenix one that could expire or mature in the next year or two. But if you're looking at the portfolio for next year, does it look like a positive mark overall or is it flat? How should we think about that? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Jordan, so we're still going through budgets for next year to give you the most up-to-date data. We're looking at the numbers, it looks like it's around flat across the entire portfolio. We're trying to push it into the positive territory. But these one-off exceptions which have reasons to it, not due to anything other than being a site of preference (48:43) or something we underwrote that are driving the down piece of it. So you're going to get a full picture when we put out our guidance at the beginning of next year. Operator : The next question will come from Will Clayton of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks for the question, guys. I was just wondering, as you work through the four-stage strategic priority list on Telx, how should we think about the timeline capital intensity profiles and margin impacts of these different stages? And what are the targets or metrics that we should use to kind of hold people accountable for executing on strategic objectives? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Will. This is Andy. So out of the gates what we said before and what we continue to plan to deliver is essentially $148 million of EBITDA from the 20 Telx locations; $15 million of expense synergies, $10 million of it roughly flowing to the P&L. We expect to meet or outperform at all those metrics. Capital intensity, recurring CapEx associated with that 2016 plan is 20%-ish of that EBITDA. There's a little bit more of expansion CapEx outside of that. But obviously the expansion CapEx will have a massive EBITDA contribution in 2016. Anything beyond that we view as a revenue synergy, which we're putting and doing a lot of work towards and continue to develop throughout 2016; and we think it will be a small contributor to 2016. And those are the examples that we've outlined before and some of which on this call, be it bringing Telx to Ashburn domestically, expanding their presence in some of our Internet gateways, tethering in certain assets, or eventually bringing the Telx product of colocation or connection to our international campuses such as a Singapore or a London. But I would say that's a more \u2013 we'll be doing a whole lot of work on that in the next 12 months to 18 months. But I don't think you'll see a ton of capital intensity or a ton of EBITDA contribution during that time period. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah, Will. Scott here. To help you out a little on that, if you look at the different stages of the priorities, they go from an ease of execution, but if you also look at them they go from a higher initial gross margin business and a lower capital intensity. So I think you see the initial stages will have better impact than the more capital-intensive, longer lifecycle later stages. So that's a good way to think about it. Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And I was just wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about what you are noticing in terms of industry fundamentals today. You seem to have sustained momentum in leasing volumes. But also on the pricing side, where do you see prices on new leases and renewals over the next four or five quarters? And then how do you think about that relative to current levels? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Will. In terms of the industry fundamentals, of course, it is, as a real estate business, region by region specific, but we see the industry fundamentals as strong and growing in certain accounts. If you go back to the slide where Bill highlighted our focus on the SMACC accounts and the SMACC portfolio, we continue to see an increasing amount of interest in our facilities from the social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content providers, which suggests that there is a great deal of strength in the industry that we're going after to address. The second piece is, if you think about the shift that we talked about at Analyst Day and the conversations that we've had, if you look at the historic approach that we've had in going after enterprises directly and the shift to go after those enterprises indirectly, that gives us the ability to have lower cost of sale and take advantage of the core competencies we have to hit the high-growth, high-potential SMACC workloads. In terms of pricing \u2013 and I am going to turn it over to Jarrett in a little bit \u2013 but in terms of pricing, I continue to see that the discipline that we're exerting in our piece of the industry and the rest of the discipline that the industry has with regard to supply is having a positive effect on pricing. Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : And just with the contract vehicles and the pricing, what's really interesting is you sell frequently \u2013 in this quarter it was 85% of our sales came from existing customers. We are adding 1,000 new customers that we can now sell a full suite of products. So I think both sales organizations are very excited to sell colo, connectivity and Scale; and we have to take advantage of that with the assets that we have as a combined company. Operator : And at this time, we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our third quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 16. First and foremost, we picked up another 10 basis points of improvement in our ROIC during the third quarter, bringing the total improvement since the fourth quarter of 2013 to 130 basis points. I would also like to point out that the 10 basis point improvement during the third quarter excludes the one-time property tax refund; and the 130 basis points since year-end 2013 likewise excludes the impairment charge we booked during the fourth quarter of 2014. These items would've added another 10 basis points each to the total. As you know, we recently closed on the acquisition of Telx, which we believe will be a truly transformational transaction for our company. We beat third quarter consensus estimates by $0.05 and we raised guidance for core FFO per share from the prior range of $5.05 to $5.15, up to $5.12 to $5.18. In short, we continue to execute on our top priorities. I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter, many of whom have been working around the clock on the Telx acquisition and integration. That concludes our third quarter call. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin on page two of our presentation, by reminding you that delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. That applies to the investment decisions under our control and it also holds for the investment opportunity, we expect to provide to shareholders. In terms of our capital allocation decisions, that means mitigating risk on development by requiring significant levels of pre-leasing and building only into markets, where we have high visibility on demand. It means emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are highly focused on the accretive deployment of capital, and we decline deals that do not provide us sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We emphasize growth in our bottom-line on a per share basis. In terms of the investment profile that we offer to shareholders, it means delivering consistent, uninterrupted growth in earnings, cash flow, and dividends per share throughout the business cycle, firmly supported by the underlying value of owned real estate. Let's turn now to our platform on page three. We have made a very conscious decision not to directly pursue the enterprise vertical with few exceptions, such as our traditional bread-and-butter customers like financial services companies. We aim to enable our partners to serve as enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. In early December, we announced the colocation resale alliance with AT&T, as well as a direct link colocation partnership with IBM Software. I'm pleased to report that our partners and alliances program continues to gain momentum. And that these partnerships have already begun to bear fruit, contributing meaningfully to our fourth quarter signing total. Through threes strategic initiatives, we have on-boarded some new target customers, such as a large and growing Asian multinational communications networking company. These wins certainly speak to our approach of supporting partners as they grow their business, while simultaneously leveraging a broader collective sales engine. This pipeline is also growing significantly, including international opportunities and several large expansions for deals signed in 2015, as well as numerous enterprise logos not pursued by Digital Realty's direct sales force, highlighting the value proposition of this partnership model. Turning now to capital recycling on page four. We closed on the sale of a vacant industrial building in Franklin Township, New Jersey during the fourth quarter. This property had previously been held for redevelopment, but market conditions were unlikely to justify construction anytime soon and we determined to sell the property to an owner user and move on. Subsequent to year-end, we sold the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $188 per square foot, at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. This former R&D manufacturing campus was likewise vacant until we were able to successfully re-lease it last year, significantly enhancing the execution we were able to achieve on the sale of this non-core asset. We are now also under contract on the National four-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. There are no financing contingencies, and we expect to close during the first half of the year. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets and this portfolio sale will substantially conclude our capital recycling program. We do, however, continue to believe that culling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties where one off assets that no longer fit our connected campus strategy. We've begun to shift from a harvesting mode to selectively investing to secure our supply chain and to carefully position the company for future growth. As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a land parcel in Ashburn, less than a mile away from our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudoun County. It will support the development of approximately two million square feet and the build-out of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus. We also established a foothold in Germany, a long-time target market with the acquisition of a six-acre parcel in Frankfurt during fourth quarter for $6 million. This parcel will support the development of a three building campus, totaling approximately 340,000 square feet and roughly 27 megawatts of critical load. We have begun the local entitlement process and expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year, subject to market demand. Moving on to market fundamentals on page five. Most markets continue to gradually tighten. The data center demand backdrop remains incredibly healthy, driven largely by our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content along with financial and IT services. We've seen a significant uptick in the size of the average scale requirement, particularly from the hyperscale cloud service providers. The caveat here is that these requirements can be quite lumpy and timing can be hard to predict. The lumpiness of the large footprint business is complemented perfectly by the consistent cadence of the colocation and interconnection contribution from our Telx line of business. Andy will provide an update on performance against our underwriting targets. But suffice it to say, the integration is proceeding smoothly. We are pleased by the contribution Telx is already making to our quarterly bookings and we expect it will accelerate the overall growth rate of our organization. The Telx acquisition has introduced us to over 1,000 new logos and the combined organization is developing strong relationships with these new accounts. Over the past two years, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, highlighting the value of these new customer relationships and further underscoring the complementary nature of the Telx acquisition. And now, let's turn to the macro environment on page six. Global economic growth has decelerated over the last 90 days, while volatility and uncertainty have increased. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation, or even the price of oil, although the drop over the last 18 months is striking. We have the good fortune to be levered to secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing faster than GDP. It's worth pausing here to reflect on our performance during the last downturn, which you can see represented in some of the visuals on page seven. By way of reminder, we have generated positive year-over-year growth in dividends and core FFO per share each and every year since our IPO in 2004. And the great financial crisis was no exception. Our total shareholder return in 2008 and 2009 also compared quite favorably to the REIT index as well as the broader market. During that capital constrained environment, it was corporate outsourcing of data center requirements, along with a prudently managed balance sheet that was responsible for our outperformance. In the current environment, cloud adoption is the next generation of corporate outsourcing writ large. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end-users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a downturn, this becomes even more appealing. In addition, our target cloud service providers are generally mature, well capitalized tech companies and the cloud platforms are among their fastest growing business segments. Consequently, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx, here on page nine. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter and we expect to realize the full run rate benefit of these savings in 2016. We also reached retention agreements with key personnel and we are well on our way to integrating the two platforms. For the fourth quarter of 2015, Telx generated $89 million of revenue, an 11% increase compared to the prior year period. Revenues are split roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $33 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Telx performed at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts. That momentum has carried on into 2016 and we remain on track to meet our underwriting targets. Bill has already alluded to more than 1,000 new customers with whom we are able to establish a relationship as a result of the Telx transaction. Separately, Telx brought an additional 27 new logos into the fold during the fourth quarter as well, including new subsea cable systems, mobile operators, and content suppliers. The total number of cross-connects for the combined organization is now more than 60,000 and we believe that connectivity represents a significant opportunities for cross-fertilization. We told you on our last earnings call that the next order of business for Telx would be to transfer our existing colocation business at 365 Main, along with turning over pockets of available inventory within our Internet gateways. I'm pleased to report that the transfer of 365 Main was completed earlier this month, and the build-out and transfer of approximately 10,000 square feet at 111 8th Ave. should be online by the end of the third quarter. In addition, our investment committee recently approved allocation of capital to build-out a dedicated colocation suite at Building J on our Ashburn campus. We expect to begin selling into that market during the second quarter and to plant the Telx flag in Ashburn during the second half of 2016. While revenue synergies will mostly be realized beyond 2016, we have begun to see some early successes through the collaboration of our scale and colocation sales force, including a recent signing by a top SMACC customer in a new location within the portfolio for that customer. In summary, while the integration mission is not yet full accomplished, we are pleased with the progress and performance to-date. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 10. We signed leases totaling $36 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $7 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the fourth quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for more than 75% of our lease signings during the quarter. Notable highlights include a multi-megawatt lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider at our Franklin Park campus in Chicago. The weighted average lag between signings to commencements were 4.5 months; and as shown on page 11, the backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence in the first-half of this year. Turning to page 12. The average cash re-leasing spread during the fourth quarter was a positive 15%, driven by robust mark-to-market on PBB renewals offset by a slight cash flow down on a much smaller sample size of Turn-Key renewals. For the full-year of 2016, we expect re-leasing spreads to be flat on a cash basis and up in the high-single-digits on a GAAP basis. We do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix and from time-to-time, individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter. On balance, however, we believe we have reached an inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by market rent growth and a steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. Turning to our financial results on page 13, we reported 4Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.38 above the high-end of our guidance range. The outperformance was driven by a combination of several items, including a few cents for Telx operational outperformance during the fourth quarter and $0.01 or so for early achievement on our expense synergy plan; roughly a $0.01 for lower is specific operating expenses; and lastly, our overall G&A did come in a little later than we had expected. FX represented roughly 150 basis points to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top line to the bottom line. As shown on page 14, and we expect this to persist and perhaps some drag of similar magnitude in 2016. It is worth reminding everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So, only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. We are well hedged, with 89% of our net assets denominated in U.S. dollars. You may have noticed from the press release that our guidance assumes $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion of long-term debt issuance. This may include a potential $500 million Euro bond, which would further enhance our natural balance sheet hedged and increase our U.S. dollar net assets to 95%. Furthermore, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. dollar debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposed us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of cloud service providers and other strategic customers around the world, which represents a key competitive advantage. We've attempted to frame our exposure to swings in currencies, interest rates, and commodities here on page 15. The overarching theme is that we benefit from our scale as well as the diversification of our customer base and geographic footprint. I'd like to take a moment to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent, shown here on page 16. A portion of decline in the fourth quarter was due to the elimination of the straight-line rental revenue that Digital previously recognized under our long-term lease agreements with Telx. The longer term trend, however, also reflects the improved underwriting discipline we have instilled over the past two years as well as the consistently improving data center fundamental landscape. Our 2016 guidance calls for $10 million to $20 million of net non-cash rent adjustments, including straight-line rental revenue, straight-line rent expense and FAS 141 adjustments. Straight-line rental revenue and FAS 141 adjustments are fairly ordinary course for our REIT investors. These items represent non-cash revenue that is recognized on our books and is deducted from core FFO to arrive at AFFO. We expect these two line items together to total $35 million to $40 million in 2016. This would be down considerably from $87 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2015, but does not get you all the way down to our $10 million to $20 million guidance. The offset is $20 million to $25 million of straight-line rent expense that Telx recognizes our long-term leases with third-party landlords. In contrast to straight-line rental revenue, this is a non- cash expense that runs through the P&L and is added back rather than deducted from our core FFO to arrive at AFFO. When we first announced the Telx transaction, we stated it would be 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016, but 3% accretive to AFFO per share. These straight-line rent adjustments are the primary reason, why Telx is more accretive to AFFO than FFO. And also, they are a meaningful contributor to our forecast for double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 60 bps sequentially, primarily due to a PBB move-out in Phoenix. Same-capital cash NOI was up 3.4% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up 4.9%. As you may have seen from the press release, we guided to 0% to 3% same-capital cash NOI growth in 2016, which is net of the foreign currency headwinds. The 2016 forecast comes with the major caveat, however, Telx greatly complicates the composition of our same-store pool, since they were previously a customer in 11 of our locations. These locations are mostly Internet gateways and represent a big chunk of our stabilized portfolio. So, carving them out of the same-store pool would result in a much smaller sample size. At the end of the day, we decided to continue to report same-capital results for 2016, as if our leases with Telx were still in place. Beginning in 2017, Telx will be included in the same-store pool and we will revert to a less theoretical presentation. In the meantime, however, same-capital results should be taken with a grain of salt. Telx had a similar impact on our reported occupancy statistics. We previously reflected space leased to Telx as 100% occupied. Now, however, this space is shown on a look-through basis, reflecting Telx's utilization of the space. The look-through treatment results in a lower reported occupancy across the 12 properties where Telx has a presence due to Telx's lower utilization and a better lease-up potential with that space. Irrespective of the complexities of portfolio reporting, we remain keenly focused on organic growth. We will be aggressively attempting to renew expiring leases at higher rates, keeping our operating expenses in check and being mindful of our cost structure. Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 17. In January, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than two years, and upsize the term loan facilities by $550 million. We also established access to a new tender within the bank loan market with a $300 million seven-year term loan. The facilities were well oversubscribed and we'd like to thank our entire bank group for their support. I mentioned earlier that the midpoint of our guidance assumes $1.5 billion of long-term debt issuance. I would like to clarify that this total includes the incremental $550 million a five-year and seven-year term loans, which was put to bed with this refinancing. As shown on page 17, the refinancing clearly \u2013 effectively clears up the left-hand side of the maturity schedule, we have clear runway with very modest debt maturities until 2020, with well-laddered debt maturities thereafter. In addition, fully rate debt now represents less than 15% of total debt outstanding, and we currently have $1.5 billion of undrawn capacity. We also generate approximately $150 million of cash flow after dividends, and we expect to realize up to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales. Consequently, we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.2 times as of year-end and we expect to remain comfortably below our 5.5 times target throughout 2016, with a balance sheet positioned for growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is regarding leasing and the overall environment. Maybe Bill or Matt, can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of the hyperscale cloud players and some of these larger requirements that Bill, you described in your commentary as lumpy and hard to predict. We see some of your competitors landing some very large transactions during the fourth quarter and post-quarter end and just curious what you're seeing in terms of that? Is it harder to compete? Do you expect to see more of it? That would be great. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Thanks, Jordan. This is Matt. Yeah, I think Bill nailed it in his opening remarks and good focus on the hyperscale activity, because those requirements really sort of form the foundation of what the demand was in Q4 and is and will be as we move forward in 2016. We see that demand as well as our regular demand accelerating, but we do have to keep an eye on the hyperscale requirements and the lumpy nature of those requirements. We saw $36 million of revenue as a healthy pace for space and power in Q4. When you throw in connectivity that gets up to about $43 million in the quarter. And I think all of that is still a reflection of our desire to remain disciplined not just in challenging times, but to remain disciplined in good times as well. It's important to remember that we're seeing successfully signed deals at attractive cash returns. And as Andy mentioned in his remarks, we were happy to land one of those very large cloud deals at a 15-year term in Q4, and we expect to see that continue in the first quarter. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then perhaps as a follow-up, you mentioned the total number of cross-connects in the portfolio. Did you mention or could you tell us how many were added in the quarter and maybe anything that might be embedded in guidance as it relates to interconnection? Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : Hey, Jordan. It's Jarrett. We are tracking our cross-connect growth consistent with the colocation pull-through. As Matt indicated, that incremental interconnection business, the connectivity, we gave you some guidance on what that incremental $8 million was that contributed to the sales. And we're continuing to evaluate and roll out more details on the interconnection business. But, as Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we're very excited because it's very complementary, it's a great add-on and it's fundamental to the connected campus to drive those connectivity solutions. Operator : Our next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good evening, guys. So, your 2016 revenue target for Telx, I guess, implies about 7.5% growth off of the 4Q run rate, but if I take the 4Q bookings you reported from Telx of about $13 million for interconnect and base rent, I guess that implies, alone, about a 4% increase off of that run rate, so it just seems pretty conservative there. I'm just kind of wondering what sort of incremental leasing assumptions you have embedded in there or should we just take that as \u2013 the $385 million-plus as sort of the low-end of the guide and you probably expect to come in above that? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Matt. This is Andy. So, I mean that the signings number, obviously, as you know, don't all come in the first day and kind of roll into the next period. So, it's not a direct correlation. I think we feel good on the guidance or the numbers that we laid out for Telx from a revenue and an EBITDA perspective, and it's going to be a combination of leasing up some of the unutilized space and selling incremental cross-connects and getting flow through on the revenue contribution. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I mean, how quickly do \u2013 I'm assuming that interconnect bookings probably commence quite a bit faster than your typical four month or five-month lag on normal scale bookings. Can you just comment on book-to-bill? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So, colo, space and power could be a month to two months for deployment; interconnection would be overnight. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Mr. Atkin, your line is open for questions. Okay. We'll move on to the next question of Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Great job with the last name there. So, I have two questions. The first is with a bunch of your current customers, CenturyLink, AT&T, Rackspace, all being in, what we'll call interesting positions, CenturyLink and AT&T looking to potentially sell some of the facilities to which you are the underlying landlord, and then Rackspace, depending on one's opinion, is doing okay as a company. Obviously, going through change in their own business model; has a lot of space that's being not utilized. How comfortable are you right now with the exposure you have to these customers right now? And is there anything that you're doing to prevent or anything you can do to prevent any risk with these customers as you go forward? Then my second question, the $43 million of new leases including the interconnects, based on your guidance that you have now for 2016, are you expecting that number to remain relatively stable through the course of the year or would you expect that \u2013 or is that assumed \u2013 or do you assume that in your guidance that that ramps even further as we go into 2016? Thanks. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'll take the second one first. I mean, I think we thought that the signings from a scale and a colo and interconnection point of view was pretty good performance, and we see that run rate kind of continuing throughout the year, maybe a little bit of increase, as it relates to the colo and the interconnection piece. And then going back to your first question and I'll let others on the team jump in. I mean, holistically, the best way is obviously to mitigate this are through diversification of your customers, your locations, your leases, maturities. We're always in constant dialog with our customers, making sure we understand their business and where it's going and trying to help them with their space needs. I don't think there is anything on the horizon right now, either with a Rackspace, AT&T or a CenturyLink, where they're actually looking to contract from our specific footprints. I think some of the noise you're seeing in the market or on the news rags is more about folks, who some of them, excluding probably Rackspace, focusing on their core businesses and selling non-core businesses. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. Hey, Colby. It's Matt. And just to pile on a little bit to that answer. It's really quite the opposite, in fact, in some of the names that you mentioned, we saw upticks not just in last year's leasing, but also in the pipeline moving forward to 2016. Important to remember that these customers, especially the customers that you mentioned that are on our top 20 list, these folks are flexing into new opportunities, moving from a capital-heavy to a capital-light perspective, and flexing towards focusing on their core objectives. And the great part for us is that, we've got long-term leases in place with these particular customers, but we also have incredible relationships, and we've developed strong partnerships over all of 2014 and 2015, so that we know exactly what direction they're moving in and how they can use our facilities to benefit from that. Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : And Colby, one final point from a legal standpoint, many of these leases require our consent in order to be signed. Operator : And our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Hey, everyone. Just want to go back to some of the sources and uses. I just want to make sure I got this straight. So, on the $1.5 billion of debt, at the midpoint, I think that, Andy, you said that included the $550 million on the term loan, the upsize, but just curious, you also mentioned $500 million Euro bond potential. But given the disruption that we're seeing in the markets today, is that something that could be done today or do we have to see things calm down before that could actually even get off the ground? I mean, I know it's a mid-2016 guide, but just curious what the conditions are today? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Vin. You were correct in your first statement, so, of the $1.5 billion, $550 million was done in the first week or second week of the year, when we closed our bank facility, and that was incremental five-year and seven-year term loan. The next leg of it, or just under $1 billion, could be a potential $500 million Euro bond. This would be \u2013 we've been to the Sterling bond market now twice and obviously, been to the U.S. dollar bond market many, many times. This will be our first entry to the Euro bond market, it really aligns well with our investments on the continent over there. We've done some pre-work in terms of meeting with different folks over there and fixed-income investors. It's really opportunistic, so as you can see from our debt maturity schedule, it's really would be capital that would term out a portion of our revolver balance, that's pretty far out there in general. So, we're kind of playing it day by day and we want to make sure there is a stable and receptive market to go to, so you'll probably see us re-engage and looking at that even harder in the coming months. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then my second question, sticking with sources on the disposition side. It sounds like the four-data center asset portfolio, you expect to be, I guess well \u2013 I thought I heard in the first half, but end of first half of this year, but we have seen a fair amount of disruption in some of the CMBS markets and that kind of thing. Not that, that's a big factor for data centers, but just curious if that's having an impact on sales expectations? I know there's no financing contingencies, but just in terms of buyer pools and that kind of thing? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : So, we're quite fortunate that Scott and his team got going on this and worked diligently, really ahead of the game here. So, as you notice, we sold one property before the end of the year; we sold another one just beginning of the year. And in this portfolio, that you mentioned, is under contract without a financing contingency. So, I think, we got ahead of some of the supply coming to the market, in terms of data center assets. And I think we've got a good buyer for these assets and realistically, I think that, that would be roughly 75% of our \u2013 the $200 million or so in our guidance. So, we're pretty much through with the bulk of our DSBOs. Operator : Our next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Just thinking about the commencements, I thought last call, you guys had talked about the commencement timing sort of turning back to more normal, I don't know what we'll call it, six-months sort of timeframe were actually lower now at 4.5 months. Is that just depending on the pool or the mix of the leases or is that where we should expect things to sort of remain going forward? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Manny, you're saying the time from signing to commencement? Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : I just want to make sure, we heard you correct. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Matt, do you want comment? Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. So, hey, Manny it's Matt. I would still expect that the normalization will come out at that six month level. Remember the impact that Telx hit inside the quarter and that certainly had an impact on the 4.5 months Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sorry, just so I understand that wouldn't the impact get greater as sort of you do more with Telx, so why would that \u2013 why would Telx be sort of a factor now and not in the future? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : So, Telx, Manny, has a shorter time to commencement, that goes back to, maybe I think it was Matt's question, as he asked about. I said one month to two months from when they signed to take the space. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : And keep in mind, Manny, that when you say, the question about whether Telx will normalize to 4.5 months across the entire year in 2016. There is also these hyperscale environments that may extend that period a little bit. So, we do still feel that six months is the accurate timeframe. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. And then, just if we think about the returns you get on one of those large cloud deal versus sort of your overall return targets or guidance, where would those two lie? Is it 200 basis point gap? Is it 400 basis points? Just, if you could help us think about that? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : On the large, hyperscale cloud deals that we've signed to-date, including the one, in the last quarter. They were, well, within our 10% to 12% range. Now, they're obviously closer to the lower end of that range, but they still kind of met our overall hurdles. Operator : Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on New Jersey. You did say that, I think, most markets are tightening. You were blowing out of \u2013 or you've gotten out of one of your assets here in New Jersey. Just can you maybe talk about conditions there and sort of your appetite looking forward? And then as a follow-up, just maybe discussion a little bit about markets that are seeing a little bit too much supply right now or not much demand? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Jordan, thanks for jumping back into the queue. We like the position that we have in New Jersey. There is an interesting transition happening that continues to have the growth that we have in the financial services, which \u2013 what we established ourselves in the New Jersey. But with the addition of Telx, in particular, our focus on content and cloud in that particular market is starting to add to the pipeline in a way that we hadn't seen before. So, I'm hoping that the pipeline is developing right now, will allow us to get to that good balance between supply and demand in New Jersey. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just markets where you're not seeing the strengths right now that you're a little bit more concerning? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, to go through strength of the markets. And as you know, Jordan, I look at that from a forward-looking pipeline perspective. We continue to see strength in Northern Virginia, incredible strength in Chicago, especially over the past few quarters. And in Dallas, continued support in Singapore, especially with Sing 11 (42:40), the new property coming online and maybe partially due to China demand moving over from the Mainland into the rest of Asia-Pacific. And then some continued strength coming out of London in the social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content markets. We do have a significant amount of those market ready, but more importantly, shell available inside New Jersey; and as I said, I'm looking that as an opportunity for us. And then we've identified a number of strategic assets where we've had opportunities to lease in the past and we've increased our marketing focus on those markets, so I'm hoping that our increased marketing focus will have a very positive effect, not just in those particularly strategic assets, but in our cash position as well. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Jordan, just to add one thing. Going back to, I think your first question, I don't think we hit the nail on the head for what you were looking for. The cross-connects at Telx were over 55,000 just by itself, so Digital contributes about 5,000 to get over 60,000 combined. And on a year-over-year basis, that was about 7% growth in cross-connects on Telx standalone. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jordan, adding to the list of weak markets or weaker markets, you could probably put Houston on that list. And I think Phoenix is on the bubble. Operator : Our next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. In terms of the interconnection revenue growth, should we see that ramping through the year? And is it going to be something that's more back-end loaded or the revenue is coming in right away? That's the first question. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : So, I just quoted you growth on actual cross-connects about 7%, I believe, the year-over-year rate growth is kind of closer to 8%, so it's combined pretty strong growth. I'm not sure, it's going ramp above that combined rate growth volume kind of in the mid to the high-teens, so I'm not sure that I can \u2013 I have a good read on the quarterly guidance, but we do see strong growth in terms of volume growth in the 7% range and rate growth are in the 8% range. Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : And just to add on that, couple of things. We're now in a position to leverage the Telx product capability, on the Digital side, to monetize that at a higher level than we've done in the past. And we're now mining the data to who's connected to whom really to leverage the interconnection business and start scaling that and that will take a little bit of time, but it's definitely the SMACC focus that we're taking and the networking and the cloud providers are definitely interconnection-rich, as you see in the industry. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : And just adding to that, Richard, I'd like to answer your question, so we're all going to jump in. In terms of timing, in particular, the revenue optimization procedure that Jarrett just described, we're expecting that to start to take effect at the end of 2016 into 2017. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, there's a decent amount of runway for growth on the interconnection side? It seems like it's just starting. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for circling back to me. I just had a couple of follow-ups. The first is coming back to Telx. I was wondering if you could share the churn assumptions embedded in your 2016 revenue target, or at least just remind me what the historical range has been there? And then secondly, regarding the AT&T agreement with IBM to manage its cloud and hosting services, I'm curious if that has any bearing on your relationship with either customer and if that partnership includes the management of AT&T's NetBond offering? Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : Sure. We're not giving guidance on the churn, but I'd say we're pretty much assuming in our projections that it was in line with historical averages. I don't want to give you all percentage, (47:11) but I thought it was like 0.6%, so relatively low. And then on your second question, I don't know if Matt, you would... Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. I'll be happy to answer that, Matthew. So, in the two agreements that you mentioned, the AT&T agreement, the IBM agreement. The AT&T agreement contains two main components and one of them is fairly far along; that's the reseller portion of that agreement. That has been significant and we've actually done joint trainings with our sales forces at our sales kickoffs and through \u2013 on multiple continents. And so, the progress being made on the AT&T side is fantastic. And the progress on the IBM side is incredibly promising. We have a unique situation with IBM where we happen to have the core compute nodes located on our campuses. We happen to have colocation space and colocation experts in Telx right next to those core compute nodes. And we have the magic of Telx's interconnection as well as a number of products that are in the funnel to bring to market in the future to provide our customers with the ability to securely and privately connect at lower than 1.5 milliseconds, which is incredibly important for them, and we think that we are one if not the only folks who can provide that environment for our customers. One small thing to clear up, NetBond is the second part of the AT&T agreement that we have; we don't manage NetBond as part of that process, but we do have a partnership with them, so that they can land NetBond assets on our connected campuses. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. So, I was wondering of the non-SMACC verticals, if you had to choose maybe two or three that are showing promise for potentially outsized growth, what would they be? And then on the JV front, there's a couple of assets where you have a partial stake and I wondered if you had any thoughts of securing full economic and operating control of any of them? Thank you. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jonathan, thanks for getting back on the call. We certainly don't like to pick amongst the non-SMACC verticals, because we're very big fans of the SMACC verticals. But in particular, financial services for us, and to go one click deeper, financial technology, we think is one of the places that holds a lot of promise, not just for large scale deployments on our scale team, but colocation requirements on our colocation team and then multiple points of connectivity. It's actually probably one of the best cases you can think about, where these fintech companies have to connect to other providers, have to connect to other institutions and have to connect to consumers, so fintech within finserv is one of the exciting places that we found. The Internet enterprises is another one of the verticals that we really like to have a focus on, not just because of our historical performance in those particular verticals, but because of the necessary growth that's coming out of some of the activities. So, some of the both \u2013 the M&A activity that we see happening here as well as some of the divestitures creates for us an incredible opportunity. When one of our great customers decides to split into two large companies, sometimes we get double the opportunity. And I know I wasn't supposed to talk about anything inside SMACC, but we think the mobile vertical for us is one that's incredibly ready for us to continue to exploit, and with the expertise of Telx now on-board, we're well situated to be able to do that. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Jonathan, on the JV front, really not much for me to report there; we have several great partners from different types of capital sources. There is no real activity underway there. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, Andy, just a quick follow-up for you. The $0.03 of G&A outperformance, I guess you would call it, that you show on slide 13 of the presentation, what specifically drove that much G&A savings versus where you expect it to be? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : I mean really the outperformance was just based on our internal estimates that kind of drove our underlying guidance. I'm not sure there's a one decisive thing that kind of calls out over any of the others, and I'm not sure all (51:42) that can be normalized into the go-forward projections either. It was a handful of things that kind of \u2013 going into a quarter where we acquired a company, went through integration, we definitely didn't think we'd come up light on the G&A front with overlapping teams in the midst of reorganizations, but we did it a little bit better than expected. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, it's actually Ross Nussbaum here with John Hodulik. A couple questions, guys. Obviously, the tone here, I think, has been pretty positive, but I guess my question is occupancy was down almost 200 bps year-over-year in 2015; it slid a little in Q4. You're guiding to kind of flattish for 2016 for the same capital portfolio. So I guess my question is, why isn't the occupancy rate of the core business trending higher given all the positive commentary I'm hearing here? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : I think, basically we're looking at the occupancy going into the year, Ross, and seeing we have some renewals, we have some space that we've been seeing from coming back to us in the form of some PBB space, that was either dark space as a consequence of a former telco merger, there are some silver linings in that, because we're seeing some of our cloud service providers really engaging around taking that space. And we are just being conservative on our occupancy forecast throughout the year. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then as a follow-up, if I could, your stock has obviously done quite well over the last four months or so. How does your, I guess, positive shift in your equity cost to capital here influence, how you think about additional acquisitions, and in particular, looking at, say, things like the Verizon or the CenturyLink portfolios? How do you think about cost to capital versus acquisitions and has that changed from the commentary, I guess, you had last fall, when you did the Telx deal and said you were just focused on integration? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Just let me go back to your first question. Because I think, I might have missed a piece of it. Just to make sure, we're all on the same page, the decrease in the total portfolio's occupancy by a 140 bps or so, as of this quarter, that was due to look through on Telx. So, 11 or 12 locations were 100% occupied at 3Q 2015, and when then, we bought their business and they were not 100% utilized within their four-walls, that was a step down there. So, I just want to make sure, we didn't miss-communicate on that front. Going back to cost of capital, the base plan, which we put out on our guidance, roughly seven weeks ago had sourcing usage plan that was funded through retained cash flow, a little bit from DSBO proceeds and CapEx below our 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA; while at the same time, funding a pretty large investment in our development pipeline, that's the base case plan, it doesn't require equity. I think you could expect us to follow our past track record, if an opportunistic investment came about, whether it's some large scale increase in our development from landing a hyperscale deal or some M&A or other acquisition, we look to go the capital markets to keep our levered stats in line and equity is \u2013 time again been a part of that. Operator : And our next question will be a follow-up from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: That response to that last question just begged me to ask one more. Obviously, there's a lot of speculation on whether or not you'll be interested in doing M&A this year or whether \u2013 wait to do something perhaps later on. As it relates to the Telx acquisition and now that integration, is there a point where you will feel more comfortable doing a deal or is that time now? Just help us give some perspective on the timing on when you think you'd be ready to handle a fairly large transaction, considering everything else that's going on inside the company? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Colby. It's Bill. So, I think \u2013 and Andy said this in his remarks, but we think we've made really good progress there, on the Telx integration, we've obviously retained the talent that we thought was critical to retain. We have over $15 million of synergies there, coming into this year, which is great and we've established a joint go-to-market plan, and we've moved inventory from various Digital locations to Telx, both 365 Main, we're going to do that at 111 8th. And we've approved in our investment committee, the Telx side of Ashburn campus. So, all that's great. We're laying revenue synergies groundwork here for 2016, and we expect to realize that in 2017 and beyond. I mean, I think what should be clear to you is, this is really a continuum. There is no clear point in time when you can say, hey, green light, we're ready. We make progress every day. We actually has a leadership team, we review that progress once a week on Monday, and there is work to be done. But at the same time, we're open to look at other investment opportunities, other M&A opportunities and the criteria is what we've said from the very beginning, getting back to Ross's question, we wanted to be strategic and we wanted to be accretive. And of course, we'll finance it in a prudent manner, keeping the leverage neutral. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing comments. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on page 18 of the deck. First and foremost, we closed on the acquisition of Telx and what was truly a transformational transaction for our company. Telx checked all the boxes for us. It was highly strategic and extremely complementary to our existing platform. It was accretive to FFO and AFFO per share in year one and it was prudently financed. We reported fourth quarter results that were well ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The quality of our earnings is improving with the burn-off of straight-line rent and the contribution from Telx. Growth and cash flow is accelerating and we are poised to deliver double-digit growth and AFFO per share. We also took deliberate steps to secure our supply chain with the acquisition of a highly desirable land parcel in Ashburn. We also entered the Frankfurt market, a longstanding target. Last, but not least, we also raised the dividend for the 11th consecutive year. We've grown the dividend each and every year since our IPO in 2004 and we remained committed to delivering superior risk adjusted total returns to our shareholders. Finally, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. That concludes our fourth quarter call. Thank you for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida over the next several weeks. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive first quarter, characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we deliberately advanced our global footprint during the quarter, the second of the four guiding principles that we laid out at our Investor Day last October and is shown here on page two of our earnings presentation. I'm very pleased to announce that we signed a multi-megawatt hangar lease with a hyper-scale cloud service provider in Osaka, totally pre-leasing phase one of our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month and delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of next year. We also announced that we established a foothold in Germany with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt. We have begun the local entitlement process and we expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year subject to market demand. As you may recall, Germany and Japan have been our top two target markets. And we're very pleased with our progress during the first quarter, particularly in a manner that is consistent with our overarching objective of delivering superior risk-adjusted returns. We also delivered solid current period financial results. Andy will take you through the details in his prepared remarks but the out-performance during the first quarter reflects consistent execution on the fourth objective here on page two achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in both cash flow and value per share. As we have explained, we have made a conscious decision not to go up the stack or compete with our customers or offer managed services. Nor do we intend to directly market to the broader array of enterprise customers and incur the overhead associated with building out the massive sales force necessary to target corporate enterprise directly. We aim instead to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide. Our Partners and Alliances program continued to build momentum during the first quarter, adding Sungard Availability Services as a global partner. We are very excited about this partnership, as it highlights our strategy of targeting enterprise via our partners by combining our best-in-class infrastructure with our partners' best-in-class services. We are in discussions with several other parties about joining our Partners and Alliances program and we have added more resources to the team to support the growth of the program. In terms of capital recycling, during the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $108 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. We are still under contract on the national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned at our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. Due diligence is underway and we expect to close within the next several months. Let's now turn to market fundamentals. As you can see, from the charts on page three, current construction activity represented by the green bars is most prevalent in Chicago, Dallas, and Northern Virginia. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, absolute levels of supply should also be considered in context, which we provide here on page four. First of all, current construction pipelines are generally concentrated in top tier national markets with high visibility on demand and pre-leasing levels are healthy. In addition, market vacancy rates within these markets are in the single-digits, and our own portfolios in these same markets are likewise north of 90% leased. These markets have also been characterized by robust levels of leasing activity. And in each case, the level of 2015 absorption represents a multiple of two times to three times the level of current supply. Within the context of our own portfolio, we have delivered 38 megawatts of new product into these three markets over the last 12 months and our deliveries were over 94% leased on average. We would expect a similar level of leasing on our current crop of development projects upon delivery. And now let's turn to the macro environment on page five. Global economic growth has stabilized somewhat over the last 90 days, although, the rate of growth still remains subdued. Growth of total IT spending is likewise lackluster. As I said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation, or the price of oil and even the growth of total IT spending paints an incomplete picture. We have the good fortune to be levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy as well as the broader IT industry. Current industry trends are very favorable to our core strategy. Rather than spending more; CIOs, Chief Information Officers, are looking to stretch their IT dollar further, narrowing the focus to core competencies is the order of the day, and outsourcing of corporate IT function is being embraced as a more efficient model. The rapid growth of cloud adoption is reflection of these same trends. IDC estimates that by 2018, 65% of companies' IT assets are expected to be located off-site in colocation, hosting, and cloud data centers, while one-third of IT staff are expected to be employees of the third party service providers. Similarly, IDC predicts that more than 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud architectures by 2017. These hybrid architectures require a colocation presence as well as close proximity to multiple clouds. Along with our partners, we provide the trusted real estate foundation for these deployments. The major cloud service providers are rapidly building out their compute note footprint to meet those demands. With our global foundation of data center solutions, we are uniquely positioned to support this rapid growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet these large scale requirements on a global basis. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on page seven. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth year-over-year. Revenues remain split roughly 50%-50% between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $38 million of cash EBITDA during the first quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than planned on all fronts. And we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. Over the past 90 days, the Telx team has been focused on a few key areas within the business. First is our customers, where we continue to grow and expand our key communities and verticals within our Internet gateways. Second is cash flow where we've been focused on the development of a commercial management team to drive additional revenue. Third is systems; we are in the process of integrating systems between the two organizations which will include a combined customer portal. With respect to expanding our customer base and nurturing our colocation ecosystem, we have emphasized the continued development of targeted vertical and communities. During the first quarter, Telx added 35 new logos, a 30% up-tick from the number of new logos added during the prior quarter. In addition to our focus on cloud service providers, we continue to see growth within our Internet gateways and areas such as content, wireless, and mobility services, undersea cable systems, and many other verticals that drive connectivity growth. We have been successful in enhancing the appeal of our facilities by attracting numerous undersea cable systems. We announced the Faster (11:54) and AquaComms cable systems last year and we plan to announce the signing of an additional underseas cable system within the next few weeks. We expect these efforts to continue to drive interconnection growth and offer our customer base continued diversity and global connectivity options from within our facilities. With regard to the commercial management team, we have been very focused on revenue optimization to ensure accurate and timely billing and collection for space, power, and connectivity within our facilities. This team has increased its focus on pursuing contractual annual rate increases from our colocation customers while within their term and we're working to consolidate licensee contractual agreements across our data center platforms. With respect to systems, we identified our target IT architecture during the first quarter and we are working quickly to consolidate these platforms, but we want to be sure that we deliver a seamless customer experience before introducing additional complexity to our systems' landscape. We're making solid headway and we expect this effort to continue as a top priority for the next few quarters. Finally, we recognize that a Customer Portal is one of the top drivers for improving customer satisfaction to our over 1,600 customers. Telx introduced a world-class portal over four years ago to improve service capabilities to drive revenue as well as functionality allowing customers to easily discover and connect to each other. We believe the self-service storefront capabilities in this system, Marketplace, will help retain existing customers while growing the installed base with new entrants seeking the benefit from this developing ecosystem. We hope many of you will be able to attend Marketplace Live in New York City on September 22 where we plan to unveil several new additions and upgrades to the portal. In summary, while integration is still underway, we remain pleased with the progress and the performance to date. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page eight. We signed new leases totaling $39 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $8 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the first quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for approximately 80% of our leases signed during the quarter and over 90% was repeat business with existing customers. The combined organization added a total of 41 new logos during the quarter. The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was eight months, driven primarily by the pre-lease Bill alluded on our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month and delivery is scheduled for next fall. Excluding the new build in Osaka, the lag between signing and commencements was five months, in line with our customary activity. As shown on page nine, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced now stands at $90 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence this year. I would also like to point out here on page nine that in response to feedback from analysts and investors, we have provided a bridge to reconcile the prior quarter backlog to the $90 million current backlog. Turning to renewal leasing activity on page 10, we signed a little over $50 million of lease renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was up 2% with a positive cash mark-to-market on turnkey and colocation renewals, weighed down a bit by a modest cash rent roll-down on a relatively small sample size of PBB renewals during the first quarter. As mentioned on previous calls, we do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Phoenix and in pockets of our East Coast portfolio, and we expect a couple of those to hit during the second quarter which will likely result in a cash rent roll-down during the second quarter. We expect to see positive cash re-leasing spreads in the second half of the year and for the full year we still expect to be roughly flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis. In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. Turning to our financial results on page 11, we reported 1Q 2016 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.07 ahead of consensus estimates. Several of the initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day designed to drive additional cash flow from our properties and leverage our scale to achieving operating efficiencies are beginning to bear fruit. And the upside during the first quarter was driven by operating outperformance as well as interest savings. Specifically, $0.01 was due to outperformance from the Digital Realty portfolio and another $0.01 was due to Telx outperformance during the quarter; $0.02 were due to lower than expected overhead. And lastly, interest expense was $0.03 lighter than expected due primarily to the timing and the pricing achieved on the term loan in January and the Eurobond in April. AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the (17:50) FFO line along with further reductions in straight line rental revenue. Recurring CapEx was also down significantly, although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up over the course of the year. As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance from $5.45 to $5.60 to a range of $5.55 to $5.65. We raised the projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points, again reflecting the benefit of the operating efficiencies we have been able to achieve. This is reflected on the G&A line as well at the property level, and we raised both ends of the range for our 2016 same-capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points, from 0% to 3% to 1% to 4%, or roughly 2% to 5% on a constant currency basis. Finally, interest rates on the term loan as well as the Eurobond, both came in tighter than expected and we have revised our financing assumptions to reflect the actual capital raised to date. The forecast does still include a potential $300 million to $400 million bond offering later this year. FX represented roughly 100 basis points to 150 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown here on page 12. Although foreign currency headwinds are abating somewhat, the U.K. represents our largest concentration outside the U.S. The dollar is currently stronger compared to the 2015 average sterling exchange rate, and our 2016 outlook contemplates a continued drag of similar magnitude for the remainder of the year. I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. I would also like to point out that we completed our inaugural Eurobond offering in early April. We raised \u20ac600 million, further enhanced our international hedge and reducing our non-U.S. dollar denominated net asset exposure to less than 10%. Finally, I'd like to point out that while our global footprint exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe represents a key competitive advantage. In terms of our first quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 10 basis points sequentially. Same-capital cash NOI was up 4.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 5%. I'd also like to remind everyone that our 2016 same-store presentation is somewhat theoretical since we have elected to report same-capital results for 2016, as if our leases with Telx were still in place, given that Telx was previously a customer in 11 of our properties, most of which are Internet gateways that comprised a huge chunk of our stabilized portfolio. Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. As previously announced, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities in January. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than two years, and upsize the term loan facilities by 550 $million, including $300 million of seven-year paper. As you can see from the chart on page 13, the refinancing effectively clears the left hand side of the maturity schedule. We have just under $300 million or less than 5% of total debt coming due before 2020. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we priced our inaugural \u20ac600 million bond offering at a 2.625% coupon in early April. Just to be clear, since it may not have been for everyone, 2.625% was the all-in pricing, not just the spread. We were fortunate to price within one-basis point of the all-time low in the benchmark eight-year mid-swaps rate and needless to say, we were pleased with the execution. We presented the pro forma impact of the Euro bond issuance here on page 14 of the presentation, and as you can see the eight-year term fit perfectly in the one open slot in our debt maturity ladder in 2024. Proceeds were used to refinance and term out borrowings on the line of credit and the current balance on the line is less than $100 million with over $1.9 billion of availability. Floating rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding. In addition, as you can see from the co-op box on the left hand side of the chart, the weighted average debt maturity is now 6.8 years, two full years longer than the weighted average maturity as of the end of 1Q 2015. Terming out over $1 billion of long-term debt does have a dilutive earnings impact, but we believe locking in long-term fixed rate financing from a new source of institutional capital providers is proven financial management. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are maintaining our balance sheet well-positioned for new investment opportunities. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Amy, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Our first question is from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. First question was regarding the hyper-scale cloud lease, I guess you announced one that sounds like it will commence sometime later next year in Osaka, but just curious overall, the trend has been for pretty significant leasing across the board amongst your peers. You guys had an above average quarter relative to the last couple of quarters, but this is not \u2013 we haven't really seen a spike in overall leasing volume from you guys. Yet you do have some availability and obviously a sizable global footprint. Can you talk about what you're seeing on a hyper-scale cloud requirement side if there is more to do there or what have you? Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yes, hey, Jordan, it's Matt, and thanks for the question. In with regard to the quarter, of course, my team, my global team is very pleased with our most recent quarter coming in around $40 million kind of as you mentioned, not to mention the welcome revenue contribution of $8 million coming from our interconnection business. It is important to remember when we talk about the current leasing environment out in the industry that we aren't really new to this hyper-scale cloud game. In fact, while we talked in the opening remarks about the one deal that was an anchor in Osaka, we have done more deals in Q1 with hyper-scale cloud providers as well. And we have been addressing this demand for more than a few years now successfully and during that time period as well as Q1, we captured multiple multi-megawatt requirements from various, not just one, but various hyper-scale cloud service providers around the world. And from our perspective, these requirements may be a little less conspicuous in our quarterly leasing results given the diverse nature of what has become a consistent $30 million to $40 million contribution of quarterly leasing activity. So, for instance, this quarter, Jordan, about 30% of our signings came from the top three cloud service providers, about an additional 20% came from targeted cloud providers outside of those top three, and then a bit more than 30% came from our diversified stack of social, mobile, analytic, cloud, and content accounts. It's important that we keep in mind that in addition to our quarterly wins here in the U.S. we're also successfully landing requirements in our target global markets. Not simply in Japan, in London as well which tend to be comparatively bluer oceans, where our publicly traded domestic data center, read peers, may not have a dominant presence. And the final piece of my response would be that, my team, as you know, remains intensely committed to strong leasing fundamentals beneficial to shareholders while we keep our eye on driving this growing hyper-scale demand. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, in terms of capital, I see leverage ticking up to 5.3 times debt to EBITDA and at the same time we've seen some of your smaller peers cap the equity market, given sort of the performance of the stocks and sort of the strong fundamentals seen in your sector. So, how are you guys thinking about equity here? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Jordan, it's Andy. So the tick-up was 5.2 times to 5.3 times, but I think I got the gist of your question. So our funding strategy for the year remains the same, the base case is to fund our development with our retained capital proceeds from our asset sales and our debt raises, which are largely finished now. With that funding strategy, we see our leverage throughout each and every quarter of the year between that targeted 5 times to 5.5 times net debt to EBITDA, so right around target levels. In addition right now we have less than $100 million on the revolver. Now, if the facts change and if we see an opportunistic investment opportunity, we will certainly look to issue equity similar to we've done in the past. Operator : The next question is from Jonathan Atkin at RBC. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. So I was interested in Japan and Germany and what you were doing staffing wise, whether it's sales operations or other as you have obviously done leasing in one market and are going to be developing in another? Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. With regard to both Japan and Frankfurt, as you know, we have got an EMEA team as well as an Asia Pacific team and in Asia Pacific as we announced last quarter, we brought on a new Managing Director in Ted Higase to be able to help us make sure that we hit that market extremely well. His background in Japan will coincidently or maybe not so coincidentally help us out a great deal in making sure that the Asia Pacific sales team has a head start and being able to hit the demand in Japan. Similarly in Europe, Wendy Will is our Managing Director for the EMEA team and has the ability to help that team hit new markets including the new markets that we see in Germany. We've got a sufficient staff and leadership employees in EMEA from a sales and sales operations perspective to be able to hit that demand quickly and we have been monitoring the demand pipeline for Germany for quite some time and we've got a significant buildup pipeline that we are ready to clear. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then on the topic of Germany, I think there was a big German bank that was in your top 20 customer list that I don't see this time around, so I was wondering given that situation, the more broadly, if there's any, commentary on churn and customers that are coming in and out of that top 20 list? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Jon, this is Andy. So that change in the customer list, you saw a German bank disappear and you saw HP Enterprises gain some exposure on our top customer list. So essentially that institution transferred over to HP and is essentially outsourcing via that route. Operator : The next question is from Colby Synesael at Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Thank you. If I'm reading your disclosures properly, it looks like about $7 million of the leasing tied to TKF was tied to power enhancements. And I was hoping if you could talk about that a little bit, maybe what markets and if you had to do anything from an investment perspective to enable that and are those types of opportunities pretty prevalent in the business? And then I actually just had a fairly high level question maybe more of an educational one for everybody on the call. Can you remind us what's happening with the GICS code change later this year and what if any impact you could see that having on DLR as a stock? Thanks. Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yes, thanks and great question. And there was a good deal of leasing in particular in one of our markets in the Central region, one of our great campuses in Chicago, where it was power \u2013 we'll call it power enhancements, but basically driving additional density into the floor space that's already taken by an individual customer. We think these are fantastic wins for us. From an economic perspective, they're fantastic for us, from a power perspective, they are very good for us, even from a relationship with utilities that we do business with, it increases the utilization of the power that's committed by those individual utilities and we do see density plays continue to play out throughout our portfolio where we can increase the stickiness of those individual customers in our facilities by bringing them additional power. It's also a great signal that our customers are doing well. In this case, this customer's doing extremely well and is taking power at a rate that we didn't anticipate, but it actually ended up helping a great deal. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Colby, on your second question, and by far no one in this room is an expert on that topic, but essentially, the REIT sub-segment on financial exchanges is coming someone out of the shadows of being grouped with other financial services companies, such as the big banks and will be a standalone component of the indexes. There has been a lot of research reports out and market chatter with the thesis being that there'll be additional focus, attention and we hope capital inflows into REITs in general and especially in the Digital Realty stock. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Chao at Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hey, guys, just one follow-up on just \u2013 maybe a pricing question here. If you take out the $7 million of power expansion, it still seems like the base rents are going up a little bit here per square foot. Just curious if there's anything to read into that of if it's just quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, or it does seem like last few quarters we've seen a steady increase here? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Vin, it's Andy. I think you're just seeing some of the power usage may be inflating it a little bit. I don't think we've seen any rent spikes in any particular market. We think our rents are still running healthy and support our development yields of the 10.5% to 12.5%. We see rents on a comparable basis kind of staying flat to having very modest increases right now. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just another question on the pipeline, the development pipeline, I think it's ended total active development pipeline just under $1 billion as of the end of the quarter. Where do you think that'll stabilize out? I mean, will this grow to $1.5 billion at some point or is there some limit on how much you'd grow that to? And then just on the yields that you're showing on that page, they seem like they're down from last quarter. I was just curious to get some commentary on that. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So, Vin, the guidance yields are roughly 10.5% to 12.5%. It's really just a function of when you bring on new projects, how leased they are and if the initial yields are a little lower, it depends on the market. But all in all, we see the yields kind of still with our bogey. In terms of the total size of pipeline, we haven't seen anything right now that's going to have a massive shift or increase in our pipeline. We still have that consistent amount of annual spend. The one point I would clarify though is, while we have $540 million of remaining spend for these projects, some of this is pre-leased, over half of it actually, and some of it is speculative. We're actually only contractually committed to finish roughly $380 million of that, so if the music did stop and there was oversupply delivered to any market, that would represent like 0.3 turns of debt to EBITDA, so our balance sheet leverage would still be in check. And as I mentioned before, we have $1.9 billion of availability on our revolver, so no crisis would ensue. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Petersen at Jefferies. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Oh, great, thank you. So, I just wanted to follow up on the hyper-scale lease that you guys signed. And I'm just curious what these conversations are like with these cloud guys. Obviously, you and your peers have been signing a lot of leases. So, I'm just curious when you sit down in meetings with them, is there so much demand that they're just scrambling to try to get as much space as they can or are these more strategic expansions, just trying to get into new markets and the business will grow into it? Just trying to get a sense of whether it is just one big wave, or whether this is just to meet the current demand out there and that's going to continue? Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yes, I think it is a little bit of a combination of both of those. And it depends on which one of the hyper-scale providers we're talking to and how far along they're in their planned execution and then what type of visibility they have into their own demand. And that really is a little bit different obviously from cloud service provider to cloud service provider. A number of them have had advance plans and it meets with their advanced planning. A number of them have seen a radical shift in terms of the demand coming to them and so in their hot markets which happen to line up with some of our hot markets, they want to occupy as much space and power as they can because they know that they will burn through it and utilize it. So, it really does depend. I would say about half and half amongst the cloud providers in terms of the current large amounts of deployments that they're going through to hit their current set of demands, but also to make sure that they understand they can cover demand that they historically might have missed because they didn't have inventory in market. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : And I guess as my follow-up in terms of the decision they're making to lease space rather than build it themselves, obviously some of these guys like Amazon and Microsoft have the scale to do it themselves and they do. Is the reason that they're doing more leasing just because they need the space and you guys already have entitled space, so it's just easier or is there a strategic reason that they would want to be in a third-party leased facility? Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yes, there's a few of them and you can see that a number of these folks have actually done some of the builds themselves in the past. I would say part of that past activity was because of slow changes to the multitenant data center environment to adjust to their needs. I think over the past six months they have been satisfied that multitenant data center providers like us have the ability to hit their needs and their capital is better spent focusing on the strategic imperatives that they have in front of them. So while they may have hit a gap with their own builds, they all have sort of come to the realization that leasing is something that they need to not just explore but execute on. Jarrett...? Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : Yes, and just to build on the architecture trends, we talked about multi-cloud and hybrid cloud. It's really important for these cloud service providers to have colocation and interconnection on the campus as well. So I think this is a trend that you're seeing, a value proposition that we can, that they LAN their compute engine and support the cloud, but then enterprises and partners can deliver private clouding connectivity right next door and that's a great value proposition. Operator : The next question is from Richard Choe at JPMorgan. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Following up on that question, now that you've signed (40:08) in Japan, how should we think about the lease up rate going forward? And I guess along with that, in Germany, do you need an anchor tenant or is demand strong enough where you can kind of move ahead and the sales force is there and everything is kind of set there, demand wise to move ahead with that one? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. Hi, this is Scott. Good questions on that. Japan, that represents phase one and that's 100% preleased with that anchor tenant. So, future development there would be subject to additional market demand. Germany, we want to develop in conjunction with market demand, although there's a pretty strong demonstrated pipeline of demand in that market. So, I think we would feel a little more comfortable pushing forward a little more aggressively there. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And I guess as a follow-up, there wasn't much leasing activity in Europe. Is that mainly due to a lack of inventory in that region? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Yeah. So, as you know, there's a different set of demand drivers inside that European market and you sort of nailed it on the head. In the places where we see the most amount of demand, we found ourselves out of enough inventory to satisfy that demand. So, in particular, in Amsterdam and in London, where we are currently swinging shovels or swinging hammers or a combination of both \u2013 I don't know if you're supposed to swing a shovel \u2013 but it depends on what you're doing I guess. But we are satisfying that problem in London and Amsterdam; the same thing in Frankfurt, where we did have demonstrated demand, but obviously we didn't have a presence there as well. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to revisit the leasing results again, and I guess just trying to figure out, if you view the current run rate of about 70 to 80 megawatts annually is translating to an acceptable level of organic growth in the scale business? Or if maybe there's an elevated tightening of your underwriting standards that we should think about? Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : So, in terms of the leasing results, what we do every year and as part of the process of making sure that we understand what our commitments are for the year, we have a very specific leasing plan that we publish and work to and we're pretty satisfied with the leasing plan that we have in front of us right now. And we're pretty satisfied that we can hit the goals that we've set out, both internally and the goals that we've set externally. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : And Matt, this is Andy speaking. So, the underwriting and returns piece of the equation really \u2013 mostly applies to bringing on new supply, where we have to build either buy land or build from the ground up. We've got a giant portfolio with pockets of vacancy throughout different markets, where it's not \u2013 whether the deal mix are underwriting hurdle, it's about marketing, finding demand and landing in locations. So, that settle the \u2013 underwriting is not always the governor for whether a lease lands or not. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then, as a follow-up, can you just give us some color on the 100 basis point increase in guidance for same-capital NOI? Is that being partially driven by the G&A improvement and kind of how does that reconcile against the lower pre-stabilized yield, is that factored in at all? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So, those are probably separate parts of our P&L, so same-store capital for NOI is not really pick up new development contributions. Reasons for same-store or our view of increased optimism on same-store drove the results in the first quarter and what we've seen going into the second quarter. I think that's both on the top line and the bottom line. You mentioned the bottom line is really \u2013 on a NOI basis, it's better operations at the property level. So, I think if you look through our P&L, especially in the same-store side of it, most of our expenses were flat or potentially down in some categories. So, we're running the properties more efficiently. And then on the top line, we did have some mark-to-market outcomes that were a little bit better than we planned, which is driving some of the increase in the same-store cash NOI growth. Operator : The next question is from Manny Korchman at Citi. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks, guys. If we switch back to the Japan lease for a second, if we just think about the timing there, where they're not going to be occupying until essentially I guess early 2018 at this point touching by your development schedule, how did they think about the capacity that they need? And can we balance that against your comments about not building spec there. Do you think that you could sort of amplify the amount of leasing you could do, if you had the spec \u2013 product that are given unlikely inventory? Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. So, hey, Manny, in terms of, just to clarify, actually I think the Japan lease will commence in late 2017. But, it's a good question, in terms of, is the demand that we're seeing not just with that particular and I assume your question applies to more than just the Japan deal and applies across the board with these types of deals that we're seeing. And how do the customers think about what their takes will be? And how do we respond to those? We've got a really good process actually in place to understand the production capabilities that we have and how those production capabilities match up to what our customers really need, I'll talk about what our customers need. Then I'll turn it over to Jarrett to talk about the production capabilities that we have. In terms of the way our customers look at this, they still sort of look at it as having a foot in each of these markets, in each of these buildings, in each of these facilities. That usually comes in the shape of at least one, what we used to call pod, but one scale oriented pod, sometimes two-scale oriented pods that they need in short order. One is generally the size that they need upfront, and then they need to have visibility, so that they're not going to outgrow their needs, and they're not going to outgrow the co-lo needs that they know their customers are going to need in the hybrid cloud environment. And I'll have Jarrett answer the rest of the question. Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. And I think, Manny, to build on what we just said, I think we talked about at Investor Day, the new agile product that we're rolling out globally. Once we really design two options, the power dense option that you're starting to see and the base option, which is the agility for the client. As well as once we have the shell up, we then can deliver pods, as Matt was talking about, every three months to four months. So, it gives us a lot more agility as we see demand in that market. And so, I think when you pair that, you can sell into a market and meet different customer needs on that timeline. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Maybe a question for Andy. So, Andy, if I look at slide 11 of the deck, I guess that's a walkover from consensus to actual. Maybe two questions related to that, if you were to make that left-most column not consensus, but where your expectations were, would the steps sort of be the same, so did you outperform your own expectations as well? And then secondly, how much of this was the timing shift and how much of it is going to impact the rest of the year as sort of more one-time in 1Q? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Sure, Manny, this is Andy. I think that's your third question, but we're going to give you a pass today, because I like you so much. So, the $1.35 was roughly around our internal projections, so we're right in line, so everyone trying to \u2013 kind of these step functions kind of mirror what our internal results look like. I would say most of these are flow through to the rest of the year, so Digital Realty NOI, Telx EBITDA. G&A, there may be some timing elements to it. Part of that's non-comp related travel consulting, fees like that. So, if people exceed budgets in subsequent quarters, they're essentially using a budget, they didn't use in the first quarter. And then the lower interest expense, I mean that's a product of two things, the timing of when we did our capital raises and actually our execution on the capital raises. The one thing I would caveat, it's not as simple as just taking the far right bar, and times it by four to get our full-year number. We do have some items that will reduce that full-year number and offset \u2013 are increases in revenue. One of those is that portfolio of datacenters that we have under contract and to sell, hopefully, in next month or so. That'll obviously be dilutive out of the gate when you sell $120 million-ish of assets that are income producing. And then the second item is, we basically had the revolver balance at $600 million or $700 million for most of the quarter and then did a $600 million Eurobond. Subsequent to quarter end \u2013 and that was a fixed-rate eight-year piece of paper, which is obviously good for the balance sheet, locks in long-dated FX hedged debt, but is not as low as floating rate revolver debt. Operator : The next question is from (sic) Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore ISI. Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI : Just call me Jeff. Listen, thank you for taking the questions. So, I guess, I asked almost the same question last quarter, but I'm still very interested, and really understand about the progress to keep getting another quarter under the belt of having both Telx and also sort of large campus datacenters and the interplay there, particularly in driving the cloud enterprise ecosystem. So, I'd love to get a little perspective on how that's coming along. And I guess as a sort of sub-question there, Jarrett gave some good color I think in an earlier response about why the hyper-scale guys are interested in your assets, given the ability to drive that connectivity there as well. But, I'd be interested I guess sort of on the opposite side as to hear about the enterprises coming into connect with the scale cloud guys. And you did call out the $7.5 million of incremental interconnection fee that you were able to book off of Telx this quarter. And it would be good to get some perspectives, I don't know what it was in the fourth quarter or what it might have looked like a year ago, but is this a number that was in acceleration, in line et cetera. Thank you. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, (sic) Jonathan, this is Andy. I'll take the first part, and then I'll open it up to the team to answer. The Telx update integration, what you call it, we're making very good progress, as you can see from the numbers in the Investor Presentation. We're on track and it has to exceed our expectations from our initial underwriting. As previously mentioned on prior call about our investor committee improving Telx expansion under our Ashburn campus, we've now started the pre-sale activity and we should have the doors open there, come September I think you can expect some additional new market expansion done full \u2013 throughout the remainder of the year. On the West Coast, well, we've been fortunate enough to sign a subsea cable, which we think will enhance our Telx \u2013 the attractiveness of our Telx footprint and our entire footprint in that market. We're also looking \u2013 we're expanding our footprint in Atlanta, where we've been very successful at 56 Marietta. So far so good, as it relates to Telx. Just not to jump around, but from our interconnection revenue line item, we're tracking year-over-year on just that revenue component, north of 10%, I think it was close to 11%; and then quarter-over-quarter, I think it's well about 2%ish, just for interconnection revenue. And then, I'll turn it over to the team to answer your middle question. Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer : Hey, (sic) Jonathan, Amy, whatever your name is today, really quick on the first part of your question, hopefully to give you a little color on what Andy said and some pretty concrete examples of where we see the combination really coming together quite impressively. We've been to a number of events where we bring both teams together to address customers. I would say it started very actively with PTC, we've got ITW coming up and we've been at a number of events in between. And what's interesting is the reaction from our customers has been absolutely fantastic. So, not only have they thanked us for coming together, for giving them in essence, one throat to choke for all of their scale, co-lo, cross connect and other services' needs. But we've seen a number of them actually start to change their own individual organization structure to come to us in the same way that we are now coming to them all in one. So, we've seen \u2013 I've now seen this last week, the fourth large cloud service provider make a decision to consolidate their network folks with their datacenter folks to make sure that they're coming to market the right way. So, I don't know \u2013 I'm not claiming credit, if that's because of what we did, but I'm letting you know that it's landing pretty well, that Telx and large campus together. Let me get to the heart of what I think Andy turned it over to me for, which is why hyper-scale is coming into Digital Realty, in particular with our set of assets. There's a couple that Jarrett has talked about individually. One is, first of all, we get hyper-scale, we've been doing hyper-scale before someone truly turned it hyper-scale, we've been doing large deployments and we've figured out how to make a fairly profitable business out of it from the beginning. So, these folks are comfortable, that we know what we're doing and that we've got the size and scale, no pun intended to have a good counterparty on the other side of the transaction for their large compute-node needs. But they also know that their customers' needs more than simply the ability to provide cloud services through one datacenter, five datacenters throughout the world. They also need to have co-location availability, so that those folks have the ability to land what they cannot put in the public cloud, cannot \u2013 maybe put into a private cloud, we have to put into their enterprise class datacenter and then they need connectivity to bring them all together. We just came from our client advisory board and several of them came to us and said, we love the idea that we can now get this at one organization. They're looking for ease. They're looking to take the complexity out of the IT transactions that they have in front of them and we are able to act as that vehicle would takes that complexity away. I would say in the future, we've had some future-oriented conversations about where they're taking the business into the future with their platform-as-a-service offerings. And they are very interested in being involved with the company that has now 1,600 customers, many of them IT service providers, many of them providing the service component, they are putting together into the applications of delivering into the future and they want to be able to offer that to their end customers. And Digital is uniquely situated to be able to provide that value proposition where nobody else can. Operator : The next question is from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I'm looking at your top tenants roster and I compared it to where you were in the fourth quarter and you obviously did quite a bit of leasing with your top 20 tenants between the level threes and the AT&T's and Verizon's, et cetera. I guess I'm curious what percentage of your leasing is existing customers versus new ones at this point? William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : I can tell you the stat from the first quarter \u2013 and the first quarter results from existing are upwards of 93% coming from our existing client base. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. The second question comes on the development pipeline side; it comes from page 34 of your supplemental. Again, the development yield, I guess, on the current pipeline is 10.3%; last quarter, it was 11.2%. And I recognize I think part of that decline, I'm guessing, is you've got Osaka in there for the first time. I assume that's a lower yield, just given interest rates in Japan, you're willing to develop that at a lower yield, I'd be looking for you to A, confirm that? But B, when I look at the development yields in the U.S. and Europe those also came down a little bit. So I'm just curious, if there's some commentary on the development yields? And then the last part of the development question, the cost went up $10 million in Singapore, and you delayed it a quarter, if you just comment on that one? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Ross, this is Andy. So, you're right, I think the main driver's Osaka bringing down the yield. The other element, I would say is, if you bridge between the last quarter and this quarter, and I think we highlighted in one of our slides, we did deliver, I believe, 13.2 megawatts across Dallas, Chicago, Northern Virginia that was pretty well leased at an attractive yield. And we rolled on some \u2013 really the last phases of our Northern Virginia project before we have to move to our next land \u2013 and some other new phases in Chicago and Dallas, which obviously are less well leased. And we include our underwriting estimate in this table until leasing actually comes in. And we typically outperform our underwriting, when we hit the leasing, you'll potentially see these yields go up. And then the other question was, Singapore timing... Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : And cost. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : ...and cost. Maybe FX rates would be a driver there; I think we're either at budget or under budget there. I know we have the ribbon-cutting ceremony in May or June. William Stein - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the ribbon-cutting's the first week of June for Singapore. We did stage it \u2013 first, we have some marketing efforts over there \u2013 but it is the second quarter and it's still scheduled for June. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Ross, my guess is FX related on the cost side, but we'll follow-up just to check. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I was just hoping to follow up on the Telx run rate on the EBITDA. I guess I'm looking at the number from the deck and on a run rate basis it seems like you guys are running a bit ahead, maybe 5% ahead, of the $148 million. Can you maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes or how we should be thinking about how EBITDA flows from Telx during the year? Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Jordan. So, as a reminder, that top row was our initial underwriting when we announced the transaction back in the middle of July, the key and repeated number, $148 million plus of cash EBITDA. We are, I would say, ahead of plan for just the first quarter. Some of that beat was on the expense side that may have been a little seasonal and timing related, the timing for the annual SKO, or sales kick-off and marketing and sales initiatives around that event, actually moved. Last year it was in the first quarter; we actually pulled it forward and did in December this past year. So, again, that's probably not a number you can necessarily just annualize to get the run rate. We are ramping additional resources on the sales and marketing front there, but all-in-all we're making good progress on the revenue and the EBITDA line item and feel like we're on track to meet or exceed our underwriting estimates. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then separately, just in the partners and alliances program, can you maybe just give us a sense, how do you get \u2013 how are you confident in that program and the potential of that program or what gives you confidence, should I say \u2013 as opposed to the other route of sort of bolstering or building out the sales platform like some of your competitors have? Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing : Yeah. Thanks, Jordan. First of all, Bill and Andy won't let me build out the sales force to address that potential demand and I am happily compliant with not building it out. And just to be clear, right, it was \u2013 it clearly is a differentiator between us and other folks in this industry. So, it was not that we didn't have some trepidation in making the decision to address a large segment of the potential revenue in what amounts to an entirely different way for us as a company. So, that was not without personal risk on my side, but also just a little bit of risk on our side, but it's a great question. How do we feel confident that it's going \u2013 two main components make me feel confident \u2013 and the first, it always starts with our customers. I think during the last earnings call we had just come from a meeting with one of our top five customers, and the reception from us having a conversation with those C-level folks and talking to them about not competing with them and asking for their support and signing up for the partnership program and being actively involved in helping us pass leads back and forth and being true partners, gives me a great deal of confidence. And then secondly, nothing brings confidence like pipeline, especially in my particular world. And so, the guys this year said, in the first quarter have already generated $40.1 million in pipeline inside G&A to date. Now, obviously we do not close all of that pipeline and we're starting small and learning, make sure we get it right and we are growing the program as we move it forward; added another program to the reseller partnership program this particular quarter. We'll continue doing that with some of our key partners moving forward. But nothing gives me peace of mind like having $40 million in pipe in a brand new program. Operator : The next question is from Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. So just on Telx, when you made the announcement, you talked about some of the underutilized capacity out on the West Coast and it looks like you made some progress in Seattle if I'm reading the portfolio detail correctly, but less so in Santa Clara, and maybe just more generally, can you comment on where you're seeing success more versus less in the acquired assets. And then, the other question I wanted to ask was just on recurring CapEx, and I think Andy mentioned it's going to pick up in the latter part of the year. What's driving that? Thanks. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Jonathan, it's Andy. So, we're seeing, I would say, increases in our occupancy utilization pretty much across the board. I'd say from a utilization standpoint, we're kind on track with our plan moving into the 70%s now. And I didn't mention we had some wins that signed that I mentioned for the undersea cable actually hasn't flowed through the utilization just yet ,and actually will probably be something that's more attractive to draw (65:29) customers to that location. I know we see a lot of demand pointed at our Telx location in Santa Clara. And we continue to see tremendous success, be it at Cermak or 56 Marietta in Atlanta, or the New York City Trifecta. So I can't tell you one asset is pulling far, far ahead in terms of percent change from another, so it's been kind of fairly broad-based. And then your second question was about CapEx, I think it's really just timing related, as you can see, from our AFFO reconciliation, if you take those last three line items before our AFFO, they sum less than $26 million of recurring CapEx and commission and compensation for the quarter. But if you multiply that by four that's like a \u2013 just a $100-ish million of recurring CapEx. And we have affirmed our guidance table North of $145 million for the full year. So, I think it's just a function of timing and didn't want anyone to think that that lower number could be truly run rated throughout the rest of the year. Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer : And hey, Jonathan, to give you a little more color on the West Coast activity. We've really integrated the efforts of the West Coast team that we have had historically at Digital with the West Coast team, especially on the business solutions side with the Telx Group and a number of the properties that we've looking at, end up having enough contiguous space to be attractive to the digital traditional sales methodology. Now the challenge with that is the Telx sales methodology has a tighter turn, a quicker return, and a faster rate of adoption. The larger deals that we see going up against the Santa Clara facility, as well as the Seattle facility, as well as the Portland facility that we have simply larger deals take a little bit longer for us to close. But the cooperation is working exactly as planned. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for closing remarks. Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Amy. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our first quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 15. First, we made significant progress towards extending our global footprint to our top two target markets with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt and the signing of an anchor lease on our first project in Japan. We also made headway towards a strategic objective of achieving operating efficiencies to drive accelerating growth in cash flow per share. And we delivered first quarter results well ahead of our own forecast and $0.07 ahead of consensus. We raised guidance by $0.075 at the midpoint on the strength of the beat in the first quarter. And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the success of refinancing of our global credit facilities in January and the completion of our inaugural Eurobond offering in early April. In conclusion, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you that at May REIT in June. Operator : This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John Stewart : Thank you, Dan. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results, including 2016 guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business, see our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Explanations and reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Stein. William Stein : Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to begin today with the discussion on governance. We recently announced that Laurence Chapman has been named Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning. The Board expects to appoint Laurence as Chairman of the Board at its next Annual Meeting in May 2017. Many of you have had the opportunity to interact with Dennis Singleton, who has served as our Chairman since April 2012 when the Company\u2019s founder resigned from the Board. Dennis led the Board during a period of significant transition, including a change in CEO as well as several other executives, a change in Board composition, and two strategic acquisitions that have meaningfully enhanced the Company\u2019s growth profile and product mix. It is expected that Dennis will continue to serve on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors after he steps down as Chairman. In addition, I\u2019m pleased to announce that Mark Patterson has joined our Board effective yesterday. Many of you may also be familiar with Mark. He was formerly the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Merrill Lynch and prior to that he was the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Citi Group. He serves on the board of UDR as well as General Growth. We are absolutely delighted to welcome Mark to our Board. The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a destaggered Board. The majority of our Directors fees are paid in stock. Each of our Directors maintains a sizable investment in the Company. The Board and Senior Management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements. And finally, since 2014 100% of the senior management teams long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder performance. We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Along those lines we announced several industry-leading sustainability initiatives earlier this month including a long-term agreement to procure wind power offsetting 100% of our U.S. colocation and interconnection energy footprint. Let\u2019s turn to Page 2 of our presentation to recap the guide posts of our strategic plan. Delivering superior risk adjusted returns is our guiding principle. This entails emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are focused on the accretive deployment of capital and we are willing to turndown deals that do not provide a sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We also execute when we can achieve the best long-term outcome for shareholders irrespective of short-term reporting requirements. In terms of capital allocation, the highlight of the second quarter was the agreement that we reached to acquire a portfolio of eight highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt, three of the most important interconnection hubs in Europe as shown here on Page 3. This transaction met all of our acquisition criteria. It was strategic and complimentary to our existing business financially accretive and prudently financed. These eight data centers are highly complementary to our European platform. The portfolio serves more than 650 customers predominantly concentrated in the network cloud and IT services, content and digital media and financial services verticals. The concentration lines up very well with our target customer verticals and more than 80% of these customers are new relationships to Digital Realty. In addition, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, underscoring the value of these new customer relationships. As you know, this sales process was dictated by the European Commission with the clear objective of standing up a business that would be immediately competitive in the marketplace. What you may not know is that this business came staffed with 130 employees including 16 sales and marketing professionals. In contrast to the Telx acquisition, we have not underwritten any expense synergies in this acquisition. We are very pleased with the caliber of the personnel as well as the properties that we\u2019ve acquired with this transaction and we welcome these new employees to the Digital Realty family. In terms of integration, it\u2019s still early days, but we are actively working to ensure a smooth transition for the acquired business into the Digital Realty platform. And we are leveraging the lessons learned from the Telx integration to create a seamlessly repeatable process. Our teams are focused on communicating with our customers and employees and we are executing on short-term objectives for the business, moving people, integrating processes and standardizing reporting. Over the next quarter, we\u2019ll finalize the plan to extend our colocation and interconnection platform and we will communicate it as appropriate. I should pause here for a moment to address the impact of Brexit. We did anticipate a potential Brexit scenario in our underwriting and we did hedge the purchase price, but we have not altered our global strategy. Fundamentally, we do not believe the EU referendum will materially impact global data center demand or our global portfolio as the secular demand drivers remain intact and the transatlantic cable landings have not moved. We believe our global platform is one of our key competitive advantages and we do not plan to exit either the UK or Continental Europe regardless of the outcome of the EU referendum. Early in the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell our fully leased [san andonin] data center in Paris to Equinix for approximately $210 million or $575 per square foot. Also early in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of a four property data center portfolio as shown here on Page 4. The sales price was a $115 million or roughly $250 per square foot. Excluding 251 exchange, where the sole tenant is moving out this month. The portfolio cap rate is in the low 6s on forward contractual cash NOI and in the mid 7s assuming the near-term expiration were to renew. Since embarking on our capital recycling program in the second quarter of 2014, we have sold 10 properties and one investment generating net proceeds of $420 million not including the Paris property now under contract. As I\u2019ve said previously, we\u2019ve been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of our non-core assets and this portfolio sale substantially concludes our capital recycling program. We do however continue to believe that calling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our global connected campus strategy. In terms of expanding our product offerings, we\u2019ve been working closely with our customers and leveraging the combined heritage of Digital Realty as a large footprint leader in addition to the Telx colocation and interconnection legacy. We are close to launching our service exchange which will further allow us to enable customers with dynamically interconnected large footprint and colocation data center solutions on a seamless connected campus uniquely meeting customer requirements. The service exchange is core to empowering hybrid cloud and IoT architectures in an extremely efficient and agile manner. We look forward to providing more details over the coming months and unveiling the benefits of the service exchange with our robust cloud ecosystem partners. In addition, we are continuing to make solid progress on the Telx integration. We are executing our systems roadmap. That work is on track and is expected to continue for the next several quarters. We planned to sunset the Telx brand during the third quarter and we are in the process of unifying our multi-product global sales force which we also expect to complete during the third quarter. Along similar lines, our partners and alliances program continues to expand. I am pleased to announce that CenturyLink, our second largest customer has joined our program enhancing options for connectivity, managed services and cloud services for our customers. During the second quarter, the partners and alliances program continue to drive revenues, including for hybrid cloud deployments that highlight the benefits of our connected campus strategy. I am pleased with the progress that we are making. In addition to adding CenturyLink to our partners and alliances program during the second quarter, we have begun executing on transactions for hybrid cloud deployments with one of our best customers and partners in advance of our formal go-to-market campaign which is set to begin shortly. As a result, we have already begun to realize revenue from this partnership and we expect to see even greater uptake once we formally launched the campaign. During the first half of the year, the partners and alliances group increased the total contract value of deals executed by more than 20% albeit off a modest base. The pipeline remains robust at approximately $40 million even after several deals were executed during the second quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to market fundamentals on Page 5. New supplies picked up in Dallas and Northern Virginia over the past 90 days. Given the sector\u2019s recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, demand is robust in both of these markets and pre-leasing levels on development pipelines are healthy. In addition, current market vacancy rates are low at our own portfolios in these markets are likewise north of 90% leased. Northern Virginia and Dallas are both national data center markets characterized by robust leasing velocity and solidly positive net absorption. And now let\u2019s turn to the macro environment on Page 6. The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly over the past 90 days, primarily due to uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit referendum. That data center industry has the good fortune of being levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both someone independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy. We believe it\u2019s still early days for cloud adoption and the related build-out of cloud service providers compute node footprints. Although cloud requirements are lumpy and price sensitive. From where we sit and looks like the wave of cloud service provider demand has not crested yet. And we see a set way building on the horizon from the Internet of Things and connected devices. Gartner predicts that by 2018, 30% of enterprises will use cloud service providers direct when cloud connectivity services up from less than 1% at the end of last year. Given is expected growth strategic planners at the cloud providers are actively mapping out their approach. We believe that we are well-positioned to support this continued growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet the full spectrum of our customers data center demand requirements on a global basis. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy? Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s begin with our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed new leases totally $15 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, including a $6 million colocation space and power contribution. Interconnection contributed an additional $8 million and our total bookings for the second quarter were a little over $22 million of annualized GAAP revenue. While this is towards the lower end of our recent activity levels. We are taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global connected campus footprint. We are winning diverse demand across attractive verticals including cloud service providers both big and small along with other growing segments of digital economy, IT service providers and other large sophisticated users. You\u2019ll note the appearance of a Fortune 50 hyper-scale cloud service provider on our top twenty customer list this quarter. At the same time we also added more than forty new logos for the second consecutive quarter. Long story short we are focused on landing demand from a diverse and growing customer set. Along those lines, I am pleased to report that during the month of July we have already signed an additional $20 million of total bookings, including space, power and interconnection. This activity has included significant singings across all three geographic regions including a healthy mix of large enterprise software cloud providers, hyper-scale cloud providers, IT service providers and financial service customers. The total bookings figure includes $6 million of annualized colocation and interconnection bookings. In fact, the month of July has already been the best month for Telx since our acquisition. While we are not satisfied with the level of large footprint leasing during the second quarter. The pipeline for the second half is sizable and we are cautiously optimistic that we are back on track to return to normalize activity levels in the second half of the year. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced standard $70 million. The bulk of which is expected commenced within the next 12 months. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements was a record low at 1.5 months. Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 10, we retained 85% of second quarter lease expirations and we signed just under $60 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was up a little less than 3% overall with a positive cash mark-to-market across all property types, including another quarter of plus 5% for colocation. This was a bit better than expected largely because we did not execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix and on the East Coast that we have called out last quarter. We do still expect to renew those leases later this year, so we may see negative cash mark-to-market on our second half renewals. For the full year we now expect releasing spread to be slightly positive on a cash basis up from our previous guidance of flat on a cash basis. In general we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we\u2019re making on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. Let\u2019s turn to Telx here on Page 11. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $94 million of revenue during the second quarter representing 9% growth year-over-year. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50 interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 11%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expend synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the second quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts and we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. We have added a number of new sales reps who have already begun contributing to the success of this business. As part of integrating our global sales force we planned to add - continue to add sales resources through the end of the year including key position to drive our vertical ecosystem development and solutions efforts. The colocation and interconnection strategy has been to focus on key facilities and drive growth associated with our ecosystem including multi-site customer wins. We are seeing progress across five emerging ecosystems, networks, subsea cable systems, mobile, digital content and over the top distribution and the cloud community. During the second quarter, we announced that we landed another undersea cable system in our Hillsboro, Oregon facility. Subsea cable systems are an area of particular focus for us and we have had success today in the Pacific Northwest where there has been a heightened interest in landing cables. In mid May we announced that we will be launching colocation and interconnection services on our Ashburn campus during the third quarter. We are scheduled to launch in September but the sale team has begun pre-selling the site. And we already signed a handful of new deals. In addition, Atlanta has shown significant growth over the past few years and we are completely sold out. So we have begun working to bring on additional capacity to accommodate our overflow from 56 Marietta and should launch early next year. As mentioned last quarter Marketplace Live will take place in New York on September 22. We look forward to providing updates on products and services and formally introduced in our revised branding and we hope many of you will be able to join us there. In summary, at the one year mark since the Telx acquisition announcement we\u2019re on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and complete the integration process. Turning to our financial results on Page 12, we reported 2Q 2016 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.04 ahead of consensus. The outperformance was fairly broad based with the topline OpEx, G&A and interest expense is a penny ahead of expectations. AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the beat at the FFO line as well as accretion from Telx and a further reduction in straight line rental revenue as shown on Page 13. Recurring CapEx was also down significantly again this quarter. Although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up in the second half of the year. Since a portion of the lower CapEx spend is essentially timing related the second quarter AFFO per share growth is somewhat inflated. But nonetheless we\u2019re well on our way to delivering the double-digit AFFO per share growth we committed to at our Investor Day last October. The AFFO payout ratio is now sub 70% and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital. The current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. The bottom line is that quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating reflecting the improved underwriting discipline we\u2019ve instilled over the past two years along with consistently improving data center market fundamentals. As you may have seen from the press release we raised our core FFO per share guidance by $0.10 at both ends of the range. We\u2019ve raised the full year projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points again this quarter to 57% at the midpoint. You may recall from our Investor Day presentation last October, the lease set out a target of a 200 basis point EBITDA margin expansion by 2018 from 55% to 57%. We are nowhere close to hanging out the mission accomplished banner today and we do expect the EBITDA margin will continue to fluctuate over time as we reinvest in the business, but we are pleased with the progress we are making towards the final objective on our three-year guideposts achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share. We also raised our 2016 same capital cash NOI growth guidance again this quarter by 150 basis points at the low end up to 2.5% to 4% or roughly 3.5% to 5% on a constant currency basis. FX represented roughly 50 to 100 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 14. I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. As shown on Page 15, the UK represents approximately 13% of total revenues and approximately 5% is denominated in euros. Pro forma for the eight property portfolio acquisitions that closed in July. However, as you can see from the table in the middle of the page, we have over $1 billion of strong debt outstanding and we also completed our inaugural $600 million Eurobond offering earlier this year. We have effectively matched the currency of our assets with our liabilities in these markets. So our total European net asset exposure including currency hedges is less than 5%. We may tap the sterling bond market again either later this year or earlier next year to further naturally hedge our sterling-denominated assets. Finally, I\u2019d like to point out that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure; it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements, our strategic customers around the world which we believe is a key competitive advantage. In terms of our second quarter operating performance, same capital occupancy was flat sequentially at 93%. Overall portfolio occupancy dipped 50 basis points sequentially to 90.4% due primarily to development deliveries placed in service in our highest demand markets. We expect overall portfolio occupancy to pick back up by the end of the year. Same capital cash NOI was up 3.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 3.6%. Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet beginning on Page 16. As you know, we executed a forward equity offering in mid-May to permanently finance the European portfolio acquisition. The underwriters also exercised their overallotment option in full, so we expect to receive total net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements. In the interest of time, I won\u2019t dwell on the mechanics today, but I would like to point out that we have included a Slide here of Page 16 that does provide some detail on the mechanics of the forward sale agreements for those who may be interested. When we close the portfolio acquisition in early July, we initially funded the purchase with a drawdown on our line of credit in an effort to match sources and uses, which we have attempted to layout for you on Page 17. In addition to the proceeds from the equity offering, we expected to close on the portfolio sale as well the Paris option property. In terms of timing for the uses, the preferred equity is not reviewable and the mortgage debt is not pre-payable until later this summer. Consequently, we expect to settle all or substantially all of the forward sale agreements by the end of the third quarter as we fund the additional use of the capital laid out here on Page 17. Remember that we can flex line of credit up or down at any time, but the forward sale agreement is a one-way drawdown. Finally, on Page 18, we provided a recap of our 2016 capital markets activity on the right as well as the pro forma impact from the equity offering and the European portfolio acquisition on the left hand side. As you can see we are keeping our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities consistent with our financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Dan, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Yes, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the rent question. You talked about positive releasing spreads and the mark-to-market across the portfolio rising. Can you talk a little bit about the trends in rents you\u2019re seeing in your markets and given essentially rising occupancies across most portfolios and very high pre-leasing rates amongst the development this out there? Matthew Miszewski : Yes, Jordan, it\u2019s Matt Miszewski. Thanks for the question. In keeping in alignment with what Andy have stated in his opening remarks and especially in our core markets but more broadly as well we see stable to slightly improving rates, which also happen to be coupled with some of the great work that Jarrett\u2019s team is involved we\u2019ve been focused on cost containment in design and construction. So that we expect as the programs that we\u2019re developing right now move forward to have even better performance from a pricing perspective. As our ecosystem development work that\u2019s underway right now starts to take hold. The pre-leasing rates that in these markets similarly look good. Internationally in particular rates look fairly strong. So strength in Chicago, in Ashburn, in Dallas and in Singapore which is great given the new facility that we just launched. Jordan Sadler : So it sounds like you are trying to, I mean, rates are stable now, but you are trying to dry them a little bit with some of the new programs. I guess as a follow-up, A, if you guys could characterize the funnel, it sounds like while this quarter was not the most robust in terms of total leasing volume, it sounds like there is a significant pipeline behind it. July was big. How would you characterize the funnel? Since you\u2019re being selective, how would you characterize the funnel in terms of high margin versus lower margin opportunities? William Stein : Great question Jordan and really since before the acquisition of Telx but really with the acquisition of Telx and working closely with that team we\u2019ve been focused on making sure that the funnel is not just full, but it\u2019s full of the right opportunities in the right target accounts. Given our targeted focus on SMACC continuing, social mobile, analytics cloud and content, but especially inside that cloud and social verticals our funnel has been slightly - it has slightly improving margins in it currently and I do say currently because its pipeline and we have to close, but we\u2019re pretty happy that we\u2019ve been able to slightly expand the margin inside the funnel as we start to work together with multiple products. In addition but we\u2019ve been working together very, very closely with multiple clouds - large cloud service providers to make sure that we can match value for value going forward given their demand and given our capacity and given the pipeline, the pipeline margins this would give the pipeline margins for the rest of this fiscal year and moving into Q1 of 2017 potentially better outcome. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mr. Atkin, is your line on mute? Jonathan Atkin : Sorry about that. So I was interested the remaining milestones that you have perhaps on the operations side. You talked about integrating the sales force and retiring the brand, but what remains to be done with the Telx integration as well as what would be some of the initial milestones as you look at the European assets that you just acquired? Andrew Power : Thanks, Jonathan, this is Andy. In terms of remaining milestones I would say unifying the brand under one brand across the Company is a big one, one global sales force is another big one that is going on, both of those going on really right now. Remaining milestones other than, obviously, meeting or exceeding our underwriting targets probably be more back of the house oriented in terms of accounting systems that will eventually be fully united and kind of HRIS systems. I think in terms of facing the customer and driving more revenue, the two that we mentioned on this call are the biggest that are kind of nearing the end zone. On the European portfolio acquisition, quite frankly its early days, we are delighted to receive approval from the commission and ultimately closing the acquisition what is I guess a handful of days or weeks ago. We think we got a really talented team along with some very attractive assets coming on board. We have onboarded some consulting help to kind of help us simulate the 130 team members and assets with our existing franchise in Europe. So we probably have more to post you on that integration coming next earnings call, but just a handful of weeks of post closings, so far so good. Jonathan Atkin : And then my second question or follow-up would be just on Telx and progress on some of the West Coast assets. If I look at your supplemental and kind of at the property level, it seems like it\u2019s been fairly slow initial process in seeing increasing utilization there. So I just wondered if you had any commentary on how that\u2019s progressing. William Stein : It may have not flow through to our supplemental because until a commencement happens on a lease, it won\u2019t show up in a utilization stat and some of those buildings are kind of portions of our building, so you can\u2019t always see it transparently. We have seen some traction increase not on the East Coast, but also the West Coast. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s kind of coastal specific, I think it\u2019s more a testament to onboarding more QBRs and we have several on-ramp that newly joined the Company. And they\u2019ve, quite frankly, the new QBRs have driven a lot of new logos and customers which is what I would say attributed to Telx\u2019s successor in the quarter which was certainly backend loaded more towards June and the beginning of the quarter and then that success is certainly spilled over in the month of July. Operator : And our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich : Thank you. Hey, guys. You kind of touch on this already, but I\u2019m just curious how long do you to think it\u2019s going to take to integrate fully the recent Equinix deal and then also along with that, does that kind of limit your ability to do other acquisitions or do you feel like you still have capacity to do other deals? Andrew Power : Maybe just to rehash Lukas on the first part then I\u2019ll hand it back to Bill and Scott on other deals. I mean quite frankly, we\u2019re fortunate very similarly to our Telx acquisition in buying a very strategic and complimentary collection of assets and team members. In Europe, previously our position was much more anchored around our scale leasing and more campus oriented products. What we\u2019ve closed on with the eight assets and that team is prized assets in the Dockland of London or the size parker Amsterdam or actually in Frankfurt it works very well with the land we purchased and a sales force oriented towards selling that small footprint, higher price point, colocation and interconnection oriented offering. So that\u2019s what makes this one a little bit easier, is that there is no expense synergies being sought here. We actually want to put additional resources to support the sales force. It\u2019s very complementary with the existing team over there. They\u2019ll be moving into our office on Gracechurch Street within the month where we had a little space to fit the corporate team. And so I don\u2019t have a date to fill, but I think this one could actually integrate more efficiently or more timely than Telx. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill and Scott to handle the back half of your question. William Stein : Hey, Lukas. So as Andy said, actually I feel like we\u2019re further along on the equity assets than Telx at the same time just because of the nature of the acquisition, so I think it should take less time. So looking at the M&A environment, there are certainly quite a few opportunities out there. I think that been written about. And Scott and his team are constantly scanning landscape and looking at those opportunities and we will see what happens. Scott, do you want to add anything to that. Scott Peterson : Yes. I would agree we\u2019re focused on integration. We want to be good stewards of our shareholder capital. I think one of the great aspects of these two acquisitions is these platforms give us a lot of flexibility. We can grow the platforms organically. We could grow through M&A, but we have a lot of flexibility and that allows us remain disciplined in our future M&A activity. Lukas Hartwich : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you. I wanted to start with the leasing numbers, the $15 million in the quarter. Would you characterize that more a function, and it being lower than what you\u2019ve been doing, which you characterize that more a function of you\u2019re not chasing the deals that are out there because you think that the returns don\u2019t meet your criteria? Did you not necessarily have capacity in the markets where some of the bigger deals were being won this particular quarter? Or is it that you actually are bidding and you\u2019re losing out perhaps to others? And then I guess just a follow-up to that, in your prepared remarks, Bill, you mentioned that you don\u2019t think that the cloud demand has crested yet and I guess that ties into some of the color that Matt gave in the first as it relates to the funnel and how you think you could see some strong demand I guess in the back half of this year and then into the first quarter and that could give higher margin. I was wondering if you can just give a little bit more specificity around what areas or what gives you the confidence that you guys will actually be involved with some of the cloud demand in the back half of the year? Thanks. William Stein : Thanks for the question and thanks for fitting five questions into one question. Colby Synesael : That\u2019s a south-side skill. William Stein : Yes. You had south-side got that skill. That\u2019s right. So I would certainly characterize it as you did. I was not pleased with what I call below average scale product signings in the quarter. We do think that the pace was due to a couple of things that you mentioned, but also the normal lumpiness that\u2019s become part of our business especially given the new hyper-scale demand that\u2019s out there. But also as you said a more selective approach to making sure that we land the right mix of customers at the maximum - to maximize the long-term value that we think we have inside of our ecosystem. So this means, as you said one of the potential reasons for that number is our continued commitment to a disciplined approach to our underwriting criteria and focusing really on top tier markets and not focusing on tertiary markets where some customers may have a desire to go and then maintaining a disciplined underwriting and pricing regimen to protect long-term value. And on your second question, really the overall demand remains strong. It\u2019s evident by the July that we\u2019ve had so far in both sections of our global business as well as the healthy pipeline that I talked about which has the potential for margin expansion as we move on. We do think that we\u2019re on track now to resume normal levels in the second half across all parts of the business in 2016. Specifically though with regard to your question about demand and cloud demand remaining strong especially where we are in our global markets where we operate. It\u2019s important to remember that that cloud business is still one of the fastest growing segments landing in our industry and from analysts from right scale all the way through to Gartner they all tend to agree that we are actually in the early innings of this new cloud ecosystem breaking out. We are also starting to see the green shoots. We\u2019re seeing mass adoption of a diversity of cloud players not just the major cloud players and early adopters that are out there which we think and to get your last question. We think we\u2019re uniquely situated to be able to land. We do believe that we\u2019re the only Company in this space that is very focused on providing great scale solutions for folks who need scale solutions including those cloud service providers, but also providing colocation right next to it at a latency that can\u2019t be beat as well as the security that comes with the power of private networking or interconnection products. So we really think that the secular demand drivers in the cloud industry are continuing to push them and we are uniquely situated to be able to address it. Colby Synesael : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan Petersen : Great. Thank you. I guess just to follow-up on the leasing volumes, I mean, I know you can certainly have bad quarters. But this is essentially three quarters in a row where your volumes have been below some of your wholesale peers. I\u2019ll just name them, like DuPont and CyrusOne. And so I guess given your comments on focusing on profitability over velocity, I guess that it kind of begs the question if the achievable profitability or the yields on these facilities have declined permanently and you guys just need to move your rents down to compete better. Andrew Power : Sure. Let me timing this is Andy. Since matching dress and some of these already. So a couple topics one timing why I\u2019d always love to have a better fiscal second quarter rather have a better deal on July 1, then a less attractive deal on the June 30. So I think you saw a little bit of that with the volume of sign that just got signed the first few days or weeks of the month of July. And just to put a little more meat on the bone that\u2019s going from a diversity of different types of customers. It\u2019s included hyper-scale top three cloud providers, a sizable chunk from other cloud providers that aren\u2019t in the top three and then another chunk from the rest of what we call smack of the digital economy or IT services or other transaction verticals. So we\u2019re seeing that our demand signings in the second quarter and July from diverse growing customer sets. The other thing I think that to draws the distinction, it is not just about pricing the profitability to we\u2019re really focused on driving the long-term growth in the cash flow and attractiveness in value of our assets our campuses and our gateways with a diversity of different customers versus some of our peers who may be more focused on being in non-core market to us or doing a full build to suit with one customer in one shot. So we always want more exposure and more signings at the right rates from the top cloud providers but we\u2019re focused on collective portfolio and drove that cash flow and value our assets. Matthew Miszewski : And Jon just to give you a little bit of color. While we had a good quarter with regard to those top cloud service providers still 37% of the revenue we closed year-to-date has come from other cloud service providers. So we have a diversity of cloud exposure including 50 new logos that were landed year-to-date inside the smack verticals. So we\u2019re fairly happy with that diversity. Jonathan Petersen : Okay, and then just thank you for that. And then just kind of an unrelated question. On the guidance, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the $0.10 increase in the quarter. Obviously closing the EquiCiti assets, I would think, is what is driving the underlying increase. You also have cash rent growth. Now you\u2019re expecting it to be positive rather than flat so all these kind of positive moves and yet I don\u2019t see any change to top-line revenue. Help me kind of understand why we are not seeing anything increment there? William Stein : Sure. So the breakdown on the $0.10 is really kind of a third, a third, a third story. The first third is kind of outperformance which we\u2019ve already mentioned topline G&A, OpEx. That we kind of got in the bag from the performance in the quarter. The second, third is kind of flow through from that operational performance into the back half of the year and the last third is due to the big question. Overall net accretion from the act the - buy the European portfolio acquisition and the funding with the asset sales and the equity and also the repayment of the debt and preferred. So the third, a third, a third, a third, the first two-third operational related the last third more or more accretion from our most recent investment. On the topline the two things what\u2019s kind of held us back from kind of nudging that up at this time, one was the - we are going to lose some revenue when we sell our fully leased property at St. Denis here fairly shortly. And two we do have some FX headwinds in the top revenue line item which or heads when it comes down to core FFO per share gains but on that top line of our guidance going to use the growth. Operator : And our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead Vincent Chao : Hi, everyone. Just want to go back to the Equinix asset acquisitions. You made a point of pointing out the number of employees that you picked up there, including 15 sales professionals. I\u2019m just wondering at this point, have all the key players been sort of locked down in terms of them staying or is there still risk of some of those guys leaving the platform? William Stein : Hey, Vince. The key guys are intending to stay through the balance of the year. And we\u2019re working on contracts for them that will tie them up beyond that. Andrew Power : I would add is that this particular team really of their own volition went into this process along with these data assets to kind of essentially at the EU request set up a standalone business that could stand on its own if it had to. So talented individuals across multiple departments coming together with the strong leaders and quite fortunately landed in our hands. We\u2019re the complimentary buyer no synergies expected, so very little overlap of any and we are able to kind of - we think the combination of our European portfolio plus data assets and teams, one plus one we feel is greater than two there. Vincent Chao : Okay, yes. Thanks for that, and then just going back to some of the pricing commentary that we\u2019ve been talking about today, and just looking at some of the data that you provide across the supplemental that might point to improving pricing, I\u2019m looking at sort of the development yields that you\u2019re expecting are up a little bit, I think, from last quarter. I don\u2019t know if that is mix or not, but then the cash spread commentary also would point to maybe a little bit better market pricing. I\u2019m just curious what kind of market price improvement are you expecting for this year and maybe next year if you have that? Andrew Power : You know, I quite frankly we\u2019re fairly cautious when it comes to kind of a going out too far in terms of future rank growth here. I could say at the larger end of the scale, the biggest buyers they are buying bulk and taking on numerous megawatts have the greatest pricing power and their rates are certainly flat. They\u2019re not seeing any type of rent spike. If you walk down to the other side of the spectrum and look at our smallest footprint colocation, I think you can look at the cash release and spreads which is up now 5% for the second quarter and it was a pretty sizable this quarter actually amount of leases - just in terms of colocation that rolled up, so we were able to roll these customers up 5%. And they are able to generate some pricing power. Between those two goalposts its very market and customer episodic. Operator : And the next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman : Hi, guys. If we look at page 16 of the supplemental, the NAV, the components of NAV, and we look at the first section which is the cash NOI by property type, it looks like there is some significant movements between the business segments. And I\u2019m just wondering if that was just a change in reporting or if there\u2019s something going on with either the revenues or the margins impacting each business, specifically with colo non-tech and then leased Internet gateway coming down pretty significantly about 16%, 18% quarter-over-quarter? Andrew Power : Manny, I am trying to flip to get that Page and are following this financial supplemental. I think the only - I think we may be more accurately mapping towards the NOI buckets this quarter than previously. I\u2019m not aware of a dramatic change quarter-over-quarter. Emmanuel Korchman : That\u2019s fine. We call follow-up offline on that one. Scott Peterson : Sorry about that. Emmanuel Korchman : No, that\u2019s all right. The other question I had for you, if you look at sort of the very, very short lease to commencement timing in this quarter, which certainly different than we have seen in the past, does that give you any concern that you\u2019re not filling the backlog? And if we look at the July 30, excuse me, the post June 30 leasing that you spoke about, is that more similar to the four to six to seven month commencement or is that also kind of here now, take now sort of lease up? Andrew Power : I think the short number is just a smaller sample size that actually closed during the quarter. So I think you can get back to the previous bars on what the signs in July in the rest of the quarter. So I mean, we like the short side to commencement because the cash flow comes quicker, right versus kind of the leaving something that you have to build and come online in a year to two years, but I don\u2019t think one and a half months is definitely an anomaly. William Stein : Manny, it was a disproportionate focus on market ready inventory that we were still clearing out, so I\u2019ll agree with Andy that while I would love the 1.5 to stick a little bit. You should expect to see revert to the norm coming up especially given July. Operator : And the next question comes from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz : Hi. Thanks. Good evening. In terms of the large, megawatt, multi-megawatt cloud signings we\u2019ve seen this year, I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts on how competitive those bids are, what factors are going into those who are landing these deals, and I can appreciate kind of the diversity of your leasing mix here and the lumpiness of those signings, but it does appear that the rates you\u2019re signing are substantially above where we\u2019re hearing those other deals getting done. I am curious to just kind of hear your thoughts on the competitive environment behind those larger deals? William Stein : Yes. Thanks, Matthew. So the competitive environment is I would characterize it as strong for especially what we turn the hyper-scale opportunities that are out there about 3.5 megawatts and above. And as you know we\u2019re certainly not new to the cloud service provider environment. We continue to get our fair share each and every quarter, but most importantly our focus on is on getting them at the right returns for Digital Realty, so we stay very focused on that. With the competitive bids, it does put a certain amount of power in these cloud service providers hands and we find that the closeness that we have with a number of them and extending to all of them as we move forward gives us the ability to have that value for value conversation that I referenced earlier. So we know that they have a high degree of value on things like inventory availability and large scale inventory availability as well as connectivity to colocation facility. And as we unearth those opportunities with cloud service providers they see the value, they match the value and it allows us to not just go to the lowest price, but to go to the best value for Digital Realty. And so that\u2019s really been our focus and it\u2019s going to continue to be. Matthew Heinz : Okay. Thanks. And just one more as a follow-up on the guidance, I\u2019m wondering what you are assuming for revenue contribution and EBITDA this year from the EquitCiti transaction, and I guess with the revenue, again, with that number not moving, are you assuming that there\u2019s just offset there from some portfolio sales and FX? Just a little deeper on the revenue guide if you would please? Andrew Power : Hey, Matt. Could you hear that answer to that last question? Matthew Heinz : I couldn\u2019t hear it at all. We can follow-up offline. Andrew Power : So in terms of the underwriting the second part of your question we\u2019re still believe in our underwriting of the 13 times EBITDA that we announced when we made the acquisition announcement last May. So nothing\u2019s changed in terms of outlook there and that\u2019s what\u2019s included in our revised guidance for 2016. In terms of revenue it\u2019s really about the gain from a partially a period on the pre-portfolio has been offset by FX headwinds and revenue loss associated with the safety knee asset. And also the portfolio assets that we\u2019ve now closed on. So both of those disposed, we lose some revenue in the back half of the year and we have some ethics headwinds offsetting other revenue gains from the European portfolio. How that one do. Matthew Heinz : That works just fine. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Jonathan Schildkraut : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess two questions. Most have been asked and answered. First, Andy, maybe you could be a little bit more precise in terms of timing of the equity distribution from a share count perspective. Is it fair to assume, then, you\u2019ll issue for modeling purposes, the shares at September 30? Is that the way we should think about it in sort of going through and coming out with our FFO numbers? And then I guess my second question, I will come back actually for that if you could help me first? Andrew Power : Sure. So the whole reason with the timing is really just the moving parts on the sources and uses and we didn\u2019t have 100% clarity when we were very able to close out for us to dispose and we think the safety need dispose will close shortly but it could be at the beginning of August could be at the end of August and we can repay that preferred debt till late summer anyways. So what we did is we closed on the revolver short-term we used revolver closing the acquisition short-term. And then when all the dust settles on all these other uses of capital. We plan to pull down all if not all or substantial all of the equity which is 14.3 million shares including the over a lot option that was exercised. Probably I want say maybe probably before September 30 maybe the beginning of September is my guess when all the dust settles here? Jonathan Schildkraut : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you know you said during your prepared comments, and Matt actually said in answering Colby\u2019s question that you guys were very selective in your choosing of customers and so I just wanted to know exactly what that meant. Does that mean that you\u2019re not taking the same customers as some of the other guys who are taking these hyper scale deals or that - I\u2019m not sure what that meant? Andrew Power : I think just to clarify and I will let Matt clarify as well had some a counter. I don\u2019t think that we have lots of great customers over 2000 customers now could in our most recent acquisition. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re choosing customers that we don\u2019t want to do business with and I regard I think all of our customers are great and we want to continued more business and grow our customer base. I think it\u2019s making sure we pick our spots on the right opportunities. So buildings on our campus or within are gateways that we can fill with the diversity of different take and small cloud service providers other parts of our smack vertical, IT service providers, corporate enterprise that all want to thrive and continue the growth space and there. We find that is a better opportunity to land versus it on the core market or outside the core market especially not going after a kind of one big swath of leasing slash capital and almost like single tenant build to suit opportunities. We think the former versus a lot us more attractive to what we put our capital. Matthew Miszewski : And in Jonathan just real quick. I mean there\u2019s that there are a couple of places where we are being more selective moving forward. As you know from the most recent Investor Day our focus on serving enterprise customers through the channel is certainly one of those cases, which actually makes the terms that that those organizations except a little bit easier on us and make the economics a little bit better for us as well as for the end customers down the road. The second piece is that the ecosystem development that we\u2019re undergoing right now will really drive who we pursue in terms of end target customers. We\u2019ve moved to a new account targeting solution that allows us to hit not just the top cloud service providers, not just the massive cloud service providers but really about 500 targeted accounts that we can focus on and then also focus on the channel. So that\u2019s the targeting that I was really referring to. And the final piece is we do continue to have a great strategy of building up incredible campuses. And so we want to make sure that we have multi data center campus facility and so we need to attract those types of customers and I\u2019ll let Jarrett. Jarrett Appleby : Yes. I think partnering up with the partner in Alliance Group there\u2019s a couple unique things. One having colocation now on the campus in Ashburn and Richardson next to the leading cloud service providers is high value we\u2019re seeing severely wins in that. We do need that service exchange that provides those new connectivity options. And the second is we\u2019re getting multi-site deals in the ecosystems because we\u2019ve expanded our cage capability in many of the buildings that we own that Telx is in and that\u2019s now bringing more magnets in who bring their customer base in with them. So those are a big push that will have from our product and delivery. And then finally with the new land we have acquired we\u2019re now using our new design and can design and delivery capability. Now in Greenfield campuses at even larger scale and so you\u2019re seeing that next generation of product in places like Ashburn and Dallas. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Choe : Great, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on a clarification. Given the EquitCiti asset probably is a little bit lower margin that the core business and it\u2019s staying in guidance, what gave you the confidence to raise up the guidance range for adjusted EBITDA to 56 to the 58? Andrew Power : Hey, Richard this is Andy. Even with the absorption of - you\u2019re correct lower margin than existing digital. Based on the outperformance we\u2019ve seen on the EBITDA side or expense side year-to-date and what we\u2019re trending for the remainder of the year. We think we\u2019re going to be able to absorb that portfolio and continue to maintain - I should say deliver slightly higher than previously disclosed EBITDA margin. There is a little bit of an order of magnitude going on here with the portfolio being $900 million and relative to digital size. Richard Choe : Makes sense. And then for the development CapEx guidance, it\u2019s been very light for the past few quarters. It seems like it really would have to accelerate to even get to the low end, let alone midpoint or high end. Is that the right way to think about that? Andrew Power : On the development CapEx spend. I think you\u2019re right. We\u2019re probably if you look to those two goal posts we\u2019re probably close to the low end than the high end. But I won\u2019t put it out of reach yet. But I would say we\u2019re probably guide into a little bit on that spend towards the low end. Operator : And our next question comes from Sumit Sharma of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sumit Sharma : Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide more color on the four assets you sold. Just trying to get a sense of whether these were non-core or more on the opportunistic side of things given the low 6 cap rate. Any color you could provide would be really helpful? Scott Peterson : Yes. Scott here. Yes, it\u2019s fair to determine or to call them non-core, St. Louis is a non-core secondary market, that asset was better placed in the hands of somebody pursuing that strategy. And then the two Northern Virginia assets, well that is a core market; those assets would not be considered core assets to our ongoing strategy. Sumit Sharma : Okay. Fair enough. And in terms of the SS NOI guidance phase, the 2.5 or 3.5 on constant currency basis to 5, assuming there\u2019s 3% escalators on all of your rents, I guess there has to be somewhere in there that just seems pretty significant asking rent hike around the 10% range. Just trying to get a sense of what kind of asking rents are you seeing and who is driving that kind of thing? Andrew Power : Sure. I would say - so our bumps are 2% to 3%, but not all 3% just to be clear. So I think the reason we really changed increased our same capital cash NOI growth. We\u2019re doing a little bit better on the retention. Doing a little bit better on a cash mark-to-market then from a quarter ago and that kind of translates into that kind of a 3 to 3.5 constant currency growth rate. You are not - that space and there\u2019s a pretty demonstrative footnote at the top does not have the Telx colocation, mark-to-market really running through it, as we want to really reflect the true chain capital stabilized portfolio, so you\u2019re not getting the 5% plus mark-to-markets like we\u2019re seeing on the colo side yet. Next year we\u2019ll be in that pool, but right now this is just really retention and modest mark-to-market from the - are more of our scale leases expiring and for those and those 2% to 3% rate bumps and then managing the OpEx prudently. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for any closing remarks. William Stein : Thank you, Dan. I\u2019d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our second quarter highlights as outlined here on Page 19. We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we further advanced our global footprint with the European portfolio acquisition. We also delivered solid current period financial results. We beat the Street by $0.04 with better than expected results above and below the NOI line. We also delivered outsized AFFO per share growth during the quarter. The quality of our earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating. We raised guidance by $0.10 with an improving outlook for most of our key metrics and solid progress towards our three-year target of 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering that coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 index. In conclusion, I\u2019d like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us and have a great summer. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive quarter characterized by healthy leasing activity and solid execution against virtually every objective of our strategic plan laid out here on page two of our earnings deck. As you may have seen, we announced this afternoon that we've appointed Dan Papes as Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Dan was most recently President of Unify North America, formerly Siemens Networking Systems, where he had responsibility for managing all aspects of the business with total ownership of the P&L. Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27-year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business, including roles as Vice President of Global Cloud Services Sales and Vice President of Global Telecommunications Industry Sales. He has experienced leading global sales organizations and he has been responsible for driving significant growth in revenues, deal volume and profitability. We are delighted to welcome Dan to the team and we are confident that he is the right choice to help lead our global sales engine to the next level. I would like to take a moment here to thank Andrew Schaap who ran our scale sales team on an interim basis, along with Tony Rossabi who continues to lead our colocation and interconnection line of business for their leadership and professionalism, while we ran the search for a permanent sales and marketing leader. They are both key assets to our organization and the solid rebound in bookings during the third quarter is a direct testament to their capabilities and the depth of our talent. The third quarter capital allocation highlight was closing on the acquisition of a portfolio of eight highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, as shown here on page three. This transaction was strategic and complementary to our existing business; it was financially accretive, and prudently financed. In terms of integration, we are underway towards a smooth transition of the acquired business into Digital Realty. In late September, we announced the appointment of Rob Coupland as Managing Director for the region. Rob, previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Telecity and we are delighted that he accepted our offer to stay on after the acquisition and lead our expanded regional platform. Also in September, we officially opened our Amsterdam data tower. The 72-meter high tower was designed and built using the latest advanced technologies and has over 5,000 square meters of space and will have fully built out IT load of nine megawatts. Based on its location at the Amsterdam Science Park, our customers will have the ability to interconnect within a rich ecosystem of telecom organizations, Internet service providers, and cable companies. In addition, we are on track to deliver the first of three phases of our 27 megawatt campus in Frankfurt in the second half of 2017. We have seen significant demand from several customers, including the major global cloud service providers. We've also recently completed ISO certification of the newly acquired sites. Over the next quarter, we will be stabilizing our operations in the region and executing our business objectives. We also closed on the sale of our fully leased Saint-Denis data center in Paris during the third quarter, as well as the previously announced sale of a four-property domestic datacenter portfolio. We do still have three small assets held for sale on the balance sheet but the completion of the portfolio sale substantially concludes the capital recycling program we embarked upon in the second quarter of 2014. As I've said on several occasions, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott Peterson and his team have achieved on the sale of our non-core assets. Let's turn to the expansion of our product offerings on page four. We announced the launch of our Service Exchange at MarketplaceLIVE in September. Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secure connections to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. Service Exchange simplifies interconnection and makes access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable, and easier to use than ever before. Upon launching in November, Service Exchange will offer significantly greater performance, reliability and security for cloud services and data center access than the public internet. Service Exchange is powered by Megaport combining our respective core strengths. Digital Realty's high-availability datacenter offerings cover the spectrum from single rack co-location to multiple megawatt deployments around the world to suit our customers' current needs and to enable their future growth. Megaport, a leading provider of elastic interconnection has developed a platform that will keep pace with innovative cloud technologies and continue to expand to new markets. Service Exchange is critical to our customers. A recent survey from RightScale reports that 82% of enterprises are adopting a multi-cloud strategy citing security, managing multiple clouds and the lack of resources as the top three challenges of leveraging the cloud effectively. Service Exchange accelerates adoption of public and hybrid cloud architectures by simplifying private access to multiple clouds. Our Partners and Alliances program continues to grow, with several of our important partner sponsoring and participating in our very successful MarketplaceLIVE event, highlighting the value of our ecosystem to our partners. During the third quarter, we executed hybrid cloud transactions with one of the best partners that highlights the value of our global Connected Campus strategy. This program is expected to ramp up with our partner in the fourth quarter, as we launch our go-to-market campaign in several markets. In addition, with the announcement of Service Exchange, we are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our existing partners as well as several potential new partners seeking to incorporate the capabilities of Service Exchange into their own offerings. We are very excited about the expanded opportunities Service Exchange brings to our partnerships. Our pipeline via our Partners and Alliances program remains robust at approximately $40 million, and deals executed during the quarter grew our bookings by nearly 20% since the launch of our Partners and Alliances program in early 2015. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page five. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets, but so does net absorption as well as the level of pre-leasing on development pipelines. Demand is outpacing supply, competitors are behaving rationally, new entrants remain few and far between, and we are seeing healthy consolidation. In addition to our solid leasing volume during the third quarter, our forward funnel is similarly robust. Based on the current sales pipeline, there's a good chance we will be completely sold out of the remaining inventory on our existing campuses in Ashburn, Virginia, as well as Franklin Park in Chicago within the next couple of quarters. Given the current pace of absorption of the remaining inventory on our major connected campuses, we took steps to secure our supply chain and supply our customers future growth during the third quarter as shown here on page six with the acquisition of land parcels adjacent to our existing campuses in Ashburn and Chicago, as well as the site of a future campus in Garland, Texas once our Richardson campus is fully sold out. And now let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, whereas we appear to be edging closer to an interest rate tightening cycle in the U.S. As I've said many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. Similarly, we've built our organization to thrive, regardless of our environment, with irreplaceable global platform, a fortress balance sheet, and a deep bench of incredibly talented, hard-working employees. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on page nine. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We assigned new leases for space and power totaling $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter, including an $8 million co-location contribution. Our third quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win robust yet profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. Third quarter wins included top cloud service providers signing across multiple locations and multiple continents. They also included a smaller, but rapidly growing new customer signing across four different locations within North America alone. In addition, the team delivered an 18% increase in co-location and interconnection signings in the U.S. with our interconnection bookings representing a record quarterly performance since our acquisition of Telx and one of the top three quarters in Telx's history. I would like to pause here to point out that we have revised our headline total bookings presentation to include the contribution from interconnection. We will continue to provide precisely the same information and the same level of granularity, but we will now be including the interconnection contribution in our total bookings to more closely align our presentation with our peers. At the market level, there's a lot of excitement in Chicago these days. And I'm not just talking about the Cubbies. As Bill mentioned, we are nearing delivery and leasing of the last few megawatts on our Franklin Park campus and we have secured the adjacent land parcel to support our continued growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we took assignment of a bespoke co-location reseller customer's PBB lease for 83,000 rentable square feet at 350 East Cermak in downtown Chicago. And we also took ownership of data center improvements and infrastructure with a total of nearly six megawatts of capacity, an original cost basis of approximately $85 million and a current fair market value of approximately $35 million. As part of this transaction, we took assignment of 15 co-location customer leases and entered into a new agreement with a reseller to maintain a smaller footprint in the building. This transaction did not require us to make any material payment to the reseller and provides us with more than 4.5 megawatts of immediately available IT load and customer-ready space in our flagship Internet gateway which has remained north of 96% leased for the past six years. Finally, we recently kicked off a marketing and pre-leasing campaign to line up anchor tenants for a potential data center development project at 330 East Cermak on a land parcel adjacent to our existing property at 350 East Cermak. Turning to our backlog on page 10, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter. The weighted-average lag between third quarter signings and commencements remain healthy at four months below the historical average of roughly six months. Turning to renewal leasing activity on page 11, we retained 82% of the third quarter lease expirations and we signed $44 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was slightly positive with healthy cash mark-to-market on PBB, colo and non-technical space offset by a roll down on turnkey renewals. As expected, we did execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix that we've called out for the last couple of quarters, which drove the roll down on the third quarter turnkey renewals. We do still have several above-market leases remaining now primarily in the Northeast region. So, we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. On balance, however, we still expect re-leasing spreads will be slightly positive on a cash basis for full year 2016. In addition, we expect cash re-leasing spreads will also be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. In terms of our third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is down 50 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. As you can see from the occupancy bridge we provided here on page 12, the primary driver of the dip in portfolio occupancy was the acquisition of the sub-70% lease portfolio in Europe along with recent completions in space previously held for development that was placed in service during the third quarter. It's important to note that portfolio occupancy is measured on the basis of square footage, which does not always directly correspond it to invested capital. If you turn to the next slide on page 13, you'll see that the balance of available fully built-out inventory relative to total inventory as measured on the y-axis has been reduced more than half. This dramatic reduction in our finished inventory has been directly responsible for the 140-basis-point improvement we have achieved in our return on invested capital over the same period, which we believe is truly a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size. Let's turn to Telx here on page 14. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $97 million of revenue during the third quarter. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior two expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the third quarter. While the quarterly increase in revenue continued to accelerate, EBITDA remained relatively flat due to timing of spend related to marketing activities around MarketplaceLIVE and other initiatives as well as some costs associated with the final stages of our integration. We do expect enhanced revenue flow through going forward and incremental growth in EBITDA during the fourth quarter and on into next year. Key initiatives during the quarter included the launch of colocation at our Ashburn campus, expansion underway at multiple new locations in North America as well as MarketplaceLIVE. The strategy of the colocation and interconnection product line continues to be in focus on key facilities both interconnection hubs and connected campuses to drive growth and nurture awareness and understanding of the identified ecosystems. Many colocation customers may not be aware of key customers, vendors or partners that maybe easily accessed within the same building or Connected Campus. Identifying these natural magnets and leveraging their position within the connectivity ecosystem attracts and breeds growth. With respect to expanding our customer base, we have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the third quarter, the colocation and interconnection team added 34 new customers across a variety of market segments. Year-to-date through September, 113 new customers have been added. In terms of market expansions, our colocation and interconnection team is in the process of expanding its footprint across eight markets in North America, representing more than 5 megawatts of incremental capacity, not including the full transfer of 365 Main in San Francisco completed earlier this year. We launched colocation services on our campus in Ashburn, Virginia, during the third quarter. Funnel activity has met expectations, and new sales bookings have been positive. Capacity expansion is also underway in Atlanta and will leverage the existing (20:52) and connected customer base at 56 Marietta, allowing customers to reach a robust community of connectivity from the launch date through the use of diverse fiber extensions. Available capacity at 56 Marietta will be sufficient in the interim or customers may pre-purchase space and power as needed. Finally, MarketplaceLIVE 2016 was an overwhelming success with attendance at record levels. The enhanced format and expanded venue were well received by customers and provided excellent backdrop for the announcement of the launch of our new Service Exchange in partnership with Megaport. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and look forward to a continued progress, as we refine our go to market strategy to incorporate the ecosystem model, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and globally. At the one-year mark post-closing, we are on track to meet or exceed our underlying (21:53) targets and conclude the integration process. The volatility in currencies during the quarter and in recent weeks continues to create a headwind with regard to growth. FX represented a 100-basis-piont to 200-basis-piont drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on page 15. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to continue this FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling-denominated debt over the next several months as part of our corporate funding plan to term out our balance outstanding under our revolver at that time. This financing will further reduce our exposure to currency fluctuation, as we head into 2017. I would like to remind everyone that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy the data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage. Same capital cash NOI was up a little less than 1% on a reported basis and up a little more than 2% on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI growth is positive 3.6% on a reported basis. And we still expect to be well within the guidance range of 2.5% to 4% for the full year. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $1.44 for the third quarter, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, we reiterated core FFO per share guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 on a reported basis and constant currency guidance of $5.70 to $5.90, representing 8% and 10% growth respectively. Turning to the longer-term outlook on page 16 that we introduced on our Investor Day last October, you may recall that we got into a mid-to-high single digit FFO per share growth and double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. We're certainly tracking ahead of plan on both fronts, but notably, AFFO per share growth that has been driven by year-to-date operating outperformance, accretion from Telx, the continued reduction in straight-line rental revenue and lower than expected recurring CapEx spend. For the full year, we now expect to deliver 20% growth in AFFO per share. Longer-term, we do expect both FFO and AFFO per share growth to converge in the mid-to-high single digits, and we plan to give formal guidance for 2017, early next year. By way of preview, we do expect continued headwinds from the strong dollar and tougher comps due to a full year contribution from Telx, as well as the burn-off of the one-time benefits to AFFO in 2016. Absent external growth from acquisitions, which are inherently difficult to predict, we would expect to see somewhat slower growth in 2017 than 2016 in both earnings and cash flow per share. That being said, we have delivered positive year-over-year growth in core FFO per share and dividends per share each and every year as a public company and we do not expect 2017 will be any exception. Let's turn to the balance sheet beginning on page 17. As anticipated on our last call in July, we settled the bulk of our forward sale agreements during the third quarter, issuing 12 million shares and generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion, a portion of the net proceeds was used to permanently finance the European acquisition portfolio for approximately $874 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $320 million from the asset sales Bill described earlier and we recognized a gain on sale of $169 million during the third quarter. We also redeemed our 7% Series E Preferred Stock during the third quarter for approximately $290 million. We recognized a $10 million non-cash Topic D-42 charge for the write-off of the original issuance cost, which is an add-back to core FFO. We also prepaid $136 million of mortgage debt at a 5.9% weighted average interest rate during the third quarter. We expect to retire an additional $108 million at an average coupon a little north of 6% during the fourth quarter. We expect to fund this pay down by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into this past May. Upon retirement of the mortgage debt pre-payable during the fourth quarter, we will have just $3 million of secured debt remaining, or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. We have also proactively termed out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing, and as shown on page 18, floating rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding. Even in a rising rate environment, a 100-basis-point move in LIBOR would impact full year FFO per share by roughly $0.03 or less than 1%. Our leverage is likewise on target with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.1 times at September 30. Pro forma for the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements, debt-to-EBIDTA will be less than 5 times. Our balance sheet is poised for new investment opportunities consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Ed, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. First question comes down to guidance. Some of the assumptions moved around slightly; the one that you touched on was occupancy, and I was hoping maybe you can shed a little bit more light. You may have mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but on the overall reduction there in the assumption? And then, on the other side of things, it seems like you were ahead on a number of metrics and I would have thought ultimately that that would have contributed to better FFO growth on the year on a core basis, at least. Can you maybe just speak to those two points? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Jordan. So, maybe turning to the guidance first. We reiterated the same guidance as the previous quarter of $5.65 to $5.75 core FFO per share. There were some slight adjustments to some of the assumptions. We increased the EBITDA margin, I think, 50 basis points on the low end, a 30 basis point tweak on the G&A. The change to the year-end portfolio occupancy to being down was really a product of a few things. One, we're absorbing obviously the European portfolio assets into the total portfolio occupancy, and that number includes existing vacancy. That portfolio is roughly 66% leased as of the third quarter. Plus in addition to that, as you may have saw, we recently opened up our data tower in Amsterdam at the Science Park, which is a brand new, up to nine megawatts asset, which is part of this transaction that will also bring some vacancy into the quarter. And then the other major driver I'd say is, in connection with the transaction in Chicago in our 350 Cermak building where we took the assignment of a PBB lease, obviously that will go from a 100% occupied 83,000 square feet to a much lower occupied amount with the existing colocation customers in the suite. Net-net, we think that was a great transaction for not only for the exiting customer but really for Digital in terms of getting our hands on very valuable market-ready space in an incredibly hot market. That asset's been north of 96% for numerous years now. And then going to your second question, overall the quarter, I think depending on whose metrics, we either beat by a penny or met consensus estimates, but it was pretty much in line with our forecast. I think there was a handful of positive things that you probably were highlighting. The one thing I would say not negative but something that maybe put a little bit of drag on our third quarter growth was the increase in the G&A, which was probably related to onboarding the European portfolio, which was expected. I think an unexpected growth component of the G&A was some of the overall integration-related work on the onboarding from that acquisition which closed in early July and travel and work to bring that team into the fold, and probably some other activity around the or seasonally-related activity around our Marketplace Live initiative and other events. And the last thing I can think of off the top of my head, we did bring on two new board member during the quarter which has a little bit of incremental cost to the company, but I think they will be well worth it in the long run. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So, the question I had was around interconnection revenues, and I was interested in both the legacy Digital Realty properties as well as legacy Telecity over in Europe, and what are your plans or what's the progress towards phasing in the interconnects towards more of a recurring revenue stream? And then the follow-up is just looking at slide six, the land parcel slide made me wonder a little bit about Santa Clara, and how you view some of the opportunities there including maybe inorganic growth. And then any kind of update on Frankfurt's given that you have a building there and then you also have a new build that you've entered into, and so what are some of the plans that you have in that market? Thanks very much. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So, interconnection, Santa Clara, Frankfurt, I'll do the first one and then I'll toss the last two to Scott. On interconnection, we are obviously integrating and bringing on board not only eight great assets in the Dockland, (34:17) the Science Park and also in Frankfurt, but a really tremendous team and also a new leader to lead our EMEA region. Their interconnection model had a very significant portion of reoccurring revenue spend, or not exact type of productization, but similar recurring revenue model. There will be further alignment across the global portfolio in terms of our interconnection services as we move forward. We've experienced, as you saw, a very strong quarter for interconnection signings quarter-over-quarter. And I think that is hopefully going to continue, and I think you are going to find us continue on those eight parts of the portfolio we're expanding our colocation, interconnection footprint be it in existing Internet gateways where Telx has historical resided, or on our connected campuses like in Ashburn or Richardson or other pockets of the portfolio. And I'll turn the Silicon Valley question over to Scott Peterson. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: On Santa Clara, we all know that there is discussion about a portfolio that's available on the market there. And we look at every opportunity in the marketplace, as we all know. We'll always keep an eye on that to see whether we view it as being strategic and how well it integrates into our portfolio and if it represents a good economic value and a good investment for our shareholders. We have a couple of land sites, smaller land sites available for future development in Santa Clara. We continue to look for additional capacity in that market since it's a good market. I think anybody familiar with that would know it's a tough market from a land perspective, so we need to be very creative in terms of acquiring more inventory there. As far as Frankfurt goes, we're very pleased with the level of activity. We're getting in that market. I think it started off very strong, and we'll continue to propose that to a number of customers on that, and so we've been very happy with the progress there so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, it's Paul Morgan. Just on the Service Exchange rollout and your interconnection, your volumes, how should we think about the timing of the rollout into additional markets? It looks like you've got kind of about half the ones you planned through 2017? Is that a near-term in Europe and the rest of the U.S.? And then that $9 million, 16% of your bookings in the quarter that's a good number. How are you guys thinking about that as a share and as a potential growth rate going forward, especially after the Service Exchange roll out? Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. This is Jarrett. In terms of the Service Exchange, we're committed to an open environment. We've traditionally won business in the network-to-network, network-to-content, and network-to-enterprise verticals. This really gives us an opportunity to participate in the cloud ecosystem, which requires a new product offering and capability. So day one, we're announcing primarily our North America platform, but we're phasing it where we actually control the portal, we control the customer experience, and this allows our customers to essentially order virtual cross connects. So the phasing is largely deployed. We wanted to have colocation, interconnection, and our scale offerings, and now with the European assets we'll accelerate that as our second phase. So ultimately we'll have 15 markets, 24 data centers by second quarter of next year. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And then my other question... Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Maybe I'll... Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No, no, please, go ahead. If you want to say it again just to make sure we address it appropriately. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: No, I was going on to my follow-ups. If you have something more to say on interconnects, that's great. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I was just going to address I think to your question on the $9 million. So that's $9 million of total interconnection signings this quarter, we were $8 million or around $8 million last quarter. I am not sure we're going to continue that pace of quarter-over-quarter acceleration; it's quite rapid. But I think the key is continuing to bring on space at these very interconnection-dense locations as one part to spur additional interconnection revenue, and I think we're doing that by expanding in the likes of 56 Marietta, getting additional inventory in Cermak and other locations. And then I think the next leg of it will be leveraging the interconnection revenue that will come from the enterprise, the cloud, coming off the Service Exchange. But I think that second part will be more of a (39:27) later in the 2017 revenue generation. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks. And then just in terms of a couple of markets where you're committing capital for expansion, can you maybe comment on Northern Virginia and Chicago and the competitive environment there? You have some of your peers also doing the same. And I know what you've said about the demand-supply equilibrium now. But if you look into 2017 and 2018, how are you thinking about \u2013 give us an update how you're thinking about your preleasing and the future demand-supply balance? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Those were two particular markets, and we have a little bit of a \u2013 a little map in the deck of our campuses in Franklin Park in Chicago and obviously in Ashburn, Virginia. And based on pipeline signings we've completed to-date or through the end of the quarter, I should say, plus pipeline, there is a decent potential that we could be finishing out our existing (40:35) campus, the last 9377 building of Franklin Park and the last buildings on our Ashburn campus in the next several quarters, which should dovetail very well with the timing of deliveries of those parcels that are literally adjacent to the campus coming online. So those markets obviously are not without competition, but we seem to win our fair share and having a fairly robust pipeline in those two particular markets. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Hey, guys. Just maybe sticking with the Chicago market, you've got some land now in Franklin Park, you've got potential build-out next to the E Cermak and you took back some availability from the PBB tenant. Just curious based on your pipeline demand funnel, where are you seeing I guess more demand? Is it more downtown or is it in the Franklin Park area? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vin. It's Andy again. We're seeing the demand in both locations. It's just different types of demand and at obviously different price points. As I just mentioned \u2013 on Franklin Park you're typically catering to a customer that is looking for more affordable total cost of ownership, seeking large amounts of space and power, and likely seeking an economic model that's in the low $100s per kilowatts. If you're going down to Cermak, we're signing and filling up space, including the space we just took possession of, at rates that could be more than double that. And that customer is obviously not taking \u2013 likely taking one megawatts to two megawatts at a time, is taking smaller quantums. They could be around 300 kilowatts, 400 kilowatts, but they're really taking those small amounts of space and willing to pay those higher prices in order to have the connectivity that our Cermak building offers. So we're seeing I'd say different demand sets in both locations but both seem fairly strong. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just maybe a question on the bookings trends. Last quarter there was concerns about the slowdown in bookings and then you had also announced some activity in early 3Q and it was discussed as a timing issue. So you take the two quarters together, you're at the $40 million-ish mark, which is relatively close to what it was in the prior couple quarters. Given the fact that you now have additional availability here in Chicago, you've got a new head of sales in place, some other development availability on the European portfolio as well, I guess, should we expect some steady increases in those bookings numbers, or is there any reason to think that we wouldn't see that in the next several quarters? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's fair to say. There's no surprises on this end that we were not pleased with the second quarter, but if you look at the third quarter, which was a quarter that quite frankly we were without a global head of sales for two-thirds of it and had a tremendous effort by both Andrew Schaap and Tony Rossabi stepping up to deliver for us. Net-net, I was pretty happy where the third quarter came out. I think there are some key takeaways that when I look through it, it was somewhat in our script. The demand was robust and diverse. We weren't counting on one single customer to do a single 10-meg deal. We had numerous customers, we had cloud service providers, other parts of SMACC, IT service. The demand was in North America but also in Europe. It was probably one of our best signings quarter in Europe for several quarters now. A good chunk of those signings were actually in the London market post the Brexit vote, and those signings came not only from cloud service providers; they came from a disaster recovery firm, they came from an IT service firm. So lots of different demand drivers filling our existing signings in our funnel going into the fourth quarter. I wouldn't tell you I could bank on $55 million again in the fourth quarter, but I think when we have that pretty steady-eddie run rate trend \u2013 if you look back, and I think we have on our slide deck like a rolling LTM number that kind of looks how our trends are fairly smooth if you look over a long time period. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's \u2013 it's Scott here \u2013 that's page 21, I believe of the appendix. If you look at that, it does quarter-by-quarter on a trailing 12 months and you'll see that there's a much smoother line there, if you will. We always talk about the business being lumpy. So if you compare that with the signings in the main deck, you'll see how that smoothes out the lumpiness a little bit. The only one to take a look at is you'll see a little bump in early 2014, which is we had \u2013 kind of, we had very high signings when we were clearing through that excess inventory that had been built over the prior year-and-a-half or so. So that's a good illustration of how the \u2013 if you look over longer timeframes, the lumpiness gets smoothed out. Operator : Our next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good afternoon. If we think about the situation in Cermak where you took out that PBB customer, how many of those types of scenarios are you looking at across your portfolio where you might step in and do something like that? Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Manny, they are always kind of few and far between. It's a product of the expiration schedules of various customers, our demand in those locations. I would say they're somewhat of events where the stars and moon and sun have to align. In Cermak we had a very highly leased, high-demand building with a customer, due to some regulatory constraints was looking to exit that building. Their lease I think only had like a year-and-a-half or so to run on it, so there was a path to a transaction that was beneficial to them and obviously beneficial to us. There is a handful of other pockets in the portfolio where that may apply, but I wouldn't say that is something that we can necessarily count on in any regards. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then going back to the occupancy guidance, just to make sure that I and other people on the call understand this correctl, when you say down 150 basis points to 200 basis points, that's versus December 31 of last year, correct? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Correct. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And so right now you're roughly 150 basis points down already. So you're saying that you could go down another 50 basis points from here through year-end. Is that right? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We are saying we'll go down another... Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): 91.4%... John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Manny, this is John Stewart. We expect to be flat from here. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So the 89.9% where you ended is already at that guidance point? John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Correct. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great, thank you. I want to talk about the color commentary you gave on 2017 growth and how you anticipate it I think moderately slowing down. And I am just curious, is that based on just the trajectory of bookings and what's happened so far in 2016 and how you see that getting installed over the next few months and how that might make it more difficult to achieve the same growth in 2017 already at this point. Is it more a change in your expectation around market dynamics, whether it's in demand or pricing or is it perhaps even just a mix shift in terms of the assets you have now versus what you may have had going into 2016. And then I guess as a part of that, I was wondering if you can give some color on how the eight facilities that you acquired from Equinix/Telecity have been performing in terms of growth maybe over the last year, or any other color you can provide so we get a sense of what those assets look like in terms of their trajectory? Thank you. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Colby. The answer to your first question, those are some good ideas, but really, foreign currency is the biggest headwind. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we obviously look to hedge that with issuing sterling bonds, euro bonds, multi-currency revolver, and term loan. But there is obviously a spread between the yields on our assets and the cost of that debt. And that's \u2013 again, it's earnings translation risk, not economic risk. We're not repatriating capital in a meaningful way that we are having losses, but the FX I would say is the largest driver to that, I would say, sentiment preview. And then on the eight or so \u2013 on the eight European assets, five in London, two in Amsterdam, one in Frankfurt, maybe I will let \u2013 give Scott a chance to jump in on performance with the underwriting? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hi, Colby. Thanks. Yeah, so the performance since acquisition, it's only been a short time and so we've been very pleased with that performance. We're on track. If you looked at the performance prior to the acquisition, you saw \u2013 I think, your question was performance and specifically vacancy. You saw the vacancy there tick up a little bit and that was primarily the result of two large tenants migrating \u2013 customers migrating out of the portfolio, one of which came to us in our portfolio and the other one actually left and went to a \u2013 it was a gaming company that went closer to their corporate headquarters, geographically far away. But other than that the stickiness there has been pretty good and the velocity has been good too. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : And are those facilities growing at a rate similar, for example, to the Telx portfolio or is it more in line with the traditional DLRs, any color on that? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: From a utilization standpoint, probably a little closer to the Telx portfolio, if that's what you are... Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : I was talking about revenue growth. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Oh, revenue growth, it was \u2013 kind of \u2013 it's in between where we are and Telx. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sumit Sharma of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, everybody. Thank you for the transparency and the detail in the supplement and everything. Sort of a basic question in terms of, I guess, one of the things that we are wondering was the pricing per square foot or the GAAP rent per square foot for the new signings was kind of lower, down to $126 a square foot. I am struggling to figure out whether this is just regular way lumpiness and a function of product and geographic mix, or was there some pricing pressure that you saw? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would say it's more of a mix contribution. We had a significant amount of signings from several customers and I'd say one of our lower price point markets, be it Northern Virginia or Chicago versus prior periods where we might have had more signings in the Silicon Valley or other higher priced markets. Now, the \u2013 I wouldn't \u2013 it's tough to take the signings from the second quarter as a great comparable data point. That was obviously a very small sample set in terms of signings, but on apples-to-apples basis, I wouldn't say we're seeing tremendous pricing pressure. The rates are held in relatively flat and the $120s due to concentration in North America in those lower price point markets. And at those rates those signings are still as you can see from our active development pipeline generating returns on our invested capital, unlevered returns right in our target thresholds of 10.5% to 12.5%. Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. That's superb. If I could ask one more question. I guess in terms of your business mix which, roughly estimating the retail or the colo portion of the business is now or at least over 1Q and 2Q a little less than 30%. I guess, is there some kind of composition level that you foresee into 2017 or 2018? Do you see that go up to one-third or 35% or 40% in terms of just revenues? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: You know, it's \u2013 I would say there is no specific targeted mix that we have on the board that we're shooting for. And you are seeing very strong growth on both fronts. Obviously a substantial amount of our external growth had been acquisition of colocation-oriented, interconnection-oriented facilities over the last few years, which obviously moved that needle in addition to the organic growth associated with those acquisitions. But at the same time, a large chunk of our active development pipeline is developing scale projects, be it on our campus in North America and Asia, Australia or in Europe. And that is still a significant component to the growth. So I am not sure I could tell you the percentages are going to diverge one way or another. We're very focused on having the right assets and the right capabilities across all four continents to capture robust and profitable demand. Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very good. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Following up on that a little bit, it seemed like \u2013 with Q2 being light and 1Q was strong in terms of signings, but 3Q is very strong, it seems like the turnkey flex signings were of a bigger scale, a lot more square footage and I guess the average rent per square foot was a little bit lower. But on the colocation side, it seemed like the pricing was better and it seemed like there is some strength there. So kind of taking all this in, how would you characterize the environment for colocation and, I guess, the turnkey flex products? What are you seeing \u2013 where are you seeing strength or weakness? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So, the turnkey flex product is what we call scale or previously called wholesale. The bulk of the activity in North America or Northern Virginia, Chicago and Dallas was soft obviously with Silicon Valley kind of falling after that in terms of demand. And it's been \u2013 it was a robust quarter, and the pipeline for the fourth quarter remains robust as well. It's a significant amount of repeat business. It's a significant amount of multi-site business. It's a business where the customer is signing one-time on multiple continents with us. The size of the deals most recently kind of ranged from, call it, almost 1 meg to almost 4 megs in terms of size of scale deal. So there is some variability in that. Some of the bigger customers are taking bigger deployments. I already touched on some of the pricing trends there. On the colocation and interconnection side, you're really seeing, I think, the combinations of success really strategic internet gateway assets, a talented sales and marketing organization around them, executing on filling those assets up and these assets command higher prices given what they offer to the customers that decide to deploy in these locations. We, again, \u2013 we're in \u2013 we have a fairly targeted approach to our colocation interconnection efforts. We are not in all 50 states or 100 countries. We picked our spots to be in the internet gateway, the internet hubs or in select connected campuses which have connectivity to the cloud service providers for the enterprise. So, I think, where we picked our spots and how we tackled it, it's been able to generate pretty strong volumes at attractive rates have increase in the last quarter on the colo front. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And one quick follow-up, the European signings are strong. Was that legacy digital or was there any significant contribution from the Telecity-Equinix assets. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: The given \u2013 most of it is legacy digital. The colocation piece was contributed from the assets and the new team that joined the company. So, the 4 megs and $6.6 million of annualized revenue was legacy digital assets. Operator : And our last question for the call will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. So I guess, just my question is more around expectations for Dan. Give us an idea of what do you expect to see change on the sales force and what are sort of his mandate kind of out of the box? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: This is Bill. His initial mandate is going to be to fully integrate the Telx Equicity (59:14) and Digital sales teams and create the appropriate efficiencies there, and then develop the right go-to-market, working off of what the team has developed, and then further to push on the partners and alliances front. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So with that, if we were to see better growth than sort of what the Street has modeled next year, would that entail hiring more sales people, and what would have to \u2013 what would change to see better than Street growth next year? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So Dan hasn't come on board yet, so I'm not going to give him his budget whether it's a lower head count or a higher head count, and we haven't talked revenues yet either. So he starts next week. So, I think, we're premature there. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein, CEO for any closing remarks. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Ed. I would like to wrap up our call today by recapping our third quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 19. We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution, against our strategic plan. We continue to extend our global footprint with the closing of the European portfolio acquisition. We further enhanced our product offerings with the announcement of the launch of our service exchange. We're also continuing to deliver outsized growth in AFFO per share. And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering used to redeem high coupon preferred equity and secured debt. In conclusion, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you at Madrid in a few weeks. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. 2016 was a very good year for Digital Realty. We delivered solid execution against each of the objectives of our strategic plan outlined here on page 2 of our earnings deck. We remain focused on realizing the highest possible risk adjusted returns. We achieved a 30 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital in 2016, bringing the cumulative three year gain to 180 basis points. Given the size of our asset base, we believe this represents a meaningful movement of the needle since 2013. We made substantial headway towards the successful integration of Telx. We also closed on another strategic acquisition, a portfolio of eight high-quality carrier-neutral data centers in Europe. This acquisition was accretive, prudently financed and coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index. We also advanced our goal of diversifying our product offerings, with the launch of our Service Exchange in November, the continued growth of our Partners and Alliances Program and the expansion of our colocation footprint beyond the original 20 Telx locations. We also made solid progress towards our goal of achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share. We hit our target for 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion two years ahead of plan. We also beat the high-end of our original guidance range, delivering 9% growth in core FFO per share and 22% growth in AFFO per share. Both metrics are on an as reported basis. On a constant currency basis, FFO per share growth would be in double-digits and AFFO per share growth would be north of 23%. Just, as importantly, we were able to achieve this growth without levering up. In fact, we actually reduced leverage by almost half-a-turn in 2016. We initially unveiled these three year guidepost at our Investor Day in October 2015. Please mark your calendars for the 2017 edition in New York on December 5. By way of preview, our priorities going forward will be geared towards further developing our considerable base of talent to come together as one fully integrated team centered around our customers. Let's take a closer look at the expansion of our product offerings on page three. As you know, we launched our Service Exchange last November. Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secured connections to multiple cloud service providers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. Service Exchange provides more value to our customers by simplifying interconnection and making access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable and easier to use than ever before when we went live in 43 facilities across eight markets in November and we are on track to rollout another 17 sites across another nine markets in 2017. In addition, we will be again offering Layer 3 capabilities during the second quarter. Layer 3 capabilities are a requirement to enable enterprise customers to reliably consume SaaS or Software-as-a-Service offerings from a private cloud environment. This means that our customers will be able to realize the benefits of a full suite of public cloud services, including infrastructure, platform and Software-as-a-Service, without incurring exposure of a traditional public Internet connection. In a nutshell, this offering will allow our customers to realize the benefit of the public cloud without the complexity or security issues associated with hybrid cloud architectures. In addition to the launch of Service Exchange, we saw an acceleration of our activity in our Partners and Alliances Program during the fourth quarter with a pickup in bookings on our Direct Link Colocation offering with IBM Bluemix as well as a significant back-to-back transaction with a leading IT services provider supporting a publicly-traded healthcare service provider. I'm pleased to report that our level of activity continues to grow, particularly where we are able to combine our capabilities with those of our partners like the Direct Link Colocation offering with IBM. These programs highlight our unique competitive differentiation with our ability to offer customers a full spectrum of data center solutions from a single cabinet all the way up to multi-megawatt deployments. We are pleased with the early progress of our Partners and Alliances Program and we are looking forward to taking it to the next level in 2017 under Dan Papes' leadership. You may recall that Dan joined us this past year in November as Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27 year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business. In addition to Dan's experience leading large global direct sales teams, he has significant channels and alliances experience, having led the global cloud and data center business at a $6 billion global IT distributor. As I said, we are excited about the prospects for meaningful growth in our channel program under his leadership. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page four. Just last week, Cisco reported that global mobile data traffic grew an estimated 63% in 2016. Looking ahead, Gartner projects that the shift to the cloud will either directly or indirectly impact $1 trillion of IT spending by the year 2020. JLL reports that several major cloud providers anticipate that they will need to triple their existing infrastructure by 2020 to meet that demand. We are as confident as we've ever been in the long-term demand profile. While cloud leasing activity may have been somewhat front-end loaded in 2016, the long-term trend is clearly marching up and to the right. The outsized leasing volume in the first half of last year grow record absorption for the data center sector in 2016. Current market vacancy rates are in this mid-single digits in most core markets and demand continues to outpace supply. Deal sizes are getting bigger and lumpier, and they no longer have the same cadence. And the biggest and lumpiest deals do not necessarily translate to the most value creation. For our part, we're taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global Connected Campus footprint. Our competitors are largely behaving rationally. But we have seen an uptick in fresh capital targeting the sector. To-date, recent investments have mostly been focused on stabilized assets, perhaps reflecting a tacit acknowledgment that barriers to entry maybe higher that meets the eye. The floodgates have opened for data center packages coming to market, but the supply of products on the market has not depressed pricing. In fact, values have firmed considerably. Cap rates are in the sixes, and EBITDA multiples are in the mid-teens. This can be somewhat of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has very positive implications for the value of our existing portfolio, and it makes our recent acquisitions look particularly compelling. On the other hand, it also makes it harder for us to achieve external growth through acquisitions, and it potentially introduces new competitors. In summary, development pipelines are active, but pre-leasing is healthy, market vacancy is tight, current construction is concentrated in core markets characterized by robust leasing velocity, and the scars of the lifecycle are still fresh. Now, let's turn to the macro environment on page five. The economic outlook has improved over the last 90 days, although the timing and ultimate outcome of future policy remains uncertain. Despite the improved outlook, it's still a low growth world, and competition is fierce for the pockets of growth, excuse me, that do exist. We believe we have a set of key competitive advantages, namely, our Global Platform, our brand, our operational track record, and our fortress balance sheet that give us a significant leg up on would be competitors. That certainly doesn't mean that we can rest on our laurels. We must continue to innovate, continuously improve and provide even greater value to our customers. As you've heard me say many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. We consider ourselves very fortunate to be beneficiaries of highly disruptive technological trends like the shift to the cloud, e-commerce and driverless cars. Over time, we expect property types that are levered to the digital economy will become increasingly core holdings. Not only do we have the good fortune to be operating in a growth industry, but we believe that we have the best platform. We are well-positioned to come together as one team oriented around our customers and capitalize on unique opportunity in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over the Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. Our total bookings for the fourth quarter were approximately $33 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $7.5 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $25 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $7 million colocation contribution. Our fourth quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win a robust, get profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. Fourth quarter wins included multiple top cloud service providers signing across multiple continents. They also included strong customer demand from several of our other key verticals, including cable and network, a rapidly growing ridesharing company, connected caller applications, IT service providers and a few diverse customers within our financial services vertical. We added a total of 50 new logos during the fourth quarter. The lion's share of these new logos were landed by our colocation and interconnection business which has consistently contributed more than $13 million of bookings every quarter since our acquisition of Telx in late 2015. This consistent performance helps smooth out some of the lumpiness inherent in our traditional large footprint leasing particularly in the hyperscale age. The complementary nature of the colocation and interconnection business with our existing platform was a key part of the strategic rationale for the Telx transaction. That rationale has been proven out over the first year of our stewardship as shown on the M&A scorecard here on page 8. The Telx business generated $99 million of revenue during the fourth quarter, although revenues remain split 50-50 roughly, interconnection continues to outpace colocation with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. We expect interconnection revenue will grow faster in 2017 than 2016. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $42 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. We made substantial headways towards realizing the embedded growth potential within the Telx portfolio as evidenced by the 480 basis point pickup in same-store utilization. This successful lease-up enabled us to achieve 99% of our full year 2016 revenue target. Executing on our revenue plan combined with our performance and operational and corporate cost containment enabled us to significantly exceed our full year 2016 cash EBITDA target of $148 million prior to synergies in addition to our $15 million expense synergy target. We also laid the ground work for realization of revenue synergies in 2017 and beyond as we began the process of expanding our colocation and the interconnection footprint across eight markets in North America, representing nearly 7 megawatts of incremental capacity. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and we look forward to continue progress as we refine our go-to-market strategy, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and across our global Connected Campus network. In terms of the portfolio of eight European data centers we acquired last year, we are likewise well underway towards a smooth integration. We're able to consolidate all the corporate employees from the acquired business into our existing office. And Rob Coupland, who's appointment as Managing Director for the region was announced last September, is now managing one team out of our combined European headquarters on Gracechurch Street in London. We are stabilized and on track with our initial underwriting assumptions. By the end of 2017, we expect to have fully integrated the eight new properties into our portfolio. Turning to our backlog on page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $78 million. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements reminded healthy at just three months, well below the historical average of approximately six months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We retained 75% of fourth quarter lease expirations, roughly in line with our historical average, and we signed $47 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. Cash re-leasing spreads were positive 3.5% for the fourth quarter and positive 2.6% for full year 2016. During the quarter cash re-leasing spreads were positive across all property types, including a solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals. We do still have pockets of above market rents remaining throughout the portfolio, primarily in the Northeast region. So, we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. On balance, however, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2016, and we expect cash re-leasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially to 89.4%, primarily due to taking assignment of a colocation reseller customers PBB lease at 350 East Cermak in Chicago, which we discussed on our third quarter call. We are actively negotiating the lease for roughly 25% of the former customer's capacity that will bring us back to breakeven, and we expect to create additional value for our shareholders from lease-up of the rest of this capacity over the next several quarters. You may recall, as part of this transaction, we took ownership of the former customer's data center improvement and infrastructure with an original cost basis of approximately $85 million, and a current fair market value of approximately $30 million. This transaction explains the bulk of the $33 million of other revenue on the face of our P&L this quarter. The gain on this lease termination is included in NAREIT defined FFO, but is excluded from core FFO. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the fourth quarter, and FX represented a 150 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Although our global footprint does expose our reported earnings to currency translation movements, it enables us to satisfy the growing data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we view as a key competitive advantage. Same capital cash NOI growth was flat for the fourth quarter and up 1.4% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, same capital cash NOI growth was a positive 2.7% on a reported basis, and up 3.6% on a constant currency basis. For 2017, same capital cash NOI growth is expected to be similar to full year 2016, both as reported and on a constant currency basis. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $5.72 for the full-year, an increase of nearly 9% on a reported basis, and up a little over 10% on a constant currency basis. Growth in AFFO per share was better than 20% for the full year, driven by greater cash flow contribution from our core business, accretion from the Telx acquisition, continued burn-off of straight line rent and lower than expected recurring CapEx spend. Our current AFFO payout ratio is sub-70%, and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital, the current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. As usual, we expect our board of directors will revisit the dividend policy at the February Board Meeting later this month. In 2017, we expect AFFO per share growth to much more closely match FFO per share growth. None of these assumptions underline our 2017 guidance have changed since we provided our initial outlook just over a month ago. And we are reiterating guidance for 2017. Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning with our sources and uses here on page 12. During the fourth quarter, we prepaid $108 million of mortgage debt at a weighted average coupon of a little over 6%. We now have just $3 million of secured debt remaining or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. Subsequent to year-end, we retired the final $50 million tranche of the 5.73% Prudential Unsecured Senior Notes at maturity in January. Our 6.625% Series F of Preferred Stock is callable in April and we expect to fund the $182.5 million redemption by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares, subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May. Aside from the remainder of the forward equity offering and barring any unforeseen acquisition activity, our plan does not contemplate any additional common equity issuance in 2017. Even so, we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA will remain below five times throughout the entire year. We also expect to capitalize on the current strength of the data center investment sales market by continuing to prune our portfolio and selling up to another $200 million of assets this year. In addition, we expect to generate approximately $400 million of cash flow from operations after dividends. Finally, we expect to raise another $500 million of long-term fixed rate financing later this year. As you can see from the bubbles in the map on page 13, we have the most foreign currency exposure to the British pound. Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to further our FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling denominated debt later this year. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we've also mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Over the course of the year, we brought our floating rate debt exposure down by more than a half to a little less than 10% of total debt outstanding at year-end, as shown in the pie charts on the right side of page 14. On the left side of the page 14, it appears that we have \u2013 it is apparent that we've also cleared the runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall thereafter. Finally, we reduced leverage from 5.2 times at the end of 2015 to 4.8 times at the end of 2016. Our balance sheet is primed for growth consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Certainly, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So, my first question is on M&A and if you could comment on the remaining milestones as you integrate the new European assets and as well the kind of the many potential that you see in enhancing interconnection revenues there? And then if you could also maybe talk about your views on further inorganic growth in Europe or elsewhere? There has obviously been a lot of recent M&A transactions where you did not participate. And then I've got a follow-up. Thank you. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, Jonathan. Hi, Scott here. I think Andy touched on a couple of those items here, but I'll just go over them again. We're off to a great start with the EMEA portfolio that we acquired. We're on track with our underwriting there. The overall EMEA team has been fully integrated under the Digital Realty umbrella and that was finalized in the fourth quarter, so that's going well. In 2017, we will focus on integration of systems and processes. Over there, we are migrating the Amsterdam one connectivity ecosystems over to Science Park tower. And we have our colo expansion plans into new locations in the European market, are underway. We're seeing good customer activity and we're cross-selling products and I think all that bodes well for revenue synergies. On the cross-connect, so I think it's reasonable to view the growth there is going to be a little more modest than it would be by U.S. standards. The European market is structurally different as it relate to that. So, I think that you temper the expectations there. I think it's more common to see kind of 5% to 10% of revenues coming out of cross-connects in these European assets. On further inorganic M&A, as we always say, we look at everything. We're looking for opportunities that are strategic and complementary, that we can prudently finance and represent a good investment value for our shareholders. And by that we mean accretive. I think as a general statement that I can say that we are not looking to acquire assets just to get bigger. And many of the opportunities that were out there presented \u2013 really had neither a strategic value nor represented good value until it's easy for us to be interested observers on those. But I think we're going to remain disciplined in our approach to this. And we're not going to jump on any opportunities that will really only serve to make us bigger and not better. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then, maybe switching gears for Dan Papes. I wondered if you could maybe summarize how you see your priorities over the coming quarters now that you've been onboard for a few months. Thanks. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Jon. Jon, it's been a very busy three months for me since joining Digital Realty. And we've gotten a lot done and it will inform my priorities just to tell you the things that we've been focusing on in those three months. Very pleased to see the level of talent that we have across the organization. I've also brought some new people in as well and have a few more coming. So we'll strengthen our team even more. We've also taken that talent from three entities, really, and turned it into one. We had Telx skills and Digital skills and Telecity skills and we've taken the best of all of them and turned that into one global sales organization. So, in the coming quarters we'll leverage that to generate some meaningful growth for the business. We really are now one global team and we're taking our portfolio to market that way. We actually just had a successful kickoff last week of the integrated team. And I'm very pleased with how quickly our team has jelled. We also have reorganized our go-to-market organization around our customers and our markets. And are now going to market in the form of verticals that specialize in the unique ways that each of those vertical customers buy. We're providing solutions to them. We're not going to market by geography or by products. We're trying to help our customers meet new opportunities and solve challenges that they have in their businesses. Another major priority for me, Bill mentioned it several times in his opening statements, is Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances. We believe that there is meaningful upside for us in that business. And so we're going to put a special emphasis on that, and invest significantly from a go-to-market perspective in that space. It allows us to reach many new customers that we might not otherwise have been able to reach and it allows us to do that at a much lower cost of sales. And so, we see the opportunity to generate benefits for ourselves, for our partner \u2013 those who partner with us, as well as our customers in the end. So, all of this, we believe \u2013 as we focus on it in the coming quarters, will be good for our business and it will position us to capitalize on our comprehensive platform to generate future growth. Operator : And the next question will come Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up Dan, if I could on the Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances emphasis that you're going to have. And just to ask you if there is some kind of metric by which we can sort of track you or benchmark you, where we could start to understand the opportunity in the Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances area? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes. So, what I can \u2013 as we develop the program, we can probably give you more specific metrics. We are just launching the new emphasized approach to it. We've already seen good results, as you saw from the Direct Link Colo, as we talked about the deal with IBM on Direct Link Colo, which actually generated about $3 million in TCV last year, but giving you a comprehensive set of financial targets and number of partners around that will be something I think we'll be able to give you in the coming quarter. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I think... Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And, Jordan, just to add on there, just chime-in for one second. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And, I think we had \u2013 to be fair, we've had some successful partners in the last quarter, new partner that landed a fairly sizable deal with us in North America, supporting a publicly-listed healthcare company. I think one of the financial elements I think you'll see, and be it \u2013 Dan's been here for three months, so don't count on it tomorrow. But an acceleration of sales and revenue on the back \u2013 without a commensurate acceleration of sales head count is a way to financially see our results for the partners and channels kind of bearing fruit. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. Thanks, Andy. The other question I had was, I guess, Andy, you talked about IX growing at a faster rate in 2017, I thought maybe you could expand on that? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So we \u2013 on a year-over-year basis, we've \u2013 our interconnection revenue, it's grown more than double \u2013 just more than double-digit, just because we've added some incremental capacity. But on just a pure same-store basis it's kind of low-teens, outpacing the pure colocation growth. And, well, I would say kind of part and parcel with our expanding the footprint and the opportunities for additional colocation, interconnection opportunities. We expect a modest pickup in that growth, in the revenue on a year-over-year basis. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. You mentioned in your comments about the balance sheet and the leverage coming down to 4.8 times. As you look into the possibility of rates being where they are or higher, how does that affect the target leverage that you want to achieve over the next few years and how you're looking at the balance sheet funding development? And then just secondly on the point of development, I think your guidance flagged about $800 million to a $1 billion of development for 2017. The construction in progress that's left to go later on in the disclosures is, I think a little over $600 million. And I'm curious if you could talk a bit more about bridging those two and the types of opportunities that you might be looking at? Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Mike, I'll take \u2013 try to take both of those. So, on the balance sheet standpoint, we have a financial strategy of kind of having a balance sheet that's positioned for growth; and we kind of first and foremost target a leverage metric around 5-ish times debt to EBITDA. Now it's gotten \u2013 in the past it's been a little bit higher than that, probably up to 5.5 times. Today, we stand kind of a little below that, roughly 4.8 times. We philosophically think for our business mix and being an active developer, that's the right way to run the capitalization of the company. We are also hopeful though of obviously a rising rate environment finally coming to bear. And the way we try to think about protecting against that is one, minimizing our floating rate debt as much as possible. So today we stand, I believe 10% of our debt is floating rate, which is primarily borrowings outstanding under our revolver and that's been literally cut in half over the last year. And two, mitigating our maturity risk, so kind of matching the duration of our cash flows and our assets with long-term fixed rate debt financing. So if you look at our debt maturity schedule, you won't see much of any debt covenant due before 2020. And then thereafter we try to stagger the bars, so that we're not kind of putting any risk on the balance sheet. And those things hold for me as the CFO in a rising rate environment or quite frankly in many different rate environments. Going to your second question, the CapEx spend, the CapEx implied by the guidance at the end of the year relative to where we came out. Quite honestly, probably we're trending sub to the midpoint of that guidance going into the end of the year. It's really a product of timing. We \u2013 some projects slipped over into 2017, let's call it maybe a $100 million of that spend is kind of a calendar year slip. We are still seeing that even with that we did have a marked increase in CapEx year-over-year spent from 2015 to 2016 and our 2016 to 2017 midpoint does imply another increase. I think that's a product of two things. We've had a fair bit of success on the scale side of the business, building our campuses, expanding our customer footprint and helping them grow to the various buildings we have on other campuses. And 2017 and onto 2018 is going to have two new more demonstrative markets that they really had no contribution in prior years with Frankfurt, Germany in Europe and Osaka, Japan in Asia. Operator : And the next question will come from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, LLC: Thanks. Hi, guys. I was hoping we could touch on Brexit and just I'm wondering if you're seeing any clarity in terms of how tenants are starting to think about managing that. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hi Lukas, it's Bill. We \u2013 post Brexit, we actually signed a fair number of deals in London, while before Brexit we hadn't done much business at all. So I think, from that standpoint, Brexit perhaps has been good for the London market. But having said that we are building in Frankfurt and Amsterdam, and we're definitely seeing demand in both of those markets as well. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, LLC: Great. And then, also could we just touch on real quickly the integration costs, is that all of the European portfolio, is some of that Telx and then just how are those integration costs tracking relative to your initial expectations? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. This quarter the integration costs are more heavily weighted towards the European portfolio. Quite frankly, a large chunk of it is \u2013 we hired a consultant firm to kind of help us through the integration process. So we have outside third-party advisors, with that domain expertise across all the multiple functions that touch the combined company. So a large of that is paying consultants to kind of help us facilitate that integration. There maybe a little bit on the Telx side on that, but I would say that's not a larger or a material amount to spend. And in terms of tracking, we've always set budgets at the time of the acquisition and then refresh moving into our 2017 spend. I'd say we're tracking slightly below budget, but overall these are not massive dollar spends in any regards in terms of integration. I think especially as it relates to the European portfolio, where it was really an absorption of their team without tremendous overlap given their colocation interconnection expertise and our scale expertise. So, it's not a huge dollar integration bucket to begin with. Operator : The next question will be from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : Great. Two questions, if I may. When I look at your bookings in 2015 versus 2016, excluding interconnect, they're roughly flat at about $127 million. And as the company has gotten bigger, when you look at what you're targeting in terms of growth expectations, what is the new reset on where bookings should be? I appreciate that there is a $33 million this quarter and I appreciate that they will be lumpy, but when we look in 2017, can you give us any color in terms of what you consider to be \u2013 what you consider to be hitting your bookings target? Also as it relates to the dividend, I appreciate that the board is going to be meeting later this month to go over that. But can you talk about the AFFO payout ratio in terms of where you'd be comfortable with that and ultimately where you can potentially go? It seems like there's potentially an opportunity here to increase the dividend at a greater rate in 2017 than we saw last year. Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe I'll touch on the dividend first. So on the dividend, obviously, as you know, it is ultimately in the board's hands and management will make a recommendation to the board to accept or approve. But as you've seen from the growth in our cash flow and our AFFO, and where our payoff stands today, I think there is a fairly decent chance that the dividend increase will accelerate or be greater than the prior year's dividend increase. While \u2013 with the one caveat being this, Colby, that while we're not the developer, I do view retaining capital as an attractive source versus going out to the market. So every dollar I can retain and redeploy into our active development pipeline that we develop to 10 to 12 returns is an accretive use of that capital. So I don't think you'll see our payout ratio move wildly. At the same time, I do think the dividend is going to increase a little bit more this year than last year. When I talk about signings, I mean, we have internal numbers where we have really market-by-market based on what we see the pipeline demand, and how that lines up with our available supply and our timing of bringing new supply coming onboard. We obviously did not give you that \u2013 a line item for that in our table, in our guidance, although we do give a fairly robust disclosure. It's something that's a little bit subjective, because as you move through the year, different markets heat up and different markets cool down, and different lines of our business be it scale or colo kind of move in the same degree. So, we're interested in focusing on winning demand at attractive rates to generate profitable returns on our capital. My goal was more and more every quarter, the best I \u2013 the most I can. I don't think we have like a specific internal goal we want to share, as in terms of a leasing volume number here on this call. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company : I'm trying to \u2013 I guess what I'm trying to do is, you guys I think are targeting mid-to-high-single digits FFO per share growth each year. And at this juncture, with the company the size that it is now, I guess I am trying to just triangulate back to \u2013 what we need to see from a bookings perspective over \u2013 again, not on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I appreciate that lumpiness, but on an aggregate year basis, what that might be, but I guess that's something we'll have to try and look at it a little bit more. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Listen, Colby, what I would say is, listen, we've just finished the fourth quarter. Some of the fourth quarter signs obviously have implications on the rest of how 2017 goes. We're halfway through the first quarter. And right here on this call we're reiterating our guidance that we gave you on January 3. So based on everything we've signed in 4Q, based on everything we know we signed so far in 1Q, we think we're on a signings momentum or velocity that's going to generate that FFO growth you just mentioned. Operator : The next question will come from Richard Choe of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - \u200eJ.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you. Following up on that a little bit. In terms of colocation and interconnection it seems like signings have been very steady and that has pretty good visibility. The Turn-Key Flex seems to be a lot more volatile. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in the pipeline, kind of, longer-term that maybe makes you feel better about potential signings in the future in that section? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Richard. I'd say the pipeline looks pretty good. To give you a data point, our investment committee used to meet every other week. Now we meet every week. Same amount of time in those meetings and that's really to discuss the deals that are in front of us. So, it's a good pipeline. There is no question about that. Dan, I don't know if you have anything you'd like to add? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No. I would just reiterate. It's a good pipeline and we're awfully busy getting those proposals out the door. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: But I will say too, Richard, that there is no question that on average the scale deals are higher. There was a... Richard Y. Choe - \u200eJ.P. Morgan: And then you said that they're getting more complicated and lumpy, but that doesn't mean that they are dying down at all. It's just taking longer to kind of get through these deals. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No, no, but they're bigger. On average they're bigger. Richard Y. Choe - \u200eJ.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to touch base on the Dallas market. There's been a lot of press about that market being particularly strong or expected to be particularly strong this year. Just curious if you could share your thoughts on that market from what you're seeing both on demand and the supply side. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vin. This is Andy. I'm pretty sure you're referring to an article that described Dallas as 2016 Chicago. I would say a little bit different dynamic there. It feels like there's more competitors. There's more competitors with supply. At the same time, we've had some pretty good traction recently in terms of signings in that market and pipeline of additional deals in that market. But I have not seen anything that necessarily unlock the flood gate in Dallas. And you can just pull up public disclosure you'll notice that it does have a fairly wide competitive set that we're competing within that market. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Got it. Okay. And next question is really going back to the same capital side of things. I mean that there has been some slowing trends there for the last few quarters, I think ended up at the low-end of the guidance range for 2016. But just curious if you could just comment on what is sort of driving that deceleration outside of FX, obviously. And then, maybe talk about the changes in the same-store pool now with Telx being in there. How that changes the comparisons year-over-year? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So I think that the thing you didn't mention, which is a little bit of anomaly is that the fourth quarter had a 1.4% constant currency growth quarter-over-quarter. I would say it's probably another 100 basis point higher than that due to some anomalies around some tax assessment or refunds I should say that we received in the prior year, which makes for a tough comp. And we did receive some impact from that PBB lease we took back and obviously are re-leasing right now. So it's probably 100 basis points higher than the 1.4% on a constant currency basis. On a full year basis, I think, we're towards the higher end of our initial guidance at 2.7% as reported and 3.6% constant currency, so fairly happy with that. I would say it was a smaller pull this year because we tried to be intellectually honest with how we treated Telx in that analysis. Moving to 2017, I'd say the biggest impact will be including the Telx contribution, will be the pooling that's a lot more meaningful and the larger component of our company. So it will give you a better read through as to same capital look for all more of digital than it did during 2016. Operator : And the next question will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. When you look out at the various markets that \u2013 where you're operating, are you seeing any sort of rational behavior either in pricing or market entry? What is that looking like? And then, now what areas can we expect you to emphasize going forward, both sort of inorganic and an organic growth? You have various types of assets. What should we expect you to put most of the emphasis on going forward? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Frank. On the market question, I mean, first of all, New Jersey continues to be our weakest market. I wouldn't say that there is irrational pricing there. There just is weak demand. I think where you find potentially irrational pricing is when there is a significantly sized deal, a very large deal that you'll find people that \u2013 who price very competitively for those. What was your second question? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: The areas to emphasize organic and inorganic growth. And I think \u2013 Frank, I think I touched on a little bit too is, we're still focused on opportunities that are strategic to our business and also represent a good investment value for our shareholders and not focus on things that are just going to make as bigger. So, good examples of those are some of the opportunities out there have been just a collection of assets. And they've been very fully priced. And, frankly, I'm kind of surprised that how full the pricing has been in the market given the supply of assets that have been up there for sale. And I think that's a testimony to the strong investor appetite for our data center assets. But we do try to focus on the more strategic ones. Anything that's just a collection of assets of two, three, four, just pure data center assets that are fully priced relative to our cost of capital aren't particularly attractive because all it does is let us get bigger and it increases the denominator and dilutes our future growth. So, we don't find those particularly exciting because we can develop those on our own. So, again, we will focus on opportunities that we believe are strategic and we can generate some synergies out of and also are attractively priced relative to our cost of capital and represent an accretive transaction as well as something that we can prudently finance. So, we're going to stick to our discipline going forward as we have in the past. And I hope it continues to play out for us the way it always has. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will be from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Yeah. I just kind of have one question. Looking at the re-leasing spreads on your Turn-Key Flex portfolio, still positive, they were good this quarter. I'm curious what year those leases were initially signed and one thing that I want to get at is, I know about four years ago 2013 was when rents really took a dip and I'm wondering when we're going to start to renew those leases and if we should expect re-leasing \u2013 when we should start to expect to re-leasing spread kind of ramp up as those rents what I presume are below where current market was \u2013 were leased and when they renew? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jon, this is Andy. So, I don't have a pinpoint on the actual year for those leases. I would say they both probably go back call it 5 to 10 years. I don't think \u2013 I mean, as you look through our Turn-Key, which is predominantly larger footprint, longer-term leases, they almost all have some type of annual escalation of call it 2%, 2.5%, 3% over that duration, be it 7 or 10 years. So they've been increasing for many years now. We have not gone to a point where we've had massive spiky uplifts upon the cash mark-to-markets. I think that's a product of being on the scale customer, they're bigger deals, they've had escalations for a longer time period and I don't think we've gotten to the expiration or the extension time for really trough rates yet at least. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Do you have any sense about \u2013 you're saying \u2013 so essentially I should take 2013, add 5 to 10 years, so we're still two or three years away from really seeing that, those rents roll. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: It feels like it, but I would say that the payments are little bit \u2013 the customers will very often come, they want to come and do a long-term extension well before their actual contractual extension. So there is potential for customers to come early to do renewals, but it does feel like what you're looking for maybe a couple of more years out there. Operator : The next question will be from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just revisiting the revenue guidance. I guess there is a, about a 5% delta there in the range, about a $100 million. I'm just curious what would you say the key variables are in terms of execution or may be just the market environment that \u2013 to get you to the high end of the revenue guide this year? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Matt. I would \u2013 I mean, I would say the key variables on that range are one of execution rate and it's probably more on the scale side execution and then the colocation interconnection side in our \u2013 performance just given the mix of our business, and the stacks of the size of the deals on the scale side, can be \u2013 tend to be a lot larger and bigger impactors. And the other thing, I would say, FX, I believe, could have another impact there. And going back several years, you probably wouldn't have heard us talk about this much, but we're living in an environment where the pounds drop from a $1.45 to $1.20, and we have a large piece of our business in the UK, that obviously has a \u2013 can create a large headwind to our top line growth. Now, as I mentioned, we hedged that having, new \u2013 to couple sterling bond offerings north of $1 billion dollars, there's multi-currency revolver and term loan so that headwind doesn't 100% flow through to our bottom line, but it would \u2013 can put some variability into the top line growth. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then one follow-up on the development pipeline. It looks like you had a couple of fully leased projects slip out of there, but pretty good increase on a sequential basis, and I think it's higher here than I've seen in quite a while. I guess \u2013 what's your sort of line of sight into having that pool substantially leased up by the time those assets are released into the stabilized pool? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So, the deliveries you mentioned \u2013 sorry, go ahead, Matt. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess by the time they're delivered? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So, the deliveries you mentioned that came out of the pool on the scale side I believe were 88% leased. So, they're almost 90% leased by the time we actually finished the construction of the building. We have a slide in the deck that kind of highlights our three North America core active development markets that did 10 to 15 megawatts per month in the last 12 months of deliveries and those are all kind of 88 to 94 or so percent leased upon the time we opened up. You are correct, the active development pipeline has increased a fair bit. I think it's a roughly $250-ish million versus the prior quarter in terms of total projects. That includes some of those \u2013 I mean obviously we've been increasing with our global footprint expanding in Europe and Asia. Some colo projects which are a little smaller dollars have been added to the list. Those typically obviously did not have much preleasing before they open up. I think we feel pretty confident on bringing those on in time at attractive cost to us and be able to lease a significant share up by the time we open the doors. Many of those projects actually are like the last buildings on some of our major campuses, be it the K building or H building down in Ashburn before we move on to the next parcel of land; or the 9377 building in Chicago. So, we're kind of rounding out some of our large campuses and now having to move to the next door property for our next phase of growth. And in that case, that's often customers that have already been in our building, wanting to really stack up that last piece of inventory so that their engineers don't even have to cross the road even though it's a short distance. So, I think we feel pretty good about that. At the same time, if you would stop all the \u2013 stop the music and everyone has to find a chair, I think our committed spend on that pipeline, meaning the spend we have to spend or would be in default on is about $190 million. So, it's 0.2, 3.3 turns of EBITDA and we can easily address it with our revolver that's got $200 million outstanding. Operator : And the next question will be from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking the follow-up. Curious regarding the scale funnel, it sounds like the deals are bigger you said. So, should we expect, is it safe to assume more scale deals from DLR in 2017 versus 2016? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I certainly hope so. I mean \u2013 kidding aside, I mean we wouldn't increase the active development pipeline by that size and we won't be moving on to build at the adjacent campuses if we didn't have conviction on the pipeline. Now, they're not a done deal, obviously there's only a certain amount that's pre-leased today and we're only a month-and-a-half into the year, but that's certainly the goal. I don't know if Dan you want to add anything to that? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I would add is we do see a strong pipeline in the CSP and hyperscale space and it's not just domestic. I think it's important to point out that our global footprint is very appealing to the hyperscale customers. And as we expand our footprint in Asia and in Europe, we're seeing good strong demand for those sites as well. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Jordan, some of the changes we're making on the sales team, we expect will allow us to gain deeper penetration into the customer and thus will unearth additional opportunities with these major players. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, a little bit of a follow-up for maybe Scott or Andy, you could tag team. This is sort of strategically year-over-year plus into the \u2013 even more so now into the Telx acquisition and integration and living with it. And so I'm kind of curious on your view of colo and interconnection relative to scale and basically where you see the best risk-adjusted returns for your money? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: You want me to start or you want to go? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Go ahead, I'll hang on. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So maybe I'll just touch on Telx holistically and kind of a year-end checkup kind of thing and then I'll let Scott talk to kind of risk adjusted returns, whether \u2013 from an investment kind of hat. I mean, obviously, Jordan, or maybe not obviously, I think we're pretty proud of what I call successful acquisition financing and more \u2013 most of the integration. I mean, we've navigated a substantial re-org that generates significant expense synergies. We either met or exceeded our underwriting targets, we've unified the team under one Digital Realty brand and we also leveraged some new found expertise and adopted market-leading customer portal. And then, on the new future, I think, we're generating revenue synergies with the footprint expansion to markets like Ashburn, Richardson and also just growing the footprint some of our gateways be it Chicago or LA or Phoenix. So, all-in-all I think we're on track. And I think it's been a fruitful, I mean, a good overall experience. And I think we're building momentum that's going to bear fruit into 2017 and beyond. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Jordon on the risk reward spectrum of it, it's really \u2013 it's kind of interesting. So, the way I look at it, it's a little bit of a toss-up. You could generate better operating margins on the colo side, be it shorter contract terms, you have smaller customers, typically more diversified customer bases. But then, you also have limits of how big it can be, and we can take some of these markets. Northern Virginia is a great example, 2 megawatts of leasing and \u2013 of colo in Northern Virginia is a big year for any company. And 2 megawatts is kind of the first week of January for scale. So, it's a tough call. I think really at the end of the day, what our view on this is, is you want to have both. We want to have a full spectrum platform to offer space and power and connectivity to a customer, whether you want a cabinet or you want a 100 megawatts. And we want to do that on a global scale, because what we see the customers wanting from us right now is they have \u2013 they have a lot of different needs over a lot of different markets, and a lot of different types and needs. So, they might need a colo deployment in one market, they might need scale in one, hyperscale in another. And they want to be able to come to a single vendor for that to partner with and provide them with some consistency of delivery across the globe. And we know, we're the only ones right now that are even close to be able to do that on a global scale. And we think we're seeing a good chance to being the only ones. And so, it's kind of hard to really separate, I mean because they are both very important. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for 2016, as outlined here on the last page. We had another very good year characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. We met or exceeded our Telx underwriting targets and we continue to extend our global footprint with the closing of the European portfolio acquisition. We continue to enhance our product offerings with the launch of Service Exchange, the expansion of our Partners and Alliances program and the expansion of our global footprint to 11 new facilities across eight new and existing markets. We raised guidance three times over the course of the year delivering core FFO per share growth above the high-end of our original guidance range, and we delivered outsized growth in AFFO per share. Finally, we achieved this growth while strengthening our balance sheet. We paid down virtually all of our remaining secured debt. We reduced our floating rate debt exposure by more than half, and we lowered leverage by nearly half a turn. Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to say congratulations and thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in early March. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, we would like to limit the questions to one and one follow-up. This event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks related to our business, see our 2016 10-K (01:17). This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today with a discussion about governance. As you may recall, we announced last year that our Board of Directors expects to appoint Laurence Chapman as Chairman of the Board at our upcoming annual meeting in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning. Laurence will take over as Chairman from Dennis Singleton, who is standing for re-election and is expected to continue serving on the board after he steps down as Chairman. Earlier this afternoon, we announced that Mary Hogan Preusse will be joining our board as well. Many of you may know Mary. She has spent the past 17 years at APG Asset Management, where she has served as a portfolio manager, most recently with responsibility for managing all of the firm's public real estate investments in North and South America, totaling over $13 billion in assets. APG is a leading advocate for shareholder-friendly corporate governance structures and responsible real estate investing. APG has also been one of our top ten actively managed shareholders for the past 12 years. So Mary is intimately familiar with our business, given her portfolio management responsibilities. We are delighted to bring Mary's institutional shareholder perspective to the boardroom and we look forward to welcoming her to our board. You may also recall that last year, we announced the appointment of Mark Patterson and Afshin Mohebbi to our board as well. Mark brings deep real estate expertise to the board, whereas Afshin's extensive experience in the technology and telecom sectors adds a highly complementary skill set. The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. Following Mary's appointment, 6 of our 10 directors who have joined the board within the past four years. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a destaggered board. The majority of our directors' compensation is paid in stock. Each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company. The board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements. And finally, since 2014, the substantial majority of management's long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder return. We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Along similar lines, we recently added our support to The Corporate Colocation and Cloud Buyers' Principles and the mission of future Internet power to power the Internet with 100% renewable energy. In addition, we achieved our 20% energy reduction target under the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Challenge nearly five years ahead of schedule. Let's turn now to our go-to-market approach on page 3. When he joined in November, Dan Papes' first order of business was to fully integrate the sales and marketing organizations of Telx and the recently acquired European assets into a single global sales force. This integration was completed early in the first quarter. These two acquisitions were transformative transactions for Digital Realty, more than tripling our customer count. Given this evolution, as well as the significant share of repeat business from existing customers, it is critical for us to become as customer-centric an organization as we have ever been. To best capitalize on the tremendous opportunity in front of us, we restructured our sales force during the first quarter to better align our sales efforts with our customers' buying behavior. Our sales force is now organized into three customer buying groups : Global Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, and Network Solutions. We expect these changes will help us deepen our relationships with our customers and fully leverage the strengths of our global multi-product platform. It is still early days and we have a lot of work ahead of us. But we are encouraged by the early results as evidenced by the solid bookings during the first quarter. In addition to these three sales segments, we are investing in our channel program to support our go-to-market strategy. As mentioned last quarter, we believe the channel program holds considerable promise for Digital Realty. We expect our partners and alliances will enable us to reach customers we otherwise would not, employing an efficient cost of sales structure. We have important relationships with IBM and AT&T, which are providing growth, particularly in the enterprise segment, which we see opportunity for enterprise end-users to benefit from the services and solutions that our partners can offer to their customers. During the first quarter, our channel program influenced a low single-digit percentage of our total bookings. In order to build upon that base, we hired a seasoned executive from a Fortune 50 leading IT services provider. Building a profitable, sustainable and growth-oriented partner ecosystem will require focus and commitment. We expect this effort will begin to pay dividends for us later this year and into next year. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page 4. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets but so does net absorption, as well as the level of pre-leasing on development pipelines, and where available capacity has been recently delivered, it has also been rapidly absorbed. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in new supply bears watching carefully. However, demand continues to outpace supply. Competitors are behaving rationally and new entrants have largely targeted stabilized investments rather than speculative development. In summary, development pipelines are active but pre-leasing is healthy, market vacancy is tight, current construction is concentrated in core markets, characterized by robust leasing activity and the scars from the last cycle are still fresh. Now let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. While the timing and ultimate outcome of future policy remain uncertain, the current monetary fiscal and regulatory climate is broadly supportive. In addition, the index of leading economic indicators has continued to climb and recently hit a new high while interest rates have leveled off somewhat. Against this favorable macroeconomic backdrop, the secular shift towards corporate IT outsourcing appears to be accelerating. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand setup, given our global platform, our comprehensive product offering and our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power, to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with the leasing activity here on page 7. Our total bookings for the first quarter were a little over $50 million, including a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $42 million during the first quarter, including an $11 million colocation contribution. The first quarter activity played to our strengths. We transacted in 21 of our 33 global markets during the first quarter and roughly 20% of first quarter customers transacted with us in multiple markets. Approximately two-thirds of our activity was concentrated in North America, with the balance evenly split between Europe and Asia. The quarter did not hinge on any one transaction. The largest single deal was just 3.2 megawatts and colocation and interconnection accounted for nearly 40% of our total bookings. We added 28 new logos during the first quarter and we signed over 200 leases for space and power. Including interconnection, we completed more than 900 transactions. First quarter wins included numerous signings from top cloud service providers, specialized cloud verticals and other vibrant customers driving the digital economy. Our wins included new customer deployments in new markets as well as continued expansion of existing customer infrastructure within our portfolio. These signings were both big and small and landed within our footprint of urban infill Internet gateways as well as larger scale campus locations across four continents. On the enterprise front, our wins included strong customer demand from both IT service providers, as well as numerous enterprise customers that came directly to Digital, including a large U.S. healthcare company, a multinational semiconductor and software firm and a global investment management firm. In terms of integration, we're off to a strong start in 2017. As mentioned on our last earnings call, we combined our European teams during the fourth quarter. In 2017, we're focused on consolidating our systems and streamlining our processes. You can see one byproduct from this process visible in the face of the P&L this quarter. We have collapsed the repairs and maintenance expense line item into the rental property operating expense line. We will do our best to minimize any external facing impact from the integration process. In this instance, however, the efficiencies gained, as we sunset multiple general ledger systems, were significant enough to make the changes worthwhile. In addition to general ledger systems, we have also unified our product offerings under a single Digital Realty brand and we expect to go through a product rationalization later this year. Our colocation expansion plans are underway and we're beginning to generate revenue synergies with customer wins and new cross-selling opportunities. We currently have in the works an expansion of our Service Exchange from eight U.S. markets to a total of 17 markets across our three major geographic regions by year-end. In addition, we will be rolling out Layer 3 capabilities in the coming months to enable SaaS providers on this Service Exchange. Finally, by the end of the year, we expect to have substantially completed integration of our recent acquisitions into our ongoing operations. Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, stands at $79 million. The weighted average lag between first quarter signings and commencements remained healthy at less than three months, well below the historical average of approximately six months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9. Tenant retention was well below our historical average at 42% during the first quarter, driven by two somewhat unique move-outs. The first was a 3-megawatt deployment in Silicon Valley, previously occupied by an online gaming company, whose needs had shrunk. This capacity has been completely re-leased. The second was a Powered Base Building move-out in Atlanta. The single tenant customer had occupied the building for 13 years and had invested significant capital to build out a customized data center solution. We were unable to come to terms on a renewal. And while re-leasing this space will require both time and capital, the existing infrastructure provides a compelling opportunity to redevelop a Powered Base Building shell into fully built-out data center product at an attractive cost basis. Atlanta is a core data center market with competitive power cost and a suburban scale offering would be highly complementary to our dominant colocation and interconnection hub at 56 Marietta. This property is also adjacent to a 1 million square foot campus owned and operated by a top 3 cloud service provider. Preliminary project footing is underway and we expect to proceed with the redevelopment subject to market demand. Excluding these two special situations, our tenant retention during the first quarter would have been north of 80% across all property types. In terms of renewal leasing activity, we signed $46 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. Cash re-leasing spreads were up 3.1% overall with a positive mark-to-market across all property types during the first quarter, including a solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals. We do still have pockets of above-market rents remaining throughout the portfolio, primarily in the Northeast region, so we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter. On balance, however, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for the first quarter and we expect cash re-leasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finished lease expirations. In terms of our first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was unchanged at 89.4%. Same capital portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points sequentially due to incremental leasing, primarily in the West region. You may recall that on the past couple of earnings calls, we've discussed taking assignment of a colocation reseller customer's PBB lease at 350 East Cermak in Chicago. And we mentioned last quarter that we're negotiating the lease to backfill roughly 25% of the space that will bring us back to breakeven. I'm pleased to report that we signed that lease during the first quarter and we expect to create additional value for our shareholders from lease up of the rest of this capacity over the next several quarters. The U.S. dollar's steadied upward march leveled off somewhat during the first quarter. As you can see from the chart, at the bottom of page 10, however, the dollar was considerably stronger in the first quarter of 2017 relative to the first quarter of 2016, given the spikes following Brexit in June and the U.S. Presidential Election in November. As a result, while comps should begin to get easier in the second half of the year, FX still represented roughly 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. Same capital cash NOI growth was 3.4% on a reported basis for the first quarter and 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share grew 7% on a reported basis and was up nearly 9% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share was $0.06 ahead of the consensus although the first quarter may be somewhat of a high watermark for the first part of the year as you can see here on page 12. We don't typically give quarterly guidance but it's important to note that we expect the run rate to dip down in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter due to a combination of higher property tax accruals, higher G&A expense related to promotions, merit increases and timing of stock grants, as well as the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May. In terms of the quarterly distribution, we expect the first and fourth quarters will represent a little over 51% of the full year figure while the second and third quarters are expected to represent a little less than 49%. We also expect to record a $0.04 Topic D-42 charge during the second quarter related to the redemption of our Series F Preferred Stock in early April. This non-cash charge will be excluded from non \u2013 from core FFO per share. As you may have also seen from the press release, we raised the low end of our guidance range by $0.05, reflecting the outperformance during the first quarter as well as our growing confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year. Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning with our sources and uses here on page 13. As mentioned, we expect to settle the remainder of the forward equity offering at expiration on May 19. We also expect to realize up to $200 million of proceeds from non-core asset sales. In addition we expect to generate approximately $400 million of cash flow from operations after dividends. Finally, we expect to raise up to $500 million of long-term fixed rate debt. Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will most likely look to further our FX hedging strategy with a sterling bond offering later this year. In terms of uses of capital, we retired the final $50 million tranche of the 5.73% Prudential Unsecured Senior Notes at maturity in January. In April, we redeemed the $182.5 million liquidation value of our 6.625% Series F Preferred Stock. We are on track to spend $125 million to $135 million of recurring CapEx and $800 million to $1 billion of development CapEx in 2017. Spending on both categories ran below expectations last year, but picked up in the first quarter. In terms of the components of AFFO, we would also like to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent, as shown on page 14. This chart reflects several years of consistent improvement in data center market fundamentals as well as the impact of tighter underwriting discipline, which has driven steady growth in our cash flows and sustained the improvement in the quality of our earnings. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall in the out years. We ended the first quarter with fixed charge coverage above four times and debt-to-EBITDA below five times. We expect debt-to-EBITDA to hover right around five times for the rest of the year. I'm pleased to report that S&P acknowledged the strength of our financial condition and the favorable industry backdrop as they revised the outlook on our BBB flat credit ratings to positive during the first quarter. Our balance sheet is well-positioned for growth, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : I would be happy to. At this time we will begin the question-and-answer session The first question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So I've got a question about the sales force. And if you could talk a little bit more about the kind of the realignment efforts. Where do things stand now in terms of (23:16) and then how did the sales roles change in light of the products alignments that Andy was talking about? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Andy, do you want to cover that? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jonathan, thanks for that question. We restructured our sales team in early in the first quarter, as Bill mentioned in his beginning comments. And what we did there was we decided to organize our sales team to sell to our customers in a way they buy, cloud service providers buy differently than enterprises and differently than network solution providers. What we've done is trained our sales team around these solutions. We've also hired skilled resources onto the team in order to make sure that we're providing expertise and solutions to our customers' opportunities and problems. And we're deepening those skills throughout the year. We saw some positive impact from that in the first quarter, as you can see from the strong sales numbers that we turned in. But we also expect that as our skills deepen and our relationships deepen and the strategy itself takes hold that we'll see continued progress as a result. It's not an overnight dramatic doubling of sales kind of an impact. But it, over time, will be the right strategic move. And again, we saw impact from that in the first quarter that we thought was very positive. I think it's important to note that we did do the restructuring at the beginning of the first quarter. It was a major restructuring and integration of the Telx, Digital and Telecity assets. And yet still turned in a strong quarter, which we feel very good about. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Do you have a, kind of, a targeted portion of bookings that you would look to be generated by channel partners over time as well as a mix between wholesale versus retail? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We do. So, first of all, the mix that we had in the first quarter, Jonathan, we were very comfortable with. Other than the fact that we want to grow our channel opportunities significantly over time, this balance of about 60% of scale business and 40% of colo business is one that we're comfortable with and we'd like to maintain over time. As it relates to channels and alliances, Bill mentioned in his opening comments as well that we did low single digits of the business that we did \u2013 booked in the first quarter through our channel partners. That is something that we're very focused on changing. I'm not going to give you a, necessarily, a percentage target of our sales right now that we'd like to generate through the channel, except to tell you that we'd like it to be meaningfully higher than that and I think it's probably safe to say that at some point in 2018, to make it double-digit portion of our bookings, the percentage of our bookings in 2018. We think that we can get there. Change of focus on channels and partners and alliances is a meaningful endeavor and takes new processes and methodologies for working with partners. The leader that we've hired from a top IT managed services provider, who has extensive channel experience, has that reengineering of our channel organization underway. And, I think, starting in the fourth quarter and certainly in 2018, you'll start seeing impacts that really matter in those areas, which will be positive. Operator : The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to come back to the overall leasing volume in the quarter and then maybe the composition of it. I think Andy, in your commentary, you identified the largest deal as 3.2 megs. I'm curious, one, what the demand funnel looks like, maybe for Dan, if you could talk about it in the context of how it's built over the quarter and where we really stand? And then just within that funnel, what you're seeing, if anything, from the CSPs? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jordan, this is Andy, maybe I'll speak to give you a little more color on the quarter, then let's see what you can get out of Dan on our pipeline. So if you look at the total amount of signings for the quarter, the \u2013 we had a similar concentration in kind of that SMACC vertical, which is cloud and other parts of the digital economy, which is about 65% of the total volume. What was a little bit different this quarter is that about \u2013 of that component, it was more heavily weighted to other parts of the digital economy relative to just the top cloud service providers. We still had a significant portion, I think, a third of that chunk I just described was top cloud service providers but there's a lot \u2013 there's a whole bunch of other parts of specialty clouds, other parts of companies that are part of the digital economy and have their businesses over the Internet, were a driver. And then rounded out, the other 35% of the total demand, was a combination of IT service providers and a host of other customers, which I'd probably characterized as enterprise. So, we really attacked enterprise customers two ways with our \u2013 a great group of IT service providers and also enterprise that come to us directly. That mix has been fairly consistent. But it did pick up a little bit at the end of the last year and into the first quarter. And I'll turn it over to Dan, if he wants to touch on pipeline. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, yes. Jordan, thanks for the question. Our pipeline for the second and third quarters, which I tend to look at it over multiple quarters at this time, looks to have a similar mix to what Andy described that we saw in the first quarter and then what we've seen in the past. I will say that the demand in all areas, in interconnection, in colocation and in our scale business, looks to us to be very solid. And it's our job to go out and capture that business but we're pleased to have the opportunities out in front of us to go after and try to capture. So the demand funnel looks good and again, will drive those results that you'll see in the coming quarters. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then just a follow-up on the FFO flow through the year, Andy. Any insight you could offer in terms of the contribution of the $68 million of backlog that's starting in 2017? And maybe an explanation as to how much the G&A is going to fluctuate? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So, we intentionally wanted to make sure we didn't have any surprises here because we do have a little bit of a funky quarterly distribution of our core FFO per share this year. So we did have a little bit of a pull forward of some good news on the revenue and NOI front during the quarter. We had a positive outcome on a property tax accrual. So, we do see a quarter-to-quarter step down, due to some of those good newses not repeating themselves. And the G&A is going to pick up, based on timing of when we did our promotions, merit increases and stock grants. And then we do have a decent portion of our backlog that comes in back half of the year. I think, I'm not sure if that's included in our prepared remarks, we signed our \u2013 a lease for the second phase of Osaka, which is \u2013 that property is essentially now fully leased and we've also purchased a land parcel for expansion of that campus. Both the first customer and the second customer that will be landing in Osaka are late back half of 2017 revenue event. So they'll be coming on in the fourth quarter and providing some growth going into 2018. Operator : And the next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. The first is, I'm looking at slide seven and I'm looking at slide 18. And I'm wondering, to what extent you have the opportunity for this $50 million in bookings to become more of a run rate for the company and kind of help that curve on \u2013 the bars on chart 18, given you have a bigger presence in Europe now, you're growing in Asia, as you mentioned, you've got interconnection as a more pressing focus. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how to think about where the new run rate for this business should be? And if you're able to get there, does that change the way FFO and AFFO can grow on a go-forward basis? Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe I'll just highlight some of the components that got us to north of $50 million signings this quarter, which I do think lend itself to additional strong quarters in 2017. Although I \u2013 we can't promise and I can't promise north of $50 million every quarter of 2017. I mean, you're 100% right. One way to generate incremental revenue is to do that in incremental footprint. And I think you saw that in a few pockets of our portfolio in the first quarter. I already talked about our wins in Osaka. If you hop over to Europe for a second, I can tell you that we had a fairly large signing within a new customer to Digital in Dublin. We had a similar \u2013 existing digital customer that anchor our scale campus deployment in Amsterdam. We also had some wins on the colocation front. So we had expansion in both U.S. and Europe in terms of colocation signing wins. And I can tell you, Frankfurt is coming online, from a campus perspective, at the back half of 2017. We haven't signed any major leases there to date, but we have had smaller wins in Frankfurt, including a digital \u2013 long time digital relationship, a colocation customer that was seeking colocation footprint. We are able to place them into one of those eight assets we acquired last summer with a 250-kilowatt or 240-kilowatt colocation footprint. But they came to us, not just because of that, seeking that deployment, but also our relationship and the fact that they could see the growth into our campus down the road in the future. So lots of positive momentum. New places to sell that could lend itself to continued steady-eddy growth in our signings. And that's obviously what we're seeking. And I don't know if anyone else wants to chime in here on that front. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Michael, it's Dan Papes. So, just to add to Andy's comments. I talked about the balance that we had in the quarter, the contributions from interconnection, colocation and scale. And Andy had mentioned that our \u2013 the deal sizes in the scale side of the business were in this 2-megawatt to 5-megawatt range. We do think that that combination, that healthy balance of sales across our portfolio should provide us, over time, the ability to provide sort of less lumpy kinds of quarters. But it's the nature of this business, given the fact that some of those larger transactions happen, the 5 mega \u2013 when you get towards the 5-megawatt transactions, there'll still be some up and down over quarters. But I think over time, you'll be able to draw the line in the bar chart that shows a consistent upward trend. And again, I think the balance that we have across the portfolio really helps us a lot in regards to that. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And if you're able to achieve that level, would that be a catalyst for upside in your outlook for FFO and the opportunity for AFFO? Or is this a type of activity that's now priced into your guidance for 2017? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: If you're able to kind of exceed our internal lease expectations and kind of hit the right-hand side of that guidance table on, call it, page 5 or 6 of our financial supplement, I mean, we see tremendous flow through and you see that by the fact of our operating margins at the property level or EBITDA level. So those will certainly be indicators that pushes through the higher end, if not, above the higher end of the guidance. But again, it's only \u2013 we got three quarter \u2013 three months, one quarter done, so we got a long way to go still. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Mike, one thing I'd like to add is, to the extent we are doing this business outside the U.S. and because we match fund, the interest costs are lower outside the U.S. than they are in the U.S. right now. So there's an incremental effect there. Operator : And the next question will come from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Just in terms of the \u2013 I don't know if this is provided somewhere, I missed it in the sup or something. But in terms of the kind of the quarterly pace of FFO that you mentioned in one of the slides in the presentation, I assume that chart is just kind of illustrative, because it looks like a much bigger impact versus kind of the 51%-49% breakout between kind of what you provided. But do you have any numbers on kind of the G&A impact and the property taxes, just to kind of quantify their impact on the quarters? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Paul, we try to stick with the precedents, and the precedent here has been to give annual guidance and not provide the quarterly granularity. And we certainly help to work with modeling questions off-line, if anyone would like to discuss. We just \u2013 given that a little bit of a pickup in G&A, pick up in G&A was like roughly around 6% of our revenue. So, obviously trending towards the low-end of our guidance range. That's going to be a little bit of a haircut. And we also have some capital stack items, which have been not there. The last leg of our forward equity offering will close out in that 2.4 million shares to our share count. So those items, in particular, are obviously going to create a little bit of a step down from the first quarter to the second quarter for core FFO per share. But we see that being offset with additional revenue from our properties in the back half of the year. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. And I could follow up on a couple of line items, I guess. And just my other question on Service Exchange, you've had, I guess, five or six months now that you've kind of been operational in the eight markets and you're about to kind of double that, I guess. Are there any takeaways from your experience so far? And kind of how you're seeing that as a driver of kind of the interconnection and colo sides of the business? And in terms of maybe what kind of customer segmentation is seeing the most take-up? And how material a driver could be over the next year or so? Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Paul, this is Jarrett. It's still early days, we actually launched in December. And we really \u2013 we're pleased and on track and slightly ahead of plan. It is changing the dialogue we're having with our customers, especially around the broader interconnection value. We can now do that all through our portal. Day one, our customers get private access to the top three cloud service providers from all our sites, so that's Microsoft, Google, AWS and now, Oracle. And I'll give you just three quick examples, we \u2013 just this quarter; we did \u2013 a global managed service provider is now offering high-bandwidth secure access for multi-cloud to support hybrid cloud for enterprise. So they're winning enterprise deals. And as part of the deal in Frankfurt, they actually required us to have a Service Exchange launch there. There's a global system integrator who is using Service Exchange now to allow self-service for their customers on our interconnection platform in Virginia and multiple sites. And then there's a disruptive new kind of hyper-converged player who is actually using the Service Exchange to provision in an automated fashion, using our Service Exchange platform in \u2013 on the West Coast. And so we're seeing different use cases. We're communicating that through the sales team and channel. But again, this is really our first full quarter of launching that product. Operator : The next question will come from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : Thanks. Hey, guys. One of your peers this morning talked about an improvement in the New York market. Is that something you're seeing as well? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, I think there was some commentary around New Jersey in particular. I'd say the New York market for us is a little bit bifurcated. We still have fairly dominant positions with their Internet gateways into the city, which is obviously focused on performance-sensitive colocation and interconnection points. We continue to see strong demand, be it 111 8th, 60 Hudson, 32 Avenue of Americas. Out in New Jersey, we're not \u2013 we don't have a ton of available space. We've not been a active developer really in that market given the retrenching of the demand for a while. We did do a handful leasing, but I think you'll see our 2 Peekay Building in New Jersey, that's \u2013 occupancy has picked up in the last quarter. But I wouldn't \u2013 relative to other things or wins we had during the quarter, I wouldn't say that was a standout market for us. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : That's helpful. And then looking at the presentation, it looks like the slide focused on Telx is gone. Can you comment at all about the things that were used to be on that slide in terms of how the business is trending relative to your expectations? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So we sunsetted that slide with kind of the year one completion of our underwriting and meeting and exceeding them on all of our financial objectives. Broadly speaking, integration from the Telx transaction is really down to a limited amount of items. The teams fully are integrated. That unification of the sales and marketing team under Dan's leadership was the final piece of that. We do have to sunset the Telx accounting system, which we'll complete later this year. But from a people, process and systems standpoint, we're almost really close to the finish line, if not there. In terms of financials, that's really been a part of our success in, on \u2013 in the North America colocation and interconnection business. You've seen that's had a \u2013 we've had a tick up in our signings volume, you've seen a tick-up in our interconnection revenue line item, be it quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. We've grown the North America colocation footprint. I believe the total colo footprint is now about a 17% expansion relative to prior to when we bought the Telx business. So we've grown them in Ashburn, and had some wins with new customer there. We've grown them in the Richardson Campus. We've expanded their footprint in 350 East (44:58) Cermak and we're also seeing some strong demand in our 600 West 7th asset in LA. So off to a start, (45:08) pretty much through the chute on integration and continue to track along and be a key contributor of our business despite the slide not being in the deck anymore. Operator : And the next question will come from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You saw a nice step-up in colocation in North America compared to the prior quarters. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on what's behind that. Is it more a function of internal changes at Digital? Is it related to sales restructuring at all? Or is it timing? Or is it a change in demand in the market? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey Rob, this is Andy again and congratulations on your new post. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thank you. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Well-deserved. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So you were asking colocation signings volumes quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year? Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah, the $9.5 million number versus the prior quarters, which were all \u2013 probably a string of quarters, which were more like in 6s? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. It's a piece of the colo numbers, obviously, Europe, the addition of the eight assets in Europe. But you can see in our table, the signing numbers are broken out. So they're \u2013 and you still do see a step-up in North America volumes. I think our colo interconnection signings were our highest signings numbers since we acquired the Telx business, a little \u2013 about two years ago almost. And I think in the history of Telx, it's a top two, yes, top two performance. I think we saw, not only continuation of traditional customers growing their footprint or connectivity packages but we saw a lot of new wins, be it new customers to the colocation footprint or an existing customer going to a new market, both of which not only spur \u2013 that case type not only spurs demand for space and power but incremental connectivity. So I think those are some of the elements that kind of drove the results. I'm not \u2013 I think coming together as one unified team under Dan's leadership certainly played a part in it. But I think having more time with the full multi-product offering across the globe certainly helps us as well. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great, sounds good. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, everyone. Just a question going back to the bookings volumes and the potential for that to go up over time. So you've got the sales force realigned at this point, you've got a channel partner program that hopefully will ramp up as well and market demand seems to be quite strong, 2x current supply. I was just wondering, to what degree your own supply is a potential constraint. And maybe part of that is, page 38 of the sup, you have all your inventory. I'm curious, how much of that inventory is entitled or is ready to start depending on demand and that kind of thing? William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vin. I would say, we've done a pretty darn good job at, what I'll call, supply chain management, and a lot of that we owe to Scott and his team's success of procuring the long lead time items, be it land, at our many campuses, locations and whether it's in Ashburn, Virginia or in Franklin Park in Chicago or in Richardson in Dallas. We either own or control a significant amount of acreage typically adjacent to our existing campus that really lends itself to our value proposition of having these customers being able to come to our campus and we can show that they can land and expand and not outgrow our footprint. So we do not see any scenarios where we're really sold out, especially in our kind of core active development markets such as the core four in North America, our Ashburn (49:18) Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley, which is probably one of the tightest markets, we're bringing on incremental space at the end of this year in terms of new capacity. And we see a similar scenario in London, Dublin, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Singapore. Osaka, Japan, now that we had success there, we do have the land, it will take us a little bit longer. So we won't be bringing on incremental capacity in 2017 or early 2018 for that property, but shortly thereafter, with that recent acquisition. So I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of being able to meet near-term and long-term demand. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then turning the question back to an earlier part of the conversation around the cloud service providers. I mean, last year or 2016 was sort of the year of the CSP. This year, volumes for the first quarter so far seem pretty good across the board. But you may be on the smaller size deals side of things. Just curious how the conversations are this year versus last with the bigger hyperscale guys. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, Vincent, this is Dan Papes. The conversations, I think continue to be around growth. The cloud service provider demand, to us, looks \u2013 continues to look strong. As kind of as far as the eye can see, I don't see it diminishing. We do see an interesting mix of deals that are in this 2-megawatt to 5-megawatt range that we brought down in the first quarter and some larger transactions. I see it, I see the trend continuing the way it's done in the past. And it's one of the things that we feel good about as we look forward at the opportunity before us. Andy, I don't know if you'd add anything to that. But... Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Same page here. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes. Operator : And the next question will be from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks and good afternoon. I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time talking about the overall health of the U.S. market, looking forward maybe 6 to 12 months. We've seen yields across some of the peer group dip a little bit. And I can appreciate that you're not necessarily pursuing the same type of customer funnel but how do overall supply levels look relative to what you would consider a stable run rate of demand? And then just maybe as an add-on to that, how would you compare the health of the U.S. market relative to Europe at the moment? And I guess, all else being equal, where would you prefer to invest your next dollar of capital right now? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Matt. I'll start and I'll let the other guys chime in here. So broadly speaking, I mean, I'll speak to more scale orientation, that's the bigger volumes side in terms of size of deals. The Ashburn continues to be a very robust and diverse customer backdrop. We continue to see numerous signings, fairly sizable signings. Obviously, Ashburn, there is also a competitive set. So we are competing with deals. We think we're winning our fair share, or if not more. And we still see demand being very large and growing and eclipsing that supply in that market. After Ashburn, you kind of go to Dallas and Chicago in terms of overall size of markets. Similar number \u2013 similar dynamics, I'd say to an Ashburn but probably just a little bit smaller in terms of markets, smaller in terms of number of customers, smaller in terms of some of the size of the deals in some scenarios. And if you head west to Silicon Valley, that's probably our tightest market by far, a much more limited supply. I can tell you that based on the demand outpacing supply in that market, we've seen an uptick in face rates of deals signed, we signed, I'd call it, two deals kind of 0.5 megawatt each. So kind of small scale or large colo deals at, call it 150-ish or north rates per kilowatt in this past quarter. And I know those rates going back several quarters or a year or could've been in the 130s-ish kind of area. So you've seen a little bit of pick up and that's the one market where large deals seem to be picking up based on supply and demand dynamics. Europe, as a whole, it's \u2013 we have a smaller presence there relative to our U.S. business. Those major markets are not quite at the same size as an Ashburn, Virginia. But I'd still say that we had good progress in London, especially if you look in the kind of last, call it, six to nine months, all post Brexit. I believe we had quote (54:35) $16 million of signings or so during that time period. We've kind of really filled out our existing scale campuses and moving on to expansion in Crawley, and we had some good progress in Dublin and Amsterdam as well as in the scale leasing side as well. I'm not sure there's a favorite although I certainly like the attributes of Silicon Valley when rates pick up like that. That's incremental profit to the bottom line by controlling supply in that market that's very limited. But we're seeing \u2013 if you've seen our sup, our returns are little bit higher in North America than Europe and then followed by Asia. Asia is way down a little bit based on the fact that Osaka, where we went in there with a little bit of an anchor de-risking market entry, signed two fairly large anchor deals to round out that initial campus. And also you have the fact that overall returns in Japan are a little bit lower. But I'm not sure I have a favorite. I'll let the other guys chime in \u2013 any other commentary? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Scott here, Matt. Look, I wish we had the luxury of being able to pick and choose where the next dollar went. The reality of it is it's still a lumpy business. And so you kind of have to go where the demand is and where you can do signings and generate revenues on all that. I would say for the yields dipping a little bit, I think part of that can be explained with there's more liquidity in the industry and more aggressive capital. And some competitors out there are willing to be a little more aggressive as it relates to yields. So I don't find that entirely shocking. And that will fluctuate depending on how supply and demand balances out in those markets over time. But the fact that you're seeing that now, it shouldn't be too shocking of that. But beyond that, I think Andy was spot on, on the differences between the three regions. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Matt. One thing I want to emphasize, though, is, I think it's important to have space in all of these markets to satisfy our customer's requirements. Our top 20 customers, of those, 95% of them are in multiple regions. And another 70% of the top 20 are in Europe and the U.S. And then frankly 25% of them are in Europe and in Asia. So, yeah, it's just important that you have space, we think, where we have it to meet their demands as they arise. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I really appreciate all the color there, guys. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And the next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I wanted to, I guess, follow up on one specific market, which is Dallas. We're getting questions specific to RagingWire and the large facility that they just opened up there. And I'm just curious if you think if that by itself could negatively pressure that market, perhaps, for the remainder of 2017 and what you're seeing there. And then secondly, on the bookings, there's been a lot of focus on this. Clearly, it's a good quarter, I think, by your standards as well as, I think, how it's being perceived by investors. But I guess with the book-to-bill being just three months, I'm surprised that that's not leading to some acceleration in growth. And maybe that's just a reflection that you guys have a pretty large range in your revenue today, it's about $100 million, or maybe it's the churn that you kind of called out that you're expecting in two situations, including in Atlanta. Just trying to get a better sense why when we see strong bookings like that, we don't necessarily see it flowing through into an uptick in terms of how you're talking about revenue expectations. Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe, Colby, I'll speak to Dallas first. So I can tell you that we've had \u2013 I know we had some decently sized wins in the Dallas market last quarter, in the fourth quarter, one with a partner that landed a healthcare company on our campus and then this quarter, we had a digital economy name with a decent kind of meg-plus deal landed on the Richardson Campus as well. And I know we have a \u2013 and that market specifically kind of has some attractive opportunities that we're working on right now with some of our largest customers looking to grow their footprint. I think, obviously, we're not alone in Dallas and we're competing with RagingWire and others. I think, those are the types of markets where you have to really differentiate yourself and bring more to the table of the customer, be it multiple U.S. markets, multiple geographic regions, a public company, investor-grade track record and 10-plus years of operating excellence. So there's a lot of things we do to differentiate our value prop with each customers and to have \u2013 and differentiate our relationships with the customers to win over some of them, may be in one or two markets, be it just in the U.S. In terms of the flow through, yes, we are quite pleased with the sign to commence creeping down to just under three months. I think you nailed the reasons in your own question, actually. We do have a range in the revenue line item. We do have some churn, which I highlighted but I would call churn with a silver lining because it's opportunities to, where we can reposition space and make incremental or are making incremental returns on that space and that's, I would say, that's part of the reason that we went with a $0.05 increase to the bottom end of our guidance and kept the top end constant. Operator : And the next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. In terms of, I guess, you mentioned earlier, on colocation footprint, it's up to, up 17%. Where can we expect that to go over time? And then kind of following up with a lot of the signings questions, will that help kind of keep colocation at this $10 million and higher level given that colocation seems to be pretty steady relative to, I guess, Turn-Key Flex? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Richard, it's really all predicated on our success here. So we've taken an approach to incrementally grow our colocation footprint what we thought it made sense, be it in our Internet gateways, where we already had a dominant presence right in the (01:01:16) room, had a connectivity and ecosystems stronghold and could build out incremental pods for \u2013 to sell colo into all new places, where you put the flags, be it in Ashburn or Richardson and Franklin Park is probably the next stop on the North America campus and Dublin is probably the next stop on the European campus. And I know Singapore is probably the next step on the Asia campus. But we're doing it very incrementally, call it 0.5 meg to 1 meg increments. We're not going to build a 5-megawatt, 10-megawatt colo all, and just waiting to fill it up over a longer time period. And the other thing I'd say, you have working against in the pie chart is that we do have \u2013 I mean, we're still doing pretty strong larger footprint scale wins. Scale was 61% of total signings during the quarter. And we have \u2013 that part of the pie is growing at the same time. So I wish I could tell it's going to be exactly this but we're trying to make sure we have the offering for the full product suite, the cage or (01:02:17) cabinet up to the multiple megawatts halls. And depending where demand and customers grow, that's going to (01:02:23) get bucketed between a colocation or a scale customer suite. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And I know it's very volatile quarter-to-quarter but in just kind of eyeballing the new leases and renewals, it seems like the contract lengths are extending out a little bit longer for the different products versus the last 12 months. Can you give us any color with regard to that? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Two trends, I would say, bigger the deployment, longer the term. If a customer wants to do a massive deployment, with us at least, they want to go 10, 15 years and we \u2013 that's something we appreciate and we want them to go 10, 15 years given the concentration risk of when that one expiration comes due. So anything kind of call it, 5, 10 years or north, we're trying to push for longer and the customer usually is also pushing for longer customarily. Secondly, you'll see our Powered Base Building renewals, that's \u2013 those are \u2013 just to remind you, those are places where we own a highly improved shell and the customers put on their own dollar the full build-out of the last, call it, 70% to 80% of the infrastructure. They've got lots of dollars sunk in the space and you can see those renewals when they do come through, they have customers contracting for a longer time period than a fully built out suite. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page. One, we retooled our sales force to better align with our customers' buying behavior without sacrificing current period results and we delivered robust bookings during the first quarter, up over 50% from the previous quarter. We delivered solid current period financial results, beating consensus estimates by $0.06. We raised the low end of our guidance range by $0.05, reflecting the out-performance during the first quarter as well as our growing confidence in the outlook for the balance of the year. And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet by paying down high coupon debt and preferred equity. We finished the quarter with our debt to equity ratio below 5 times, fixed charge coverage above 4 times and Standard & Poor's revised their outlook on our BBB flat credit ratings to positive. Last, but not least, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you, all, for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in June. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. The highlight of second quarter was of course the announcement of our agreement to merge with DuPont Fabros. And I'd like to begin today by recapping the strategic merits of that transaction. Our customers and the desire to better serve them through more offerings in more locations are the key reason and the primary strategic rationale for this deal. This transaction is consistent with our strategy of offering a comprehensive set of data center solution from single-cabinet colocation and interconnection, all the way up to multi-megawatt deployments as represented here on page 2 of our presentation. At the far end of the spectrum, this combination significantly expands our hyperscale product offering and enhances our ability to meet the rapidly growing needs of the leading cloud service providers. This deal is also consistent with our stated investment criteria, shown on page 3. The transaction expands our presence in strategic U.S. data center metros and the two portfolios are highly complement. The transaction is expected to be roughly 2% accretive to core FFO per share of 2018 and roughly 4% accretive to 2018 AFFO per share. Last, but not least the combination continues to enhance the overall strength of the balance sheet. DuPont Fabros owns a high-quality portfolio of purpose-built data centers, as you can see from the profile on page 4. And as evidenced by the 98% occupancy on the in-service portfolio. The merger will benefit Digital Realty by bolstering its presence and expanding its product offering in three top tier metro areas, while DuPont Fabros will realize significant benefits of diversification from the combination with Digital Realty's existing footprint in 145 properties across 33 global metropolitan areas. In addition to world class assets in high demand metros DuPont Fabros will also bring some outstanding team members and industry best practices that we look forward to leveraging. Their culture of putting the customer first will complement our move towards becoming as customer centric an organization as we've ever been. Turning to the pro forma stack on page 5. The combined company will be the ninth largest REIT in the index with an equity market cap of approximately $24 billion and a total enterprise value of $33 billion. The balance sheet impact will be leverage neutral, but given the exceptional credit quality of the customer base, the long lease terms and the high proportion of owned real estate, we would expect the combined companies unsecured debt program should improve due to broader investor base and greater liquidity that should over time result in an even lower cost of capital. The benefits of this scale translates directly to operating efficiencies as shown on page 6. DuPont Fabros has always run one of the tightest ships in the business and given the additional economies of scale and cost savings achieved through the transaction, the combined organization will have by far the most efficient cost structure and the highest EBITDA margin in the data center sector. DuPont Fabros is also unique in the data center sector, in that it owns the dirt under all of its datacenters. The combined organization will likewise own the greatest percentage of real estate within the sector. To sum it all up, we are very excited about the strategic transaction which will enhance our ability to serve our customers and hyperscale cloud customers, in particular, in the top data center metro areas across the U.S. It will be accretive to earnings and cash flow in year one and strengthens our balance sheet. The complementary nature of the two footprints, customer bases, and product offerings provide mirror image diversification and enhancement benefits, and augment our ability to create significant long-term value for both sets of shareholders. Along the lines of sustainable long-term value creation, I would also like to highlight the recent announcement that Digital Reality ranked 6th on the U.S. EPA's top 30 Tech & Telecom list of the Largest Consumers of Green Power and 12th on the National Top 100 list of Green Power Users. We are proud of our sustainability initiatives and we remain committed to manage our environmental impact in optimizing our use of energy and natural resources because we believe it's the right thing to do, and because it matters to our customers. Sourcing renewable energy is also important to many of our customers, including some of the world's largest consumers of data center capacity and our ability to meet their needs for renewable, and highly efficient data center solution sets us apart from our competitors. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page 9. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center metros, but leasing velocity remains robust and the industry has almost universally transitioned to a just-in-time inventory management approach, helping to keep new supply largely in check. Their near-term funnel remains healthy and we are currently chasing requirements from all of the leading cloud providers, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service as well as PaaS and SaaS providers. The size of these near-term requirements is generally smaller with some of the hyperscale deployments we saw in 2016. But we see demand as broad-based and consistent, and we expect to see larger requirements over the intermediate term. In addition, vacancy rates remain tight across the board, and supply constraints are building in top tier metro areas notably including Silicon Valley. Competition remains intense, particularly for larger requirements and given the sector's recent history, any uptick in new supply bears watching carefully. However, we were encouraged by the depth and breadth of demand for our scale, colocation and interconnection solutions and we believe tightening conditions bode well for long-term rent growth, as well as the enduring value of in-field portfolios like ours. And now, let's turn to the macro environment on page 10. While the timing and ultimate outcome of future policy remain uncertain, the current monetary, fiscal and regulatory climate is broadly supportive. Economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, but good enough to sustain continued growth. In addition, our expectations for the U.S. have recently been tempered somewhat. Growth prospects in our global regions outside the U.S. have brightened off late, against a broadly supportive macro-economic backdrop, a long-term secular shift to digital applications such as cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and autonomous cars is driving robust dealer center demand. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand setup, here with our global platform, our comprehensive product offering and our fortress balance sheet. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 12. Our total bookings for the second quarter were a little over $34 million, including an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $27million during the second quarter, including an $8 million colocation contribution. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages to generate numerous second quarter wins. We transacted in 20 of our 33 global metro areas during the second quarter and the majority of our second quarter business was across multiple metros. On the heels of the robust absorption in both Europe and Asia Pacific during the first quarter, our North America region generated the lion's share of new leasing due to the timing of inventory coming online abroad along with strong second quarter signings on our campuses in Ashburn and Dallas. The largest single deal was 4 megawatts, and colocation and interconnection accounted for more than 40% of our total bookings. We added 30 new logos during the second quarter and we signed nearly 200 leases for space and power. Including interconnection, we completed more than 800 transactions. We continue to support the growth of various top cloud service providers across regions. These wins included Infrastructure-as-a-Service, PaaS and SaaS providers growing their footprint in multiple metro areas. Our multi-pronged strategy of serving enterprise customer demand both directly and through various IT service providers and other partners also continues to bear fruit. We were able to directly support the growth of a long time financial services customer with the expansion of their footprint in Singapore. Through our partner channel, we also added a top three U.S. Money Center Bank as a first time Digital Realty customer across three locations in North America. We also built on our recent success in the healthcare vertical by lending a new hospital system with a partner on our Dallas campus. The leading cloud service providers have recently announced the enterprise versions of their hybrid cloud offerings designed to be more conducive to supporting private data and security requirements. These enterprise offerings should simplify hybrid cloud solutions, and open new opportunities to serve enterprise customers, either directly or through our partners and alliances program. As mentioned last quarter, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliances program to create meaningful upside for our business over time. Our partners and our customers value our focus on working with quality solution providers. We feel good about our partners growing ability to position our value proposition as part of their overall solution to their customers. We are pleased with the progress during the second quarter and we are encouraged by the momentum we are building. In terms of integration, activities are proceeding as planned. Our product rationalization workshops were held in June and we are now focusing on the steps necessary to create a consistent product portfolio and customer experience across all sites, ultimately, uniting all products, delivery models, operations support and billing under a common platform. The teams are busy consolidating our back office systems and we expect to have the eight European assets we acquired on our new platform by the end of the year. In terms of the financial results we registered sequential gains in occupancy, as well as revenues for the European acquisition portfolio for the second quarter in a row versus the trend of revenue declines that predated our stewardship. With respect to do DuPont Fabros, while it remains business as usual until the merger closes, innovation planning is well underway. Although this will be our largest acquisition to-date, we expect a seamless integration after closing. The DuPont Fabros portfolio consist of just 12 operating properties in three major metro areas where Digital Reality has an existing presence. In addition, DuPont Fabros has just 32 customers compared to 2,300 for Digital Reality. Turning to our backlog on page 13, the current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stands at $64 million. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements remained healthy at six months, in line with long-term historical averages. Moving onto renewal leasing activity on page 14, we retained 72.5% of second quarter lease expirations. And we signed a record $65 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over eight years and cash releasing spreads were up a healthy 6.5% overall, with a positive mark-to-market across all property types during the second quarter, including another solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals and a consistent mid-single digit mark-to-market on colocation renewals. We do still have pockets of above market rents throughout the portfolio, and we currently expect to see a negative cash mark-to-market on our third quarter renewal activity. On balance however, cash releasing spreads were positive for the second quarter and we still expect cash releasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finished lease expirations. In terms of our second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was down 30 basis points sequentially to 89.1% due primarily to recently completed development deliveries placed in service during the second quarter and two small expirations within our Internet gateway buildings in Dallas and Chicago. Both of these footprints are currently being repurposed as colocation inventory and we expect to generate additional upside over time from lease of the space at meaningfully higher rents. The U.S. dollar softened somewhat during the second quarter although it also remains somewhat of a headwind relevant to the second quarter of 2016 given the spikes following Brexit in June and the U.S. Presidential Election in November as you can see from the chart at the bottom of page 15. As a result, while comps should begin to get easier in the second half of the year, FX still represented roughly 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our second quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 16. Same capital cash NOI growth was 3.1% on a reported basis for the second quarter and 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share grew by 8.5% on a reported basis and was up a little over 10% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share was $0.05 ahead of consensus although we do expect the quarterly run rate to step down in the second half of the year as shown here on page 17. In terms of the quarterly distribution, we now expect the first half will represent roughly 51% of full year results while the second half is expected to contribute roughly 49%. As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating our guidance despite the $0.05 beat during the second quarter. The primary reason we are still in path on the full-year guidance is the pending merger with DuPont Fabros. In particular, the merger closing date remains uncertain whereas we expect to line up long-term financing as market conditions permit. You may recall that we raised approximately $770 million of proceeds from a sterling bond issuance earlier this month whereas our guidance contemplated just $500 million of long-term debt. We also expect to raise long-term financing in advance of closing the transaction. We still expect to realize $18 million of annualized overhead synergies from the DuPont Fabros merger, and we still expect the transaction to be roughly 2% accretive to core FFO per share in 2018, and roughly 4% accretive to 2018 AFFO per share. However, these synergies will not be realized until 2018 and given the number of moving parts, we felt it best to leave guidance unchanged for the time being despite the outperformance in the first half. With respect to AFFO, I would like to highlight again this quarter the long-term trend in straight line rent as shown on page 18. This chart reflects several years of consistent improvement in data center market fundamentals as well as the impact of tighter underwriting discipline which has driven steady growth on our cash flows and sustained improvement in the quality of our earnings. The second quarter was particularly active on the financing front, with numerous steps taken to further strengthen our balance sheet over the past 90 days, which we have itemized here on page 19. In early April, we redeemed $182.5 million of high coupon preferred stock. As mentioned on our last call, we booked a related $0.04 topic D-42 charge during the second quarter, which is excluded from core FFO per share. The preferred redemption was essentially funded with $211 million of gross proceeds from settlement of the remaining forward equity offering we raised one year ago in conjunction with our inclusion in the S&P 500. In May, we issued a \u20ac125 million of two-year floating rate notes to refinance borrowings under our line of credit. The interest rate on these notes is EURIBOR plus 50 basis points or half the spread on our line of credit for an all in initial coupon of just under 17 basis points. In late June, we refinanced and upsized the secured loan outstanding on the Westin building, the premier internet gateway for the Pacific Northwest which we own in a 50-50 joint venture partnership with Clise Properties in Seattle. This transaction led to a $3.3 million gain during the second quarter, since total cash distributions from the refinancing and prior operations now exceed our investment basis in the joint venture. The gain on the amount of excess distributions from the refinancing above our investment basis run through the equity and earnings of unconsolidated JV line on the P&L. Given the non-recurring nature of the gain, it has been excluded from core FFO per share. Last but not least, we raised a total of GBP 600 million Sterling bonds or approximately US$770 million in two tranches subsequent to quarter end. The blended coupon of these tranches is just over 3% and the blended term is just under 10 years. As mentioned earlier, this bond offering was contemplated in our original guidance given our recently expanded presence in Europe and consistent with our financing strategy of managing currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. The amount of the raise was upsized however from $500 million at the midpoint of our guidance to $770 million. We expect to use the excess proceeds to repay a portion of DuPont Fabros' debt in connection with the acquisition. Of note, however, the seven-year tranche included an SMR provision, which enables us to retire the debt at 101% of par in the event that DuPont Fabros transaction does not close by December 15, 2017. Finally, as you could see from the left side of page 20, we have a clear run rate with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall in the out years. We ended the quarter with fixed charge coverage above 4 times and debt to EBITDA at approximately 5 times. Our balance sheet remains well-positioned for growth, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Once again, you will be limited to one question and one follow-up. At this time we would like to take our first question from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I have a question and then a follow-up. Regarding the DFT acquisition, what is the most up-to-date expectation on timing, maybe a sense of where we are on the potential as you see review and shareholder vote? And then I'm curious how you are working them vis-\u00e0-vis leasing pipeline if there is any sort cross over there to the extent that you're able to look to their inventory or if that's being kept completely separate. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And thanks, Jordan, this is Andy. In terms of timing we are right now, we put our initial proxy on file at the beginning of July, and we're readying that final version to out and solicit votes, from both the Digital Reality and the DFT shareholders in the coming weeks. And our best ballpark, I'd say on timing of the actual final tallying of the shareholder votes and the meeting, and ultimately closing this would be call it late third quarter, early fourth quarter. In terms of business planning, I can tell you there's a lot of activity going on, on the integration planning side, getting ready for the closing, day one and beyond. But with regard to competitive intelligence, chasing competitive deals. Right now, up until this transaction is approved and closed, we have to act as two separate independent companies and we're not sharing any information of the sort. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, as a follow-up I noticed that cross-connect volume was a bit lighter in the quarter relative to the last few quarter in terms of new cross-connect signed, and at the same time I noticed that you guys made this investment in June in Megaport so maybe likely unrelated, but maybe you could address both items? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe I'll \u2013 I think, you were able to sneak four questions in here, but let me tackle the cross-connect volume and return. So, I would say it was a slight bit under the previous quarter in volumes of cross-connects, but there is obviously a numerous variations of products underlying in terms of physical cross-connect. So I think the better economic indicator looking at the Cross-connect revenue line item on the P&L, which is up year-over-year call it 20%, obviously there is a \u2013 not enough \u2013 there's an apples and oranges there from our acquisition in Europe, there wasn't in the numbers. On a more organic basis, just North America, the cross-connect revenue was up call it low teens, so we're quite pleased with that number. And then I think to your last and final question with regard to an investment we made and maybe I'll ask Jarrett to chime in on that front. Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jordan, if you recall we launched the product, the service exchange in December. It's on track and it had a plan, we're continuing to expand to 17 markets by early 2018. We're still very supportive. We wanted to take a different approach and integrate it into our product, integrate it into our portal, we've enhanced the redundancy of the platform, but we also wanted to remain open in terms of future opportunities, the open service exchange environment to allow other options to come in. But we ended up investing the million because largely we wanted to really maintain close ties to that software development partner, because it's integrated in our interconnection platform with strong alignment, with our management team and their board, and we're staying very, very close in terms of the service development road map and also the go to market interest on behalf of our customers. Operator : The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. First off on leasing, obviously the slowdown this quarter relative to last quarter came from international. Can you just remind us when you will be in a better position with capacity in those international markets where you're seeing that demand, so that you could potentially go after that and we could see a stronger number? And then just more broadly as it relates to that, just what are your expectations for leasing as we are sitting here now in the third quarter? And then just my other question had to do with additional M&A. I appreciate from a size perspective that DuPont is a very large transaction, but as you mentioned fairly simplistic hopefully in terms of the integration. To the extent if you see something out there that you want to go after that's large in nature, are you prevented from doing so or would you still have the ability to go after that? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Let me start off, Colby. What, Jordan, I think, started answer for two, we got three to four pattern here. So, we'll try to... Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: I've just two. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: -- clear these quickly. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Three, I'm sorry. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Your first question was on the signings and inventory timing. So, in the back of our financial supplement, we have our active development pipeline and in particular you will see in Europe, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and London, deliveries of \u2013 on a largely concentrated on our campuses be it Crawley in London, the President in Amsterdam, and also in Frankfurt, deliveries call it late fourth quarter, early first quarter 2018. Late fourth quarter of 2017, early first quarter of 2018. So, that's where our larger footprint, that doesn't mean we're totally sold out in all those markets. We do have incremental capacity in Dublin, We do have \u2013 we're not a 100% leased from some of those campuses and we do have some capacity in our gateways, but the larger footprint capacity inventory supply chains coming on call back half of this year or early next year. Your second question, you said it was... Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Any color for the third quarter. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Colby, hi, this is Dan Papes, and thanks for your question. First you commented on the second quarter and it perhaps being a little later, I would like to just note that in the first half of 2017 we actually grew 17% year-over-year in total lease signed, new lease signings versus first half of 2016 and our colocation business grew 14% year-over-year in the first half 2017 versus 2016. And that's after you just for the \u2013 for the Telecity acquisition. So, a strong first half and you kind of note the uneven nature of demand in this industry, but when you look at the first half, it's something to feel pretty good about. But as we look at the third quarter, we like what we see from a pipeline perspective and a demand perspective both across the scale business and the colocation business. I would just say, I kind of extend that even to the second half, we like the pipeline, pipeline is one thing. The other is executing on that pipeline, which we plan to do. We've got a very strong team in place as I think you know we restructured the team in the first quarter. And we feel like we're well-positioned now to have a strong second half and third quarter as well. Now \u2013 now we're going about executing against that. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Colby, Scott here. Your last question was on additional M&A. Clearly, we're focused on integration right now of the existing acquisitions and getting the DuPont deal closed and integrated. Very important for us to get that right as we move forward. Certainly doesn't put us out of the game when it comes to considering and looking at other M&A opportunities and we'll continue to evaluate those that are consistent with our strategy. But we clearly will consider integration issues as we contemplate any of these other opportunities. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So just two questions. One, I know there's a drop in a rent from CenturyLink Cyxtera, are they consolidating their footprint or is that just the impact of breaking out CenturyLink from Cyxtera, were sent to \u2013 where some of that kind of get spoken out separately? And then the second question is just a little bit of market color, and I'm interested in which metros did you see the greatest kind of demand for interconnection and colocation bookings? Thank you. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. I'll start off on the one. So Cyxtera, CenturyLink that's the product of the transaction where CenturyLink sold its colocation business where they lease long term from Digital Realty numerous of those locations. And so, Cyxtera now becomes our top customer as a standalone business albeit CenturyLink did remain in equity ownership in that business. That business now being run by Manny Medina and his team, who has a long history with Digital and we're looking forward to support that customer and it's growth and in terms of activity with Cyxtera going forward, I'm pretty sure we've actually had some business together in terms of renewals subsequent to the transaction. So all things full steam ahead, CenturyLink is still a large customer with the sites, they aren't in the top customer list. It is not a top 20 customers anymore and they still have numerous network node deployments, probably largely concentrated in our Internet gateway facilities. And then in terms of trends and signings. I don't have the by market interconnection signs, I can tell you some stats on the \u2013 in terms of demand or the industry verticals. Go forward, Jarrett. Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: It's Jarrett. Early trends we saw some good momentum in the new campus in Ashburn, with the colocation and the pull through there. Our traditional markets are strong on the interconnection trend. Chicago, New York, the Gateway, Santa Clara, those big three markets in North America. So \u2013 and we're seeing pull through, early pull through on some of the colocation as far as the service exchange launch as well. So, those were kind of the core markets we saw some growth. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead. Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. I'll just stick to my two questions. First on the merger, have you had any \u2013 I actually have that. How the customer conversations gone after the announcement and are there opportunities in specific markets that you had in some of those conversations that's kind of from the perspective of revenue synergies, and then, my other question is, this was partly asked earlier, but it's a little bit slightly different. You have $31 million in revenue, kind of at the forward year at this time last year, and if you look at the commencements now, it's sort of $11 million and wondering if any of that is related to just kind of changes in your \u2013 in enterprise time horizons when you're doing bookings or are there other factors that are kind of driving where you stand now versus where you stood this time last year? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Answer to your first question, Paul, the customer conversations have gone well. Obviously, we have a very different offering than DuPont has on a global basis as well as a smaller footprint offerings in the interconnection. So there has been a positive reception in that respect. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. So Paul, let me just add to Bill's comments. This is Dan Papes. Our customers like DuPont Fabros, and they like doing business with them. One of the things Bill mentioned in his opening monolog was that we thought that DuPont Fabros would add to our customer efforts to become ever more customer-centric and DuPont Fabros has a reputation in the marketplace for being such, and the feedback from our customers along those lines is, we like doing business with them and that will help us like doing business with you guys even more. Our customers are also, especially obviously our largest scale customers, like to know that we'll have if and when the merger closes that we're going to have the inventory that they need in the markets in which they are growing. One of the reasons obviously that we pursued the merger was because of the quality markets they are in, the quality products they have, and the quality products that they are building. So, the feedback we are getting from the market is, from our customers and some of our potential customers is universally of it. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then Paul on your second question, just to frame it, so I think you are referring to our rollout forward of our backlog table in slide 13 of the deck, where this year we have about a $11 million commencing in 2018 and the same period a year ago it was I believe $31 million. I think that's really just a product of the signs that have no commenced on the book. Last year I can think of at that time we had signed for some fairly large deals in like Osaka, Japan, where we had literally signed the deal before we had broken ground on the site. So these were much larger amount of signing with a forward commencing period. So, I think it's really a timing of inventory coming on relative to signings that are in the backlog, that's driving that. And then just lastly I want to circle back because John Stewart reminded me, he didn't think I appropriately addressed Jonathan Atkin's question, to make sure I was clear. The reason Cyxtera and CenturyLink disappeared from that number two tenant and Cyxtera appears is because CenturyLink sold its datacenter business, and Cyxtera is the new customer for those 20 assets that are on our top list. Just to be clear on that point. Operator : And the next question will be from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, good afternoon. I think, Bill made a comment in the prepared remarks regarding some large requirement for RFDs floating around in the marketplace. Just expand on that a bit? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Matt, can you come closer to the phone, it's hard to hear you. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Is that better? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes, thanks. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Yeah, so just with respect to the large requirements referred to in the prepared remark, I was hoping if you could just expand on that a bit, with respect to customer verticals or application types, a little color around that, and then also whether you think you have the right inventory in the right markets to be competitive on those deals? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: First the Vertical segment, Dan do you want to talk to, and I'll jump on the application. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, but momentarily. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Okay. Just from the application side, I think, Matt, one of the things we're seeing is the growth of performance-sensitive applications that are network that are latency dependent and throughput dependent, and that one is scale in the campuses. And if you look through that lens, we continue to see the cloud compute deploy, you've seen those are in smaller deployment sizes at this point. But we're excited enterprise private cloud and storage solutions to support that. There was a major wave in the last quarter, and frankly, over the last few weeks of all these new announcements to support enterprises, or part of the Azure platform or Oracle's platform, or VMware, for example. The big drivers right now we're starting to see in this deployment are higher power density solutions for application, artificial intelligence and machine learning that plays off of the cloud in hybrid cloud. And then, definitely mobility, we're seeing early days at the internet gateways of growth on the mobile applications as well. So, those are kind of the drivers and then Dan, if you want to talk to the vertical sectors? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, so thank you, Matthew. We, as I have previously stated have organized our go-to-market teams by what we call buyer types and verticals and we call them sectors. First is the Global Solutions sector, that's our cloud service providers and hyperscalers. And I think I mentioned that we see continued strong demand in that area. And we're going to continue to serve that, and the contemplated merger with DuPont Fabros is going to serve us well there. From an enterprise perspective, we think took our eyes off that in the previous couple of years, we now have our eyes staring straight at that market. And within the enterprise space the conversations we're having with clients all the time is about hybrid cloud. And what direction they should take or what direction some of them plan to take, and how we can serve them with \u2013 with the portfolio of solutions that we have both with the ability to go from a single cabinet to a multi-megawatt deployment, but also with our Connected Campus and service exchange capabilities. But we're a quarter-and-a-half into focusing on the enterprise in a different way and we're seeing that as a good thing for us to have done. And then in the network space we're seeing, I would \u2013 we don't report our number separately but from a sector perspective, our sales into the network space and our pipeline into the network space is one that we're very excited about and will continue to contribute positively in the future. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful color. Thank you, and just as a follow-up, it looks like there was a nice sequential improvement in retention ratio on primarily on the PBB side, but I was wondering if you could just comment on the TKF retention, which seems to be kind of tracking well below historical trend through the first half? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Matt. So, the \u2013 we agree we had fairly high retention both on PBB and colocation, PBB in the second quarter at 89% and colocation at 90% and the other thing I'd highlight is the lease tem, a lot of these transactions are fairly long; 7.7 years for TKF, 8.6 years for PBB, for weighted average across the all the products of just over eight years. With regard to TKF the retention dipped a little bit below the last 12 months and obviously a little below the historical average. It was a slightly lighter renewal on the quantum, it's about 20% of the last 12 months average in terms expiring sort of fees, so the sample set was a little smaller, in particular there was a megawatt or 2 megawatt expiration, where the customer decided to not retain with us on that specific lease, but actually consolidated their applications and their load into other space that they had taken with us on that same campus in a building where they had more room to grow. So, a bit of moving the puzzle pieces together, but obviously a technical non-retention and that is on one of our campuses in one of the top 40 North America markets, where you see strong demand and we had strong new signings in that market. So, I know we've released a portion of that but I think we will be able to quickly release in the interim. Operator : The next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. Just a question on guidance. Last quarter you talked about how the first quarter and the fourth quarter were going to the highest and it sound like the second quarter will be a down quarter, and clearly we are up this quarter. I'm just kind of curious where did we come in \u2013 where did you guys come in above your own expectations this quarter versus what you had expected last quarter, and I'm trying to figure out how that doesn't flow through to the rest of guidance? I appreciate, yeah, for the financing coming, but it would seem to me that revenue and EBITDA is trending ahead of your expectations. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Jon. So we beat our internal reforecast by handful of pennies, I would say 50% of that was operational and the other 50% was financing and other items in the P&L. On the operational piece, there were some good wins, but not all of it flows though, a one-time item or two. And on the financing some of that is a product of delaying our sterling bond offering which we had anticipated doing earlier in the quarter, but obviously we are caught off sides and being able to access couple of markets while we're in M&A discussions and ultimately wind up this transaction. So that transaction, we may end up moving forward that till in July. So we are little ahead for the quarter. When you look at back half of the year, where Digital Realty standalone, it's a bit of a delay actually in terms of what we said last quarter where we thought it was going to be a strong first half and a little bit of step down in the back half just got pushed a quarter. The things that we have working against us and offsetting some of our revenue gains are some operational seasonality, things that's of some \u2013 on a colocation, we're having exposure to the power cost that we've in the summers. And then there is also our dispositions we have not closed any of those dispositions yet, although our team is working hard and making great progress. But obviously when you sell assets that are income producing, you lose FFO, rate allocates, and I think that timing of those disposal will be kind of backend loaded. And then just lastly holistically on guidance, we do \u2013 we do have some handful of pennies in negative carry. We upsized the Sterling bond offering and now portion of that Sterling bond offering will go to ultimately refinance the DFT transaction. And then we have the moving parts of the remaining U.S. dollar long-term financings and the ultimate timing of closing the DFT transaction. So, we felt it more prudent to leave our current core FFO guidance as it is for now and then come back and update you post-closing of those transaction. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just \u2013 just one follow-up on DFT, one thing I heard you guys talk about is the customers like doing business with DFT, or at least the customers they had like doing business with them. Just kind of curious what you can do to, I guess, keep those relationships strong and kind of what it is about what they like doing business with DFT. Now that you had a little more time to kind of research the process there, is it the design of the buildings, is there a certain key people that need to be kept, is it lease structures, just maybe a little more details on what you guys think you need to keep that culture? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, John. This is Dan Papes. A few things that we've observed. One is that DFT they have very close, I would call it, business relationships at very senior levels with our customers and interact with them frequently. They have a smaller number of customers, so at some degree they are able to do that, but it's also cultural and there are some people there that will add few our culture from a customer centricity perspective that we think will be helpful. They also have some customer support processes that we haven't been able to dive into deep detail with, but the way they interact with our customers on a regular basis from an operations perspective has been shared with us from our shared client base and we feel like that out of our operations group we'll gain benefits from that from the processes and the philosophies with which they used to manage their customer relationships day to day. So, those are some of the things that we've observed and that we're going to try to leverage should the merger close, and I'm sure there'll be other things that we'll uncover as we go that tell us why those customers enjoy doing business with them, will enjoy doing business with us together. Operator : The next question will come... A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: The only.. Operator : I'm sorry, go ahead. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I'm sorry. Sorry, Denise to interrupt you. The only thing I would add is I think that the key element is not being \"single courted\" on your relationships, and having the team at the executive level at the site, in design extraction, in sales and operations all supporting these huts for day in and day out. They certainly had some early wins with some large customers and they were able to support those growth, and showing that great support and success was translated into incremental wins over time. And think of large customers that land and expand them in ASH1 campus and continue to want to do so. That's very similar to here at Digital, we had some great some wins with likes of ridesharing company and another social company and we're early with them, and we had great experience with them so. I think, we've come together with two similar cultures, and I think, it's going to be a great combination together. Operator : And the next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Hey everyone. Just a follow-up on the last question. Just in terms of closed business relationships that you mentioned, do you have visibility on how successfully you will be able to keep those folks have those relationships? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey Vin, this is Andy, again. I can tell you we made that a high priority here at Digital, Bill out of the gate spent significant amount of time, great meeting with team and the field throughout the entire organization. just in the last handful of weeks, I've spent a fair amount of time with Scott Davis and team going through all the three core North American campuses, sitting down with their operational team in the field, the guys and ladies and gentlemen that are day-in day-out supporting those customers and their mission-critical infrastructure and we try to give insurances that our goal is to have them as long time here at Digital going forward. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Okay. And Vin, this is Dan. I'll just add to that. Bill has made very clear to us and with the approach here that we agree with, which is we didn't just buy some very high quality assets, if we \u2013 when -- if and when the merger closes, there are also some best practices and some cultural elements, some of \u2013 what some of those that I just mentioned in my \u2013 in my previous comments that our value here that we want to retain and leverage and so forth, that includes, that includes people. So it's what we see here is we're \u2013 we're probably acquiring, we are acquiring some industry best practices that in some cases might be better than the way we do things today. And we want to go ahead and leverage those. And some strong people with not only who have strong relationships with customers, but also some strong people from a delivery and design perspective as well. So our idea here is to capitalize on the multi-pronged portions of DuPont Fabros that goes beyond the assets, includes the people, the processes and elements of the culture. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks for that. On a totally different topic, I mean, you mentioned, Bill you talked about the G&A margin, the leading G&A margin of the combined entity, and I was just curious is there an opportunity been in sort of $7 million to $8 million bookings level here on the interconnection side for a while. Curious if you were to step up the investment on the G&A side, is there an opportunity to really bolster that booking number or do you think that that's not really the way to get that number higher? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I mean, Vin. I think we do need some additional sales resources, Dan is looking. But I don't think he is fully staffed quite yet. So it's not going to hit G&A in a material way. But with the right sales sources in a couple of his sectors, we can certainly move that number. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Vincent, a few comments from me. As the leader of the sales organization, we \u2013 I would say, as Bill mentioned, a marginal amount of additional sales resources, we think would be helpful here. We're also very focused on the quality of our resources. We have made some significant, I would say, upgrades in the quality of our sales people, and some of them may cost a little bit more, but we \u2013 if we take on less of them and they are more productive, that's very helpful to us. The equation comes out the same from a cost perspective. And so, we \u2013 that's the approach we're taking. I don't see a need, and I don't go ask Bill and Andy for meaningful or impactful from a financial perspective additional sales head count at this time. I think, we drive based on the head count that we have today, and make sure it's quality head count. Operator : The next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about kind of bigger picture given the DuPont acquisition and other company, certain companies focusing on big could providers. How should we think about the hyperscale cloud business? It's lumpy, but it seems like it can last for a while, do you see this as a multi-year type of business that is worth going after or is it something that it's just kind of the here and now, and wanted to get your sense on that. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Rich. This is Bill. You hit it right, it's lumpy, unquestionably lumpy, it's getting lumpier, I think. I think the potential orders are getting bigger. And I think, it's here for the foreseeable future, at least we have \u2013 we don't have any indications yet, that it's waning. Dan, do you want to add to that? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes, Richard, just to add to that, I think, Bill uses the right term foreseeable future. When we talk to our large customers, cloud service providers, and those aren't CSPs, that are hyperscalers, they don't talk about a trough in 2018 or anything like that. Their plans seem to be to continue to grow, it's just not to get too basic about it. But the fact of the matter is, the amount of the data is exploding, and the amount of processing is exploding, the need for storage is exploding. And it's hard when you just kind of look at what happen in the IT industry today, and the demands of customers for more or more data, just if you look out as far as you can see, and you just can't see why it would diminish anytime within our line of sight. So, we think \u2013 we just think, it's going to continue, and we're going to keep going after it. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then to follow-up a little bit on the acquisition. In terms of \u2013 and I appreciate if you do want to provide specific customer, but Facebook is a significant customer of yours, it's 1.6 years average lease term, DuPont has got some renewals up and coming, how is that going to be handled in terms of renewals for both the companies in terms of dealing with larger customers that are coming up? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Richard, and obviously just want to reiterate up until the transaction closes we are operating as two independent companies. So, the DFT team is handling renewals as well as new leasing with their customer base and we're doing the same with our customer base on our side of the table. I can tell you for the larger customer, the larger hyperscalers, cloud service providers or names that you've referenced, we're in active discussion on renewals and in locations where we have them with near term expirations, there what they have expressed to us is desire to stay and renew on a long term basis. And these are the customers that in other locations they have recently grown with us. So, the leases have just recently commenced, or will be commencing soon. I would anticipate the DFT side is having similar types of conversations with their customer base and many of these are the same customers. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, I think also you can look at DuPont's addressed this issue particularly with Facebook in their Q4 2016 prepared remarks and then again in Q1 of 2017 and that will give you a little color, but there's probably not a lot add to that. Operator : And the next question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Just a little bit of upside on some of the tenant reimbursements that we are looking for, just curious is anything going on there, anything one time and then you mentioned you acquiring Green Power and I keep hearing this from others in the industry as a growing demand. It's becoming a little bit more of a focus from some of the customers. What do you think that you're doing there that maybe others are not that's enabling you to source more Green Power and how do you plan to meet that need going forward? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Sure, Richard. There is nothing that materially comes to mind as episodic on the reimbursements either on the consolidated basis or on a same capital basis, but happy to follow-up with you offline if there is something we see there. On the Green initiative and I will open this up obviously to Jarrett and team here. I think a few things, I think our scale and our creditworthiness as a counterparty has been a differentiating factor. I know that is something that when we entered into our wind farm purchase agreement several quarters ago, we could financially provides sustainable Green Power to a North America colocation footprint, that they were seeking an investor grade credit rated party, which was kind of linked to the ultimate financings to get that project up and running. And being the only investor grade data center REIT, we are the only one out there to really offer that. Jarrett, is there anything else do you want to add on the Green front? Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks. The vision was really predates me, Bill really set up the dedicated team to set up a sustainability vision, had a dedicated team. And then we've engaged from our product and with sales, if we sort of the \u2013 kind of we've interviewed the customers and they're really seeing value on it. So, we started with the wind power deal, but we covered our colocation product with this. We've since augmented with solar initiatives, and there is a whole team now working \u2013 a power working group that is working on that focus, and you can see the results as we were really announcing this quarter. You are seeing that being recognized now in the industry as a leadership role and we're committed to that globally. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And you are correct, Frank, it's important to our customers. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will come from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking your question. So, in looking at your customer lists, it looks like you had some really nice gains quarter-over-quarter with some of your top customers like Uber, Oracle and NaviSite, particularly stood out, but it also looks like Rackspace returned 14,000 square feet and reduced its annualized rent. I was wondering if the reduction from Rackspace is what is reflected in the 65% retention ratio in the turnkey category? And secondly, since they are 9% customer of DuPont Fabros and I believe that last we saw them, they were somewhat underutilized on their commitment of space although that's a while before they went private. What do you see? Is there a possibility of more return space from them going forward? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Rob. And obviously, due to confidentiality reasons, we don't like to speak to specific customers ins and outs, but if a customer's location is decreasing, that would obviously fall in the non-retain bucket of an expiration. There's certain customers, and I have bought it in the names, like the name you mentioned that has taken space down with us over time in multiple suites in a campus and sometimes they want to consolidate their infrastructure to be more centralized or take up an entire building versus having it in multiple buildings across the campus. So, there are some times we're moving parts and consolidation comes to play. And our retained space is not necessarily an awful thing, because incremental deliveries they may have already leased with us maybe commencing coming online. So, not necessarily specific to the name you mentioned, but that's a trend we've seen and really part of our value proposition where a customer can land with us and know their business model is going to be future proofed based on the series of buildings we have on campuses in hundreds of acres that we have adjacent to it. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, thanks, and if I could just do one follow-up. In light of the DuPont acquisition, could you just restate your view point on sort of very large hyperscale single-tenant assets and the construction of them going forward who are participating in those opportunities? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We are certainly seeking to participate in those opportunities with the \u2013 just to refresh everyone's memory and the DFT team filed their second quarter earnings release this morning, they've an active pipeline of projects that are in construction and some of which I toured in the last several weeks meeting the team, and there were call it \u2013 almost 80 megawatts of active development across their core markets, and those are roughly half preleased, with great customers commencing leases but leaving space that will be coming online and be readily available to lease for large footprint or small footprint scale customers. So we remain committed to the full product spectrum from the (1:06:55) up to the hyperscale. Operator : And the next question will come from Andrew DeGasperi of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask first on the acquisition with DuPont. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment now that most of your customers know you're obviously going to merge and are you seeing potentially any delays in your agreements because of that or any potential opportunities on the flip side for that matter? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Andrew, given the fact that we must be fiduciaries to our independent shareholders and act \u2013 operate independently. I have not seen any change in terms of competitive nature or delays to business to-date. Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: And I just want to follow-up. As far as your synergy number for the acquisition, I know you're still probably tight lipped about it, but since you've been doing the due diligence for a while, is there a potential for expanding that number at this point? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would just \u2013 at this point, which we are now call it just over almost two months since the acquisition and based on the fact that we did extensive diligence of this business and this team, and prior to the transaction, I think I would right now currently would reiterate the, call it, $18 million-ish of overhead, which is I would say 70%-ish of their G&A. Operator : And the next question will come from Mathew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks for coming back around to me. Just regarding the topic of green energy and your initiatives there over the last several months. What do you think that brings to the conversation regarding some key renewals in DuPont's portfolio and just with respect to kind of your capabilities and your rankings in those \u2013 in the green power area relative to DuPont and your capabilities there? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would say, where the puff is going on Green is \u2013 it's going to become more of a table stakes requirement for any of these large sophisticated customers and consumers of power. And I think we have some competitive advantage today given how long we've been making sustainability a priority to digital. The financial benefits I mentioned as a counterparty to secure the \u2013 secure green power. So I think we're very much aligned with what our customers want from sustainability and green front, and I think we're only going to as a combined company with DFT, be able to offer the \u2013 that offering to our customers in a likely lower cost and more comprehensive way. Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today, by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page. We set the stage for continued future value creation, with an agreement to merge with DuPont Fabros, a high-quality, highly complementary portfolio, concentrated in top tier U.S. metros, in an accretive transaction that strengthens our balance sheet and expands our relationship with the blue-chip customer base. We also continue to support the growth of a diverse mix of customers who are driving the digital economy with a healthy level of new business and record renewal activity. We delivered solid current period financial results, beating consensus estimates by $0.05. Finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet by settling the remainder of our forward equity offering using the proceeds to redeem high coupon preferred and opportunistically raising an ample mix of attractively priced debt capital. We finished the quarter with the debt-to-EBITDA at approximately 5 times and fixed charge coverage over 4 times. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us and we hope you enjoyed the dark days of Zorro. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Let's begin on page 2 of our presentation. I'd like to focus today on capital allocation. As you know, we closed on the acquisition of DuPont Fabros during the third quarter, a high quality, highly complementary portfolio concentrated in top-tier U.S. metros and an accretive prudently financed transaction that expands our relationships with a blue chip customer base. Integration is well underway and Andy will cover this in detail in his comments. Earlier this week, we announced a 50/50 joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation to enhance our ability to provide data center solutions in Japan. And we provided a summary here on page 3. In a nutshell, we are contributing our recently completed project in Osaka and Mitsubishi is contributing two existing data centers in Tokyo. Although the venture is non-exclusive, the expectation is that this will be both partners primary data center investment vehicle in Japan. Japan is a highly strategic market and we see tremendous opportunity for growth over the next several years. This joint venture establishes our presence in Tokyo, which has been a longtime target market for us. In addition, we expect this joint venture will significantly enhance our ability to serve our customers data center needs in Japan. In particular, we expect that Mitsubishi's global brand recognition and local enterprise expertise will meaningfully improve our ability to penetrate local demand. Back in the U.S. we also entered into an agreement this week to acquire a data center in Chicago from a private REIT for $315 million. This value add-play offers a healthy going in yield along with shell capacity that gives us an opportunity to boost the unleveraged return up into the high single-digits. This investment represents an expansion in our core market and is occupied by existing Digital Realty customers with whom we have been independently working to meet their expansion requirements in the market. During the third quarter, we took steps to support our customers growth in key metro areas. We acquired land parcels adjacent to our existing holdings in Osaka, Japan and Garland, Texas during the third quarter. These parcels will ultimately support the development of more than 50 megawatts of incremental capacity, once our existing campuses in these markets are fully sold out. During the third quarter, we also announced that we were breaking ground on a new 14 megawatt data center in Sydney, Australia adjacent to our existing facility in Erskine Park. We also announced the expansion of our Silicon Valley Connected Campus with a 6 megawatt facility at 3205 Alfred Street in Santa Clara, California which is scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2018. We are pursuing LEED Gold certification for this project and we also received LEED Silver certification for the most recently completed building at our Franklin Park campus in Chicago during the third quarter. I'm also very pleased to report that we were ranked 6th on the EPA's top 30 Tech & Telecom list of green power users and we ranked 12th on the EPA's national top 100 list of green power users across all industries. As disclosed in our press release, we took a $29 million impairment charge during the third quarter on three underperforming properties to write them down to their estimated fair market value. These assets are generally redevelopment projects in markets where data center demand has proven to be comparatively thin, namely Boston and Sacramento. These assets no longer fit our strategy or investment criteria, and are classified as held for sale. We have a strong track record of success, on both development and redevelopment projects, but these three assets were clearly not our best performers, and we are reallocating resources and capital to assets and markets that represent a better opportunity to create value for our shareholders. We sold one asset during the third quarter, a fully leased Powered Base Building data center in Austin, Texas. We sold the asset to the user for $20 million at a 5% cap rate and recognized a $10 million gain on the sale during the third quarter. We sold another asset in Northern Virginia after the end of the quarter, likewise to a user, one of our publicly traded data center, REIT peers for $34 million at a 7% cap. This asset was held in a consolidated joint venture with Equinix, and we expect to book a $15 million gain on the sale during the fourth quarter of which our pro-rata share will be approximately $12 million. Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page 4. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center metros, but leasing velocity remains robust and industry participants are mostly adhering to a just in time inventory management approach, helping to keep new supply largely in check. Demand is outpacing supply in most major markets. The near-term funnel remains healthy and demand seems to be picking up as we head into the end of the year. In addition, vacancy rates remain tight across the board prompting us to bring on measured amounts of capacity to meet demand in select metro areas like Sydney, Silicon Valley and Chicago. We have seen a flurry of recent land deals in core markets and the number of new competitors is on the rise, although we believe our global platform, scale and operational track record represent key competitive advantages. Given the sector's recent history, any prospect of an uptick in speculative new supply bears watching. However, we remain encouraged by the depth and breadth of demand for our scale, co-location and interconnection solutions. We expect the demand will continue to outstrip supply, while barriers to entry are beginning to grow in select metros, which we believe bodes well for long-term rent growth, as well as the enduring value of infill portfolios such as ours. Now, let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. The current monetary, fiscal, and regulatory climate remains broadly supportive and the prospect of tax reform remains intact. Global economic growth forecasts have improved somewhat over the past 90 days and most economic indicators have edged up as well. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth or the price of oil. However, data is the new oil, driving the digital economy, and data wants to be close to the compute engine. Compute engines reside within the scaled data center footprints and Digital Realty scale strategy is the prerequisite to enabling these deployments. Workloads need to be logically close and connected to data lakes, and we are well-positioned to connect workloads to data on our global connected campus network and through our Service Exchange offering. Enterprise architectures are going through a transformation and workloads are transitioning from on-premise to a hybrid multi-cloud environment. Our comprehensive product offering is critical to capturing this shift. Cloud demand continues to grow at a rapid clip, but future growth in the data center sector will come from artificial intelligence. The power, cooling and interconnection requirements for AI applications are drastically different than traditional workloads, and Digital Realty is well-positioned to support the unique requirements and tremendous growth potential of this next-generation technology suite. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. We signed total bookings for the third quarter of $58 million, including an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power, totaling $50 million during the third quarter, including a $6 million co-location contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the third quarter was nine years. Our third quarter wins showcase the strengths of our combined organization as the bulk of our activity was concentrated on our collective campuses in Ashburn, which is not only the largest and fastest growing data center market in the world, but also the combined company's largest metro area in terms of existing capacity and ability to support our customers growth. Although the lion's share of our bookings landed in North America, two of our top five wins during the third quarter were with leading Chinese cloud and Internet service providers sourced by our Asia-Pacific sales team. We closed six fairly sizable transactions with customers from China during the third quarter, including three direct deals with existing customers, two direct deals with new logos, and one channel transaction with an existing customer. We were quite pleased to be able to support the growth of these magnet customers' respective footprints here in the U.S. Our enterprise team notched several strategic wins, including a new logo win that brought a global provider of food, agricultural and industrial products to our Chicago campus. We also continued to support the growth of an existing customer, a provider of data protection solutions for businesses and IT professionals with their expansion into a third location within our portfolio. Our network team continued to support the growth of a wired and wireless communications infrastructure customer on our Dallas campus, in addition to ecosystem-rich wins with global cloud and network service providers in our New York Internet gateways. We added a total of 36 new logos during the third quarter and we signed over 200 leases for space and power. Including interconnection, we completed more than 900 transactions. We continue to build and refine our partners and alliances capabilities to extend our reach to serve enterprise customer demand both directly and through various leading IT services and cloud service providers. Through our alliance program, we delivered an integrated solution for a second site deployment for a leading multinational networking and telecommunications equipment manufacturer during the third quarter. We're also continuing to expand our capabilities and footprint with cloud service providers. Through our Connected Campus and Service Exchange interconnection platform, we are enabling customers to establish direct private connections to the leading Infrastructure-as-a-Service, PaaS and higher value SaaS offerings globally from our data centers on a connected network with a single user interface. These capabilities help our customers accelerate deployments of hybrid cloud solutions and open new opportunities to serve enterprise customers either directly or through our partners and alliances programs. As we've discussed on previous calls, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliances programs to create meaningful upside for our customers and our business over time through a set of referral, sell-to and sell-with programs. Our current partners and customers see the value of our focus on working with quality solution and service providers to create a comprehensive IT solution offering. In terms of integration, activities related to the DuPont Fabros acquisition are well underway. We have established a comprehensive communication program for the team members who joined Digital Realty at closing, and we have executed a customer outreach plan to embrace all legacy DFT clients. At the property level, we are completing security system upgrades to ensure that each of the acquired properties meets Digital Realty standards. We're also performing system audits and updating operations, policies and procedures. The systems integration is progressing well, and the migration of accounting, finance, and HR-related applications is expected to be finished by year-end. We will continue to update all customer-facing material and will sunset the DFT logo and marketing materials during the fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate that the vast majority of integration activities will be wrapped up by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Turning to our backlog on page 8, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $106 million. The step up from $64 million last quarter reflects the $50 million of space and power leases signed, along with the $59 million backlog inherited from the DuPont Fabros acquisition offset by $67 million of commencements. The weighted average lag between third quarter signings and commencements improved to four months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9. We retained 86% of third quarter lease expirations, and we signed $66 million of renewals during the third quarter, in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over six years, and cash rents on renewal leases rolled down 3.8%, primarily due to two sizable above market leases that were renewed during the third quarter, one on the East Coast, and one in Phoenix. These are the two markets we have previously called out as the primary culprits of above market rents in our portfolio. These are unfortunately not the last two above market leases in the portfolio, thus the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. On balance, however, we expect cash re-leasing spreads will be positive for the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth, and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. In terms of our third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 170 basis points sequentially to 90.8%, partially due to the inclusion of the stabilized DFT assets. However, we also registered positive net absorption within the standalone Digital Realty portfolio, notably in Dallas, Chicago and the Bay area, and same-capital portfolio occupancy also improved by 30 basis points sequentially to 90.2%. The US dollar continued to soften during the third quarter, and finally rolled over relative to the prior year, as you can see depicted on the chart at the bottom of page 10. As a result, FX represented roughly a 30 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our third quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. Same-capital cash NOI growth was 4.1% on a reported basis for the third quarter and 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share grew by 5% both on a reported and a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share came in $0.03 ahead of consensus, as well as our own internal forecast. And as you may have seen from the press release, we are raising guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow through from the deal (20: 21). In terms of the quarterly distribution, we still expect the first half will represent roughly 51% of the full year results, while the second half is still expected to contribute roughly 49%. This does imply a step down from the third quarter to the fourth quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, the primary driver is a full quarter with the higher share count outstanding following the close of the DFT acquisition late in the third quarter. We still expect to realize approximately $18 million of annualized overhead synergies and we still expect the transaction will be roughly 2% accretive to core FFO per share in 2018 and roughly 4% accretive to 2018 AFFO per share. However, these synergies will not fully be realized until 2018 and the quarterly run rate is expected to spring load in the fourth quarter before bouncing back in 2018. With respect to AFFO, I would like to highlight again this quarter the long term trend in straight-line rent. As you can see on page 13, non-cash straight-line rental revenue has come down from a run rate of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, all the way down to less than $2 million in this quarter. Over that same time, quarterly revenue has grown by 60% from $380 million to more than $600 million. This trend reflects several years of consistent improvement in data center market fundamentals, as well as the impact of tighter underwriting discipline, which has driven steady growth in our cash flows and sustained improvement in the quality of our earnings. We had another particularly active quarter on the financing front with numerous steps taken to further strengthen our balance sheet over the past 90 days, which we have itemized here on page 14. In late July, we issued two tranches of Sterling denominated bonds with a weighted average maturity of 10 years, and a blended coupon of just over 3% raising gross proceeds of approximately $780 million. In early August, we prefunded a portion of the DuPont Fabros acquisition with the issuance of $1.35 billion of U.S. dollar bonds with a weighted average maturity of nine years, and a blended coupon of 3.45%. This was only the sixth time an investment grade U.S. listed REIT has issued a $1 billion or more in a single tranche of bonds. The transaction was well oversubscribed and priced 10 basis points inside of where our existing bonds were trading on the secondary market prior to the transaction. Needless to say, we're pleased with the solid execution and the strong investor interest in the Digital Realty credit story. We also raised $200 million of perpetual preferred equity at 5.25%, an all-time low coupon for Digital Realty and the lowest rate ever achieved on a REIT preferred offering with a crossover rating. In mid-September, we closed on the DuPont Fabros acquisition and exchanged all the outstanding DFT common shares and units for approximately 43 million shares of DLR common stock and 6 million OP units. Also in conjunction with the DuPont Fabros acquisition, we exchanged the DFT 6.625% Series C Preferred for a new Digital Realty Series C Preferred with a liquidation value of $201 million. We also tendered for the DFT 5.875% high-yield notes due 2021, settled nearly 80% of the $600 million outstanding at closing in mid-September and redeemed the remainder within a few days post closing. Subsequent to quarter-end, we redeemed all $250 million of the DFT 5.625% high-yield notes due 2023 and a blended 106.3% of par or a total cost of $270.5 million, including accrued interest and the make-whole premium. When the dust settled at the end of the quarter, debt-to-EBITDA stood at 6 times and fixed charge coverage was just under 4 times, as you can see from the left side of the chart on page 15. However, that's a bit misleading, since all the debt related to the DuPont Fabros acquisition was on the balance sheet as of September 30, but the third quarter only included a 17-day contribution from the DFT assets. Adjusting for a full-quarter contribution, the balance sheet actually improves as a result of the DuPont Fabros acquisition and debt-to-EBITDA dips down below 5x and fixed charge coverage remains above 4x, as you can see on the right-hand side of the chart. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 16, we have a clear runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet remains well-positioned for growth consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session. Operator : I would be happy to, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks very much. I wondered on the international front, if you could talk a little bit about Europe and any sort of update on Frankfurt as well as the momentum you're seeing with retail and interconnects in the acquired Telecity assets, as well as over in Japan with Mitsubishi joint venture, and how you intend to staff and brand that? Will that be kind of its own operating entity or would that be a DLR branded in some fashion? Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan, this is Andy. Maybe I'll take the first part, touch on Europe, and then I'll hand it over to Scott to give you an update on the Mitsubishi JV. So over \u2013 I think the first part of the question was with regard to Frankfurt. I had an opportunity to spend some time with the team in Frankfurt a handful of weeks ago. I was able to tour our new scale campus that is quickly coming online, which I think is going to be a great flagship scale product offering in that market. I know we are in advanced discussions with one of the top five cloud service providers to serve as an anchor customer for that site. So that will be a great win. And then also I've spent some time with the team operating the colocation site, which was one of the eight properties we acquired summer previously, and we've had great wins there on the colocation and interconnection front with a fairly strong lease-up to that specific asset's occupancy. Broadly speaking, I think Europe in general had a fairly strong first half. We had a comparable anchor win to our campus on the scale side. In Amsterdam we had growth from a U.S. specialty cloud provider in Dublin and we had some great wins on the colo and interconnection side as well. In some of our London assets, I think, we had a little bit lighter quarter in the third quarter, largely due to some of the timing of inventory coming online, but I do expect to see a pretty strong fourth quarter on the Europe front. And I'll hand it over to Scott to talk to the Mitsubishi JV. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Jonathan. On Mitsubishi JV, that's going to be co-branded, but it will be very clear that it's a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Digital Realty. We're very excited about this opportunity. It's going to allow us to further serve our customers in this important Japanese market and specifically access to the Tokyo market. As you can imagine, it's a long process to go it alone there. We have a lot of our international customers have immediate needs in Japan, which we'd like to be able to serve and this really gets us up the curve a lot faster on that. We get to bring our global customer base, our global platform and operations, development capabilities, a balance sheet obviously, they bring a strong balance sheet as well as local presence, land positions and relationships that will help us both address the market in a much more timely and effective manner for our customers. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then finally just is there anything post the end of the quarter that you could provide any granularity on in terms of pre-leasing in the portfolio? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No, no new news to post to you on the handful of days we're into October, but I think you can expect an update from us somewhat close to mid-quarter in our Investor Day coming in early December. Operator : And the next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. Bill, in your prepared remarks, you touched on the demand picking up heading into the end of the year. And, Andy, you just ran through some of the strength. It sounds like that Europe could be a nice pacesetter for next quarter. I'm trying to figure out on a pro forma basis with DFT what the new bogey is in terms of leasing for DLR on a quarterly basis? And I know you don't really give guidance around that, but should we expect if demand is picking up that the 4Q could be as good as the volume we were able to produce in 3Q? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Jordan. This is Dan Papes. I'll start with an answer to that. I'd just characterize it this way that the acquisition and \u2013 sorry, the merger with DFT has certainly stirred up interest from their customer base and our customer base. And we're optimistic that that's going to be helpful. But, at the same time, I don't want to \u2013 we don't really commit to a run rate or anything like that. I would just say that we feel like the demand in the fourth quarter is healthy. And from what visibility we have into the first quarter, it's healthy as well. We're going to just have to see how we execute against the pipeline of opportunities that we have. And you'll see that unfold as we're able to close transactions. If anybody wants to... A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jordan, what I would add too is that the deals are definitely getting bigger. There are bigger deals in the pipeline. But with that comes lumpiness. So we could have a great quarter in the fourth quarter or it could be a great quarter in the first quarter, but there is a lot of potential volume in Dan's pipe for sure. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I was glad to see that the asset sale pipeline appears to be picking up a little bit. It seems like you guys are cleaning out some of the slower growth or assets with less opportunity. Can you maybe just flesh out, Scott, for us, what this looks like, this held-for-sale pipeline in terms of overall volume and then maybe what else might be in the portfolio in terms of scale to dispose of? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Sure thing, Jordon. So these were \u2013 we went through and looked at our portfolio and tried to identify some of the other assets that would be considered non-core or non-core markets, and we came up with these additional assets \u2013 four assets that we're putting into the held-for-sale category. We are also conducting regular reviews on our portfolio. So it's a little premature to tell you what the volume might be of other ones, so if you can give me a few months to work through that. We're expecting that these assets will probably trade somewhere in the first half of 2018, the ones that we have right now, but I think it's safe to assume that we will regularly review our portfolio to cull non-core or underperforming assets. Operator : And the next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Two questions, if I may. Of the 33 megawatts of TKF that was leased in North America in the quarter, how much of that was in legacy DLR facilities versus legacy DuPont Fabros facilities? And then, secondly, the $59 million of backlog that you referenced for DuPont, is that the backlog that they had at the end of their second quarter, or is that the backlog that they had as of the last day before the transaction closed with you? Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Colby. Andy here. So, going to your first question, I would say a large share of our North America signings were in the Ashburn market, and there were some fairly large signings in there. But it was fairly spread as well. So we had a top five cloud service provider sign a multiple megawatt deal, which really was the last major signing to cap off our previous Digital Realty standalone campus. We had the first meg-plus deal from an international customer signed onto the new Building L and we also had sizable signings into the legacy DFT ACC complex. So it was... Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Is it fair to assume that then 20 megawatts in that 33 megawatts came from the DuPont Fabros facilities? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would say the \u2013 I can tell you all the signings \u2013 new signings in the legacy DFT assets happened really just post the shareholder vote by both companies. The largest signing I think was about 15 megs on a single lease, but adding up to total customers, it probably approaches that 20 megawatts number from one customer. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And then on the backlog? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then your second question, that was the 2Q backlog. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: So did they sign anything between the second quarter close and when the deal with you closed that is worth calling out? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: There were no new signings between 6/30/2017 and the shareholder vote. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder, Bill, if you could expand on your prepared remarks about AI and, in particular, just help us understand what you see as the kind of the market opportunity there and how the timing, when does that really start to impact your volumes in terms of orders and revenues? Thanks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We've always seen some demand for it. So it's \u2013 what I'd say, we're at the \u2013 we're in the first half inning of a nine-inning game there. And our take is that it's going to be -as I said, the demand will be substantial and I think the power requirements will be significant as well going into this. And I think we'll see a lot of this from our existing customer base. Dan, you might want to expand on that? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Okay... Operator : I'm sorry, was there another question from you, Mr. Flannery? Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. I don't know, was there \u2013 was Dan going to follow up on that? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No, Bill, I think sufficiently answered the question, Simon, unless you have a specific follow up. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Well, on the power requirements, is that something that might require kind of a denser build in future phases, or do you think you're going to accomplish that within your existing architecture? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I think we can accomplish more power density within our existing build. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I mean ... A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: ... Simon, just want to add \u2013 this is Andy. Just to add onto that. I mean, we're seeing a range of customer density demands, and it's not always dictated by specific industry verticals for that matter. But you may have enterprise customers that wants a lower density in terms of power per square foot and you may have other customers that are driving that well into the 200 watts per square foot. And I believe we create our build to be able to bring incremental power to the floor as needed and respond to the customer demand. And I think this AI trend is going to further those boundaries. Operator : And the next question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Talk to us a little bit about the DFT model sort of as a product set. Are you looking to expand that model possibly through some of your other campuses? How are you look at that? And then as sort of a follow-up. For a couple of markets DFT was in, particularly I think in Canada, they're a little bit new for you. How has pre-leasing trended in those markets during the quarter? Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Frank, this is Andy. So on the model, so pretty much anything really in-flight, in terms of near-term deliveries or last legs of expansion are pretty much dictated by the existing DFT design. So you can expect that for our most recent deliveries just wrapping up in Santa Clara ,the next builds of our ACC 10 Phase 2 and similarly in Chicago. When it comes to new swathes of available capacity, be it just down the road from the ACC complex and our latest land acreage in Ashburn, we are creating Building L, which is the first phase is 36 megawatts, but that entire site has capacity to call it 250 megawatts, and we have greater ability on those land parcels to provide various build types depending on the customer demand. So we think being able to have the flexibility to offer various designs to capture a broader amount of customer demand is a competitive strength. And having that with the acreage and power capacity in core growing markets is also to our advantage. Your second question was really I think speaking to cross-sells and some of the newer expansions. Toronto, in particular, we've seen great interest from several customers, legacy DFT customers that had looked in to expand with a megawatt or so. We've also seen interest from legacy Digital Realty customers that really had not done any business with DFT but had been looking for capacity in Toronto where we're essentially out of inventory and fully leased and now looking to expand. So we think there are substantial cross-sell opportunities here, and the Toronto is just a one-off example of something that will down the road pay dividends. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I think it can have \u2013 this is Scott. The Toronto is kind of a land constrained market, so the supply is somewhat limited. So I think that will help us in our leasing there. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Frank, it's Dan, too, just as the leader of the sales organization, I'm very happy to have inventory in Toronto for our customers, because that's something that our customers have been expressing interest in since I've been here. Similar to my being happy to have inventory now in Frankfurt for customers who have been asking for it for some time. So that's good. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Please go ahead. David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon, good evening, guys. Bill, DFT I think negotiated a lot of their super wholesale deals at the various highest level of the executive pool. I think you mentioned it was a pretty simple lease structure. Do you guys have a plan in place to kind of go and attack those same customers to Andy's point of maybe changing your build structure to some extent? So is there a sales plan? Is there kind of a lease structure that you're contemplating to go after that group of tenants? And as a follow-up to that, can you update us maybe on the Facebook leases that you inherited. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So in terms of executive interaction with the customers, we have something that we call an executive sponsor program here at Digital. So we have accounts that are assigned to members of our executive leadership team for coverage in addition to the day-to-day sales team. So we'll have two or three accounts assigned to individuals on our leadership team. I'm sorry, what was your other question? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I can help out. The other one on the design side, I think building larger footprint buildings with larger data halls is something we've done on many occasions. I think it's important to remember the most significant departure between us and DuPont from a design standpoint was really the way the UPS is designed. We have typically built a battery UPS system, and they've done a rotary piller unit UPS system, which by the way we have many of those deployments in our portfolio. So it's a matter of preference on that, and of course we're always reviewing to see which is the best design. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And the second part of that ... David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just on... A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sorry. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sorry, go ahead. David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just on the Facebook leases was just the second part of that. Sorry, if I interrupted. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. So I think you asked about an update on a major customer. No, obviously, we can't provide any specific details. They're confidential to our customer. We did have a very large volume of renewals. I believe it was our highest quarterly renewal quantum in the history of digital, but we did not \u2013 I could tell you there were not any major renewals executed during the quarter. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And can I just to add to Bill's answer, Dave, in regards to I think your question was something around senior executives being involved in transactions and bringing them to closure. We have become much more active in that way as a senior leadership team in the field. I, myself and my peers and Bill spend, I would say, daresay much more time with clients now than we did a year ago. And we also did one \u2013 of the things that we saw from DuPont Fabros was they were very effective in that. And as we look at best practices from DuPont Fabros, we saw that as a success factor that we feel like is important for us to leverage, so we are doing a lot more of that. I think it's a great question and something that we're focused on. David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Please go ahead. Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first, I was wondering if you went back to slide seven, if it was possible to break out the dollar impact of the leasing between the heritage digital business versus DuPont in the quarter? And then just second to that, you mentioned that a lot of the activity was concentrated in the Ashburn market during the quarter, and do you think that was just an issue of where customer decisions were getting made, or is there some share shift that may be happening in some of the other markets, or is even possible that it's just what's in the available-to-sale category? Just some insights on the concentration maybe versus historical diversity of bookings would be helpful. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Michael, this is Andy. Let me see if I can tackle, I may have to reverse order. So last quarter was a very hot Dallas quarter, we had multiple customers with multiple megawatt signings, this quarter was a very hot Ashburn quarter. I can tell you Ashburn is a very competitive market, probably our most competitive, but we had many wins in Ashburn during the quarter from various types of buyers of cloud buyers, other international companies and other technology companies. I'm not sure \u2013 and there's obviously very well known merits to why customers choose Ashburn, why this quarter versus last quarter or the quarter preceded made Ashburn the winner. I'm not sure there was anything that pointed out specifically. I think it's a market that has demand from the most amount of industry verticals, you have top cloud companies, network companies, enterprise customers, all seeking to deploy there. And this was obviously a big winning quarter for us on all of our three major locations in Ashburn. I think your second question was really breaking out how much of the third quarter signings landed in the legacy ACC construct. I think I've touched on this with an response to Colby's question. I believe the largest signing was roughly 15-ish megs and the second largest was 7 megs. Both of those into legacy DFT ACC complexes. And then I think after that there was a 4.5 megawatt signing into the last building on the legacy Loughton Digital Campus, and then over 1.5 meg landed in the brand new building now on our latest Digital Realty campus and the largest capacity for growth. I would say it's not all Ashburn. We did have deals ranging from 300, 200 kilowatts to close to 1.5 meg; also in San Francisco, down in Santa Clara and Chicago and Dallas, it's just that the predominance of winnings was in Ashburn this quarter. Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I was just curious, it seemed like you guys were making a special point about the demand or the signings that you had from some of the larger Chinese cloud, and Internet players. And I was just curious are you seeing significant pick-up in interest from that region, and those types of tenants such that we might see a bit of an uplift over the next couple of quarters from that category? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vincent, it's Dan. Thanks for the question. I'll take the scenario that we're excited about the opportunity, we did capture three inbound opportunities as you heard from Chinese cloud service providers. And we don't believe they're done. We believe that it could be the start of something very important for us. So we're on it and pursuing it and hopeful it will continue to provide us some meaningful opportunities for growth. I would not say these are anomalous transactions. I think that there will be several more in the future and we want to go capture those. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And, Bill, maybe going back to something you said in your opening remarks about rising barriers to entry in certain markets. I mean it seems like land availability is becoming a problem for certain markets, but I was just curious if you could provide some more color on what you meant by \u2013 what barriers exactly were you referring to? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: You're right. I mean land is significant. It's a significant issue in Silicon Valley. It will be an issue in Loughton. I think that's why you're seeing this sort of mad rush to acquire land because there's the availability of suitable sites is definitely depleting. And then, in certain markets, power is an issue; it's not a permanent barrier, but it certainly can be a multi-year barrier. I want to go back to \u2013 for your first question, though, the other thing that we've done as a change is that we now have a Mandarin speaking salesperson based in Hong Kong in our Hong Kong office, and so we're covering the Mainland Chinese companies from that office with this person and that has clearly worked out well. That person had prior relationships with the Chinese Internet companies. Operator : The next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Just to follow-up on that quickly, where are you seeing more of the activity from the Chinese companies? Where are they looking? And it seems like we're hearing more about the Chinese cloud players coming to the U.S. So just kind of trying to get a sense of where they're interested in booking space. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Richard. So it's actually fairly broad-based. We had signings in Ashburn, we had signings in Santa Clara, we had signings in Chicago, and then some smaller signings in Atlanta and Portland. So it's actually been pretty broad-based. But, obviously, I think the larger signings are more aligned with our campus locations and many of those signings usually land with 1 meg or so, and with the customer quickly coming back looking to expand. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And I guess you have been very consistent with the 57% to 59% adjusted EBITDA margin with DuPont. Should we expect that to go to the higher end as things get integrated or are enough things happening that you're investing and that range is kind of the range we should be looking for? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: My guess is, with the quarter \u2013 really a full quarter and half-a-month of the DFT transaction under our belt, we will be guiding slightly to the higher end of that range of our guidance, and obviously it should be more helpful as we move into 2018, given the operating efficiencies from that portfolio. Operator : The next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about \u2013 you did a number of kind of one-off dispositions and acquisitions, kind of curious, some more color on, I guess, the ease of selling stabilized data centers on a one-off basis. I think historically we've seen more of M&A focused on large portfolio transactions, I guess, it's becoming easier as the industry kind of normalizes to sell one-off buildings. And then, specifically, on the two dispositions you did, the one in Austin at a 5% cap rate and the one in Sterling, Virginia at 7%, just curious for some more details on what the discrepancy in those cap rates would be. I would think a Northern Virginia data center would trade at a lower cap rate just given the strength of that market. Curious about some more details specifically on those buildings. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Jon. And I'll take the two assets first and then I'll go to the other one. But, Austin, as you know, we sold it to the existing customer there and that was a separately negotiated transaction and we think we got a good outcome on that from a cap rate perspective. Virginia, and by the way, it's a general statement, I think cap rates are probably not the best way to always look at these. But if you look at Virginia that asset was a joint venture with Equinix. They were interested in disposing of that asset as well. If you look at it on a whole picture of all the metrics on a price per foot, the quality of the asset, the amount of office and the relative data center, if you look at all of those components on it, you'll see that it was a pretty good outcome from a valuation perspective. So, the cap rates can be a little misleading on those two. The ease of selling one-off assets in markets, I would say, if you had a good one-off asset in a core market, they're probably still pretty easy to sell, you get outside of the core markets and they can get a little bit more difficult to sell, because then the size of them will determine who the potential customers are that might \u2013 or the buyers that might buy that. So it does get a little more difficult in \u2013 Sacramento is a good example, we're going to pair an asset that we've held for sale with another existing well leased asset in an effort to kind of get a little more bulk there and attract some other buyers. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then I guess as a follow-up on that same point, I'm just kind of curious which type of building is commanding a lower cap rate today, kind of a power-based building leased do like a credit tenant on a long-term basis or just kind of your traditional multi-tenant wholesale data center building? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I think the long-term lease PBB kind of net lease assets are still easy to buy and a little lower on the cap rate spectrum just given there's a much larger universe of buyers. You can find a lot of passive buyers who would clip coupons. For the multi-tenant data centers, you have to consider what you're going to do from an operational standpoint. But I will also say as a general statement, there's been \u2013 while those cap rates used to have a few hundred basis points spread between them, those spreads have got compressed quite a bit. And in some cases, they're kind of right on top of each other. Operator : The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Not sure if you touched on this yet, but I was wondering if you could offer an update on the COO search. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure, Jordan. I can do that. We engaged Heidrick & Struggles to do the search. I think that they've certainly sourced a number of highly qualified candidates. I've met with several as have members of the management team here. So, I think we're making good progress. But I think what's important here is that we're going to take as much time as we need to, to find the right addition to the team. And I feel comfortable and confident that things are being handled appropriately in the interim. We have Chris Sharp, who is now part of the leadership team, in-charge of his old area, plus product and NSEs (58:12), and then the data center ops team is reporting into Andy. So, things are in good hands while we pursue this search. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the interconnection side, during the quarter it looks like you added 1,400 cross-connects sequentially, was that entirely organic? So, no contribution from DFT whatsoever? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Correct. No material contribution from DFT. Operator : And the last question will come from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : Thanks. Hey, guys. Can you provide some color on market rent growth across your portfolio? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Lukas. Andy here. Happy to do that. I would say, if you look at to maybe start with North America, rental rates in the Ashburn market, where you've seen the largest amount of demand, but also the largest amounts of competition and supply are relatively flat. Conversely if you go to the other coast to the Valley, we're continuing to see a modest uptick in rents, certainly on a year-over-year basis really due to the supply constraints in that market, limited capacity coming online by ourselves and our competitors and there's much less competitors. Kind of in between Chicago, Dallas and maybe kind of put them certainly in between those two bookends for you, flat to slightly rising rates. Broadly speaking, I think despite the robustness in the overall volume of demand, the fact that supply is rising up to just try to intersect with that demand is something that kind of puts a bit of a lid on rates from spiking and you also have a phenomenon where the buyers are buying in bigger and bigger quantities, hence commanding better pricing on each of those buys. We remain optimistic that these rates stay flat to slightly increasing, going within the U.S. for half a second. I think we're seeing similar trends in our major campus oriented markets, be it Frankfurt, London, Hampshire and Dublin, and same thing in Singapore and Sydney. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : That's really helpful. And then one last quick one. The straight line rents, they've been declining over time. Can you remind us what the main driver of that is? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Two drivers. One is just obviously just natural as you move through the lease of the delta between cash and GAAP rents changes. But I think the more material one is really a firming up over several quarters, not just a quarter-over-quarter change, but several quarters and even probably years of the market where really less and less incentives, free rent or ramps had been given away as the market tightened and came out of trough, and hence we were able to command firmer pricing and less incentives, that's more of a better quality of our earnings. Operator : And at this time, we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we closed on the acquisition of DuPont Fabros, a high quality, highly complementary portfolio concentrated in top tier U.S. metros, an accretive, prudently financed transaction that expands our relationships with a blue chip customer base. Two, we delivered solid current period financial results, beating consensus estimates by $0.03 and we raised the midpoint of our full year guidance by $0.03 as well. Last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by refinancing DuPont Fabros's high yield debt with attractively priced long-term capital and exchanging the DFT common shares units and preferred stock for DLR common and preferred equity. We finished the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA below 5 times and fixed charge coverage above 4 times, both pro forma, for a full quarter contribution from DuPont Fabros. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us, and we hope to see many of you at our Investor Day in December. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and SVP of Sales & Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. First of all, we came in $0.04 ahead of the high end of our initial 2017 guidance range, driven by operational outperformance within both the legacy DFT and Digital Realty portfolios. Second, we've landed over 30 megawatts within the legacy DFT portfolio over the past five months, capitalizing on the value of the installed customer base to realize revenue synergies in addition to hitting our expense synergy targets. Third, we expect to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. Last but not least, we expect to achieve this growth while maintaining our target leverage and self-funding our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today on page two of our presentation with a recap of the principles that we laid out at our Investor Day in December. We've set ambitious growth targets over the next several years, and we expect to achieve them from a global connected sustainable framework. What that really means is further leveraging our leading global platform to cross-sell, in addition to addressing new markets that meet our risk adjusted return criteria. Our top priority is deepening our connections with customers to position us to meet their needs and support their growth. In addition, we are focused on further strengthening connections across the organization making sure that processes are streamlined, systems are integrated and people are performing efficiently. We are committed to sustainability and we are focused on delivering sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees. Let's turn to our recent investment activity on page 3. As you know, we entered Tokyo, a longtime target for us during the fourth quarter through a 50-50 joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. We contributed our recently completed project in Osaka, and Mitsubishi contributed two existing data centers in Tokyo. Japan is a highly strategic market and we see tremendous opportunity for growth over the next several years. We expect this joint venture will significantly enhance our ability to serve our customers' data center needs in Japan. In particular, we expect that Mitsubishi's global brand recognition and local enterprise expertise will meaningfully improve our ability to penetrate local demand. We also closed on the acquisition of a data center in Chicago from a private REIT during the fourth quarter for $315 million. This value add-play offers a healthy going in yield along with shell capacity that gives us an opportunity to boost the unlevered return up into the high single-digits. The investment represents an expansion in a core market and is occupied by existing Digital Realty customers with whom we had been independently working to meet their expansion requirements in Chicago. Separately, we closed on the sale of two non-core assets at a 7.1% cap rate generating a little over $70 million in net proceeds. And we recognized gains of approximately $27 million during the fourth quarter. Since year-end, we've sold two more non-core assets generating net proceeds of a little less than $90 million and we expect to recognize gains of approximately $25 million during the first quarter. Since embarking on our capital recycling program a little over three years ago, we have now sold a total of 14 assets generating over $500 million of net proceeds and recognizing sizable gains in the process. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets. We believe that culling the asset base is prudent real estate portfolio management and we expect to generate up to another $100 million of proceeds from asset sales in 2018. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 4. Data center construction crews remain active across the primary data center metros, particularly in Northern Virginia. However, some context may be in order. It's helpful to remember that according to CBRE, the Northern Virginia data center inventory is larger than the total data center stock in any country in either Europe or Asia Pacific. As a result, while the absolute number of megawatts under construction may be big, we are very comfortable with our development exposure, as well as the pace of absorption in Northern Virginia, especially in the context of such a deep and active market with vacancy hovering in the low single digits. In fact, those of you who saw the Ashburn time lapse video at our Investor Day in December will be aware that we expect all the developable land in Loudoun County will be fully built out in the coming years. We believe our strategic landholdings represent a precious commodity and a key competitive advantage. Very few markets around the world operate at such a well-oiled cadence as Northern Virginia. For instance, there has been very limited inventory available in Silicon Valley for over a year, so recent leasing velocity has slowed considerably pending the arrival of new deliveries. In Europe, demand is likewise robust, and 2017 was a record year for net absorption. Our participation was somewhat limited largely due to a lack of available inventory. We have recently brought capacity online in Amsterdam and London, and we expect to deliver additional capacity in the Frankfurt, London and Amsterdam in the first quarter to position us to capture a greater share of the strong current demand in Europe. Across the Asia Pacific region demand remains robust, particularly from the global hyperscale players. The supply situation varies considerably by market. The local markets tend to be dominated by large telcos, and there's generally a shortage of institutional quality modern data center stock. The region is highly fragmented with very few pan-regional offerings. The limited available options for state-of-the-art carrier neutral facilities across multiple markets plays directly to our competitive advantages. In addition to our deliveries, competitors are also bringing supply online to meet this demand, but the rapid pace of absorption is keeping vacancy rates below equilibrium in the single-digits. In sum, competition remains intense, particularly for larger requirements. And given the sector's recent history, any uptick in new supply bears careful watching. However, current vacancy rates are tight and we expect demand will continue to outstrip supply, while barriers to entry are beginning to emerge in select metros, which bodes well for long term rent growth, as well as the enduring value of infill portfolios such as ours. Now let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. The biggest change over the last 90 days has been tax reform. We expect minimal impact on our financials from the specific provisions of the tax reform bill, but we do believe it will be good for our customers businesses. And as a result, it should bode well for data center demand. We saw very healthy growth from our customer base during the fourth quarter. The three leading cloud service providers each generated over $5 billion in cloud revenue during the fourth quarter alone, all growing at a very healthy clip well into the double digits. The top seven cloud providers all generated over $1 billion of cloud revenue in the fourth quarter. This broad based growth plays directly to the strengths of our carrier neutral, cloud neutral platform. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that we would be offering private connections to the Oracle Cloud in 14 major metros and a total of 59 data centers through our Service Exchange. Similar to other leading cloud providers, Oracle maintains a significant presence in numerous locations across multiple regions within our global portfolio. This recent announcement demonstrates the value proposition to our joint customers by giving them the ability to connect directly, privately and securely to a public cloud compute engine that sits right next to their private cloud environment within the same campus environment, reinforcing one of the key differentiators of our offering. The relevance of this capability was reinforced by the RightScale 2018 State of the Cloud Report published earlier this week, which found that on average companies are using about five public and private clouds. Separately, the Cisco Global Cloud Index forecasts that the number of hyperscale data centers will nearly double by 2021. Hyperscale data centers will account for more than half of all installed data center servers by 2021, and traffic within hyperscale data centers will quadruple by 2021. The opportunity to serve this rapidly growing segment of the market on a global scale meshes well with our competencies. We believe we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand set-up given our global platform, our comprehensive product offering, and our investment grade balance sheet. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. We signed total bookings for the fourth quarter of $56 million including a $6 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $50 million during the fourth quarter, including a $9 million colocation contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the fourth quarter was approximately seven years. Our fourth quarter wins continue to showcase the strengths of our global platform, as well as the demand for our multiproduct offering from both new digital economy customers, as well as more traditional enterprises. A leading Internet hyperscale user further expanded its footprint with us taking down another 12 megawatts in Ashburn and underscoring the value of the installed customer base and the relationships inherited through the DFT transaction. We also won a sizable new logo deployment from a significant online multiplayer game creation platform further diversifying our customer base in Northern Virginia. Additionally, a primary global provider of financial market data and analytics grew with us in the tri-state area citing our operational effectiveness and our relationships with many of their subscribers. Finally, not that all roads lead to Ashburn, but it's certainly been a lynchpin of our ability to sell to an international customer base across four global theaters. Ashburn twofers during the fourth quarter included an expansion with a large Chinese cloud service provider on our newest Ashburn campus. A top five cloud service provider expanded with us not just in Ashburn, but also in Sydney. And we also expanded a European SaaS provider in Sydney in addition to their inaugural deployment back in Ashburn. Combined colocation and connectivity signings rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter. One of the world's largest telecommunications companies expanded in four locations across North America. A leading provider of integrated telecommunications services in Latin America expanded with us in one of our lower Manhattan Internet gateways demonstrating that the critical connectivity points in our portfolio will continue to drive regionally diverse demand. Finally, on the enterprise front, one of America's oldest theater company selected Digital Realty as their trusted data center provider for all of their mission critical applications. Of the record 51 new logos added during the fourth quarter, nearly 19% were sourced through our North American and European colocation platforms, including 13 in Europe, likewise a regional high mark. Roughly half of these new logos were within the network sector, including a nationwide managed service provider, a cable provider and a computer software company; roughly half were enterprise, including an artificial intelligence platform, an online trading community, and a content provider. The breadth and diversity of this new business should serve to drive new end users to the connectivity ecosystems and bodes well for future interconnection revenue growth given the historical correlation between new logos and interconnection bookings in subsequent periods. Our partners and alliance capabilities delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year of 2017, we achieved significant growth compared to the prior year due to the establishment of an alliance partner framework in addition to our focus and execution against our existing partner programs. We also provided our partners a set of standardized colocation and connectivity rate cards to make it easier for them to include us in their menu of services. These programs effectively extend our reach to serve enterprise customer demand for comprehensive solutions through various leading IT services, network and cloud service providers. Through our recently announced partnership with Oracle, we've significantly expanded our customers' ability to connect to the Oracle Cloud through private dedicated access to Oracle Cloud infrastructure in 14 major metro areas and 59 Digital Realty data centers through our Connected Campus and Service Exchange interconnection platform. Through our continued partnership with IBM and leveraging Direct Link capabilities, we have been able to provide customers and IBM business partners direct access to the IBM Cloud in 20 data centers across nine global metros. These capabilities have allowed us to deploy a standardized hybrid colocation set of solutions sold with a direct dual fiber connection to the IBM Cloud platform that provides extremely low latency and highly secure access to the IBM Cloud. As we've discussed on previous calls, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliances programs to create meaningful upside for our customers and our business over time through our referral, sell-to and sell-with partnership programs. We are pleased with the results to-date and we expect greater contributions in 2018. Our current partners and customers continue to see the value of our focus on working with quality solution and service providers to create a comprehensive IT solution offering and capabilities. In terms of integration, we made significant progress over the past several months and we are nearing the finish line in many respects. As of year-end, all former DFT employees have been on boarded onto the Digital Realty benefits platform and we have finalized the HRIS and payroll system conversions. At the property level, we completed the rebranding of all former DFT assets and we are wrapping up final security upgrades to bring all properties up to Digital Realty standards. We have completed alignment of onsite assets and equipment and we are finalizing the migration of the legacy DFT computerized maintenance management system onto our new platform. The systems integration is progressing well and the migration of accounting, finance and HR-related applications have all been completed. We expect to finish the network integration in the second quarter of 2018. The marketing team completed the rebranding of all customer-facing collateral and transitioned the DFT digital and social properties to DLR. All the acquired properties are now showcased on our website and we've added material to conform to our corporate standards. We remain on track to meet or exceed our $18 million expense synergy target and we still expect the vast majority of integration activities will be wrapped up by mid-year. Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stands at $116 million. The step up from $106 million last quarter reflects the $50 million of space and power leases signed, offset by $38 million of commencements and a $2 million delta due to the contribution of our recently completed development project in Osaka to the joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements was eight months reflecting large leases signed for space currently under construction and scheduled for delivery later this year. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9, we retained 76% of fourth quarter lease expirations and we signed $64 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over four years and cash rents on renewal leases rolled up 2.3% with positive cash re-leasing spreads across product types. We do still have a few above market leases across the portfolio most notably within the former Dupont Fabros properties. As a result, the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash for leasing spreads for the full year in 2018. On balance, however, we continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expiration. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 60 basis points sequentially to 90.2% due to development projects placed in service in Ashburn and Dallas along with a churn event in Phoenix, where an IT systems integrator lost their end user customer contract and let their lease with us lapse their expiration. We do expect portfolio occupancy to dip below 90% in the first quarter of 2018 likewise due to a combination of development projects placed in service in Ashburn, Toronto, Silicon Valley and London, along with a churn event in Boston, where an enterprise customer is consolidating their data center footprint. Similar to other opportunities within our portfolio, like the space we took back in Chicago a year ago, this space will be repositioned to expand our Boston colocation product offering. However, we also expect portfolio occupancy to rebound beginning in the second quarter, and to finish the year essentially flat at 90% and change. The U.S. dollar continued to soften during the fourth quarter and FX represented a slight tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our fourth quarter results. Interest rates on the other hand, begin to rise during the fourth quarter as shown on page 10. We target variable rate debt at less than 20% of total debt outstanding and we were at 14% as of year-end. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 1% impact to our 2018 FFO per share. In addition, although the 10-year benchmark may have backed up considerably over the past five months, our credit spreads have actually compressed meaningfully over the past two years as you can see depicted on the chart at the bottom of page 10. As a result, from an all-in cost of borrowing perspective, our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well-managed. Turning to earnings growth on page 11. Core FFO per share grew more than 8% compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year of 2017, core FFO per share grew a little over 7% and came in $0.04 above the high end of our initial guidance range. Aside from updating the low end of the range for asset sales close to-date in the first quarter, our 2018 guidance is essentially unchanged from the initial outlook we rolled out just over a month ago. In terms of the quarterly distribution, we expect the first half of 2018 should represent approximately 48% of the full year results, while the second half should contribute roughly 52%. In other words, the fourth quarter should represent a pretty good run rate for the first half of the year with a step-up in the second half. We don't typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but I would like to point out that recurring CapEx was up a little over $10 million sequentially during the fourth quarter. The biggest portion of the higher spend in the fourth quarter was one-time in nature related to value add activities at a non-core suburban office building in the Bay Area that was sold recently and this investment more than recouped. As a result, we now expect to deliver double digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board level decision. Given the low AFFO payout ratio along with the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Finally, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 12. Net debt to EBITDA improved from 6 times at the end of the third quarter to 5.2 times at year end and fixed charge coverage improved from just under 4 times in the third quarter to 4.2 times in the fourth quarter. As you may recall, leverage was somewhat overstated in the third quarter since all the debt related to the DuPont Fabros acquisition was on the balance sheet as of September 30, but the third quarter P&L included just a 17 day contribution from the DFT assets. We expect levers to gradually improve over the course of 2018 as the full run rate benefit of DFT synergies are realized, and our cash flows continue to grow as signed leases commence throughout the year. It's important to note that our cost and capital structure affords us the ability to self-fund over $1 billion of development spending in 2018, largely with cash flow from operations and an assist from the asset sales Bill mentioned earlier. As a result, we expect to maintain our target leverage and coverage levels throughout 2018 without the need for additional common equity. As you can see from the chart on page 12, the weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately six years, and the weighted average coupon is just under 3.5%. Over 85% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a potentially rising rate environment. And nearly 100% percent of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. A little over 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. We will continue to actively manage the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 12, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we would be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Certainly, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. My question, I wanted to harken back to the Investor Day commentary. Bill, you talked about the opportunity to take share on the leasing front going forward, recognizing that the market cap of DLR was larger in proportion relative to the leasing overall versus peers. And I just wonder a couple of months later if you could maybe take stock a little bit and talk about the measures you've implemented and what kind of progress you're making? And then maybe offer a little bit of context in terms of that progress around one of your large competitors, peers in the space coming into the hyperscale build business and one of the former CEOs announcing they're launching a new platform in the business? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Jordan. First of all, I assume you're referring to Tom Ray with your last point. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah, Tom Ray and Equinix. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Right. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Not too difficult. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We have the highest regard for Tom, we welcome him back to the space. He is what I would call an absolutely rational competitor. I think, he's been a responsible steward of investors' capital and a great allocator of capital. So he's the type of person that we like to see coming into this space. But back to Investor Day, the steps that we outlined at that time were the executive sponsor program, a number of investments in customer success, as well as a streamlining of our underwriting and contract approval \u2013 contract negotiation process. And I can tell you that during the fourth quarter, two-thirds of our fourth quarter wins involved an executive sponsor. So, I think that part of the program is working quite well. On the commercial side, the legal and commercial teams have worked very hard to put standard forms in place with quite a few of our customers, most of the major customers, and that's made it much easier to execute business with us, with very minimal additional negotiation. In fact 90% of the fourth quarter scale business was done with this type of arrangement in place. So we're very encouraged by what I'd say are the early results, but we recognize that there's always room for improvement, but importantly, I think in terms of the benefits of doing business with Digital, clearly the global platform is quite important, anchored by irreplaceable gateways. We've got our comprehensive product offering from a single cabinet all the way up to hyperscale. And I think without \u2013 our investment grade balance sheet is without peer. And I think that's clearly very important in terms of minimizing counterparty risk for these firms that are signing up for long term with us to lease their mission critical facilities. So, I think this \u2013 once again this sets us up quite well for capturing what we think is going to be not only additional share, but a rising tide of demand in 2018. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then \u2013 it's helpful. And then as a follow-up maybe for Scott, I'd just be interested in his thoughts on the capital that seems to be cramming its way into this space. Your balance sheet is good for sure, but is there an opportunity beyond these non-core assets that you've sold to opportunistically monetize some of your stabilized assets, just seeing the multiples being paid in the high-20 times EBITDA or what have you for certain assets. Is there an opportunity here for Digital? Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, Jordan, that's an interesting question and I do agree with you, there's sort of awful lot of capital coming in market, and clearly we're seeing some pretty big valuations out there. We're going to take a deep dive in our portfolio a little later this year and we're going to look at non-core assets, non-core markets, underperforming assets, assets which may become at risk for underperforming. But I think your point is good, and part of that would be looking at assets where essentially we've created all the value we can create and would it make more sense to redeploy that capital somewhere else in our portfolio. And as you know we've done that before with a joint venture that we put together with Pru several years ago. So, I think, it would be reasonable for us to bear that in mind as we review the portfolio later this year. Operator : The next question will be from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. So following a bit on Scott's comment about valuations, I mean, the Infomart deal announced yesterday points to a pretty attractive cap rate, and I just wonder to what extent do you see that as being transferable to your Internet gateway assets? And anything you're seeing out there in terms of the valuations around regular turnkey product to be kind of interested in your perspective? Thanks. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. We think it's entirely applicable to the \u2013 to our Internet gateways. It's a \u2013 Infomart is a great asset, highly strategic, little more so for Equinix I think than others. And I think they are in a good position to add value there, but you're right, I mean, we can all kind of sort out what that multiple is there, and if you look at those multiples and apply that to our Internet gateways, I think, you're getting out some rather full valuations on that. As it relates to other assets out there, we've seen a compression in cap rates. I mean, clearly the Infomart multiple relates to these kind of highly strategic Internet gateways, but we've seen cap rates in general come down and compress. There used to be a lot more differentiation across product types and \u2013 of assets and they're getting a lot closer. I think that bandwidth is maybe 100 basis points or 150 basis points wide, where it used to be more like 300 basis points wide for kind of the more traditional assets. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's very helpful. And then with your major global peer kind of going hyper-scale, getting more into kind of wide area connectivity, I just sort of wanted to maybe get an update on the flip side in terms of your retail initiatives, Megaport partnership and anything else that is kind of worth highlighting that maybe Andy and Bill didn't capture in the scripts? Thanks. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan. We're absolutely committed to the retail colo business. In the fourth quarter we had 51 new logos, fully 90% of those came through colocation, half from network and half from enterprise. And since we acquired Telx, we've doubled our megawatt capacity, committed to the colo product, we're up to 92 megawatts and that's both organically and through acquisitions. We plan to launch our colo business in Asia-Pac later this year. But I will say that we're definitely seeing a convergence of strategies and we can see that with the Equinix announcement today with customers and competitors recognize the value of interconnected scale, our offering of the full menu of options from a single rack to multiple megawatts along with the ability to connect directly, privately and securely from the enterprise customers' private cloud instance to a public cloud compute engine in order for there to be relevance to their hybrid cloud architecture. So, we think the colocation product is a very important element of our comprehensive product offering. And we're going to continue to invest in this business to support our customers' needs. Operator : The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Thank you. Two if I may. You did $199 million in annualized revenue in bookings or leasing in 2017 with two strong quarters in the last two quarters. Based on what you're seeing, well, I appreciate that bookings could jump quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter, I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the momentum that you're seeing and what your expectations are for 2018? Do you think you could be above the $199 million in 2018? And then secondly, CapEx when you gave your guidance earlier this year for the $900 million to $1.1 billion, that was meaningfully below what we were anticipating, that was already \u2013 and we had already been modelling something less than what if you just simply added DFT and DLR together. Can you just talk about your confidence that this is the right number of CapEx and the risk that we could find yourself in a year from now that you're undersupplied with inventory? Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Colby. This is Andy, I'll try to take the \u2013 start the first half of the first one, maybe add \u2013 Dan, chime in as well. So kind of just speaking to our most recent fourth quarter, overall we thought this is great results in terms overall robustness in volume, in terms of diversity by customer, geography and product line. We had numerous customers expanding with us as you heard in the script, we had numerous customer signed in multiple geographic regions. Are \u2013 the biggest signing was into the legacy DFT portfolio, for all we made up about 25% of all the signings, so 75% of the signings were in legacy Digital portfolio, and as Bill just mentioned a second ago, 51 new logos which was a new record for us, so all in all great. I would say the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter seemed to be continuing into the beginning of the year, and I \u2013 we are certainly shooting for higher than $200 million of signings in 2018, albeit we're not providing any specific guidance on that line item. But I'll ask Dan if he has any other color on fourth quarter or our pipeline? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks Colby. Thanks Andy. So the fourth quarter and our positive feelings about the first quarter this time I don't think are any coincidence given the restructuring that we went through last year from a go-to-market perspective. We have a lot of things that play into our success, teams outside of the sales organization for sure. But in the second and third quarter, we went through a major restructuring, Colby, as you know and that all started to settle in, in the third quarter and we believe it started to pay some dividends for us in the fourth quarter. It's early in the first quarter. We are six weeks in; we feel positive about what we've done so far even with a very busy January with PTC and the sales kick off. And the pipeline that we see going into I'll say the rest of this quarter and into the second and maybe early into the third makes us feel positive and makes us feel very good. Of course, as I always like to say we have to execute against that pipeline, but we do feel like we're in a very good position. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Colby back to your second question on capital. So when you do a deal with a company like DFT, I think, there are going to naturally be some capital synergies. You're not going to expand at the same sort of planned rate in certain \u2013 in identical markets, where if you had remained independent. So I think there is clearly some shrinkage of capital deployment from that standpoint. But when I look at our inventory, I think, it's \u2013 I think, we're in pretty good shape to be quite candid with you. And, frankly if we see additional demand in any of these markets, we'll add more capital. We'll tune it up. So we're pretty flexible in that area. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And just to round out your question on the CapEx, which was part 2. So, our midpoint of our guidance is about $1 billion, about $1.1 billion on the high end. I would say we as a team have certainly learned the lesson over the last handful of years of making sure inventory coming online and to make sure we have that fine balance especially in our core active development market. So our active pipeline has about 123 megawatts under construction, half of it leased, the other half available. And many of these markets be it like in Ashburn, we've delivered large shells and have had active signings into filling up our legacy campuses and into the latest buildings on our new campuses. So trying to obviously not overextend ourselves and put our balance sheet at risk, but not put us in a position where we're missing a good opportunity for one of our customers due to timing of inventory. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. A couple questions. First, you mentioned the idea of revisiting some of the portfolio for non-core assets. Is this the time \u2013 given where some of the strategic transactions have taken place on multiples and cap rates, is this the time to consider a more aggressive exploration of monetizing the power based buildings that would be very valuable to some of the tenants that sit inside of that. And then secondly, just curious as you talk about the competitive environment, if you could unpack maybe how the environment for pricing might be changing in 2018 versus 2017. And if you can put some context around the cash re-leasing spreads you saw in the fourth quarter on a cash basis relative to the guidance for slightly negative in 2018? Thanks. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Michael. It's Scott, I'll take the first half of that question, and I think that's an \u2013 it's an excellent question. I assume, you're saying on some of those PBBs perhaps, thinking about selling those to the customers that are in the building. Listen, I think everything is on the table. I will say the mitigating issues on that though typically are, what is the nature and design of the building and what market is it located in. Many of those still represent tremendous upside opportunity for us in the event, we were to get them back. Our basis is relatively low and they are extremely good investments for what they are, but in some cases, we could actually generate some pretty impressive returns if we got those back. So wouldn't want to forego future upside for the sake of a good cap rate today, but we'll keep that all in mind as we evaluate these opportunities. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And Michael, on the pricing and re-leasing question, I think, there was kind of two parts packaged in there. I guess, 2017 versus 2018 overall pricing, I mean, while we are in a competitive market for sure, we are seeing a tremendous amount of demand. So that intersection is kind of keeping pricing relatively intact with some exceptions to the positive, and the tight ends of the market build out in Santa Clara, where supply is still limited. On the re-leasing spreads, I mean, we've been coming through this kind of a journey where we've been bringing our re-leasing spreads further into the positive territory. This quarter was a positive outlier, positive across the major product sets, our colocation re-leasing spreads ticked up to 3.5%. We are positive on the TKF. Now, we do still have, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some above market leases in certain parts of the portfolio. Those are largely related to leases that were \u2013 came to us via one of our \u2013 the major acquisition last year with DFT. The timing of when those renew and the rates that they renew at obviously would put \u2013 could put a negative into those stats in any given quarter. But by and large, we see it slightly negative for the full year together for the combined portfolio largely driven to those select above market leases. Operator : The next question will be from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Hey, everyone. Just want to ask a question about some of the initiatives, Bill, that you mentioned earlier, the executive sponsorship and some of the customer service initiatives that you talked about at the Investor Day. First, just curious from a spending perspective on the SG&A front, how much of the costs for some of those programs are already in the run rate and how much is on the com? And also just curious, I think, speed which you mentioned has been a criticism of the company in the past. Curious, if you have any stats on how long it takes to get leases done today versus maybe six months ago? And then just one other follow-up. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, I'll ask Andy to cover the SG&A question. On the second part, we actually looked at this in the fourth quarter and we've taken eight days out of the process for documentation in this last quarter on average. So we've shortened that I think pretty substantially, but I would tell you, there is a great deal of variety. I mean look, if you \u2013 we are doing business with a customer with whom we've done a lot of business before, we can ink a deal in just a couple days and it can be a very large deal, if it's a new customer then that obviously would \u2013 can take longer. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then on the spend and kind of investment in our customers, in our systems, in our teams, Vin, I think, you're probably harking back to a slide from our Investor Day in December really showing the power of the platform and our scale and being able to invest I think in the last year 100 basis points of revenue back into the business, and still maintain industry leading EBITDA and G&A margins. That spend was really illustrative. It's going to come in many forms, it's going to come in the G&A line, in terms of investment in our team, hiring the right sales personnel, or it's going to come in our systems. We launched a new accounting system for our colo platform in Europe this year. It's going to come in the capital side in terms of integrating our latest acquisition. It's going to come on the marketing side, but all in all that spend is going to be spent throughout 2018 and is fully baked into the numbers that we've put in our guidance table released at the beginning of the year, fully incorporated. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Vincent, it's Dan Papes, if I could just add a few comments to actually on top of Bill's. Our executive sponsorship program relating back to the SG&A question cost us a little bit airfare other than that having our leadership team out in the field, talking to our customer, executives, understanding their needs, responding to unique requirements that they may have, has paid great dividends at very little expense to the company and has also informed us as a leadership team to be more effective in some of the strategic decisions we make. So that's made a big difference. Another is again, it didn't take any G&A for us to take a look at our processes and our approval processes and how we how we work bids through our system, and shorten those timeframes meaningfully in order to be able to accommodate our customers and eliminate this stigma that you mentioned of us being slow. We get \u2013 in the last six months we've gotten just really, really positive feedback from our customers, from brokers, from partners about the fact that people are seeing us to be faster on our feet, more flexible and working together with our customers in a customer centric way that's making a difference. All of those things translate into less tangible, but certainly very meaningful benefits to us as a company, I think that the business results have been and will continue to be positively influenced by that. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks a lot for that. That's very helpful. I just \u2013 my second question is just, trends seem to be moving in the right direction, leasing volumes have been pretty healthy here over the last couple quarters. Industry commentary also seems to be pretty favorable from a demand perspective. The one metric that seems to be a little bit at odds with this is the same-store NOI growth which seems \u2013 has been softening a little bit, still positive, but curious if you could provide any color on, on what's driving that trend? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Vin, I think, we're going to give you an exception for the third question here. So \u2013 and I'll do the honor. So same-store NOI growth little softer this year in our guide and our guidance relative to 2017, and also we've put up in the fourth quarter and really has to do with some episodic churn and the re-leasing of that capacity. Obviously, as you see from our stats, we typically retain 75% to 80% of our customer's expirations, even higher than that sometimes on the colocation, but we don't retain 100%. Two specific churn events that are impacting the same-store pool; one in Phoenix where a systems integrator lost its end customer, and let its lease lapse at expiration that happened at the very end of the year, another one that's expected to happen in the very beginning of 2018 is in Boston. Now, again these are down \u2013 essentially downtime for \u2013 associated with re-leasing of that space that is putting a negative headwind to the year-over-year same-store growth. Not all just glass half-full, because in Phoenix, that's a market where we've been essentially full in terms of capacity, so this brings on some attractive inventory, it's a space where actually we should be able to densify it and bring incremental power, so we're able to generate potentially higher revenue from that footprint. So there is an upside, but there will be a downside, in terms of, in your cash for that asset. And then in Boston, this \u2013 that was a scale customer that is churning out, and that gives us \u2013 gave us an opportunity to re-productize a portion of that space as colocation, and we launched that along with Service Exchange in the Boston market. That goes very well with our recently hired sales team members to form the Boston market coming online at the end of last year. So, we think that same-store pool should accelerate coming out of 2018. Operator : The next question will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Looking at the joint venture with Mitsubishi, can you give us some color on their data centers that are contributing and how utilized they are and how we should think about that? And then I guess a question for Dan around the sales force. Have you completed the reorg with sort of all the moving parts there and where are you finding the sales people here, are you seeing with demand high for the industry you're having trouble with churn or how should we think about that? Thanks. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Frank, Scott here. I'm looking for the exact numbers. They are largely utilized, I think, they're north of 80% utilized in there; and I can get you the \u2013 I'll get back to you with the exact number on that. But there is some upside potential there with the additional leasing. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Frank, to your second question about the sales force. So, yes, the restructuring of our sales forces is completed. Always will be some small adjustments here and there, but we really completed the major part of the restructuring in the second quarter last year, and then it was a matter of it settling in which happened in the third quarter for the most part, and then the fourth quarter was us operating in the new business model, which to me will \u2013 that new business model would just get better and better for us as we go forward. As far as churn goes, there is no question. It is a very competitive market for talent, especially in the colocation space, but we are \u2013 we're finding people, we're not finding them quite at the pace that we'd like, but we have most of our head count slots full now, which is great. And the places that we're getting them, we're getting them at our competitors. We're getting them from our competitors with our \u2013 I'll call it sort of our new story about the way we're trying to operate in the market with customer centricity, we're getting them with our \u2013 basically our very strong business results. They want to come work in a company that's stable, established, doing well and has a growth plan. I'll also say that they \u2013 there are a couple of companies that have exited this \u2013 the colocation and connectivity business or sold their businesses, or have been acquired. And those salespeople, the top salespeople in those organizations they don't want that instability. They want the stability of being in a firm like ours. And so when we have conversations with them, when we tell them our story, it's been positive for us from a recruiting perspective. Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. And hey, Frank, the \u2013 just give you the breakdown. The north building in Mitaka was 73% occupied and the south building is 86% occupied, and then blended together it's 78% occupied. Operator : The next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on the colo business, the \u2013 with the scale business we could see volatility, but it seems like there's been more focus on the colo business, more capacity dedicated to it. Is this level of signings to the $9 million range and then maybe higher kind of the new level we should be looking for, and what's driving it? Is it the focus or is it the supply or kind of everything kind of coming together on that aspect of the business? And then a quick follow-up on maintenance recurring CapEx that was up a little bit, wanted to get a little more detail on how should we think about that going forward? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I'll take the first. Andy will address the second. The colo business, not sure exactly how you phrased that, Richard, but we're \u2013 we want to grow that colocation business, back to Jordan's question about growth from Investor Day. We're trying to grow meaningfully in our scale business and we're trying to grow meaningfully in our colocation business. A lot of the transformation we went through last year was in that colocation go to market space, and we \u2013 it is our strong intent to continue to grow our colocation business, it may be just a little bit lumpy, less lumpy of course than the scale business, but we intend to make that go up into the right with our team. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Just around that, I'll hit on the CapEx. I think, it's \u2013 if you look at the progression through the year, you should look at kind of the colocation and connectivity lines of almost kind of hand-in-hand because the bulk of that connectivity are from those colocation customers. The trajectory of the year during the changes in the sales team, we were a little bit softer in the first two quarters in our new logo adds. That's stepped up in the third quarter from 30 to 36, and then stepped up to a record of 51 in the fourth quarter, including a record in Europe in particular of 13 new logos, all colo oriented. And then that ties to the mix of space and power which flows to the colocation size and the connectivity. A lot of those new logos are coming to Digital for the first time, coming to our ecosystems within our gateways, or our campuses, taking our digital cage cabinets and power requirements and base requirements from connectivity. And then we think that'll spur incremental connectivity from other customers in those assets want \u2013 seeking to connect to them. So we're quite pleased with the overall combined results, which is about a, I think, 14% step up on for colo and connectivity combined quarter-over-quarter and we're looking to continue to drive that growth. And then lastly, on your other question, about a $10 million increase quarter-over-quarter to recurring CapEx, the bulk of that was actually related to something not core to our business. We spent some capital on the tenant improvement front to re-tenant a office building in California, in the East Bay asset that was not a data center that dates back to our pre-IPO days. And we re-tenanted that asset and just sold that beginning of the year for \u2013 I believe north of $70 million, $75 million. So part of our capital recycling program. So that non-core spend was a major driver in that quarter-over-quarter CapEx \u2013 recurring CapEx step up. Operator : The next question will be from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC : Great, thanks. In your prepared remarks, Bill, you talked about the tax reform and the benefits from companies bringing tax \u2013 bringing their cash overseas and investing more in the U.S. Apple is somebody who's talked a lot about that. Just kind of curious if you could expand more on what the opportunity is there, and if you're actually seeing an increase in RFPs out there in the market from these type of customers as a result of tax reform? And then somewhat related it seems like every year we're hearing more and more about sustainability. You guys have been certainly talking about it more. I'm curious if you could \u2013 I don't know if you have any numbers to quantify around this, but to the extent that you have customers that are able to build their own facilities, what can you offer in terms of facilities you build that are sustainable, comparable to what a lot of these large guys can build on their own? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So, on tax reform, I would tell you that the pipeline of opportunities that we're seeing right now is bigger than anything I've seen since I started with the company in 2004. Now whether that's attributable to tax reform, I don't know. It may be due to just cloud and other technological trends, but it's definitely larger by a fair degree than anything I've seen before. So in terms of the sustainability initiatives, we've been pursuing that for the last few years. We've won a number of awards for it, we've been recognized for it by NAREIT as the \u2013 it's called the Leader in the Light award within the data center group, and so we're very proud of that. And we've actually partnered with some of our customers trying to let them leverage our contracts and our connections in this area in sustainable power, so \u2013 and we've actually some of the RFPs we've responded to have green energy as a prerequisite to bidding. So it's very important to us and it's important to I would say a high percentage of the customers with whom we work. Andy or Dan, anything you'd like to add? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yes. I would add, Jon, on the sustainability point that Bill made. We \u2013 our customers talk about it, talk about that with us all the time. And it's one of those situations where we can make it work for our customers. And it ends up just being a good thing because sustainability, we all would agree is a good thing in principle. It also happens to be very good business and our customers are urging us to focus on this. We're doing so and that works really well between them and us. Operator : The next question will be from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, two if I may. First, I believe commencements were $38 million in the quarter and according to the last waterfall chart, I think, it implied $48 million. So, commencements were a little lower, and I was wondering if that was just \u2013 if that was customer driven or availability driven? And secondly, I appreciate all the really positive commentary about the scale of the pipeline. And I was wondering if you know given the secular strength and the progress you've made with the sales organization and flexibility, if you could \u2013 there is a way to quantify that difference, maybe from a year-over-year perspective? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Rob, this is Andy. I'm just trying to find the prior quarter commencements. I \u2013 the bridge, I know, is we added $50 million, we took out $38 million, and we lost $2 million because of the JV. So, maybe we can follow-up just to figure out the details, there is a nuance quarter-over-quarter. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Sure. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then the second question was quantify the difference year mix in terms of all the changes. Dan, do you want to take a stab at that? Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Robert, so this is sort of this early on in these changes, I wouldn't dare to quantify it, the impact at this point. I do know we've won some deals that I suspect we might not have won, had we been the company of 18 or 24 months ago. I know that we're having discussions with some customers who previously wouldn't put us on the bidders list or call us when they had a requirement. So there's no question in our mind that the changes in the way we're doing things is having a positive impact. I am sorry. I'd love to put a number on it, but we know it's making a difference and it's my hope and expectation that that's going to be one of the factors that's going to show in the growth results that we're going to deliver here as a company over time. Operator : The next question will be from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Just a clarification on the $6 million contribution from interconnection booking that was highlighted in the press release. I was hoping you could tell us more about this, was this from handful of customers or was this from a single \u2013 or the majority from a single customer, for instance a global car provider that is trying to aggressively expand globally right now? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Sami, our interconnection signings is incredibly diverse. I can tell you the largest single contributor is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, I mean, it's any given signing. So that was not one big cross connection \u2013 cross connect signing, it was a \u2013 it's from numerous carriers, it's from numerous cloud providers, enterprises assortment. Now, it's largely concentrated, one in our colocation facilities both in North American and Europe. Two, in our most highly connected ecosystems within our Internet gateways and then supplemented with connectivity on our campus colocation outfits, but it is a very diverse mix of signings. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you. And then recently Digital announced Oracle will be expanding in 14 new locations. And then at their cloud event earlier this week, they announced global plans. Will they be building their own data centers in some of these new markets, or are they \u2013 or is the announcement in coordination with Digital as they go global and expand and kind of put a little bit of catch up with the bigger cloud providers? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sami, I'm going to have Chris Sharper, our CTO tackle that one, because he is heavily involved with that announcement. Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Absolutely. Thank you, Andy. Definitely, Oracle is growing rather rapidly, and so we're very proud of the partnership we've been able to put in the market with them, and it's definitely an early innings, I would say, on the amount of ecosystems that are going to be built around that infrastructure. So we're very excited about that. But definitely the growth that they're starting to put out into the market, I think, they'll look at all of their options. And what's nice about Digital is, we have the heritage to do it from build-to-suit where we can support them in that manner. But all the way across the board to helping them in our existing facilities globally, and so that's why we see a lot of early success in this already, and we continue to see a growth pattern, not only for Oracle, but all these major cloud providers as they start to really invest in that global platform to access their customers privately and securely in a very efficient manner. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And just to clarify, I think, the second part of your question, Sami. The \u2013 not to name any specific customers, but I would say by and large, the majority of our customers are seeking us to pursue an outsourced third party multi-customer data center environment, not to go do it on their own. Even the most well large capitalized, I think that's due to our value proposition of having a global footprint of highly connected assets, the campuses and the land to future proof our customers growth. And I would think that based on the fact we've seen that name you just mentioned quickly ascend our top customers' list that they are no different. Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing comments. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we demonstrated our commitment to prudent capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders. We harvested mature assets to recycle capital where appropriate. We invested opportunistically in core domestic markets to earn acceptable current return with an opportunity to generate future upside from further value creation. And we extended our global platform to enter a highly strategic new international market with a well-respected local partner. Two, we made significant progress towards finalizing the integration of our recent acquisitions, delivering on our stated expense synergy targets and building on the established customer relationships to realize revenue synergies as well. Three, we beat the high end of our initial 2017 guidance range and set the stage for sustainable growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends per share in 2018 and beyond. Fourth, last but not least, our disciplined capital allocation and deliberate balance sheet management has positioned us to safely navigate a rising interest rate environment and self-fund our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying a thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us, and we hope to see many of you later this year at the various investor conferences. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for participating in today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Due to scheduling constraints, this call will be a concluded after 60 minutes. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and SVP of Sales & Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. The management may make forward -looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions.

Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First of all, we set a new high watermark with quarterly bookings north of $60 million. Second, we beat consensus by nearly 4%, driven by consistent operational out performance and we've raised guidance by $0.05 at the low end. Third to beat in race, flows through to cash flow and we remain on track to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. Last but not least, we expect to achieve this growth while maintaining our target leverage and self-funding our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With our Annual Shareholders Meeting coming up in a little less than two weeks, I'd like to begin today with a discussion on governance, here on page 2 of our presentation. At our Investor Day in December, we shared with you our plan for providing shareholders the ability to amend our bylaws. I'm pleased to report that in early March, our board approved a resolution giving any 3% shareholder or any group of up to 10 shareholders comprising a 3% stake for three years the right to propose binding amendments to the company's bylaws. We believe that with this step, we are joining a small group of other high-quality REITs and leading the industry with sound corporate governance practices. In keeping with our commitment to ongoing board refreshment, we also disclosed in our proxy that longtime Director, Bob Zerbst will not be standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting. In addition to his role on the board, Bob served as Chairman of the Compensation Committee from 2012 to 2017, and as a board representative on our internal investment committee for the past four years. He was also Chairman of the Investment Committee at CBRE Investors, when the initial investment in GI Partners, our private equity predecessor was first approved. On behalf of the entire board, I'd like to extend our thanks to Bob for his years of service to the company. The governance principle behind our board refreshment philosophy is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. Following Bob's departure, 8 of our 10 directors who have joined the board within the past six years, whereas our Chairman and former Chairman have both served on the board since our IPO. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a de-staggered board, the majority of our directors' compensation is paid in stock, each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company, the board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements and finally since 2014, the substantial majority of management's long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder return. We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Moving on to investment activity. We have already closed on the sale of seven non-core assets year-to-date, generating proceeds of approximately $185 million and realizing gains of a little over $50 million. As Andy will address in his prepared remarks this consistent execution on our capital recycling program has prompted us to raise the high-end of our range for dispositions guidance by an additional $100 million further bolstering our ability to self-fund our 2018 capital plan. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 3. In North America data center construction crews remain active across the primary data center metros particularly in Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active metro in the world. It is also Digital Realty's largest concentration and we are blessed to have 345 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity on our two existing campuses in addition to 180 acres of strategic land holdings that will support the build-out of another 290 megawatts of future capacity. The market dynamic in Ashburn is highly competitive and customers have plenty of options to choose from both established players as well as new market entrants. By the same token however demand is both sufficiently robust and diverse to lift a lot of provider boats. New supply is coming online, but is being just as rapidly absorbed. On balance, the North American data center landscape is roughly at equilibrium as you might expect with a national vacancy rate at 10% on the dot. In Europe hyperscale users continue to dominate the data center league tables representing over 70% of first quarter leasing volume. We estimate that approximately 40 megawatts released across the region in the first quarter largely driven by hyperscale customers expanding in existing locations, London and Amsterdam were the standout metros this quarter followed by Frankfurt. Digital Realty did not have a particularly active first quarter in terms of signed deals, but we did restock the shelves and now have a full complement of inventory in each of the major metros in Europe. We are also off to a strong start in the second quarter having landed a 4 megawatt deployment in Amsterdam in April, our first global deployment with a top legacy DuPont Fabros customer. We expect to see further momentum in Europe over the next several quarters. In terms of current buying behavior, customers are looking for long-term commitment tied to flexibility and the ability to land and expand within the same location, which lines up perfectly with our Connected Campus strategy. Across the Asia-Pac region demand remains very healthy and is even showing early signs of further acceleration driven by hyperscale users both within the region, as well as Western destinations. While supply has remained largely in check, several sizeable requirements are prompting potential new entrants to explore new markets. The marketplace remains highly fragmented, which creates barriers to entry especially new geographies for unproven teams. That said, healthy demand dynamic is not yet translating to rental rate growth given the prospect of potential new supply coming to market. Net-net we believe our customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection product offering as a key differentiator in their selection of data center provider of choice. Let's turn to the intersection of supply and demand on page 4. Much ado has been made of the pricing and profitability on the recent spate of hyperscale activity and I'd like to take a moment to share our philosophy on pricing and returns. First and foremost, I would like to remind you that we've always targeted superior risk adjusted returns. Along the X-axis here on page 4, we've outlined the primary risk attributes we underwrite our new-builds. It stands to reason that we would be willing to accept a somewhat lower return on a project that is fully pre-leased to a high credit tenant on a long-term lease as opposed to a speculative new-build. In addition, it should be intuitive that we're able to achieve the lowest unit cost by building at scale or hyperscale, as the case may be. Finally, evolving customer preferences for higher power density and lower redundancy have enabled us to drive down build costs, shrinking the denominator in the return equation. As a result, we are still able to achieve risk adjusted returns that we consider quite acceptable on hyperscale builds. The returns on our current pipeline represent a respectable spread above our cost of capital and also represent a very meaningful spread above current cap rates. Unrealized development profit margins are somewhat theoretical, since we have no intention of flipping our core holdings, but we are confident that the returns we are able to achieve on our development pipeline are creating significant value for shareholders. Let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. The global economic backdrop remains quite supportive and the long-term secular trends driving data center demand seem to be gaining momentum. The Cisco Global Cloud Index forecast that the number of hyperscale data centers will nearly double by 2021. Hyperscale data centers will account for more than half of all installed data center servers by 2021 and traffic within hyperscale data centers will quadruple by 2021. Digital Realty has the heritage and design expertise to officially meet this demand. Cisco also projects that 69% of the compute and 65% of the data will be housed in hyperscale facilities, which will become the foundation for the evolution of future ecosystems. Software-as-a-Service is expected to be the most popular cloud service model over the next five years and Digital Realty's Service Exchange facilitates secure, private access to critical SaaS applications. We continue to see a healthy and growing partnership with our large multinational clients resulting in tailored data center solutions for the world's largest and most demanding customers. It is these custom solutions that continue to position Digital Realty and the Connected Campus as the standard for global growth. Multi-region deployments are growing across all sales verticals, signaling a platform effect from our largest cloud, network and enterprise buyers and further validating the Connected Campus, our full product offering and our role as an international supplier of choice for their critical infrastructure. Earlier this week, we launched support for Google Cloud's Partner Interconnect, a new service from Google Cloud that allows customers to connect to Google Cloud Platform from anywhere. Partner Interconnect provides customers with the ability to extend private on-premises networks from Digital Realty data centers to the Google Cloud Platform, reaching a broad set of public and private cloud-based service offerings. The new offering will enable our service exchange customers to reach Google Cloud Platform services in nine global metros with additional markets to be brought online later this year. The Google announcement was just one highlight of a great start to the year and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward. We believe we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand setup and deliver sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, given our global platform, our comprehensive suite of power and connectivity solutions, along with our operational and financial stability. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity, here on page 7. We signed total bookings for the first quarter of $61 million, including a $7 million contribution from interconnection. This marks the fourth quarter out of the past five we've delivered bookings north of $50 million. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $54 million during the first quarter, including a $6 million colocation contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the first quarter was approximately eight years. We saw robust and balanced performance of lease signs across every month in the first quarter. We are seeing strong demand from current as well as new customers and we signed 32 new logos during the quarter. Demand across cloud customers remains strong, with many of the leading global cloud service providers expanding with us. A leading Chinese cloud and technology service provider expanded with us in Ashburn just a couple of quarters after first landing with us in that market. We are pleased with our progress in the enterprise segment, landing broad and diverse customer engagements. For example, one of the world's largest media entertainment technology and content companies needed immediate access to enterprise quality data center capacity in the red-hot Northern Virginia market to support a new complex cloud-connected application. The customer cited three reasons for selecting Digital Realty; our track record of operational and financial resiliency; the quality of our product and speed of delivery, capacity when and where they needed us; and ease of contracting. And National Cancer Research Institution selected Digital Realty based on our proven track record of operational excellence as well as our interconnection solutions. Their critical business applications will be migrating from another provider and will reside within our secure campus environment in Phoenix. A leading edge personal finance company that is focused on helping everyone make financial progress has selected Digital Realty to consolidate their back-end systems and storage into higher density racks to help future proof their rapid growth. One of the world's oldest stock exchanges acquired a company in the U.S., and as a result of this acquisition required data center expansion. Digital Realty was awarded one of two North America data center deployments. MOBITV delivers live and on-demand video to any screen connecting media reliably and securely anytime anywhere on any device. The customers connected media solutions solve the complexity of delivering video across networks, operating systems and devices while managing associated rights. MOBITV chose our 250 William Street location in Atlanta to utilize the extremely highly connected 56 Marietta ecosystem as an activation point for their TV channel content to directly connect to end users. We see continued strength in our network segment. Our first quarter network wins indicate continued strong demand for scale infrastructure in the infrastructure-as-a-service subsector in addition to multi-site colocation and interconnection demand in the content delivery network, Internet service provider, and global carrier subsectors, including a major backbone expansion with one of the largest telecommunication providers in the U.S. Our strategic alliances and channel referral partner programs continue to help us drive growth and provide a source of new customers. We are gaining traction with partners who want to include our capabilities into the solutions they offer their customers. For example, partnering with Insight one of our alliance partners, helped a customer migrate from a dated architecture as part of an overall technology refresh. We were a perfect fit to offer our colocation interconnection solutions paired with Insight's IT product and service capabilities. So the customer got one comprehensive solution. With IBM, one of our first strategic alliances, we have been able to embed our capabilities across their direct win products to allow their customers to connect directly to their cloud infrastructure and cloud services. Through this partnership, we drove solutions for our customers throughout our domestic campuses and internationally during the first quarter, strengthening our ecosystem, enhancing our ability to penetrate the enterprise vertical. As we've discussed on previous calls, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliance program to create meaningful upside for our customers and our business over time through our referral, sell-to and sell-with partnership programs. We are pleased with the results to-date and we expect continued growth in 2018. In terms of integration, our efforts related to the DuPont Fabros merger are winding down. A number of functional areas have completed their project plans and we've made solid progress towards achieving our synergy targets, but we remain focused on closing out all remaining tasks. The outstanding items are primarily related to operations and IT activities with some IT organizational alignment intentionally delayed so as to avoid disrupting the customer experience. We have successfully completed the migration of all accounting, finance and HR related applications and we will continue to work on the customer portal consolidation and network migration through year-end. We remain on track to meet or exceed our $18 million expense synergy target and we continue to expect the bulk of our integration activities will be wrapped up during the second quarter with loose ends completely tied up by the end of the year. Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $126 million. The weighted average lag between first quarter signings and commencements was six months reflecting largely signed for space currently under construction and scheduled for delivery later this year. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9, we signed $57 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over four years and cash rents on renewal leases rolled up 4% with positive cash re-leasing spreads across all product types. We do still have a few above market leases across the portfolio, most notably within the former DuPont Fabros properties. As a result, the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash releasing spreads for the full year in 2018. In terms of our first quarter operating performance, as we indicated last quarter, overall portfolio occupancy dipped 100 basis points sequentially to 89.2% due to a combination of development projects placed in service along with a churn event in Boston where an enterprise customer is consolidating their data center footprint. Similar to other opportunities within our portfolio, like the space we took back in Chicago a little over a year ago, a portion of this space will be repositioned to expand our Boston colocation product offering. We also expect portfolio occupancy to rebound beginning in the second quarter, and to finish the year essentially flat at 90% and change. Turning to our economic risk mitigation on page 10. The U.S. dollar continued to soften during the first quarter and FX represented a slight tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our first quarter results. Interest rates on the other hand continue to rise during the first quarter as shown on the bottom of the page. By way of reminder, we target variable rate debt at less than 20% of total debt outstanding. And we were at 18% as of the end of the first quarter. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets, long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have just a 1% impact on our 2018 FFO per share. We believe our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well-managed. Turning to earnings growth on page 11. Core FFO per share was up 7% year-over-year and came in $0.06 above consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was primarily driven by operational outperformance and favorable FX. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising the low end of the range of our 2018 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Most of the drivers are unchanged except for a 100 basis point increase in the low end of the range for the same-store guidance and updated FX assumptions, partially offset by another $100 million of asset sales. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect to dip down slightly in the second and third quarters due to the timing of G&A investments and loss of NOI from recent asset sales as you can see from the bridge on page 12 before rebounding sharply in the fourth quarter as several large leases commence. We do not typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but I would like to point out that as John mentioned, the beat on the FFO line flows through to cash flow and we remain on track to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. The growth in cash flow has likewise flowed through to our distributions to shareholders and in early March, the board approved a 9% increase in the per share dividend. This marked the 13th straight year we have grown our dividend and we are pleased to be among a select group of REITs to have raised the dividend each and every year since our initial public offering in 2004. Finally, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. Net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 5.3 times at the end of the first quarter and fixed charge coverage ticked up slightly to 4.3 times. Our cost and capital structure affords us the ability to self-fund over $1 billion of development spending in 2018 largely with cash flow from operations and an assist from the asset sales, Bill mentioned earlier. As a result, we expect to maintain our target leverage and coverage levels throughout 2018 without the need for additional common equity as proceeds from asset sales are used to pay down debt, the full run rate benefit of DFT synergies are realized and our cash flows continue to grow as leases signed commenced throughout the year. As you can see from the chart on page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is approximately five years and the weighted average coupon is approximately 3.4%. Over 80% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and nearly, 100% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. A little over 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. We will continue to actively manage the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our asset. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to feel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session. Operator : My pleasure, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. First one just regarding the pace of leasing, I think this looks like one of the best quarters I can remember. And it comes on top of, as you pointed out, two pretty strong quarters, it happens to say lumpy but healthy on page 7. But this seems like leasing has gotten much more stable over the past few quarters. And so congrats on the execution, but I'm curious will we see increased volatility going forward and if so what is the bias, would it be upward volatility or downward? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, Jordan. You know we don't give bookings guidance and I sense from your question that you're trying to obtain bookings guidance. We're not going to change our policy. But as you might imagine, we're pleased with the trajectory over the past several quarters. You're correct, this is a record quarter. We've had great volume, also a very strong mix in products, logos and geographies. If you look back over the last 12 months, bookings have been trending up and that's how we obviously would like to keep it. We're confident in the growth of the business, long term growth of the business, so I would expect that quarterly volume will follow that as the current funnel is very healthy and we are confident that we can build on our recent momentum. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just moving on to the development pipeline which seems to be gaining some momentum as well, maybe you could speak to construction costs, you're quite a sizable developer in the scheme of things and construction costs appear to be rising as a function of increased demand, but also tariffs and skilled labor demands et cetera. How do you expect these rising construction costs to manifest themselves in the data center sector in your portfolio over the next couple of years, are rents going to come up a lot, because customers can bear the increases or will returns come down, what do you think? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Let me break that question apart. So first of all, I think that because of our designs, we've been doing an excellent job of taking costs out of the product, but I will say, I think it's going to be difficult to take much more cost out without affecting the residual value of the real estate. We have put in place something called our VMI program, which stands for vendor managed inventory. We have that in place for all of our major suppliers. And what that is, is a three-year contract where we've been able to lock in pricing for major items like generators, switchgear, UPS module. And importantly, we put that in place before the tariffs were put in place. So our pricing at least for the next three years won't be affected by rising steel prices. I think the other factor that's important for everyone to keep in mind on the call is that we're the only data center company with an investment-grade balance sheet. And I think it's not just the cost of our debt, but the way Andy has managed the balance sheet that gives us a distinct competitive advantage in not only a rising rate environment but, currently, an environment that has an inverted yield curve. So most of our debt is fixed and it's been termed out for quite a period of time. We've also been able to de-risk the labor inflation that I think we will certainly see by keeping our contractors very busy and on site. It's another one of the benefits of having a global sales funnel and buying in bulk. In terms of what's going to affect data center rents, we think that's most directly affected by supply. And if you think about the barriers to entry, it's a restriction in land, which we see certainly today in Silicon Valley and we think we're going to see it in Loudoun County in a few years. In some markets, you see a NIMBY sentiment, not in my backyard. We think that higher debt costs and build costs will also represent barriers to entry. So while I don't think that, with the exception of Silicon Valley, you're necessarily going to see rent growth in the very near term. I think that you'll definitely see it over the intermediate term. Operator : The next question will be from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. So, a question about kind of the demand that you're seeing going forward, the scale demand. And is that basically upsized requirements by traditional scale customers or are you seeing a broadening of the types of customers, either by vertical or by region, that are interested in doing most of megawatt deals? And then, following on to the last answer about the developments. The development pipeline, just given the volume and demand out there, do you feel that you're appropriately staffed or would you consider having a little bit more work-in-process to accommodate what seems to be kind of a rebound in demand back to sort of 2016 levels? Thanks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jeff, I'm going to take the first part of that question and I'll ask Andy to take the second part of it. The requirements \u2013 and I've said this on several calls, but the requirements have definitely grown larger over the last several years, but on top of that, and you mentioned in your question, the demand is also broader. It's more than just a handful of CSPs. And we're seeing it out of social media, we're seeing it out of global cloud, not just U.S.-based CSPs, we're seeing it out of the SaaS players and we're seeing it out of multinational hardware and software companies. Maybe going back to Jordan's question though on the level of bookings. We do need at least one, what I would say, major anchor transaction every quarter to hit $50 million. If we have more than one, there will definitely be upside. If we don't hit that one, there will be downside. But I would say based on the volume that we see in our pipe, I'm confident that we'll get one. But nevertheless, it's still a lumpy business and that you see that with the 4-megawatt deal that that we announced that we signed in Amsterdam this month. But I can tell you that on balance, we're very encouraged by both the breadth and the depth of demand and we're looking forward to what the balance of this year has in store for us. Andy, why don't you take the second question of Jonathan's? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So your question related to appropriately stocking the development pipeline. It's obviously a very fine line as that we've seen from our competitors and we've experienced first-hand here at Digital in the history of our company. I would say we have a very robust capital planning function with a regular cadence, and we're doing our best to line up the supply and demand as the best we can. I think we do have some competitive advantages on many fronts. When you have a large installed customer base that is looking to grow in those markets with a preference to grow in adjacency to their existing loads, I think that translates into incremental wins that it's harder for a new competitor or a smaller provider to really attack. If you look at our pipeline in total, it's almost 130 megs, north of 40% pre-leased. That's obviously book ended by some speculative development capacity and also fully pre-leased activity. If you just look at Northern Virginia, which is north of 60 megawatts and that's north of 60% pre-leased, I can tell you that remaining, call it, 23 megawatts, 24 megawatts that isn't preleased, we're almost playing Tetris with the customers in terms of lining their timelines to move in with our delivery schedules. So, we're definitely tiptoeing that fine line and I think we have the right balance for right now. Operator : The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. One, with the DuPont integration largely behind you, I was curious about your appetite for M&A, particularly with some news out there that there could be some assets that are out there for sale, including some in, I guess, Brazil. And then secondly, your \u2013 what is it \u2013 your retention ratio was 58%, I believe, in your disclosures. That's below where it's typically been. I was wondering if you could just provide some color as to what's behind and then what your expectations going forward would be. Thank you. Scott E. Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Colby. Scott here. I'll take the first part of that question. Yes, we continue to look for other M&A opportunities. As you know, we're looking at everything that's out there or even not out there on the market. As always, we're focused on opportunities that have some strategic value to us, but as always, we are going to be good stewards of our shareholder capital and be disciplined as we pursue those opportunities. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Colby, just add to that, though. When you look at where the share prices are today and the multiples, they're obviously down from where they were a quarter or two. And that on the margin may make M&A less likely. And I think you couple that with where some of the recent trades occurred, which were at fairly lofty valuations. And I think that might argue that there would be less M&A near-term. Andy, do you want to pick up the second part of that question? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. So I think you were pointing to the retention assuming just on the Scale TKF product, sub-60%. That was largely related to some churn. I think we'd called out a call a quarter or two ago in the Boston market an enterprise customer that was looking to consolidate some capacity. Now not all churn I would say is a bad thing. That provides an opportunity to take back space and re-productize that larger footprint into a colocation offering and expand our capabilities in the Boston market in particular. By and large, other than the episodic customer moving from here and there, we do have some positive churn events where customer is just outgrowing a traditional colocation environment and wants to grow with us on a campus. So a customer moving from one part of their portfolio to another can actually be a positive event. And on the colo side, the other major product domain, we actually had, maybe not record, but very high retention, low churn this quarter call it north of 90% retention on those capacity. Operator : The question will be from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks very much. So you talked about the healthy pipeline a few times. Are you seeing any benefit from tax reform in terms of IM enterprise spending on expansion? Any more confidence there or is that something that you think might feather in later in the year? And on the hyper-scale side of it, is there any change in the mix between what they're self-performing, doing themselves versus what they are using you or others for in terms of outsourcing to build? Thanks. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey Simon, it's Dan Papes, thanks for the question. From the pipeline perspective, you're right. As we've termed it here in our discussion today, it's very healthy. We're really pleased with it. We're pleased with the second quarter, and as we take a look at the remainder of the year. We really can't trace any of it directly back to tax reform. It may be a small factor in there, but there is nothing obvious about the demand we're seeing from enterprise or the CSPs related to tax reform. We like to think it's just a great job being done by our sales team, but no really there's just no trace back to that that we see. I'll let Andy take the second question. Thanks, Simon. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. In terms of do-it-yourself versus seeking a professional provider like the Digital Realty, I think by and large we've seen more of a trend from even very highly sophisticated, well-capitalized technology customers to come to a Digital especially in the major markets where we have full product offering in terms of space power and also on the connectivity side and where we have land holdings to allow for their business to grow for years to come. I can just look at the mix of our largest signings across the portfolio that we had several signs this quarter that were in the 2 megawatt to 3 megawatt size, several in the 4 megawatt to 6 megawatt. I think 6 megawatt was the highest, in total 6.5 megawatt. And it was from a smattering of customers, different customers, U.S. multinationals, top five cloud service providers, other large sophisticated enterprises that could have the ability to build their own data center and they've come to us for our capabilities in the global platform we deliver to them. Operator : The next question will be from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Couple things if I could. One is, if you go back to, I think it was slide 4 in the deck. You shaded the core-plus range of 9% to 12% for developing yield. And I'm curious how that fits into the current year guidance for developing yields of 10% to 12%? And what does this say about the future direction of the aggregate development yields for the Digital portfolio? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. This is Andy. I think the genesis of this chart was really to try to provide an illustrative view as to incremental risk takes on incremental reward and not an effort to change our guidance table, which we reiterated on the 10% to 12% for unlevered cash returns on our $1 billion of development spend. I think we obviously tilt towards the 10% when projects are de-risked. De-risk can happen from significant amount of pre-leasing or activity, and we tilt towards the higher end of that range when there's more risk in the equation. Operator : The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to clarify just a lot of questions on the bookings. But, Bill, you mentioned feeling comfortable hitting the $15 million range assuming you get at least one anchor tenant, it sounds like 6.5% was the biggest for this quarter. So I mean is that what you mean when you're referring to an anchor tenant, something in that 5 megawatt or 6 megawatt deal size? And then second question is more on the dispositions. I know they're non-core, so maybe not a great read through for the rest of the value of the portfolio. But just curious if you could give some commentary on the California data centers that were 100% leased that traded at pretty high cap rate? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I mean we take a look on that deal that you mentioned, the $6 million deal, keep in mind that there was shell associated with that which will likely lead to some additional improved data center space that will be leased over time. But, yes, that's fair. Andy, you want to handle the asset sale question? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Actually, Scott, do you want to hit the dispose? Scott E. Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah. I can nail that. Those assets were out in the, call it, the Sacramento market which is a non-core market, so not as robust a demand from the potential investors or buyers out there. Also one of those assets was a little challenged with some structural vacancy there which kind of led towards that higher yield on that. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And, Vin, I think in summary, it's a continuation of the capital recycling program that really under Bill in Scott's leadership started years back to kind of exit markets, exit non-core assets and redeploy that capital at better returns into the core portfolio. Operator : The next question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. So just curious on Europe, obviously the industry is seeing some strong growth there. Any thoughts on why not spending some capital and trying to be more aggressive in that market? How should we think about that going forward? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Frank. This is Andy. I can take that one. So I think we're doing a very good job at executing in Europe and timing is everything because the example we mentioned on the call, a very sizable customer landed in Amsterdam with us in our Scale campus. It was a legacy DFT relationship we were able to grow internationally and we thought it was going to land during the quarter and it popped over into the next month. And on the backs, I think though there's been a tremendous amount of activity in a few other markets outside of Amsterdam. In Frankfurt, where we've delivered our first campus offering 6 megawatts. We're moving well along in terms of landing an anchor customer with the top-five global service provider. And turning to London, I know the team is working on a, call it, a 600 kilowatt or so deal on the enterprise vertical as well as some demand coming out of our Asia Pacific sales team looking to land in the London market. So the timing of our inventory coming online seem to be quite fortuitous in terms of an increase in demand backdrop. And we think we have the right capacity, and if this continues, like we've seen in the very end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, I think that would point to continue to put investment into Europe. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, I just wanted to follow-up on the SG&A line. It really dropped dramatically quarter-to-quarter. How much is this just seasonal? Is this the new base level? And is it going to rebound through the year or is there something else going on there? And then I have one follow-up? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Richard. Thanks for that question. The answer to your question is yes and yes. It did step down partly due to seasonal in terms of bonus accruals. As we know our numbers and performance close to the end of the year. That number will ratchet up a little bit in the third and fourth quarters, and you can kind of look at that similar trend in past third and fourth quarters. We also were carrying in the G&A some head count and some non-comp expense associated with our DFT acquisition that has been winding down on both of those fronts. And we do think, it will step back up, as some of our G&A investments, be it our IT systems, our investment in the sales and marketing department, sales engineering and our overall IT department, as we work on finalizing our integrations and invest the team, similar to the comments we made at our Investor Day in the beginning of December, really to spend not massive dollars but amount in the budget to fuel growth in the business. So I do think they'll pick up in the back half of the year. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then looking at the supplemental, it seems like on the lease expiration things were pushed out. It might be a subtle difference, but just wanted to be able to ask about it. Have you been working to kind of extend out customers and it maybe is not something that you can just point out on a big level, but it seems like a lot of the 2018 and 2019 expirations have been pushed out. Is there something there that we should be aware of? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I would say we're always looking to push out customer contracts and having customers contracting with us for longer terms at fair and rising rates. So we did about $57 million of renewals. I don't think that was a record renewal quantity for us. The weighted average renewal term on the TKF which is the larger dollar longer term stuff, let's call it five years. And, no, we obviously keep chopping through our renewals every year. I think we're taking a very much a holistic approach with our global customer base and using those installed, embedded relationships and contracts to come to mutually beneficial outcomes and package more business together and use that installed customer base as a competitive advantage that helps our customers more than some of our competitors can. Operator : The next question will be from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : Thanks. Hey, guys. I noticed the base building construction pipeline increased by a fair amount this quarter. Can you provide some color on that? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: My gut, Lukas, is \u2013 that's on the developments-type pipeline that's really largely driven by some of the activity in Northern Virginia. And like I said, we've got, call it 23 megawatts that are as of the quarter were unleased and we're working fast and furiously and bringing on incremental shelves because we'll be quickly through building out on that campus, at least the first phase of it. We also \u2013 something I should mention. We also had in the prior quarter there was a shell that was not there that we brought online because the customer signed a lease for the entirety of a shell like in 36 megawatts, including initial take of 6 megawatts within it as well on a long-term basis. So that kind of speaks to the activity in that market, in particular that customers are in large amounts moving to fully contracts when we're literally looking at dirt and explain design very quickly. Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC : That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. The straight line rent line item, looks like it's up a little bit over the last couple of quarters. And is that just driven by free rent on recent lease signings or what's kind of driving that line item? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I think there was something in the prior quarter that deflated that adjustment. It was episodic maybe on the leasehold side. I would say with signing more longer-term deals with escalators is going to certainly continue to widen that gap between your GAAP rent and your cash rent. So that would probably be another attributor to the widening of that number. But relatively I would say fairly small adjustment because I would say that the delta between our FFO and AFFO is relatively narrow speaking to the quality of our earnings. Operator : The next question will be from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, we haven't seen much power-based building for quite a while, and it turned up again this quarter. I was wondering, especially based on the comment you made, I think, answering the last question, does this indicate anything about the customer view? Why is this suddenly coming back into the picture? Is it a positive read on demand? And similarly, in Asia Pacific, you had significant Turn-Key leasing. I was wondering if you could provide some greater color on location and the context for that. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Rob. Thanks for the question. So, I do think the data point you pointed out does point to a trend we're seeing in the business as these large either top five cloud service providers, other hyperscalers are seeing a long-term growth trend in their business. And they're looking to lock up capacity in large quantities, knowing that they'll grow into it over time. In that example, they took down the entire shell and rented that from us \u2013 or upon delivery, they will rent it from us, and then took one suite and then will grow into that suite \u2013 the full shell over time. I think that's something not necessarily identical structures, but I think that many of our large and growing customers are thinking long-term about the growth in their business. And this is just one way to tackle it. Turning to Asia, I would say, I just spent some time over there with our team over there who's incredibly talented and had some great success with the local customer base. And really, it's been about a bit of an import/export business and I don't say that in jest, but it's bringing those local customers into the data centers in Singapore where we had significant pick up in leasing with the new logo on a large-scale deal. And it's also setting that same demand to other parts of the Digital Realty portfolio. And I'm thinking particularly of some of the Chinese customers where they've sent that demand into North America on both coasts and also tracking deals, as I mentioned earlier, in the European market with that same profile of customer. So, overall, great progress from the team in Asia-Pacific in the last handful of quarters, actually. Operator : The next question will come from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I was hoping to drill down a bit further into rent changes that you're seeing at renewal. More specifically, if we slice your Turn-Key portfolio different ways, like older facilities versus newer facilities or Internet gateways versus corporate facilities or higher resiliency versus lower resiliency, are there differences in what you see at renewal or would you characterize them as fairly similar across the board? And then second, I was just hoping you give us an update on some of the customer service initiatives you're undertaking and if you're starting to see any benefit in the result? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Hey, Nick, I'll tackle the first one, and I'll toss it out to team to talk about on the customer service side. We have a table in the back of our financial supp, it's either page 20 or 21 or 22, that really breaks out the product offerings. I would say the outcome of our expirations in terms of cash mark-to-market is driven by the product offering. It's driven by the customer profile. And as you can see on that, the bulk of our Internet gateways, as you've mentioned, fall within our colocation footprint. And that's not exclusively, but you see that we had 3.5% cash mark-to-markets, all with 90% retention. And if you move to the Turn-Key Flex, which is typically a little bit larger scale, definitely approaching the multiple megawatts in terms of expirations and renewals, that was closer to 4%. It's those colocation product offerings, those Internet gateways are typically incredibly network customer dense, limited capacity, maybe the most challenging type of capacity to move to a new provider. But both, by and large, have had kind of cycled through some peak vintage leases and turned into positive in the last couple of quarters. The other thing I want to touch on real quickly is, we really try to take a holistic customer approach, agnostic to product, and try to bring as many pieces of business, be it a network node in an Internet gateway, a scale renewal in one of our campuses, business in North America or Asia or Europe, and bring that in a holistic fashion to the customer and bring more to the table than just a transactional experience, which we think is a win for the customer in terms of delivering more value, and we think it's a win for Digital. And that often how we treat that customer at the renewal and those economic equations may flow through with a little bit softer or positive cash mark-to-market, but may also translate into more signings in the portfolio near-term and in the future. Maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk a little bit about the customer service initiative. Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Nick, for the question. We look at our performance over the last few quarters and our confidence in the pipeline right now. I think your question on customer services is quite valid to ask because we feel like it's making a significant difference in the demand pipeline that we're seeing from our customers. We have customer success managers deployed across our client base. We've invested in that role inside the company so that we stay close to our existing customers, while the sales team is out building new pipeline and we have very, very positive feedback from our customers in regard to that. We mentioned previously our Digital Delivers Program, which basically when a customer has feedback for us they just click a hyperlink at the bottom of any of our emails and get a response in 24 hours, and very positive feedback on that. We've talked about the focus on cultural changes and customer centricity in the company. That's making a big difference for us as well. And then, finally to say again, the executive sponsor program where all of us are getting out into the field and spending time with our clients, understanding what their strategic and tactical needs are, makes us really well informed leadership team and able to much more effectively make decisions that end up in, we believe, much happier customers and repeat customers. That's working well for us. Operator : And the next question will come from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thank you. Could you give us more color on why interconnection grew around 7% 1Q 2018? And just in the context of just your performance in the quarter, can you give us a little more color on that? And also after that, a second part to that is, could you give us more color on the work you're doing with Megaport, considering you actually invested another $5 million in a follow-on equity offering? And I could go from there. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Sami. Maybe I'll just touch on the interconnection revenue on the signings and the full tour on the P&L and then I'll toss over to Chris Sharp, our CTO to add on to that and also give some commentary on the Megaport question you had. So it was a little bit lower \u2013 on the signings front obviously a step-up versus the prior quarter but still not at a level that we're completely satisfied with. I can't tell you, I'd pointed to something specific episodic on the signings. I often look at it the interconnection signings kind of hand-in-hand with the colocation signings where the bulk of that connectivity is being serviced. And on a quarter-over-quarter basis, while not at peak number were down, call it, just north of 10%. I attribute that largely to our pipeline and execution around some larger colocation deals. So sub megawatt, I call it 200 kilowatts, 300 kilowatts, 400 kilowatts, 500 kilowatts. And another dynamic going on there is some \u2013 the lines are blurring a little bit between our products in terms of colocation and scale and some of those type deals have actually fallen outside of the colo product into a scale TKF suite. We actually saw a tick up, close to 14% or about 0.5 megawatt for sub 600 kilowatt deals that landed outside of colo. A prime example of that was a large telecommunication company that landed with us I think in nine locations and about half were in product types colo and half were outside product types colo. But net-net I think it's good news because our breadth of product allows us to capture that and I think the pipeline for some of the larger colo deals, which should have additional connectivity in the ensuing quarters is looking pretty strong. But maybe I'll open it up to Chris to add on to that or touch on the Megaport question as well. Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. And Sami, yeah, you're are absolutely correct. We're very happy with the partnership that we have in place with Megaport today. It's a very unique partnership out in the market. One of the things that we always emphasize is that the core component to our overall service exchange which some of the key highlights are on the service exchange is, it's really changing the dialogue that we're having with customers today and allowing us to really remove a lot of complexity from their deployments and allowing them to stand up their hybrid cloud architectures and one customer in point after \u2013 in most recently win in this last quarter is Netgain. They are a cloud IT provider delivering cloud hosting and managed services for healthcare and financial vertical. It's really the service exchange is allowing them to provide a much more dynamic environment for their customers in accessing the Microsoft Azure cloud. And then lastly, I mean, one of the reasons that Netgain came to Digital is the fact that they're able to provide a more robust, very performance aware deployment and be able to access a set of future cloud services which allows them to really broaden their horizons and leverage a future set of cloud services across that exchange. And that's where, one of the reasons why we picked Megaport to partner with is that not only their work, but our conjoined working going to market allows us to really solve a very differentiated part of the market and the fact that we've been able to accelerate the launch of the service exchange into most recently Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London due to the customer demand because of the fact that we have all the top five cloud providers on that platform. So, that's including Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, Oracle and IBM. So it's really allowing us to have a value based dialogue with our customer base. So we're very happy with the partnership we have in place with Megaport and we look to continue to expand the service exchange functionality across our portfolio. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we continue to execute on the integration of DuPont Fabros capitalizing on the value of the installed customer base to realize revenue synergies reaching record high bookings and backlog. We also delivered very solid current financial results being in consensus and raising guidance. Three of the sustainable growth in our earnings has flowed through to cash flow, as well as our distributions to shareholders. And our board recently approved a 9% increase in the per share dividend making this the 13th straight year that we've given shareholders a raise on the dividend. We achieved this growth in our distributions to shareholders while preserving our best-in-class balance sheet which we believe is a critical differentiator, particularly in a rising rate environment. Last but not least our board has approved a resolution giving shareholders the right to propose binding amendments to our bylaws. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us and we hope to see many of you at NAREIT in June. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your line.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp is on the call and will be available for Q&A. The management may make forward -looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. First and foremost, consistent execution against our customer success initiatives drove new high watermarks for both bookings and backlog. Second, we beat consensus by $0.05 driven by operational outperformance and the beat flowed through to a $0.05 guidance raise in the phase of shifting FX headwinds. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet by terming out revolver borrowings with an oversubscribed offering of $650 million of ten-year paper at a 4.45% coupon. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Let's begin on page 2 of our presentation with a recap of the strategic initiatives we laid out at our Investor Day in December. As you may recall, we told you then our top priority was deepening connections with our customers, and we expected to achieve our objectives through a global connected sustainable framework. We highlighted several initiatives we were undertaking to reorient our business around our customers, including our executive sponsorship program, our Digital Delivers customer success program, and steps we've taken to streamline the customer contracting process. A little over six months later, I'm pleased to report these initiatives are bearing fruit. The strong performance of the digital team delivered in the first half clearly benefited from a healthy economic backdrop and the robust growth of our customers' businesses. But there's no doubt that our growing mind share with customers has also benefited from our concerted efforts to reorient our business around their needs. Let's turn to sustainability on page 3. We are committed to powering our global portfolio with 100% renewable energy because we believe it's the right thing to do and because it matters to our customers. Our 20-megawatt utility-scale solar power purchase contract announced in December 2017 commenced operations in late March. This is the most recent project in our 184-megawatt renewable portfolio to come online, and it is now delivering low cost renewable energy at Ashburn. We have been frequently recognized for our sustainability leadership, and in June, we were named a 2018 Green Lease Leader by the Institute for Market Transformation and the Department of Energy's Better Buildings Alliance at the BOMA Expo. Green lease standards have become common in the main food groups, but have not traditionally been used in the data center industry. Digital Reality is the first global data center REIT to adopt green lease standards. Our actions are helping to evolve industry practices, enabling mutually beneficial arrangements between building owners and customers that align the costs and benefits of energy and resource efficiency investments by both parties to improve PUE and reduce operating costs. We are committed to sustainability and we are focused on delivering sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 4. In North America, new data centers are popping up across the primary data center metros, especially in Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active metro in the world, and through which more than 70% of the world's Internet traffic passes every day. Northern Virginia is also Digital Realty's largest concentration. We are blessed to own 370 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity in our existing portfolio along with 63 megawatts currently under construction that are 87% pre-leased, in addition to 243 acres of strategic landholdings that will support the build out of another 390 megawatts of future capacity. The data center sector has been prone to oversupply in the past, but demand is rapidly outpacing supply and on current form, we see a greater risk of running out of inventory and missing the opportunity to support our customers' growth than risk of oversupply. We are taking proactive steps to secure our supply chain and replenish our inventory balance. And you may have seen that we've acquired a 13-acre parcel in Santa Clara as well as a 62-acre parcel in Manassas, Virginia. We've seen a similar dynamic in Europe where we did miss out on some recent business due to a lack of inventory. However, as we told you last quarter, we restocked the shelves and made up for some lost ground in the second quarter with a total of 10 megawatts sold. On the last call, we mentioned a four-megawatt deployment in Amsterdam with a top legacy DFT customer. Other key second quarter wins in Europe included a company that provides cloud-based solutions for the higher education sector security deployment in our Frankfurt colocation facility to provide local hosting services to German customers and to satisfy data sovereignty compliance requirements. They selected Digital Realty as their partner for this project due to the technical strength of our Frankfurt facility as well as our ability to meet their aggressive deployment schedule. Europe's leading provider of monitor security solutions for both business and residential properties selected Digital Realty in Amsterdam to consolidate their other data center deployments across the Nordics and Southern Europe. A British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer chose a digital location in London to replace their owned facility, meet their migration criteria and timeline and provide immediately available inventory with room to grow. Nearly three-fourths of the recent activity has been with existing customers either expanding their current footprint or looking for new partnerships for their next phase of growth. Similar to the U.S., given our recent success, we are focused on building out remaining capacity within our current footprint and we are kicking off the initial phases of the next buildings on our campus locations to maintain a healthy inventory balance. Pricing is competitive and customers remain focused on flexibility and expansion options in addition to differentiated connectivity solutions and a track record of operational excellence. Market vacancy is low across the major European markets, both new and established competitors are bringing new supply to market, but it is being met by healthy demand. Across the Asian Pacific region, the robust demand we have cited for the past several quarters continues to accelerate, particularly from Asian cloud service providers. Follow-on requirements from these clients are coming to market sooner-than-expected, deployments that were closed only a few years ago are already approaching full capacity. On the supply front, the build cycle in many Asia Pacific markets is longer than other regions, given complexity in the permitting and approval stage, as well as the need to build vertically in urban, land-constrained environments. Net-net, we believe our customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection product offering as a key differentiator in their selection of data center provider of choice. Let's turn to the intersection of supply and demand on page 5. A lot of ink has been spilled recently expressing concerns about pricing and profitability on hyperscale activity. I'd like to share a few data points that may help you understand our perspective on pricing and returns. First of all, the average lease term on leases we've signed over the last 12 months is more than two years longer than the average lease term over the prior 12 months. Quarterly bookings tend to get a lot of airtime and obviously our bookings have stepped up as well. But when you take those two extra years of lease term into account, you'll see that the total contract value we have signed over the last 12 months is more than double the contract value we signed over the previous 12 months. It goes without saying that hyperscale credit quality is excellent. In addition, the larger deal sizes we're doing today are also substantially de-risking our development pipeline. You can see that firsthand this quarter as the pre-leasing on our pipeline moved up from just over 40% to north of 60%. Consequently, while developing returns may be marginally lower today, we believe the returns on our current pipeline represent a respectable spread over our cost of capital, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis. And when you consider the greater volume and longer lease term, we believe our recent activity has created meaningful value for shareholders. Let's turn to the macro environment on page 6. As I said earlier, the global economic backdrop has been quite supportive for the last several quarters. We are mindful of the risk of a global trade war which does have the potential to disrupt the broad based current economic growth. However as you've heard me say many times before, we're fortunate to be operating a business levered to secular demand drivers both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular trends, I'd like to highlight just a couple of the figures on page 7. According to the Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey, over 70% of organizations report making significant or moderate cloud investments. According to a recent Gartner forecast, nearly $74 billion will be spent on cloud application services better known as Software-as-a-Service in 2018. This makes SaaS the top category in global public cloud spending this year. More than $40 billion or over 20% of the overall public cloud market will be spent on Infrastructure-as-a-Service in 2018. While SaaS is the biggest piece of the pie and is expected to stay that way through 2021, infrastructure is the fastest growing segment, up nearly 36% in 2018 according to Gartner. The global spend on public cloud services is expected to grow by more than 20% in 2018 reaching over $185 billion. IDC expects public cloud spending to grow over 20% a year for the next five years reaching north of $275 billion by 2021. To effectively address this market, data center providers must offer a global interconnected solution from colocation to hyperscale. These trends obviously play directly to our strengths, help explain the quality of our recent results and bode very well for future demand cycles. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 9. We signed total bookings for the second quarter of $94 million, including an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $86 million during the second quarter, including a $7.5 million colocation contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the second quarter was over seven years. Our largest transaction was a 25-plus megawatt win with an existing hyperscale customer who selected us based on our distinguished operational track record and ability to accommodate their future growth needs. Second quarter wins were broad-based across products as well as geographic regions and bookings would have been north of $60 million even excluding the 25-plus megawatt hyperscale win. While the majority of our new signs were with existing customers, we added 39 new logos during the quarter from an industry-leading aerospace company to an international provider of shared workspaces sourced through one of our many partners. Within the enterprise segment, second quarter wins included : a global financial technology company chose Digital Realty as their go-to partner for data center consolidation and expansion, the customer recognized Digital Realty's ability to provide best-in-class facilities that met the most stringent security needs, a strong partner ecosystem for migration enablement and robust connectivity solutions; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology needed a specific connectivity solution in North America and Digital Realty delivered, the institute established a presence with us to accommodate high networking gear that will support research and development of Internet platform technology; an international semiconductor intellectual property supplier is expanding into new IoT services, with existing data center facilities in the U.S. and the UK, the company expanded with us with their presence in Texas, driven by security and their customer demand for a single-tenant environment. We saw strong demand this quarter in our network segment across the portfolio including, a 12-site backbone expansion for a leading global provider of communications and digital entertainment services, a new edge deployment in Atlanta for a leading global provider of software-defined networking and other services, a new networking deployment in Miami for a leading national provider of fiber optic network solutions and services, a new edge deployment in New York for a leading global provider of innovative solutions for satellite clients, and an expansion of network deployments in Atlanta and New York for a global media and technology company. Our strategic alliances and channel referral partner programs continue to help us drive growth and extend our reach to new customers. We continue to build our capabilities through partners who integrate our world-class data center capabilities into the solutions they offer customers. For example, during the second quarter, we partnered with Oracle to provide the right solution for a global mobile network provider with a set of private, low latency, high availability connections through our Service Exchange platform to their globally deployed production environments and directly to Oracle OCI cloud nodes within our data centers. As shown here on page 10, we also continued to expand our capabilities with IBM, one of our key strategic alliances where we have been able to embed our capabilities into their Direct Link products that allow customers to connect directly to their cloud infrastructure and advanced cloud services. We saw continued growth with that business in the second quarter by providing capabilities to IBM, its business partners and customers globally. These capabilities now include access to IBM Cloud, the IBM Direct Link on our Service Exchange platform providing customers, partners and IBM organizations the ability to choose how and where they want to connect to the IBM Cloud within our global footprint providing a secure, low latency, consistent and reliable set of capabilities. This partnership illustrates the unique value proposition of Digital Realty's comprehensive product offering. We are able to offer customers a wide variety of connection options such as a flexible private cloud footprint on our campus, directly adjacent to an IBM Cloud compute node, enabling the customer to connect directly and securely to their public cloud instance at incredible low latency, especially compared to an off-campus on-ramp, which is then has to tether back to the actual cloud compute engine sitting on a Digital Realty campus. This flexibility gives us a unique ability to solve for the full spectrum of our customers' hybrid multi-cloud architecture requirements. Turning to our backlog on page 11, the current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, reached another all-time high of $142 million. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements was five months, a bit below the long-term average. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 12, we signed $76 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was 3.5 years and cash rents on renewals rolled up 3.4% with positive cash release and spreads across all product types. We do still have a few above market leases across the portfolio, most notably within former DFT properties. As a result, the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash releasing spreads for the full year in 2018. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy picked up 20 basis points to 89.4% due primarily to positive absorption in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Dallas. We expect portfolio occupancy should be essentially flat in the second half as continued positive absorption in the same-store pool will be partially offset by placing in-service development projects that have not yet reached stabilization. Turning to our economic risk mitigation on page 13, FX represented a modest tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our second quarter results. However, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen over the past 90 days and has acted as a bit of a drag on growth relative to the prior quarter. We now expect FX to represent a modest headwind in the second half of the year. Moving on to earnings growth on page 14, core FFO per share was up 8% year-over-year and came in $0.05 above consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was primarily driven by operational outperformance with lower than expected property taxes as well as operating expenses. As you may have seen from the press release, despite the foreign currency headwind, we are raising 2018 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Most of the drivers are unchanged aside from higher development spending due to our recent leasing wins and updated assumptions for FX, financings and asset sales closed during the second quarter. In terms of the quarterly run-rate, as you can see from the bridge on page 15, we expect to step back down by the extent of the beat in the third quarter due to higher interest expense from the recent bond issuance, timing of G&A investments and loss of NOI from our recent asset sales before rebounding sharply in the fourth quarter as several large leases commence. Last but not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 16. Net debt-to-EBITDA improved slightly to 5.2 times at the end of the second quarter and fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.3 times. As you can see from the chart on page 16, our weighted average debt maturity is approximately five years and the weighted average coupon is 3.5%. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and nearly 100% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. A little over 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. We will continue to actively manage the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards long duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 16, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will be from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. So first, I just wanted to touch on investment activity for a second. It was reported, I believe, by Bloomberg a few weeks ago that you guys were in talks and looking at a large scale portfolio in Brazil. Anything you can offer up in terms of interest level in expansion into South America? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hi Jordan, thanks for the question. We, as you know, do not comment on market rumors, but I'll share with you our thought process regarding investments. First, as you know, we try to stay close to our customers, and in speaking with them, try to ascertain where they have an interest in growing. Second, we truly believe that our global platform represents a key competitive advantage. We think that's been validated with this quarter's results. When looking at new investment opportunities, we pay particular attention to new capabilities, new markets, platforms that are appealing. In our Investor Day last year, we did say that we were going to try to enter two new markets in the next three years and we put a map up of the largest economies. So from that map, you can probably draw your own conclusions. We do keep tabs on everything. We see everything because of our size. We look at potential markets all the time. And when we do participate in a new market and buy a portfolio, we try to remain disciplined with respect to capital allocation. So I hope that's helpful. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. It is. Separately, just on the results, I think congrats are due to you guys from the volume. We don't offer those up lightly, but that's obviously a big quarter. The one question regarding the volume is you did beat and you did raise by a similar amount to the beat in the quarter. Given the reasonably short lag between signing and commencement on this $94 million, why aren't we seeing a little bit more of a flow through into 2018? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Well, thank you first of all for the congratulations on the bookings in the quarter. We obviously feel really good about that. In terms of the specifics behind the guidance, I'll hand that off to Andy. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Jordan. So, as you mentioned, we were certainly pleased with not just the volume, but the composition of the new signings. The one thing I would note is a significant portion of those new signings were executed in the back half of the quarter. Thus the five months from sign to commence really only trickles in a few weeks or months into the fiscal 2018 year. The good news is that we are once again moving the chains on our guidance at the low and the high end and moving the guidance up to higher and higher single digit growth and we will get the full year benefit of those signings we signed this quarter next year, which does de-risk our growth in 2019. Operator : The next question will be from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. I also want to echo the congratulations on obviously a very strong quarter. Two questions if I may. First on the interconnect revenue; it was flat roughly quarter-over-quarter. And I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that and what you're doing to potentially improve that and maybe what you think it should be. And then also just in light of the very strong bookings, just wanted to get some \u2013 remind us about your capital requirements. Do you think an equity raise is coming at some point to support this, maybe not this year but next year? Any color on what CapEx could look like in 2019 even if it's simply down, flat or up from this year would be helpful. Thank you. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks again, Colby, for the congratulations, appreciate it. This is Andy, maybe I'll tackle, actually probably both and let Bill and Chris chime in. On the interconnection front, we were pleased with the overall signs on interconnection and the step-up quarter-over-quarter, and we kind of often lump that together with the colocation signings, which did improve on a quarterly basis in terms of signings. They stepped up in Europe and North America and in aggregate, the largest contributors were some of our campus colocation expansions, be it Ashburn or Richardson, some new footprint in Atlanta we opened up in the last six to nine months, and also some of our core markets like New York, Chicago and London, we had some several wins in there for some great customers and I think what you're pointing out too is what flowed through the P&L, which was a little muted on a year-over-year basis. We did have some credits from our Amsterdam Data Tower migration moving some of our legacy customers from their existing footprint to newly built colocation facility to facilitate that disruption. We gave some credits on the interconnection revenue and we do think the other signs we signed will ultimately continue to grow that line item in the future. And I look at it as more of a longevity here of the re-architecting of the sales and marketing team, going vertical, getting the right reps on the right accounts and driving the cadence to drive more colocation interconnection revenue over the next several quarters. I think your second question was kind of around capital planning and financial policy. So, we did inch up the development CapEx guidance line item due to some of the wins we had on the signings front during the quarter and also attributable to some of the land purchases carrying future supply chain. Luckily, we ended the quarter at 5.2 times debt-to-EBITDA, in line with our targeted leverage levels and termed out our floating rate debt. So, we have call it less than $0.5 billion of revolver borrowings, so substantial liquidity and remain focused on organically or self-funding all our needs for 2018. Looking forward 2019, call it, the next 12 to 18 months from here, we're certainly going to have to evaluate all of our sources of capital, be it proceeds from our disposition capital-recycling program as well as other common, preferred equity and bond financing alternatives. Operator : The next question will be from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the land acquisitions in Santa Clara and Manassas, how are you thinking about the potential build out of those properties, and what's the long-term thought there, particularly you talked about Ashburn, but establishing a bigger footprint in Manassas? And then you did some divestitures in the quarter, can you just help us think through, is that it or are there likely to be more and how do you think about why get out of a market like Austin, what's the framework there for de-emphasizing some of those? Thanks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Simon, this is Bill. I'll start and let the other fellows here clean up. But first of all, relative to Manassas, what we're seeing is that the CSPs are basically going with three availability zones in the market. And so, Manassas represents a different availability zone than Loudoun, so it gives us the opportunity to land the same customer in the market, but in a slightly different location. So, Manassas is very attractive from that standpoint. And Santa Clara is a very tight market and we've talked about it before. It's the one market where supply is constrained and we see rents improving. And so, this particular location was adjacent to an existing data center of ours. It allows us to create a campus in that particular submarket. Relative to dispositions, we're not finished. I mean, while we are a data center company, we're also a real estate investment trust, and we're all about prudent portfolio management, which means we are monitoring the portfolio regularly and looking to sell assets that are less core to our strategy, maybe have slower growth, maybe some CapEx requirements. And so, those are typically markets that we don't see as having the same demand characteristics as some of our core markets, and those might be one-off assets. And that will continue. Andy or Chris, any? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, I'll just say that the theme on the markets where we're concentrating our investment focus versus markets where we're monetizing the similar trends be it when we exit Philadelphia, St. Louis, Sacramento and redeploy those capitals into Ashburn, Chicago, Dallas, Santa Clara and similar markets abroad it is targeted markets with robust and diverse customer demand from across all of our verticals, be it our global accounts, enterprise or network verticals and moving out of markets or less concentration in markets that are much more dependent on regional IT outsource demand and somewhat single thread. Operator : The next question will come from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Peter Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you, for taking the questions and congrats on the results. Just two questions. First, as it relates to your 2018 outlook and your expectation for slightly negative cash renewals, but your commentary seem to be somewhat positive. So I'm just trying to balance out what your guidance is versus some of the commentary that you had made. And then, secondly in Europe, obviously, it was a little light in Q1, but your business had picked up. How do you feel you're positioned now to capture some of that demand that you're seeing in the market is demonstrating? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Relative to Europe, we think we're in a good spot. In Frankfurt, we've leased 3 megs out of 9 meg total building and we're planning to begin construction on the other two nine meg properties on the site. And similarly, I understand we have some additional capacity and we'll be beginning construction soon there. Andy, do you want to handle the...? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Just round that out and I'll turn over to the mark-to-market. I mean, I think the Europe activity has certainly picked up on the execution front and it's been broad-based to ranging from top three global cloud service providers to Asia based cloud service providers to local, a win we had in London market from an enterprise customer. So broad-based and traction continues and pipeline grows. Turning to the mark-to-market, we've had a positive cash mark-to-market on our renewals in the first quarter. We had another positive mark-to-market in the second quarter. It was broad-based across all of the major product lines. That being said, as we've referenced before we do still have a handful of larger leases in the portfolio, most notably those we've inherited and somewhat underwrote in our acquisition of the DuPont Fabros portfolio that will likely renew in the coming quarters, that could bring the overall year slightly negative or into the red. So it's not a definitive time table when, which particular quarter those get executed, but we did want to make sure that we incorporate that into our full year guidance. Operator : And the next question will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I wanted to touch base on sort of the inflation pressure that I'm kind of seeing in the industry both on raw materials and labor and what's sort of your outlook there over the next 12 months and your ability to pass that along and do you think that could possibly affect your development yields as you look at building out over the next 12 months? Thanks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Frank, we've touched on this before, but we have a program in place where we lock in our major equipment costs for three years. And that's really insulated us from equipment costs and material costs. The other thing that we do is we keep our contractors fully employed. In fact, if we're no longer building in one region, we'll move that contractor out to another region to keep them fully engaged and we find that by doing that it gives us very attractive labor cost as well. Andy, anything you'd like to add there. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Just something that was akin to the legacy DuPont portfolio as well. So, on many of our larger footprint customers, we've been moving forward with a triple net lease structure that allows us to pass through escalations and costs over the term of the contract, but it also insulates us on our returns over-time. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will be from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. I have two quick ones. One, in terms of the signings that you mentioned in the fourth quarter, how should we think about the level of contribution it has and then going into 2019 and then in terms of the top three customers that you have, there is a little bit of a shuffling in terms of the level in a positive way. How should we consider that? Thank you. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. I'll start Frank and let the team chime in. We do have a slide that kind of rolls forward our commencement timing and which we somewhat segmented of what's kind of commencing in the back half of 2018 and on into 2019. As I mentioned in response to I believe the first question, a good portion of the 4Q 2018 commencements are late 4Q 2018, but there are some larger leases in there that will kick in and obviously (40:33) that is you've got a full-year's benefit in 2019 de-risking our growth there. So that should give you a little bit of color on the backlog and we also kind of provided some rough guidance in the composition of the quarterly 2018 core FFO per share. Your second question, you're correct, we have a new name on the leaderboard in terms of our top customer list here at digital. I think we all love each and every one of our customers equally. So I'm not going to say that's a good thing or a bad thing, but certainly I've seen customers that are already on there, adding more locations and expanding with us and also new names jumping on that top 20 list anytime we can. Operator : And the next question will come from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Just two quick questions. One, where do you guys stand on potential replacements for Dan and Scott or whether you're going to replace them at all and maybe talk a little bit about the organizational structure in that case. And the second is, Andy I was wondering if you could just be a little bit more specific, I guess, about 3Q guidance and then what's implied for 4Q just on a per share basis? Thank you. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Michael, I'll handle your first question, and Andy will handle the second one. Relative to replacements, first of all, I think we clearly believe in our team. We think we have a very talented team. We think that's validated by the second quarter that's been delivered. But having said that, we're looking at both internal and external candidates for both the head of sales position and the Chief Investment Officer position and we're looking at some what I think are very high quality, high caliber candidates. We've engaged a search firm. We're also mining our own network, which we think is very good. But you know given the strength of our platform and the existing team, we're focused on bringing on the right people versus timing, and we're in no rush to fill these positions. We have a deep and talented team and we remain focused on executing our strategic vision. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then Michael turning to your guidance question, probably I'm not going to hit the nail on the head with this answer given that our policy is really to give full-year guidance not quarterly, we did try to be helpful on one of the slides in the deck that kind of bridges you from the second quarter to the third and fourth. A couple of things I'd highlight or the three things I'd highlight are one, some of the step down between second quarter and third quarter is we did execute an upsized U.S. dollar 10-year bond offering last month. That turned out our revolver borrowings and as you can see on the guidance table, we did that a little bit earlier than we had previously assumed taking advantage of a market window and preserving liquidity and which we think is the right thing to do for the balance sheet. But it does have a somewhat of a little drag in the quarter-to-quarter earnings. We also will get hit with the loss of NOI and the timing delay between redeployment and those funds coming back on through our development yields from some of the acquisitions we completed during the second quarter and our plan to complete in the third and fourth quarter. And then that kind of stair steps you down to 3Q 2018. And then lastly the fourth quarter, we do have already signed leases several in Northern Virginia that have signed and are commencing in late or a portion of which will commence in 4Q 2018 and then also there is another larger lease in the Santa Clara market, it's multiple megawatts that I'm aware of coming online and kicking into fourth quarter 2018 contribution that steps that core FFO per share backup per our guidance. Operator : The next question will be from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the question and also congratulations on a very big leasing number. I have a question about smaller item on the property taxes, which looks like that was a big part of the beat in the quarter, it was a significant step down. Do you expect this to be the recurring rate going forward or will that be stepping back up sort of more in line with where it's been historically. And secondly, in terms of hyperscale, I was wondering what you're seeing generally outside of the Northern Virginia market. Northern Virginia market seems extremely strong and then we hear a lot about it. But what are you seeing in terms of the scale of deployments in other locations around the country? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Maybe I'll start off and let Bill and Chris chime in here. On the property taxes, that's really due to proactive management always chasing down appeals and working wherever we can. And also a bit of conservative accruals in terms of our estimates, a portion of that would be non-recurring unless we continue to achieve on a different appeal in a different market. They really were broken up between our UK portfolio and the West Coast region of North America portfolio. So, a little bit of that I would say is one time in nature, but all baked into the full year guidance we've kind of already incorporated. Turning to hyperscale or scale, maybe I'll just kind of hit the tops of the waves and guys chime in as you see fit. Outside of Northern Virginia, we had in North America scale signings the larger \u2013 on the smaller end, the scale signings ranged from call it north of 500 kilowatts to as high as 6 megawatts in Austin, Phoenix, Toronto and Santa Clara, one of which I just mentioned. If you move over to Europe, there was some of the transactions I mentioned with the enterprise customer in London, was call it 700 kilowatts and then we had other transactions in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt ranging 2 megawatt to 4 megawatt each from three different customers. And then in Asia Pacific, we had on the smaller end, 600 kilowatt transaction from a European SaaS provider in Australia, multiple megawatt and then multiple megawatt signings from some of our other customers into Hong Kong and Tokyo. Operator : The next question will be from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Bill, you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but how would you describe the risk of running short of inventory over the medium-term to sustain the sales momentum you've seen as of late. I mean, is that something we should actually be concerned about or do you feel comfortable with the pipeline? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Well, that's why we have acquired the land that we did in Virginia, we acquired the land in Santa Clara. We'll probably have some other land announcements this quarter. So we're very focused on securing the frontend of the supply chain. We're laying down pads on our campuses so that we can build quickly when the demand materializes, so. And there are some markets where the inventory is being churned through very quickly, particularly in Northern Virginia but that's why we're adding land. Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay. Got it. And maybe on the colocation side, now that you've been operating them both for a couple of years, can you help dimension the magnitude of the benefit that stemmed from pairing the Telecity divestiture assets with the Telex assets? Help us understand how valuable it is having a global presence in that business versus a regional presence? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. This is Andy, and then I'm going to pitch this to (49:30) Chris to add on. I mean I think we're seeing more and more multi-market, multi-product deployments. And the customer is coming to us with, I need these many, eight locations across North America, Asia, Europe of ranges of different sizes and different uses. And there's specific signs I can recall during the quarter with some of our network customers and some of our social media customers who have bought with us, not only large but also small network deployments in multiple markets, multiple geos. And I'm aware of many other transactions in the pipeline as well. We're having \u2013 being able to be at the table with these customers and being able to provide a solution, be it Amsterdam or London, Ashburn or Santa Clara and Asia Pacific equivalence is the key differentiator relative to our competitive set. And something we would not have had or would not be able to compete with just going back a handful of years. Chris, I don't know if you want to add on to that. Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: No. I'd definitely echo the sentiment on the fact that it's not just about colo, it's in the interconnection as well. And so, taking that interconnection capability and applying it to our scale portfolio has definitely broadened the solution set that we can provide to the customer base and it's a very much a multi-national type of customers coming to Digital where they land and they have the ability to expand, not only into colo but also into scale, which is really a differentiator going forward. And so, being able to apply these services in a very seamless fashion, so that not only a lot of the large cloud that we've been talking a lot about today can land their initial deployment, but they have a lot of smaller customers that need that colo capability in close proximity to their cloud node where they have the most efficient way to achieve that hybrid multi-cloud model, which a majority of the enterprises are looking for. So the culmination of all those products coming together in a very efficient manner is really differentiated in Digital going forward. Operator : The next question will be from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the hyperscale requirements and with regard or some focus on the 25 megawatt deal that was signed this quarter, I'm just curious in terms of the nature of the requirements you're seeing and the specific markets. Are you able to flag for us or identify the types of workloads that are driving this acceleration in demand that you're seeing? Is it the use of AI and ML that's driving it or anything specific you could point to? Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Excellent question. Thank you, Jordan. It's a mix, right. So inside of 25 megawatts, you can do a lot. I would tell you that what we're seeing is there's a lot of demand for new services that are adjunct to an existing set of services. So customers are really landing and expanding and really looking at how they can future proof their deployment. But the culmination of a lot of this infrastructure coming to market is not only supporting AI and some of the new ML services, but if you look at any of these major cloud operators today, I mean, they're announcing services \u2013 a couple of services a week, and so the way to support those services and the fact that it's a bit of an arms race is why they are coming to Digital and Bill had touched on this around the land banks that we have in place, the power that we've procured, the fact that we're master planning a lot of the infrastructure we have out there, and can turn around a lot of this infrastructure in some of the shortest timeframes in the market is definitely top of mind for these customers. And then I would tell you the last piece around some of the workload dynamics is, it's a mash up of services for a lot of these operators. So, as I referenced earlier, that interconnection component is also top of mind not only achieving the 25 megawatts and having a line of sight to future expansion for their own needs, but where their broader ecosystem of partners also are going to be placed, and that's why you see us really master planning and looking at building some of the largest campuses that are out in the market today that are fully interconnected to support that. We talked about it's at the highest levels, the cloud as the supply chain, the most efficient supply chain brought to market, which supports every workload permutation we've seen in the market today. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jordan, just let me add to that. So one thing that's really important to our customers, I don't think we've exactly hit on it here, but it's the ability to expand. So not only do the customers want to be able to fit into what we have built or will soon have built. But they want to be able to look and see that there's room for their growth on a campus and that's either in the existing facility or in a building next door and that's I think one thing that Digital provides that many of our competitors can't offer. And it goes to our point that we think that scale and particularly the global scale is a key differentiating factor in this business is becoming more and more important to our customers. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And when you look at the scale requirements and this potential and this acceleration. Or, is pricing holding would you say or is it strengthening? How would you characterize it as it relates to (55:19) requirements. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I'd say it definitely varies by market as you'd expect in any real estate business. But, I think, the pricing is actually on a risk adjusted basis is pretty darn good for even the largest deals. You look at the term of the contract, you look at the credit quality and the bumps over the term of the contract and you take those returns against our weighted average cost of capital and so, it's a very healthy spread that I don't think you can find in many other parts of the real estate world, if any. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers, reaching record highs in both our bookings and our backlog. We further extended our sustainability leadership with our industry recognition as a green lease leader. We delivered solid current period finance results beating consensus and raising guidance. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by terming out borrowings in our line of credit with the successful issuance of $650 million of 10-year investment grade U.S. dollar corporate bonds. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us. And we hope you all enjoy the dog days of summer. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. First, we followed up our record bookings in the prior quarter with our second highest and our backlog reached another high watermark. Next, we announced our entry into Latin America. Third, we beat consensus by a $0.01 and we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share for the third time in the past four years. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet extending our weighted average debt maturity by a full year with the issuance of $520 million of 12-year paper at 3.75% and the refinancing of our $3.3 billion credit facilities. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had a very productive third quarter with consistent execution against our strategic plan. Let's turn to page 2 of our presentation. The highlight of the quarter was the announcement of our entry into Latin America with a definitive agreement to acquire Ascenty for $1.8 billion. Ascenty is the leading data center platform in a rapidly growing market. It's best-in-class management team and proprietary fiber network have made it the partner of choice for the leading global cloud providers, and as a result, it has the largest market share. Ascenty's portfolio is comprised of eight in-service, purpose-built, world-class data centers and another six data centers currently under construction, totaling 106 megawatts of planned capacity. The in-service portfolio was approximately 97% leased as of September 30. While the data centers under construction were approximately 83% pre-leased. Since our announcement, the Ascenty management team has continued to execute generating additional fiber revenue and leasing another 3.6 megawatts in October to two leading global cloud providers, bringing their year-to-date leasing tally to approximately 30 megawatts. Given its high quality portfolio, Ascenty serves a blue chip customer base of 140 logos, including the leading global hyperscale cloud providers. In fact, investment grade or equivalent clients account for over 90% of revenue. In addition more than 75% of Ascenty's contractual cash rent is denominated in U.S. dollars substantially mitigating foreign currency exposure. I might add here that the real has appreciated by 10% since we announced the acquisition just over a month ago. This transaction immediately establishes Digital Realty as a leading data center provider in Latin America. Ascenty enjoys approximately 30% market share in Brazil far outstripping its competitors. We believe we can further accelerate the company's success, capture additional market share and expand our total addressable market by leveraging digital realties global platform. In fact we've received a number of inbound calls from existing customers inquiring about data center capacity in Brazil since our announcement in late September. The transaction also presents significant growth potential in a key emerging market. Brazil has the eighth largest economy in the world and it's the fifth most populous country, but less than 60% of the population currently has internet access. As this relatively young market continues to come online and as consumers, local enterprise customers and global IT service providers begin to expand their presence in Latin America, we see significant opportunities to ride this next wave of growth. Finally we've structured the transaction to benefit from two sets of partners with local market expertise and a strong track record of execution. We are pleased to be partnering with Brookfield, a leading global asset manager with a well-established track record of investments in Brazil, across infrastructure, renewable power, real estate and private equity. Brookfield has committed to initially invest $613 million in exchange for a 49% equity interest in a joint venture expected to ultimately own Ascenty. Brookfield has been investing in Brazil for over 100 years, and is now one of the largest investors in the country with over $40 billion of assets under management. The partnership with Brookfield provides unparalleled access, experience and resources within the market to help us grow and rollout our strategy. In addition Ascenty's management team led by CEO, Chris Torto is staying with the company. Management is rolling forward the substantial majority of its equity into Digital Realty OP units subject to a three year lockup as well as a 2% stake in the joint venture with Brookfield. This transaction is prudently financed. We raised common equity to fund our equity contribution the same day that we announced the acquisition, consistent with our historical practice, in addition to the equity contributions from Brookfield and the Ascenty management. We've also lined up non-recourse debt financing. Partly due to the conservative capital structure, the transaction is expected to be approximately 2% dilutive in 2019, and 1% dilutive in 2020. However, we expect it to be accretive over the longer term and significantly accretive to Digital Realty's long-term growth profile. Last but not least, the Ascenty acquisition is highly strategic. The portfolio is comprised of great assets along with a critical fiber network run by a top notch management team, all in a tough market to crack with significant verified customer demand. We spend a lot of time assessing global markets and we see precious few opportunities around the world with such a compelling growth trajectory. At the same time that we announced Ascenty, we also announced the pending acquisition of 424 acres of land next to Dulles International Airport for $237 million or a little less than $560,000 per acre. This is the parcel highlighted in Royal Blue at the bottom of the map here on page 3. The land purchase is consistent with our stated objective of securing our supply chain and our cost basis compares very favorably to recent comps of over $1 million per acre demonstrating how our global scale, balance sheet capacity and real estate heritage have further enhanced our ability to support our customers growth in the most important data center market in the world. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 4. Construction crews remain active in the primary data center metros across North America, including Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active metro in the world and through which over 70% of the world's Internet traffic passes each day. Despite the number of competitors and shovels in the ground, on current form, we see demand continuing to outstrip supply. Northern Virginia is also Digital Realty's largest concentration and we own over 375 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity in our existing portfolio along with 74 megawatts currently under construction that are 89% pre-leased. Upon closing, this most recent land purchase, we will own 667 acres of strategic landholdings that will support the build out of over 1,000 megawatts of future capacity. In Europe, supply and demand dynamics are similarly healthy. Global cloud providers continue to drive robust demand in the region and multiple cloud providers have come to market for new deployments across the core metros. Enterprise demand has also begun to pick up particularly in London and Dublin. Pricing is competitive and customers remain focused on flexibility and expansion options along with differentiated connectivity solutions and a track record of operational excellence. Market vacancy remains in check across the major European markets. While competitors are bringing new supply to market it is being met by healthy demand particularly from existing customers either expanding their current footprint or looking for new partnerships for their next phase of growth. Across the Asia-Pacific region, demand remains robust with pockets of demand popping up in new markets along with steady demand for core markets. Supply remains largely in check, and the complexity of local regulatory frameworks, vendor pools and even language barriers serve to limit the number of pan-regional competitors. On balance, we believe customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection offerings as a key differentiator in the selection of their data center provider. Let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. Global economic expansion remains intact. Although, we are mindful of the risk of a global trade war which does have the potential to disrupt the broad-based current economic growth. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. Given the resiliency of our industry, our business and our balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. We had a very strong quarter with balanced performance across regions, product types and customer segments. The continued demand underscores the values customers see in Digital Realty. We provide the trusted foundation, powering our customers' digital ambitions. Customers choose us for many reasons. We offer them resiliency they can trust. We have secure, compliant and reliable data center solutions, including those powered by renewable energy. Our global footprint of interconnected scale data centers and hyperconnected hubs offers a broad range of solutions when and where our customers need them. And finally, our solutions help customers manage their strategic, financial, operational, and reputational risk. During the third quarter, we signed total bookings of $69 million, including an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $62 million, with a weighted average lease term of 10 years, including a $10 million colocation contribution. The total bookings number was our second best quarter ever, close on the heels of our $94 million all-time high in the prior quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $224 million compared to $198 million for the full year in 2017. The $18 million combined colocation and interconnection contribution was likewise the second highest on record. We are seeing solid traction with our Service Exchange platform, powered by our unique partnership with Megaport. This traction is partly due to the continued expansion of our key cloud destinations to include Salesforce, the largest SaaS provider, and top destination requests from many of our enterprise customers. Recent customer testimonials include a global voice solutions and service provider, who reported, \"We now have 10 times the bandwidth with painless provisioning to different cloud services.\" While a company using Digital Realty to accelerate their AI strategy stated and I quote, \"Having Service Exchange not only lowers the cost of our bandwidth by 80%, it also makes setting up virtual environments much easier.\" As these testimonials suggest, hybrid multi-cloud is the most sought after and efficient architecture for the overwhelming majority of enterprise customers. And our Service Exchange provides them simple, secure access to the most valuable ecosystems around the world. During the third quarter, our largest transaction was a 20-plus megawatt win with a global hyperscale cloud provider that selected us due to our repeatable contractual framework, attention to detail throughout the pursuit, and our ability to accommodate their future growth. This is hyperscale, the ability to meet current demand and to provide highly sophisticated customers the ability to efficiently land and expand. While the majority of our new business was with existing customers, we added 48 new logos during the quarter. In addition, through our alliance partner sales engagement, we added eight of our partners' new end user customers to our ecosystem. Our Enterprise segment delivered a notably strong contribution this quarter. Key wins included a global investment bank that's leveraging Digital Reality's network density for five new colocation deployments that will be used to upgrade their current global wide-area network. We will be providing one of the world's oldest stock exchanges with highly redundant dual meet-me-room connectivity to their Ashburn Data Center deployment. A not-for-profit oceanography foundation chose Digital Realty for its colocation environment that will be used to store, analyze, and distribute data in real time. Within our Network segment, key third quarter wins included : an edge expansion in San Francisco and New York metro areas for a leading open digital media platform provider; a backbone expansion in New York and L.A. for a leading national provider of communications services to businesses; and new backbone interconnection deployments in Dallas and Atlanta for a leader in content delivery, load balancing, and video and streaming services. Turning to our backlog on page 8, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached another all-time high of $148 million. The weighted average lag between third quarter signings and commencements was five months, a bit below the long-term average. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9, we signed $61 million of renewals during the third quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was 4.2 years, and cash rents on renewals rolled up 0.2%, driven by healthy cash releasing spreads on colocation and power-based building renewals. Turnkey releasing spreads were slightly negative during the third quarter, largely due to a single enterprise customer who renewed their existing footprint in our Franklin Park connected campus in Chicago while simultaneously expanding their presence in Franklin Park and establishing a sizable new presence on our Elk Grove Village campus, also in Chicago. This transaction is a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And then whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. This particular transaction was a legacy Digital Realty renewal and was not one of the above-market leases within the former DFT properties we've called out previously. We do still expect these leases to roll down. And as a result, the mix of renewal activity in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash releasing spreads for the full year in 2018. In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked up 10 basis points to 89.5%, due primarily to positive absorption in London, Chicago, and Dallas. Turning to economic risk mitigation strategies on page 10, the U.S. dollar strengthened somewhat over the past 90 days, and FX represented roughly a 30 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our third quarter results. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 1% impact to full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well-managed. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up 8% year-over-year and came in a $0.01 above consensus. As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating 2018 core FFO per share guidance. Most of the drivers are unchanged except that we have now closed substantially all the asset sales contemplated in our plan. We have raised our expected development spend to reflect the recent land acquisitions and we may revisit the bond market later this year. As you update your earnings models and begin to roll forward 2019, please keep in mind that we expect to adopt the new lease accounting standard on January 1 of next year. From a lessee accounting perspective, those situations where Digital Realty is the tenant, such as for corporate office space and for data centers we operate subject to a leasehold, the primary impact is that we will be required to recognize a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on our balance sheet. We do not expect this to have an outsized impact on us given that we own substantially all of our real estate. And we expect to gross up the balance sheet somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 million to $800 million. From a lessor accounting perspective, where Digital Realty is the landlord, the primary impact is the indirect leasing compensation costs will no longer be capitalized and will be expensed going forward. If we had adopted the new lease accounting standard on January 1 of this year, we estimate it would have lowered 2018 core FFO per share by $0.15 to $0.20, which should give you a good baseline as you begin to frame the impact on our 2019 estimates. The irony is while these accounting changes will be dilutive to our reported earnings, they'll actually be accretive to the returns on our development projects since cost that were previously capitalized to our basis in that development project will now run through the P&L going forward. At the end of the day, there is no change to the underlying economics or to our cash flows. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 11. Over the past several months, the digital team has consistently executed on our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options, while minimizing the related cost. In mid-June, we raised $650 million of 10-year U.S. dollar bonds at a 4.45% coupon. In late August, our in-house team originated a $48 million 10-year secured CMBS mortgage loan at 4.3% for our joint venture property in Seattle; and in early September, we originated a $212 million five-year secured CMBS mortgage loan at 4.6% for our joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors. In late September, we executed a forward equity offering to fund the Ascenty acquisition and development CapEx needs, and we expect to receive approximately $1.1 billion of net proceeds when we settle the forward sale agreements. We also raised a $725 million private capital commitment from Brookfield, a leading global asset manager. In early October, we opportunistically accessed the sterling bond market raising $520 million of 12-year paper at a 3.75% coupon. And finally earlier this afternoon we announced the refinancing of our $3.3 billion global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing for the line of credit by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by three years and upsize the availability by $350 million. In the process, we also completed a roughly $300 million five-year revolving credit facility denominated in Japanese yen to fund our joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. The global credit facilities were well oversubscribed and we would like to thank our entire bank group for their support. The success of these collective financing activities over the past several months is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers, and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As I mentioned a moment ago, we may revisit the Euro bond market later this year consistent with our strategy of actively managing the right side of our balance sheet, with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. As you can see from the pro forma maturity schedule on page 12, the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity to six years, and our weighted average coupon is 3.6%. Net debt to EBITDA remained in line at 5.2 times as of the end of the third quarter and fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.1 times. Roughly 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 85% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and nearly 100% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 12, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : My pleasure, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael J. Funk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Thank you for taking the question tonight. One quick one to begin. So, earlier today there was some commentary on pricing trends in Northern Virginia and the impact that the negative pricing from that perspective is having on project yields. So hoping that you as a dominant operator in that market, maybe add your perspective and the expected returns that you're seeing in that marketplace? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Michael. Look I'm not going to speak for the returns that our competitors are earning, but our experience over the last couple quarters is that rents have been flat. And that includes some 20 plus megawatt deals that we've done in each of the last two quarters. I mean just something to keep in mind, we hear a lot about demand in other parts of the world particularly Europe, but year-to-date absorption in Northern Virginia is more than two times the absorption in the rest of Europe combined. So look I mean global scale really matters. It's part of our differentiated product offering, and we can and do provide the opportunities for our customers around the world. But I think the ability to satisfy their needs to both land and expand in Northern Virginia currently on both of our campuses the legacy DuPont campus and the new Digital campus we're building out is absolutely critical. And the Dulles land that we just acquired is a clear reflection of our real estate heritage, our DNA and we view that as a critical piece of our supply chain going forward and our ability to continue to support our customer base. So, I mean, the bottom line is Northern Virginia is a competitive market. But the current market dynamics we believe play to our strengths and enable us to achieve very attractive risk adjusted returns. Michael J. Funk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm going to just follow with one more quick one. I know, you've maintained the guidance for a slight pressure on the rental rates and renewals for the full year and I heard your commentary about still cycling through some of the larger DFT deals, but thinking about fourth quarter and what we've seen year-to-date there, it seems to imply that you're expecting maybe to put at least one of those deals behind you in the fourth quarter, is that the correct read? And what kind of visibility do you have on those larger renewals from the legacy DFT? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Michael. It's \u2013 this is Andy. I would say, listen, the timing of when any particular renewal gets done and over the finish line is always tricky to map to a quarter because the \u2013 our customers obviously don't necessarily march to that same cadence. Based on I'd say some advanced dialogue we've had with few of our larger customers that have a handful of renewals coming up in the next several quarters and years, I think our estimation is that we may get a few of the larger ones done in the fourth quarter hence we have a little bit of more cautious view to the mark-to-market, which has been year-to-date positive 2.5% on cash basis and I think close to 5.5% or so on a GAAP basis, hence the slightly negative on our full-year guidance table. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. So I want to just touch base on something of a little bit of a disconnect, obviously fundamentals, leasing, very robust. The equity markets not so much as it relates to data centers or at least it doesn't appear to be fully reflecting the success you guys have had this year in your stock price. So, I'm curious how do you tweak the capital allocation model for a rising interest rate environment given the capital intense business model like yours? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So, Jordan, I think there are a couple of things. First of all, we continue to work to drive down our build costs. We've been quite successful with that. But basically, the bigger the building the more you can build, the lower you can drive your per unit costs. And for example in Northern Virginia, are building out which is you know almost 100 megawatts, it's 96 megawatts. That's up and it's basically leased, it is leased. And we've built that in less than a year. And so it clearly allows you to drive your unit cost down. The other part of that and somewhat related is our vendor management initiative, which \u2013 through which we lock in our vendors on three-year deals with fixed price contracts and that too particularly if there's some inflationary pressure, you know, it helps us keep our costs in line. Because of our scale we're able to buy both equipment and power in significant bulk. And similarly with land and we bought over 400 acres of land there next to Dulles Airport at I'd say less than half the market cost per acre. And I'd say the final piece of this in terms of how to function in a rising rate environment as it relates to the balance sheet and it's just \u2013 I'd say it's basic real estate fundamentals where you extend your debt. We just did a 12-year sterling deal, you fix your rates and you make sure you have plenty of liquidity and we just announced the refinancing of our revolver, booking upsize and reduced pricing. So I guess, what I'd say is as competition intensifies it's important that we continue to exploit our competitive advantages. Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: That's fair. Just as a follow-up you took down and you mentioned the incremental land here in Northern Virginia in the quarter anywhere else where you see the need to backfill inventory in terms of land in a significant way? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Yeah, no, absolutely. So, and I think, we announced Sydney in this earnings release; we're looking at a couple of other markets in Asia, as well as Europe where we're going to be adding land. I think we're in pretty good shape in the U.S. Operator : Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please ahead. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Yeah, thank you. So couple of questions on international. So in Brazil, the sizes of those deployments are, they seemed a bit modest given the size of the opportunity and essentially leadership position in that market. And so I'm wondering when do you anticipate that the deal sizes might get larger in Brazil as they have directionally in Australia, Europe and U.S.? And then elsewhere in the region, I'm curious about just any updated thoughts on Mexico and (35:24) and other assets around there and how that might fit into your strategy. And then finally, if you could update us on the Japan joint venture and where things stand there? Thank you. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Jon, this is Andy. I'll tackle the second \u2013 excuse me, I'll tackle the first of, I think, three in here, and I'll toss it to Bill, and he can toss it back to me if he likes. So first on the deal sizes, as we mentioned, a bit of a bring down since we announced the Ascenty transaction we signed, an incremental \u2013 or I shouldn't say we signed, the Ascenty team has signed an incremental 3.6 megawatts to two different customers, which speaks to your point that these are top cloud, global cloud service providers buying in the, call it, less than 3.6 megawatts a turn sizing, and that's consistent with their track record for certainly the last 12 months. I think that is very much comparable to their stages of growth for those similar customer profiles here in North America or Europe or Asia, for that matter, going several years back, and we're aware of the fact that the Ascenty team has been in dialogue with several of those customers in taking on certainly larger takes. So we expect, similar to migrations, in terms of size of capacity that the deal sizes will grow. We're quite pleased that the Ascenty platform and team has landed the initial cloud on ramp and compute nodes, and our hit track record is where these customers typically land is where they expand. So we're quite optimistic on that. Maybe I'll hand it over to Bill to talk about Mexico and the other markets, Jonathan Atkin. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Jon, relative to other markets in Latin America, entry there will very much be driven in response to customer demand. We are in close dialogue with almost all of our top cloud customers, as you might imagine. And the extent to which we enter new markets will be driven by what we hear from them. So we're not going to embark upon a build it and they will come strategy as it relates to new markets. It will be very much driven by specific orders, if you will, from key customers. I think it's suffice to say though, there's a high likelihood that we'd enter at least one new market within the next 12 months down there based on what we're hearing. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: And then lastly, Jonathan, I think you had asked about also an update on our joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation Japan. I would say things are going very well on that front. Last quarter we announced a strategic win with a top cloud service provider into the Tokyo asset. The capacity is coming online also in Osaka. I think subsequent to quarter end, we'll announce a new win with a top five cloud service provider on that new campus, and then we have a pretty long runway of growth on that campus and I have seen a substantial amount of customer inquiry. And I'd probably add Tokyo back to the list of locations where we'll be looking to continue to procure additional WAN capacity. Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you, two if I may. First off on Ascenty, that deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. So I was hoping, Andy, you can remind us just how we should be thinking about landing that into our models to get to that 2% dilution, including the equity raise, which was a forward deal. How should we assume that that actually starts to flow into the actual income statement? And then as it relates to expansion, just piling on the last question, I think the market that Ascenty's talked about potentially going into is Chile. So I assume that that's the market within the next 12 months that you just referenced, but I just wanted to confirm that. And then also just wondering what your interest is in markets like Africa as well as others such as India and so forth. Thank you. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Colby. So you're correct, closing in the fourth quarter, our estimated timing is probably call it late November-ish. And obviously in conjunction with that we'll close on a portion of the equity offering to fund our share into that venture. We've obviously not given out 2019 guidance just yet given we're standing on the third quarter earnings call, and we'll be happy to give you components of the model for 2019 guidance when the full company guidance comes out. I think the best that I can give you is about 2% dilution in 2019, ultimately then becoming accretive by 2021, a good chunk of that dilution due to the fact that we are mitigating risk through a non-recourse secured debt financing that carries an interest rate double the Digital Realty interest rate. So forgoing that near-term FFO, and this is really a risk mitigating strategy, and we obviously have the financing components, be it the cost of debt and the amount of shares, so I bet you could back into the amount of EBITDA using the three numbers. Maybe I'll toss it back to Bill for thoughts on some of these other international markets. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: So, Colby, I gather you're looking for confirmation on whether or not Chile is the next entry point down there. Just keep in mind that when we enter a new market, we have a very rigorous process we go through here looking at the political risk, economic risk, currency risk, and everything that you expect. And at the end of the day, it goes to our board for approval. So I don't want to jump ahead of our board with respect to which new market we could enter next or the next one after that. Relative to Africa, I know you're referring to a specific opportunity there that's in the market, and you can assume that we see everything just because of our size and our history. Again, whether or not we act is really a function of a lot of factors, and that includes how comfortable we are with the risk factors associated with that market and the opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Thanks very much. Good evening. Bill, you talked a lot about the pipeline last quarter. Can you just update us in the various regions how the pipeline looks today, and then any changes in the cost of construction or other inflationary pressures given what we're seeing in the broader economy? Thanks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: We actually have Chris Sharp here in the room, who runs design. And he might be able to speak to construction, given an opportunity to speak, and then we'll turn it over to Andy to talk about the pipeline. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thanks, Simon. So just before we get to fourth quarter, maybe to recap on third quarter, we had a second best in the company's history $69 million total bookings. I would say it was robust and diverse, which is a great thing. We had a market step up in our colo and connectivity signings on a global basis, which included a few multi-market signings, really leveraging the power of the platform. We had a step up in North America colo, and interconnection by itself as well as EMEA and broad-based regional demand with key wins in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America, not only the dominant Ashburn market, but also in Chicago and Dallas, which was great to see. Turning to the back half of the year, the last quarter of the year and on to 2019, I think we're seeing a continuation of similar trends on the global accounts. We see the same customers where we've had success in the past continue to build out their footprints where they've previously landed with Digital Realty, and at the same time in active dialogue on some new market locations. Within the enterprise and network sector, this whole past quarter we had 48 new logos, call it 20%-plus step up from prior quarters, just a smidge below prior peaks on new logos, plus another eight new logos we landed through some of our P&A channels. So I think we're charting towards another strong colo interconnect quarter as well across the board driven by some pickup in the enterprise demand, as well as some new names within our network vertical. We're actually aligning some of the legacy network providers and some newer fiber and other over-the-top network providers. Chris, do you want to tackle the construction piece? Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Absolutely, thank you, Andy. So, Simon, great question and it was alluded to earlier by Bill with the fact that we have an industry-leading global supply chain and a part of that is a key element is the VMI program, Bill had walked through. But that VMI program is definitely something that's allowed us to really maintain a relatively the same cost in the same delivery timelines that we have for the last couple of quarters. I'm also trying to emphasize the fact that with the way that we've been building in larger chunks and being able to establish a longer term relationship with a lot of the local construction teams and keeping them on jobs for a longer period of time, have been able to also alleviate any kind of spikes or mishaps in any of the construction projects that we have coming online in the market today. But I'd also emphasize the fact that this is something that Digital has been doing for some time now and we have alluded to the real estate heritage of Digital Realty. I would also allude to the heritage of being a construction company that's operated in more markets around the world than a lot of our competitors. So that has provided us a very phenomenal opportunity to kind of consistently deliver our product offerings and some of the most economical elements possible to our customer base and meeting the stringent timelines that we're seeing from a lot of these larger and smaller customer base that's coming into our asset class. So I would say the short answer is, we don't see any spikes today and we've really locked in a lot of the variability and we continue to deliver I think an industry leading price point to the market today. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Do you have any way of quantifying the GAAP sales in your price, your cost per megawatt versus maybe some of these private equity new builds? Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: That's a great question. It depends on the market. There are so many variabilities. We can't really go into an apples-to-apples comparison, but I would tell you just some of the new money coming into the market, I don't think they really realize the stringent nature of giving power to the facility and securing the right resources and because of the competitive dynamic that exists in the market today, I would tell you that the talent that is required to build out these facilities is becoming extremely scarce. And that's why we continue to secure long-term contract with the appropriate people to do the very complex installs and builds. And that's why I tell you, it's really hard to place a simplistic model against their money coming in, but there are a lot of pitfalls out there that we've seen certain providers \u2013 with PE providers and even existing providers fall into on getting that power, getting those resources allocated. And then also the last piece that we've talked about a couple of times the supply chain, right. Making sure you have the available infrastructure and inventory to hit those timelines. And you know we've been able to achieve some industry leading timelines on delivery of shells, delivery of data hauls and just a full fit out. But I would tell you it's hard to give you any specifics, but we definitely are very pleased with some of the teams that we've had in the field for some time now. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That was close, it's Michael Bilerman. So first question, I don't know if Bill or Andy want to take it. If you think about the Ascenty transaction, you talked a lot about how about how strategic it was. You know at the end of the day the deal was going to be somewhat dilutive to 2019 and 2020, given that there's a lot of development that has to be leased up in that portfolio, but you also talked about how it would accelerate your long-term growth profile. How should investors think about you doing other deals like this that could take down current growth for the potential of growth going forward and perhaps within that context, quantify a little bit how much you think this deal adds to your growth profile on a standalone basis? Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Michael. This is Andy. I'll maybe start off and Bill and Chris can chime in. I think what we found here was a quite unique and somewhat unusual opportunity to enter a market and essentially step into a dominant market leading position, 30% plus market share, where the next competitor is close to a third in terms of size. So far ahead already landed the initial critical compute nodes in network on ramps for the top and largest buyers of what we offer and essentially have this dominant position to deploy incremental capital to support our customers' growth. Now what's unique about that with it was that close to half of the contractual revenue was associated with a project where the building is being constructed. So there's certainly timelines that these projects need to be delivered and contracts need to commence. And the other unique aspect, which I touched upon earlier is the fact that we went into this with a risk mitigation approach not only by choosing Brookfield as equity partner given their experience in the region for close to 100 years and their massive investments in that region, but we also pursued a non-recourse piece of secured debt financing that covers the cost of debt that is double-digit rate. So, we actively diluted our earnings attributed to heavier coupon debt in order to mitigate risk. And I'd say while it's dilutive to our core FFO and AFFO per share call it 2%, we see call it closer to 1% positive in 2021 and I would say that's on our fairly conservative underwriting really essentially building out the capacity that team in hand has today. And when in reality I think this platform is going to grow not only in Brazil onto the option land they have, but also in other parts of the South America as our platform. I don't think there's a lot of other opportunities that I've seen there in my career inside or outside the data center space or opportunities that I see out there today that really line up like that, like there's another one of these out there, but maybe Bill can chime in a little bit. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: I think this is unique. Mike, this is in some ways a giant construction project, development project with the type of growth return \u2013 returns growth which we expect over multi-year period. So, you know while we've talked about unlevered returns that are in the high teens on these development projects, you know the EBITDA growth that I've seen in the underwriting, year one was 50%, year two about 35%. So obviously that's off a low base, but that's certainly accretive to our growth rates on standalone basis. Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. Second question and this goes back to the minimal lease spreads that you're getting, and I recognize there is some legacy leases that are in there. But overall, the lease spreads are largely uninspiring. And when you think about the two real estate sectors that both have the secular demand trends, industrial and data centers, both have a lot of development going on. A lot of demand for space, industrial is seeing rent spreads in the 20% to 30% range, and the data centers are not seeing much at all. And, I want to know if you guys step back from just a real estate perspective, what is the factor overall because both of these sectors have a lot of supply that supply is being taken up. There's a lot of demand for the assets themselves and there's a lot of institutional capital that's being attracted to the space. So, why do you think the fundamental trends within the data centers are not as strong as they are sort of within industrial? A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Mike, I guess my observation and we're not nearly as versed in industrial space as our neighbors at ProLogis, so they can give you maybe they \u2013 good thing to ask their view on the same question. But my understanding on industrial space is, it's an asset class that did not have rent growth for a fairly long time. And now a little bit more on the heels of some of the technology trends and the reorganization of the supply chain, you have these fairly attractive rental rate growth and ultimately releasing spreads. Our space certainly not been as long as it's been around as long as industrial space, really has it's a composite of leases that had called it 5 year, 10 year, 15 year leases with 2% to 3% bumps for a long time. And look, I agree with you, what is surprising you're not seeing much more aggressive cash mark-to-market. They're not, I won't say they're 2.5% year-to-date cash mark-to-market is not nothing, it's still decent. I think what you're seeing with our space is a different kind of cycle relative to the in-place leases relative to some of the industrial leases. And I also think what's a little bit different about our asset class and our platform is, and we mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we try to utilize our competitive advantages when we have renewals with a customer like the one I mentioned, at one of our Chicago campuses, we're happy to take a less aggressive posture in that negotiation in order to either contractually tie-up at the same time or to have a happy customer that wants to grow with us. In that example, we renewed a less than 0.5 megawatt deal for the negative cash mark-to-market, but at the same time, we grew them at that same location where they were currently and also at a rough growth campus a total of 3 megawatts across both locations. So it's kind of a win-win, where you look at that just the renewal by itself and you would come away looking fairly negative. But I can tell you economically it was an attractive value proposition for Digital, and I think was attractive for the customer because they were able to enjoy the benefits of our platform. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Revisiting the pipeline, but I'm focused more on the hyperscale part of the pipeline. So, you've had two back to back very strong quarters with some large deals at both times, and I was wondering on that aspect of the pipeline are you seeing it really replenished or stable or is that part sort of trying to taking a pause. Secondly, similar question on a broader scale, I'd say that the Northern Virginia market absorbed like 168 megawatts in the first half probably eight times the next biggest market in North America. So the same question really on a broader not Digital specific basis, do you think this pace continues the next quarter or the next few quarters or does it take a pause, which is a more rational view. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Hey, Rob, thanks for the question. So on the hyperscale platform to have two quarters in a row with 20 plus megawatt deals is fantastic. I can't tell you that I'm confident there's going to be definitely another one in the fourth quarter. At the same time, looking at the pipeline, we're in numerous active dialogues with customers in numerous markets around the globe supporting their growth and they're in all shapes and sizes, but when you get into the hyperscale arena with these customers, be it top five health service providers or other customers with similar profiles, the deals do tend to be larger. And I think, we \u2013 based on what we're seeing, we think there's going to be continuation of these customers growing and rolling out their infrastructures, not only in North America, but in all other markets as well. Turning to your Ashburn comments, so we've \u2013 I think we've averaged or we've done about 100 megawatts of leasing in Ashburn over the last four quarters or so. And obviously, based on the fact that we bought, I believe, the largest non-contiguous land capacity in megawatts was recently Ashburn. I think we're big believers in the continued growth of this market. I think, we have conviction around it based on a large and growing installed base of customers who keep coming back to us for the second, third and fourth takes and new customers who are coming in the market. When you get to these large numbers, you never know what quarter, you're not going to have another record for that market. But I think I very much like our value propositions for any customer looking to tour Ashburn because it's not just an Ashburn location. And I think we got \u2013 it's a conversation about the whole Digital Realty platform. I think we have a lot of other competitive advantages relative to other peers in the market. Chris, do you want to add anything on either of those? Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Absolutely. Thanks, Andy. You had highlighted this earlier, Andy, about proximity. And I think that's something that you have to look at, particularly in that market where we have these immense data lakes or immense set of infrastructure that's already deployed there. So that's why we're looking at this longer-term contiguous land where you have availability of power in a very proximate location. And there's a bunch of benefits that are afforded to a lot of our top customers and being able to provide them that. And so that's one element of why we see it growing within that market. And in particular, we're also seeing the fact that there are so many new applications coming to market. And we highlighted this at our Investor Day, where we talked about the second generation of cloud and the next wave of cloud infrastructure. So any of the AI or any of the new blockchain and any of the new technologies coming out, Ashburn is a critical epicenter to be able to leverage the existing data to support these new services. So they're not standalone silos, they need a consistent set of infrastructure to efficiently launch them at the global scale needed. But that's why we believe very strongly in the Ashburn market. Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thank you. My question pertains to interconnection revenue growth that is decelerating on a year-on-year basis consistently through year-to-date 2018. And on the interconnection signings it looks like you were flat quarter on quarter, and I just wanted to get a better understanding of the dynamics that are at play here. Is it because wholesale is just predominantly taking off and diluting out the effects of interconnection? And do you anticipate a complete swing the other way around, maybe in about a year or two years' time, regarding the interconnection business? Is there a scenario where this accelerates? Maybe you can give us some color on that, especially as it pertains to some of these new applications you just mentioned in the prior question. Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Sami. I'll talk a little bit about the most recent trends in both the interconnection revenue recognized through the P&L and also signings, where we think both are going, and then I'll ask Chris to chime in about applications and the implications from the applications. So obviously we had somewhat muted year-over-year growth in the P&L from the interconnection revenue, closer to mid-single-digits. I'm certainly not pleased where we think that product offer can go. We are \u2013 I would say a little bit in the results, you saw a little bit of headlines from some of the M&A consolidation on the telco space, where those buyers are just not as demonstrably large buyers of the interconnection offering when two of those companies have combined. And that trend has been playing out in the M&A world for a while and now starting to flow through a little bit on the P&L. I would say I remain optimistic for the ensuing quarters or next year in getting that revenue line item to be getting closer to high single digits, if not double digits on the P&L. What gives me optimism is we have been putting up more solid signings quarters, about $8 million for the last couple quarters. The composition of those signings have been from \u2013 you can see some of these in anecdotes we put from the customer signings about multi-market, re-architecting the backbones, multi-sites where they need new interconnection. And also what gives me confidence is the new logo trends, which have been trending up quarter over quarter each quarter this year to 48 new logos plus the eight through our P&A channel. And as we've seen in prior experiences, when new logos land, they obviously take initial connectivity offering, but then they substantially grow their customers' connectivity profile in the high teens. So the new logo connecting within our ecosystem spurs incremental interconnection revenue. The composition of the locations, it's certainly been the dominant North America sites, including New York City markets, Chicago, Atlanta, and then London and Europe. And I think one thing that's been a pretty good uplift is actually we've seen a material pickup in our interconnection or connectivity bookings within Ashburn, which I'd say is on the heels of launching some fairly quite successful colocation and interconnection offerings in that market. I'm not sure if we're going to do our second or third part that it gets that off. And so all these things to me in my mind are going to drive incremental interconnection bookings. And maybe I'll let Chris speak to a little bit of the longer-term trends. Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Andy, and yeah, Sami, so I think you're very aware of the interconnection dynamics that exist out there, but one of the other elements I would highlight is just some of the new cloud on-ramps that are coming into our facility. So those have a bit of a lag in picking up and customers really starting to be able to leverage that new interconnect paradigm that's core to digital. And I would tell you that as the interconnection shifts to where the actual clouds reside, it's creating a brand new opportunity, where you probably hear a lot of people talk about a cloud-first world. One of the things we've often looked at is we have to provide a different type of interconnect model to meet these new application demands. And so I would tell you that with these on-ramps coming into our connected campus and getting set up to where they can leverage the broader markets, and these are enterprise customers and it's across all the verticals, but they can leverage our Service Exchange to start to seamlessly consume all of these major cloud services privately in a much more secure broader manner. I definitely see that picking up. And one of the things we've also referenced at a high level is just some of the newer cloud applications that we've brought onto the Service Exchange, where it's not just about your traditional IaaS infrastructure, it's about SaaS. And so with the recent announcement of our Salesforce.com capability and bringing that SFDC infrastructure online so you can consume it privately as well, it's definitely setting us apart and making more and more ecosystems represented inside of our Digital Realty campus so that customers can get value out of that. And so there's not a new application coming to market that doesn't have very dynamic interconnection requirements, but I would say the last high-level element I would leave you with is the most efficient supply chain wins. So the more you can directly connect to where the actual cloud and network nodes are or where those services reside, the better off your overall performance is going to be. And that's something that we've touted on previous calls and we talk a lot about is the fact that we've brought to market what we feel is a very unique offering with interconnected scale, which represents the best of both worlds for the cloud providers and the cloud consumers. And so that set us up for some future growth potential around our interconnection, and we look at that very positively over the next couple of quarters. Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it, thank you very much for that color. And then my next question is just on bookings visibility. And I really just want to get an idea. For example, after 2Q 2018 results, how much visibility into 3Q 2018 signings did you guys have? Would you say half of the potential bookings you had visibility on? I just want to get an understanding on how we could put confidence in a long-term model as far as the same amount of bookings generated. And maybe you can explain to us. Are the leasing conversations completely changing with your customers versus about three years ago regarding future pipeline? I just want to get a better feel on that. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Sami. So listen this is a \u2013 as I mentioned another robust and diverse and successful quarter on the signings, six of the last seven quarters now, over $50 million, and it was a short strength across the product offerings and sectors. If you look at the, call it $69 million of bookings that the colocation and interconnection piece of the pie, which was call it approaching $18 million that has much more of a monthly cadence to it. So obviously, we have an idea of pipeline but those deals move from upside to outlook and commit every month in a monthly close. So let's call it just a little bit less than a third of the signings. On the larger end on the bigger side including the 20-plus megawatt deal that work, and that deal started well before June 30. And it probably went on for a couple quarters. The tricky thing about that is, it's a large massive project and aligning contractually and with deliveries and operationally takes a lot of work and a very talented sales team, remember taking the lead on that one, but really supported by the entire Digital Realty organization to bring that over. And that could have signed on September 1 or September 30, there's no \u2013 nobody can control that the destiny of that deal. After that you got several in the call it 1 megawatts to 5 or so megawatts, and they're all on the different tracks with different customers and different markets. And then we also have a handful deals in the middle. So I think the key is maintaining a very large and diverse pipeline and making sure we are delivering for the customers, and try to bring, meet their timelines as fast as possible. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks. A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.: Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter. As outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers, delivering our second highest quarterly bookings on record. And our backlog reached another all-time high. We further extended our global platform with a definitive agreement to acquire Ascenty, the leading data center provider in the rapidly growing Brazilian market. We once again delivered solid current period financial results being in consensus by a $0.01 and we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth in AFFO per share again in 2018. Last but not least we further strengthened our balance sheet raising $1.1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth and refinancing our $3.3 billion of credit facilities to extend the weighted average maturity of our debt by a full year. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us and for your interest in the company and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in November. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Due to scheduling constraints, today's call will be limited to 1 hour. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call will be CEO Bill Stein and CFO Andy Power. The call may contain forward-looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  For a further discussion of risks related to our business see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.  Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our full year 2018 results. First, we delivered record bookings over one-third better than the previous all-time high. Next, we closed on the acquisition of Ascenty, expanding our global platform into Latin America and we further extended our sustainability leadership with continued expansion of our renewable energy capacity.  Third, we delivered 8% core FFO per share growth and we delivered double-digit growth in AFFO per share for the third time in the past four years. Last but not least, we further strengthen the balance sheet by recasting our line of credit and locking in long-term fixed rate debt at attractive coupons. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. William Stein : Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. We advanced each of these three pillars during the fourth quarter. We extended our global footprint with our entry into Latin America. In December, we closed the acquisition of Ascenty, the leading data center platform in the rapidly growing Brazilian market shown here on page three of our presentation. Ascenty owns a high quality portfolio of purpose built world class data centers as well as a proprietary fiber network and is run by a best in class management team. Over 90% of the revenue is generated from investment grade or equivalent customers and over 75% of contractual cash rent is denominated in U.S. dollars. This transaction represents a highly strategic extension of our global platform offers a compelling growth opportunity and will be accretive to our long-term growth. Our top priority is deepening connections with our customers. We are also focused on strengthening connections across our organization. We made several important investments in our human capital during the fourth quarter most notably including the appointment of Greg Wright as Chief Investment Officer and Corey Dyer as Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Greg joins us following a long and distinguished career in investment banking. And he served as lead advisor on several transformational transactions for Digital Realty. Corey brings over 25 years of relevant industry experience, including colocation and interconnection sales leadership experience successfully targeting the enterprise customer segment. With these key additions in place we have filled out the team and are fully primed to press our competitive advantages and power our customers\u2019 digital ambitions around the world. We also took several significant steps towards further extending our sustainability leadership over the past few months highlighted here on page four. In November, we received NAREIT\u2019s data center Leader in the Light Award for the second consecutive year. We are the first and so far the only data center REIT to receive NAREITs leader in the light award for sustainable real estate practices. In December, we announced that we earned the U.S. EPA\u2019s Energy Star certification for superior energy performance in 24 data centers in 2018. We also entered in an agreement with Salt River Project to source solar energy to power a portion of the load for our Arizona data center portfolio. In January we issued the first ever data center in Green Euro bond. And finally, just a couple of weeks ago we announced a long-term renewable power purchase agreement to secure 80 megawatts of solar power on behalf of Facebook to support their renewable energy goals. We are committed to managing our environmental impact in optimizing our use of energy and natural resources because we believe it's the right thing to do and because it matters to our customers.  Most of our top customers have 100% renewable energy targets and our ability to meet their needs for renewable and highly efficient data center solution sets us apart from our competitors. Let's turn to market fundamentals on page five. Moving from East to West with the sun data center demand remains robust across the Asia Pacific region, driven by local as well as global hyper scale users. In Japan, we recently announced a multi-megawatt multi-year agreement with a leading global cloud service provider to anchor the latest facility on our Osaka Connected campus scheduled for delivery the middle of this year. As you can see from the occupancy schedule in our supplemental we've also had significant activity in Singapore where we are quickly running out of capacity and recently announced the acquisition of a land parcel on a long-term ground lease to accommodate build out of our next facility at Liang drive on the east side of Singapore, scheduled for delivery the latter half of next year. The supply situation across the region remains largely in check. And given the robust demand backdrop, we expect to continue to invest to support our customers\u2019 growth in existing core markets as well as potentially in select new markets. In Europe, supply demand dynamics are fairly balanced. Despite the noise around Brexit, we continue to see healthy demand, notably including a sizable global cloud network node deployment in our Crawley Campus in London during the fourth quarter. At Sovereign House in the Docklands we are nearing capacity. And we recently gave the go ahead to break ground on a Cloud House, an adjacent multi-megawatt facility that will offer customers a unique ability to land a new colocation deployment directly adjacent to the city's network dense interconnection hub. Incidentally, we acquired the freehold interest in Sovereign House during the fourth quarter and we now own this iconic London Docklands asset outright. Across the UK as well as the Continent, pricing is competitive and customers remain focused on flexibility and expansion options along with differentiated connectivity solutions and a track record of operational excellence. Market vacancy remains in check across the major European markets, while competitors are bringing new supply to market it is being met by healthy demand, particularly from existing customers either expanding their current footprint or looking for new partnerships for their next phase of growth. In the Americas, competition is similarly intense across the primary data center metros, including Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active Metro in the world. Despite the number of competitors and shovels in the ground, we are well positioned to outperform the competition, given our ability to address the full spectrum of our customers data center needs around the world, our deep installed customer base in Ashburn with a strong preference to expand next to their existing deployments. The longest runway for customers\u2019 campus growth align with our agile delivery capabilities allowing for limited speculative risk. And last but certainly not least, the strength of our investment grade balance sheet. At the end of the day, we believe customers view our global platform, our operational and financial resiliency and our comprehensive space power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider. Let's turn to the macro environment on page six, we are late in the cycle and comps are getting tougher across corporate America. Tough comps and moderating growth are a far cry from a global recession however, as evidenced by continued robust job growth in the U.S. as well as the very respectable growth in cloud revenues during the fourth quarter. Hyperscale requirements are big and getting bigger so new business could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But we continue to see very healthy demand from our customers. The trends underlying this demand are long-term and secular in nature. People don't stop using personal or professional social media just because it's late in the cycle. In fact, corporate IT outsourcing and cloud adoption are significant drivers of our business. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a slowdown, cost containment and achieving efficiencies become paramount. Constantly given the resiliency of our industry, our business and our balance sheet, we believe we are very well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page eight. During the fourth quarter, we signed total bookings of $44 million, including a $7 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $37 million, with a weighted average lease term of nearly 10 years, including a $10 million colocation contribution. These results do not include an additional $18 million of previously disclosed bookings by the Ascenty during the fourth quarter.  Ascenty did not sign any deals during the last 10 days of the year after closing, but this volume of activity, particularly relative the size of the base should give you a good idea of why we are so excited about the growth potential for this platform. Our largest single deal during the fourth quarter was just 6 megawatts, and nearly 40% of our activity was outside of the U.S. Our domestic fourth quarter bookings were likewise diverse, with major contributors from the Bay Area, Houston, Dallas and Chicago markets. For the full year, we delivered total bookings of $268 million an all-time high and up 35% from the previous record of $199 million in the prior year. Colocation and interconnection bookings were flat year-over-year at $63 million, but third and fourth quarter results were both above the recent average. We continue to see the traction with accounts expanding with us globally, including a leading regional cloud provider, who expanded their footprint with us most recently in Singapore in the fourth quarter. We've helped this customer expand globally in the U.S., Europe and in Asia Pacific within the last 12 months. Another example is a global leading SaaS provider that we helped to expand into Japan through our Mitsubishi Corporation Digital Realty joint venture. Digital Realty is assisting this strategic partner in expanding their cloud presence in the region. They are in multiple sites across our global platform and this is their third deployment with us across APAC. One final example, I want to site illustrates our ability to help hyperscale our customers power their digital ambitions. One of the world's largest SaaS companies required a custom built data center. We signed the deal in Q1 and they commenced using the data center in Q4. Simply put, we were able to build and launch the first data haul for the customer within nine months. We're also pleased with our traction in the Enterprise segment. We are landing business from small, medium and large customers, who are positioned to grow with us. We added a total of more than 150 logos in 2018, more than half of which were enterprise customers and we signed a total of 868 contracts in 2018. Aarki rank the 19th fastest growing company in North America and number four in the Bay Area on 2018 Technology Fast 500 helps companies grow and re-engage their mobile users. Aarki is standardizing their global data center footprint with Digital Realty to ensure they have the scalable solutions around the world to meet their fast paced timelines, and support end user demand. Most recent colocation expansions were made across Ashburn and Amsterdam. Dialpad, who designed and developed cloud based platforms for enterprise communications is hosting their AI powered Cloud Phone System in Digital Realty Dallas and New York locations. We help build redundancy within the platform for our customer's end users. Dispatch Track, the number one last mile logistics platform that is currently being used by about 40% of all furniture and appliance deliveries that occur in the Continental United States has a unique requirement of owning its computer infrastructure with specialized hardware for its proprietary algorithms. After quite a bit of research Dispatch Track chose Digital Realty as a partner on this journey. Digital Realty\u2019s world class infrastructure, commitment to standards in terms of certifications and processes presence across wide geographic locations will help Dispatch Track scale their solution and service their current and future customers better. Dispatch track is looking forward to consolidating and scaling all of their existing hosted infrastructure at Digital Realty. We continue to see very healthy networks sector business. This quarter a noble win was without scale a strategic partner of Dassault Syst\u00e8mes at the forefront of cloud computing. Out Scale\u2019s primary focus is providing infrastructure services, hosted solutions and on premise private cloud as well as related to cloud based service like mapper as a service, rendering solutions, compute, storage and networking to many of the world's most respected companies. This new and much larger private cage environment for a longtime customer will enable Out Scale to grow and remain focused on their core competencies of providing secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure as a service solutions to over 800 of the world's top corporate customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We continue to see traction with our service exchange platform. Net gain, who helps highly regulated industries such as healthcare, financial and legal services manage their IT infrastructure needed to shorten connection provisions in time and minimize latency between net gain facilities.  We provide a centralized colocation facility for their hybrid cloud architecture to connect to local customers. They were able to connect to major telecom providers to maintain 10 millisecond or less latency between facilities leveraging service exchange for fast, secure access to Azure cloud services and provide a high availability environment for customer application hosting. Total alliance and channel partners related bookings continue to contribute to our business. And our channel partners sourced nearly 20% of new logos in 2018 and over 25% of new logos during the fourth quarter. Through our channel partner, we landed a Korean IT based marketing and advertising company with a mission to support bringing Korean lifestyle fashion and entertainment imports in our LA data center to support its digital advertising and cloud business.  They chose Digital Realty because they needed the right location with maximum uptime to support their mission critical infrastructure, flexibility to support their private and hybrid cloud environments, access to data center and cloud connectivity and certification compliance. Our continued partnership and capabilities with IBM around their Direct Link products resulted in more than a 200% year-over-year increase from our total deployments in 2017 and we are working on several opportunities for 2019. Significant 2018 deployments with IBM included adding new IBM block chain and IBM hyper protect deployments allowing IBM customers to deploy their infrastructure and leverage secure, direct low latency access to IBM cloud and these advanced services all within a highly connected ecosystem supported by -- globally by Digital Realty.  Turning to our backlog on page nine. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stepped down from the all-time high at the end of the third quarter to $97 million as of year-end, due to an all-time high level commencements during the fourth quarter. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements was a little over three months speaking to the diversity of our fourth quarter signings activity. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10, we signed $138 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was five years and cash was rents rolled down 2.6%. For the full year, cash rents rolled up 0.3% a bit better than our slightly negative guidance.  Cash re-leasing spreads were negative for Turnkey as well as colo renewals in the fourth quarter. The colo roll down was entirely due to two top customers who started out in a colo environment early in their life cycle and have grown so significantly that they are both now hyperscaler users. Our unique product offering with the ability to accommodate single rack colocation and interconnection footprint since all the way up to multi megawatt hyperscale requirements enables us to continue to support the full spectrum of data center solutions for both of these strategic customers.  The turnkey roll down was largely due to the expiration in Houston where a customer renewed their existing footprint on a long-term lease, while simultaneously expanding and taking close to another megawatt of additional capacity likewise, on a long-term lease. This transaction is a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. As you're probably aware, we expect cash re-leasing spreads will be negative in the high-single digits in 2019, primarily due to size of above market expirations within the legacy DFT portfolio, this roll down was fully baked into our underwriting at the time of the acquisition. As we work away past these pending renewals, we do expect to reach an inflection point and return to positive re-leasing spreads, driven by modest market rent growth and a steady progress. We have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance overall portfolio occupancy slipped 50 basis points to 89% due to a single non-data center customer who moved out of an entire Class B office building they were using as a call center on a campus earmarked for future redevelopment in Dallas. Needless to say, the square footage impact on reporter occupancy is far more pronounced than the economic impact given the low rent for a call center redevelopment candidate in Dallas. Property operating expenses picked up sequentially, primarily due to the timing of some repairs and maintenance projects we had expected to close out earlier in the year, along with the growth of our portfolio with more than 50 megawatts of capacity placed in service during the fourth quarter. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11, the U.S. dollar strengthened somewhat over the past 90 days and FX represented roughly a 50 basis points headwind to the year-over-year growth in our fourth quarter results. We manage currency risk by issuing locally to nominate debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy to matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have a 1% impact to our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up approximately 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and the full year. We were a couple of pennies above consensus for the fourth quarter and we came at the at the top end of our original guidance range for the full year. We also deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth for the third time in the past four years. As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating the 2019 guidance we rolled a few weeks ago. Almost all the drivers are unchanged except for debt financing. As you may know, just two days after we gave our initial 2019 guidelines the debt capital market seas parted across the pun and we're able to successfully tap the euro bond market for the first evergreen data center euro bond, raising approximately $1 billion of seven year paper at a 2.5% coupon. Our 2019 refinancing the capital spending needs have been put to bed, but we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year. And we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing and attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. Please keep in mind that our 2019 guidance includes a $0.20 impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. We don't typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but given the hit to the bottom line from the change in accounting policy it's worth noting that we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth in AFFO per share. Please also keep in mind, this mid-single digit growth includes the 2% dilution from Ascenty and also absorbs a 100 to 200 basis points FX headwind. Excluding FX and accounting changes, we expect to deliver per share growth in line with our long-term sweet spot in the mid to high-single digits. In terms of the quarterly distribution, the first half of 2019 should represent roughly 49% of the full year results. While the second half should contribute roughly 51%. In terms of the quarterly dividend that payout policy is ultimately a board level decision. Given the actual cash flow growth in 2018, along with the projected growth in 2019, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just so as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. It's been another busy few months for the Digital Realty capital markets team characterized by consistent execution against financing strategy on maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs.  First and foremost in late September, we executed a forwarded equity offering to fund the Ascenty acquisition and development CapEx needs. We expect to receive approximately $1.1 billion of net proceeds when we settle the forward sale agreements. In early October, we issued approximately $520 million of 12 year sterling bonds at a 3.75% coupon. In late October, we recast our $3.3 billion global senior unsecured credit facilities tightening pricing for the line of credit by 10 basis points, extending the maturity date another three years to 2024 and upsizing availability by $350 million. We also completed a roughly $300 million five year revolving credit facility denominated in Japanese yen define our joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. Shortly before year end, we closed on the Ascenty acquisition. The transaction was initially funded with $600 million of proceeds from a non-recourse five year secured term loan, $300 million of digital realty OP units and $1 billion of unsecured corporate borrowings. As you may recall, we expect to ultimately own Ascenty in a joint venture with Brookfield infrastructure, which we expect to close some time in the first quarter.  As you can see from the charts on page 13 leverages are artificially inflated at year end, since 100% of Ascenty debt is reflected on the balance sheet. Whereas our fourth quarter results include just a 10 day contribution from Ascenty. Pro forma for a full period contribution from Ascenty, the joint venture with Brookfield and the forward equity offering, leverage remains in line with our long-term target of approximately 5 times, while fixed charge coverage remains healthy at north of 4 times. The success of these collective financing activities over the past several months is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As I mentioned a moment ago, we've already addressed our 2019 refinancing and capital spending needs, but we will continue to monitor the global debt capital markets consistent with our strategy of proactively managing the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. As you can see from the pro forma maturity schedule on page 15 the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity to six years, and lowered our weighted average coupon to 3.6%. Nearly half our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a national FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S., roughly 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and over 95% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 15, we have a clear runway with less than $1 billion of maturities in any year until 2023 and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.  This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you and good afternoon. First, I'd like to see if you guys could drill down a little bit on the expectations of the pipeline as we -- and maybe level set us in terms of expectations for 2019. I know 2018 was a record year. We finished kind of on a dull note. I think a couple weeks ago you sounded a little bit optimistic at a recent conference and I'm just -- how should we be thinking about leasing volumes for 2019? Andrew Power : Hey thanks Jordan, this is Andy, I\u2019ll tackle that because I think you're referring to my most recent conference. Obviously we ended 2018 with what I would call very respectable quarter $44 million overall signings capping off a record year 35% year-over-year increase, which was a record -- on a record at $268 million. A lot of successes in there across regions be it in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America or markets specific and across product lines. And at the same time I think we entered 2019 with a similar amount of optimism on the overall demand backdrop. Bill, myself, Corey, Chris and the team we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with customers in just the first handful weeks of the year we hear a lot of positive feedback of what their demand profiles look like and then how we're really lining up in terms of our footprint and capabilities to be their trusted partner around the globe. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And so relative to 2018 you think 2018 was not necessarily an anomaly, sort of what it sounds like. Andrew Power : I would say listen, we sat this time in the beginning of 2018, I certainly didn\u2019t have the expectation that we're going to do 35% increase year-over-year and put record $268 million. But as we look at exiting 2018 and look at what's out in front of us in 2019 in terms of where we're seeing opportunities and we're overall honestly quite bringing on new inventory capacity such as the Osaka, Japan, Sydney Australia, our Frankfurt Hampshire and the London campuses, numerous colo footprints and then some of the usual names you've heard about North America be it Ashburn or otherwise I think we feel like we're pretty well positioned heading into this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. So kind of a related question just about overall hyperscale demand and how it benefits the data center sector. And you talked about having inventory in a lot of the key markets, but I'm wondering from a competitive standpoint how do you think about the mix of business that goes to unlisted players versus listed data center operators such as yourself. And then, maybe drill down on kind of sales given the hiring of Corey into the organization. Any kind of thoughts on channel strategy or any changes whatsoever contemplated in kind of your go to market approach. Thanks. William Stein : Hey, thanks, John. I guess, what I would say at least what I have observed is that the private guys win the business when at least Digital doesn\u2019t have inventory in the market. So it\u2019s a question of availability. And I do think that we are the preferred partner to most of the hyperscale players. Andrew Power : I\u2019d add-on for that for half a second for turning your second question, Jon. I think in addition to what we\u2019re seeing -- hearing from our customers very recently in terms of demand backdrop, I think we\u2019re also hearing a overall outlook of potential vendor consolidation where they want to do business with fewer parties over the long run really global organizations that can scale with them and meet their needs across numerous markets and product offerings, which we think we line up very well on. In terms of changes to go to market and the like, Corey and Greg, just started with us literally the first week of January. We had already pushed up our sales kick-off we had a great kick-off that first week and our team is out of the gates here running hard for 2019. I'm sure Corey, is going to be digging in here and look at the things as ways to improve and obviously has a deep background across colocation interconnection capabilities and really penetrating the enterprise customer base an area where we're always looking to step up our game. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. And then quickly on, there was an interconnect announcement related to Ashburn in Chicago that you put out a couple weeks ago. And wanted to maybe get your thoughts on that overall prospects for cross Connect growth as well as your SDN partnership with Megaport? Thanks. William Stein : No, absolutely. Thanks for the question John as always. So a couple elements to it. Yeah, the most recent announcement we just made inside of the Ashburn in Chicago markets are around expanding our internet exchange. And so, that was a lot of customer driven demand in those two markets. And because of the fact that, we have a comprehensive interconnection portfolio comprised of both the internet exchange and the service exchange, which meets a lot of our larger customer demands. I would tell you, the reasoning and why we went into Chicago in particular is the ownership of 350 East Cermak and how that building is becoming a bellwether of the broader workloads and interconnection requirements, and then associated Ashburn, that is the epicenter of where a lot of these clouds are building out. And so getting access to all of the networks via the IX was kind of the backdrop of why we were pushed into those markets. And just further solidifying the broader architectures that not only the hyperscalers are bringing to us, but also the enterprise. And so secondly to the partnership with Megaport, which is the underlying fabric on our service exchange. I mean, it's been a great partnership where it's really generated a lot of new revenue for us where it's -- we're having a different value based dialogue with a brand new ecosystem of enterprise customers coming in to consume cloud. And so it's an underpinning of our strategy going forward. And we've had a huge uptick in not only the dialogue, but also utilization of the platform. And so we're very happy with the outcome of that. And again, just to echo the sentiment of Andy and having Corey join the team were just getting focus on leveraging that even further in our dialogue so that we can represent the comprehensive portfolio that we have in these markets and all the inner connection capability that we have is really a unique differentiator for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Right. Thank you very much. Good evening. I think you referenced the opportunity to go into some new markets. Could you -- you've obviously been expanding a lot in some existing markets, particularly in Asia as well recently. Can you just talk about how we should think about that in 2019, and are you likely to do that organically developing new land or do you think M&A will be the path to get to get into those markets? And any updates on a few weeks of Ascenty under your belt any learnings that you've had since they've come onboard? Thanks. William Stein : Thanks, Simon. So I think as you know, we don't target slices of the geographic pie by region. We look to allocate capital where we see the best risk adjusted returns. We're always looking at potential markets and we want to be prepared if there are good opportunities, but our criteria just remind you is that we're customer led into major new markets and we're looking for appropriate risk adjusted returns in these new markets. I'll turn it over to Andy to handle the Ascenty question. Andrew Power : Simon, could you just repeat the Ascenty question, make sure I didn\u2019t miss it? Simon Flannery : Yes, you talked about the bookings, when you came on board, but just you\u2019ve had it for six or seven weeks just how is the integration going and any more color that you've had on the opportunity since you've taken control. Andrew Power : Great, thank you, Simon. So we closed I think the last week before the holidays, the 21st of December. We've had our first board meeting with the team, we've -- Brookfield has cleared it's our regulatory approvals and we're working towards finalizing their closing, which should happen in the next month or so. We've been out in front of customers on a joint basis and have had some really terrific feedback from existing customers of legacy Digital Realty, legacy Ascenty and crossover, we've really gotten going on the rules of engagement for the Digital Realty 100 plus sales reps. In terms of feeding demand into that region, and we're also doing some late work on the supply chain design, constructional operational capabilities to really try to bring that benefit to the Ascenty platform. Albeit it's been a fast and furious couple weeks under our ownership to-date, but so far so good and seeing some positive signs, but obviously have a lot more to report on this topic in another 90 days or so. Simon Flannery : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great, thank you. In your comments, prepared remarks you mentioned the renewal spreads, how they're going to be down in the high-single digits. This you should be the trough and I think you said you expect them to go back to positive in 2020 and beyond. Just tied up the pricing is it your sense that pricing is going to start to trough I mean pricing, if you look at it on a like-for-like basis seems like it's been coming down for the last few years. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you think we are because as I did notice, for example, in your returns, you're now getting to 9% to 12%, whereas you've historically guided to 10% to 12%. And then secondly, as it relates to bookings or leasing for 2019, I appreciate you don't want to give us a hard commitment on what that number could look like. But when you think about it from a geographical dispersion perspective, is it fair to assume that we should see a notable percentage coming from international in 2019 than in 2018? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Colby. Let me see if I can dissect the multi-pronged of that mixture tackle at all. So a couple concepts. So first on renewal spreads, we've -- we exited the year on a full year basis cash positive just slightly and a couple points of higher than on a GAAP basis. We called out some anomalies in the actual note that happened in the fourth quarter, but happy to expand upon those specific details. But cash positive for the full year and even greater that a gap positive we did call on our 2019 guidance released at the beginning of the year a cash negative mark-to-market really related primarily due to a large legacy customer we inherited in our acquisition of DFT. The outcome or underwriting of that event has not changed since our closing or initial acquisition. So same facts and circumstances just that timing looks like it's going to be coming fruition certainly in 2019. And beyond that plus I'd say another larger Power Base Building or PBB renewal that likely to get completed in the first quarter of 2019. We feel that we're kind of really working our way through the bulk of the larger customer bulk renewals including early renewals pushing out their maturities for 5, 7, 10 and 15 years. When you look at the next kind of top customers that have several of renewals in those customers have, I'd say a different, different either vintage of lease, one of those customers in fact typically only sign five year leases. So has not had a 10, 15 year run of bumps in their leases and much less chance to be way out of market. Hence our commentary, where we think the sensitive pickers moving to the pipe on here, when it comes to the expirations this year. Dovetailing to your overall -- that was renewal, so cash, upon cash upon expiration dovetailing to your question on pricing overall. If you look at our scale pricing, which I think is really more tied to that renewal comment. If we went market-by-market this quarter, I would say our scale pricing was really kind of flat to slightly up. Now, partly that is due to the overall mix in diversity of business. In North America, we were less concentrated with larger deals specifically in Ashburn and had more numerous wins in San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, and Chicago. But when you look apples to apples of signing in those same markets, and is close in terms of size. Those rates actually look flat to suddenly up. I think, I said in a earlier conference this year looking at Ashburn, for our third quarter signing where we did a lot of larger deals, our rates versus the prior 12 months were within like 100 basis points. So definitely speaking to a crescendo on the rates. Now, I'm not saying that there isn't a competitor that's going to throw in a low price out there, just to win a business. But I think we bring a lot to the table as Bill, mentioned with our global platform that\u2019s multi-product our installed and growing customer base that wants to expand with adjacency, longest runway for a growth in a competitive market like Ashburn and other things agile to supply chain and counterparty risk as well.  I think last but not least, you really are touching on development returns and also bookings compositions. I think if you look at our development cycle what you're seeing are two things. There's a concentration of our current products in the development project pipeline are larger deals 20, 25 megawatt deals, 10 to 15 year lease terms, AAA minus rated credit counter parties, triple net leases. Hence they're pushing those North America returns down closer to the nines. And then outside the U.S., which is becoming a much larger share of our new growth be it on that table you\u2019ll see it in Singapore, but also Osaka and the same thing over in Europe. The returns are a little lower, but you're also seeing those returns in an interest rate environment in those countries that is much, much lower than the U.S. And you could see that in the fact that we did seven year euro bonds two weeks ago at a 2.5% coupon. I think, I kind of hit them all there for you. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thanks. So maybe just want to focus again on Northern Virginia. There is a lot of capital coming into the major markets especially Northern Virginia, which is shaping a lot of the development. But what are your thoughts on the private companies making these major investments for plan data center space? And how that impacts the overall industry and general fears of potential oversupply? William Stein : Thanks, Erik. We've commented on this before. While there is a tremendous amount of supply obviously in Northern Virginia, there's an equal amount of demand, so absorption has been very strong. As I said earlier and Andy mentioned this too, if the hyperscale players have to choose between a private provider with whom they've done little to no business and Digital with whom they've done a substantial amount of business and they are also keen to bring their product to market as quickly as possible at least it\u2019s been our experience that they would prefer to do business with the provider that offers the shortest cycle for providing a product. So that has to do with both contract and reliable construction deliveries and knowing that the building is going to operate as expected. Erik Rasmussen : Great. And just maybe my follow up, kind of efficiencies in the past you talked about efficiencies in the various ways to control, bill cost to manage returns. But how much of those efficiencies can you still pull from? And are we coming towards the end where you may start to see some headwind because you don't have those same levers to pull. Thank you. William Stein : So I think our team has done an excellent job of bringing out the cost from data centers design. But I think you note correctly that we're approaching a level where it's going to be difficult to take out more costs without impacting residual value. I think we're fortunate and that we've established that our VMI or vendor managed inventory and program in place with most of our major suppliers. And what that means is we have three year contracts in place that lock in pricing for critical equipment like generators switch gear, UPS modules. And so, we haven't been affected by rising steel prices because of those programs. It's also I think important for you to keep in mind that we are still the only data center REIT with investment grade ratings from all the major rating agencies and that gives us a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. And finally, we've been able to derisk labor inflation by keeping our contractors on site. So to sum up we have the benefits of buying in bulk across a global sales funnel. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi. Two questions if I could. First, I noticed that you took out the goal for asset monetization relative to prior guidance tables. And I was wondering if you could size the potential for asset monetization and optimization of the portfolio and what kind of market is out there for the assets that would be up for consideration? And then just switching gears as you look at the hyperscale deployment that you've accommodated over the last couple of years, is there a way to quantify any magnetic effect those deployments are having to also get to additional enterprise bookings in a similar or nearby campus that either wanted to be close to the cloud or employ a hybrid cloud architecture? Thanks. Andrew Power : Hey. Thanks, Michael. I'll tackle the first question then I'll pass it over to Chris on the second one. So asset monetization still is really very much part of our DNA here. It's in our heritage, and I think you could see that by the fact that even on the portfolio optimization and capital recycling track for some time, I think we sold about $800 plus million of assets outright in the last handful of years. I'm pretty sure that's more than any other data center provider out there. And also we are big fans of having our fishing pool in all the different pools of capital, both public and private. And that includes outright or joint venture ownership. And we've deployed joint venture ownership across multiple formats. So I would say we look through our portfolio and try to find areas where we want to focus and defocus and also opportunities to further optimize our capital structure through the use of private capital. I think, you could expect us to continue to focus our investment in the major markets where we see additional runway for growth the Ashburn\u2019s and Santa Clara type markets or Dallas and Chicago\u2019s, in North America, the Frankfurt's, London's, Dublin's, Amsterdam's in Europe and Osaka, Tokyo, Singapore and Sydney in Australia and Asia. And I think we'll see less of a focus on some of those other markets in terms of where we put further dollars or continue to invest. And with -- I'd say now over 200 data centers almost entirely unencumbered, the majority of which own fee simple. I think we've got a credible amount of flexibility to optimize our portfolio efficiently track various forms of capital and to recycle capital when we find it appropriate. Chris, do you want to hit the hyperscale and overall echo system question? Chris Sharp : Yes, thanks Andy. Appreciate the question, Michael. So there's a couple elements to that. So it is somewhat hard to quantify. But still a lot of the industry research and papers out there are still indicating the fact that the enterprise 80 plus percent of that enterprises looking to achieve that hybrid multi cloud.  So one of the things we've often looked at, and we constantly track is not only the amount of uptake on the service exchange, which allows private connectivity to all of the major cloud providers on a very open platform, which we\u2019ve referenced in the past and at a couple of conferences where you have access to 109 cloud on ramps associated with that platform, which is very, demonstrably and allowing customers to efficiently achieve the hybrid connectivity or access to these hyperscale services. And then I'd say the other key indicator that we've been watching a lot is the proximity, right? And so allowing enterprises to deploy chasing point in Ashburn where you could be immersed in the largest cloud epicenter in the world is a major differentiator, which is why you see a lot of the construction and the build in the amount of infrastructure pipeline that we have in that market. Because it's just a key indicator of the amount of uptick that we have associated with that. I don't have any specific metrics on how to quantify the attach rate to that at this point in time, but that's something that we constantly track and are really putting in a very tight model to our sales team to ensure that they're having that dialogue with the enterprise customers that they know which clouds they're betting their business on.  And how easily and efficiently consume them either via the service exchange, which is private connectivity or which is unique to our connected campus. The proximity of being deployed right next door to it, which Andy had referenced in the script earlier with IBM, which is a very unique model where customers can be right next door to the actual cloud services they're consuming. So we see a lot of that uptick coming to the market and we see no ending sight for a lot of that hybrid multi-cloud architectures. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Guttman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Guttman : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about the state of power availability in Northern Virginia and whether or not that is any constraint on market growth there? And secondly, last year's the full year\u2019s leasing in North America was largely focused in Northern Virginia. I was wondering if when you're looking at the sales pipeline how does -- how did the rest of the markets look in U.S. versus a similar comparison the same time last year in terms of pipeline. William Stein : Thanks, Robert. I'll jump on the first question and I think Andy will pick up the second piece. But, as far as power availability in Northern Virginia one of the things that we often really start to look at is how we master plan the multiple campuses that we've built out there. And one of the key elements of that master plan is working with the local power providers and early on establishing a demand profile associated with not only what we have today, but where we're headed. And a part of that is investing and ensuring that we get the proper substations built inside of the market, which is very unique to digital and from our long heritage in building out these campuses to ensure that we don't run out of any power. So not only with the campuses that we have populated today, but the future expansion campuses we're already in deep dialogue with a lot of local utility providers to ensure that we have proper access and redundant access in these core markets even outside of Northern Virginia. So we see nothing impacting our ability to meet our customer demand with the master plan facilities that we have today and also the future expansion that we have in that market. And I'll hand it over to Andy for the second part. Andrew Power : Thanks, Rob. So I mean if you look back at the fourth quarter or -- and a little bit of 2018 in terms of North America composition, fourth quarter was really not about Ashburn at all for us it was much more diverse. So we had north of a megawatt size in the San Francisco property area, we had signings in Houston close to a megawatt, Dallas, also in Chicago. And if I also go back a handful of quarters, I can certainly recall other major signing in the Chicago market as well as on the Dallas campus. Now those signings obviously get a little bit round out when you do a 25 megawatt deal in any given quarter. But it wasn't solely isolated to Ashburn or Northern Virginia. When I turn to looking at North America for 2019, I do think you'll still see a consistent demand for that Ashburn, Virginia robust demand market. But I think the conversations at Digital range a little more broadly all the way up into our newest delivery Toronto campus also out to some Santa Clara discussions. I know there has been some activity growing on our Richardson campus in Dallas. And then a market that's been a little bit of a sleeper going back a year or two is the New York City metro or northern New Jersey market where we've seen a pickup in financial services related demand on a few locations in that market. So definitely seeing the demand spread out a little bit to more pockets within North America portfolio in 2019 it feels like that it did in prior years. And going back, I apologize, I think I skipped one of Colby\u2019s questions ask about outlook for 2019 international versus non-international. Obviously we have the Ascenty portfolio, which is going to be go from count zero towards our $268 million record signings in 2018 and be a part of the picture in 2019. But putting that aside and really comparing apples to apples when I look at the inventory backdrop be it our campuses in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London. Some of the enterprise customer demand we're seeing in Dublin are new announcements, which we had in Sydney, Australia in terms of new deliveries and also in Osaka, Japan. I think what -- in the last year or two it was probably more of a 75% to 80% signings in North America and remainder outside of the U.S. or North America. I think you could see that complexion should become much more global. And I can tell you that was a major theme as we kicked off the year from a strategy to really kind of speak selling to our strengths of the global multi-product platform. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein, for any closing remarks. William Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our 2018 highlights, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers delivering record bookings of $268 million, a 35% increase from the previous all-time high the prior year. We further expanded our global platform with our entry into Latin America. And we further extended our sustainability leadership with the addition of 90 megawatts of renewable energy capacity. We delivered 8% growth in FFO per share at the top end of our original guidance, and we delivered double-digit growth in AFFO per share setting the stage for continued growth in our dividend. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising $1.1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth, refinancing our $3.3 billion credit facilities and issuing over $1 billion of long-term investment grade corporate bonds at very attractive coupons. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in March. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will end approximately after 60 minutes. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein, and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright, and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First and foremost, we continued to support our customers' global expansion requirements with an agreement to anchor development of a new campus in Santiago, Chile. Next, we demonstrated our commitment to deliver a sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises, renewable energy procurement and corporate governance enhancements. Third, we raised the dividend by 7%, our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet, redeeming high coupon debt and preferred stock, lowering our weighted average coupon by 30 basis points while simultaneously extending our weighted average duration by more than half a year with the opportunistic issuance of $1.6 billion of long-term capital. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. William Stein : Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. During the first quarter of 2019, the Digital Realty team continued to effectively press our competitive advantages. We capitalized on the strength of our comprehensive multiproduct offering by capturing healthy enterprise demand across multiple regions. We also advanced our private capital initiative by closing our joint venture with Brookfield and we further strengthened our balance sheet by locking in fixed rate long-term capital at attractive coupons. We continued to build upon our industry-leading commitment to sustainability and sound corporate governance, setting the stage for sustainable growth for all stakeholders. We further expanded our global platform with strategic land purchases in Tokyo and Singapore, as shown here on Page 3 of our presentation, and finally, we announced earlier this afternoon that we are entering Chile, Digital Realty's 14th country, with a 6-megawatt facility underway slated for delivery in the third quarter of 2020. Our strategy for new market entry is to follow our customers, and Chile is no exception. We are pleased to be supporting the growth of a leading global cloud provider who will be anchoring the first phase of our campus in Santiago. Chile is one of the most economically and politically stable countries in South America and is considered a high-income economy by the World Bank with a clearly quantified business-friendly investment climate and the highest per capita GDP in Latin America. Our Chilean operations will be conducted by the Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, our exclusive vehicle for data center investment in South America. It's obviously still early days since we just closed on the acquisition of Ascenty in December and the joint venture with Brookfield at the tail end of the first quarter, but and we are encouraged by our partnership with Brookfield, the early execution by the Ascenty team and the compelling growth opportunity within the region. We also continued to advance our ESG priorities over the past few months, highlighted here on Page 4. In January, we issued the first-ever data center green euro bond. Late January, we announced a long-term renewable power purchase agreement to secure 80 megawatts of solar power on behalf of Facebook to support their renewable energy goals. In late February, our Board of Directors submitted our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director-candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. Finally, our Board also approved a proxy access standard for stockholders in late February. We are committed to sustainability and sound corporate governance principles and we are focused on delivering sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees. Let's turn to market fundamentals on Page 5. As most of you are aware, 2018 was a record year for data center net absorption and the primary metros across North America are still in digestion and restocking mode. To provide some context, North America represents approximately 80% of our total revenue and was responsible for 75% of our 2018 leasing activity, but only half of our current availability is located in North America. The same dynamic is true in [states] for Northern Virginia, our largest market at over 20% of total revenue. It accounted for 40% of our 2018 bookings, but less than 15% of our current availability. We expect to see a pickup in North America data center absorption in the second half of the year as data center providers restocking their shelves with inventory coincides with the next phase of hyperscale users' incremental growth requirements, taking adjacency next to existing applications and continuous runway for growth on our campuses. In Europe, recent leasing activity has been dominated by global cloud service providers who continue to sign expansions throughout the major metros. Data privacy and sovereignty rules are driving a distributed architecture, forcing cloud providers to establish a presence in all the major metros. So these expansions generally come in smaller increments than the hyperscale deployments in North America. Last year was likewise a record year for absorption in Europe with leading cloud providers deploying multiple megawatts across major metros. These cloud providers also exhibit a clear preference for expanding adjacent to existing deployments. So landing the initial deployment is key. Our Global Connected Campus strategy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this consumption pattern. Across the Asia Pacific regions, supply remains largely in check. The complexity of local regulatory frameworks, the difficulty of procuring power and the limited availability of sites with adequate connectivity all serve to limit competition. Demand is outpacing supply in several of our key APAC markets, notably, Singapore, Tokyo and Osaka. This is translating into solid execution and pipeline targeting our near and medium term available inventory in these markets, setting us up for attractive backdrop as we bring adjacent capacity online at our Singapore and Osaka campuses, in addition to our recently announced Tokyo campus development project. At the macro level, the Asia Pacific region is still likely in the very early stages of its communications infrastructure build-out, and we see a significant runway for growth for years to come. Finally, our pipeline of existing customer expansion and new customer opportunities is growing in both Brazil and now Chile, where we are the market-leading data center provider. On balance, we believe customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. Global economic expansion remains intact. The U.S. unemployment claims recently dipped below 200,000. Interbanks the world over have adopted a dovish stance and the risk of a full-blown trade war appears to be receding. As you've heard me say many times before, we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. The hyperscale data center customers who drove outsized demand in 2018 marched to the beat of their own drum. Although they have largely remained in digestion mode in the early days of 2019, we remain highly confident in the longer-term trajectory of this demand. In addition, the resiliency of our business model enables us to capture robust and diverse demand from a broad swath of customer verticals across geographic regions around the world, as evidenced by our first quarter results. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business, I'd like to highlight a couple of the points on Page 7. According to Synergy Research, the total cloud market ecosystem passed the $250 billion revenue milestone in 2018, up 32% from the prior year. Separately, according to an IDC global study of 800 enterprise cloud users, 58% of respondents are now employing a hybrid cloud model, defined as using private and public resources for the same workload. Finally, an IDC study of 400 users of public cloud compute and storage services found that over 50% have recently moved the workload back on-premise. To effectively address the hybrid multi-cloud market, data center providers must offer a global interconnected solution from colocation to hyperscale. These trends obviously play directly to our strengths, help explain the durability of our recent results and bode very well for future demand cycles. Given the resiliency of our industry, our business and our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on Page 9. As Bill indicated, our first quarter results highlighted the durability of the Digital Realty global platform with balanced performance across the regions, product types and customer segments. We signed total bookings of $50 million, including $9 million from Ascenty, a $7 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $42 million with a weighted average lease term of 10 years, including a $7 million colocation contribution. 5 of our top 10 deals in the first quarter were outside the U.S., including several top customers who were able to leverage our global platform to enable their growth across regions. For example, this quarter, we enabled the expansion of a cloud infrastructure provider, that specializes in helping developers launch applications into the cloud, helping them better serve their customers on the West Coast as well as APAC. Within our global account segment, we landed 2 sizable deployments north and south of the border with a leading global cloud service provider. Separately, we also landed a network edge node from another leading global cloud service provider, which we expect will enhance the interconnection profile of our campus in Dallas, Texas. We continue to track healthy demand within our global account segment, but the cloud accounted for just 1/3 of our first quarter bookings, as shown on Page 11. On a majority of our new business during the quarter was with existing customers, we added 43 new logos, with a particularly strong contribution from our enterprise segment. For example, a well-funded software startup leveraging artificial intelligence to develop safe and reliable technology for autonomous vehicles selected a Digital Realty data center to help their production application and deliver their technology on a global scale. Afterpay is a global fintech provider based in Australia providing a \"buy now, pay later\" payment platform. Their proprietary decision-making engine determines creditworthiness of their retail customers in a near real-time on a global scale, and they are leveraging service exchanges from earning their gateways in the U.S. and in Europe to simplify, scale and improve the user experience. We continue to see traction from European-based organizations keen to partner with a data center provider able to facilitate their global growth well into the future. A multinational semiconductor and software design company headquartered in New York selected Digital Realty to provide a global data center strategy to support the transition of their business services as the decommissioned data centers and extend their business reach. In particular, the partnership will facilitate their ability to extend their presence into Singapore in support of their APAC initiatives. They will now be able to deliver a full global services capability supported by Digital Realty in each region of -- around the world. In addition, a British satellite telecommunications company is expanding with us in Europe to provide further colocation solutions for their London and Amsterdam operations. The solution underpins the infrastructure required to support the launch of their new satellite later this year and will provide high-speed broadband services to their customers. Channel partners continued to contribute to our business and comprised 15% of our first quarter colocation and interconnection bookings and accounted for 25% of our new logos. One of our top channel partners brought us an opportunity to support a digital health care company that is redefining the way cardiac arrhythmias are clinically diagnosed by combining their wearable bio-sensing technology with cloud-based data analytics and machine learning capabilities. Their primary business model requires extensive data mining to help doctors predict and respond to cardiovascular events. The customer's proprietary cloud solution within Digital Realty required access to Azure, AWS and Salesforce cloud services. Digital Realty won the business by providing a superior low-latency and HIPAA compliant solution with the ability to connect to multiple cloud providers throughout our interconnection services, including Service Exchange. We're also seeing traction with the strategic relationships we have forged with leading cloud and managed service providers. For example, we're engaged with one of our global cloud's hyperscale customers to provide best-in-class ultra low-latency hybrid services to end customers with specific performance requirements. We're also teaming up with a major storage solution provider who offer services to end customers who wants to deploy private infrastructure in close proximity to the public cloud. Alliances like this greatly expand Digital Realty's addressable market and demonstrate our unique capabilities in terms of ubiquitous cloud interconnection and near-field proximity to underlying cloud infrastructure around the globe. Turning to our backlog on Page 12. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stood at $144 million at the end of the first quarter. I'd like to point out here that the current backlog shown on Page 12 reflects the full contribution from Ascenty, whereas the Ascenty contribution will be shown in our 49% pro rata share going forward. The weighted average lag between the first quarter signings and commencements remained tighter than our long-term average and a little over 2 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 13. We signed $116 million of renewals during the first quarter, in addition to new leases signed. This is the second highest quarterly renewal leasing volume in our history, right on the heels of the all-time high of $138 million in 4Q '18. The weighted average lease term on renewals was nearly 13 years, while cash rents on renewals were down 6.9%, driven primarily by strategic portfolio transaction as a single customer deployed a multiple powered base building shell as well as fully built-out turn-key capacity in 15 sites across our global platform. We renewed their footprint for 15 years on triple net lease terms, walking in these cash flows for years to come and maximizing the value from these facilities. We also effectively tied the strategic renewal to a multi-region expansion opportunity with the same customer. Excluding global relationships that have signed an incremental $15 million of annualized GAAP revenue over the past 6 months, the mark-to-market on first quarter renewals would have been essentially flat on a cash basis, as you can see from the data points on the bottom of Page 13. This incremental leasing activity is a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic, long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 40 basis points to 88.6%, half due to development deliveries placed in service in Amsterdam and Chicago and half due to customer move-outs in Silicon Valley and Dallas. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen over the past 90 days and FX represented roughly a 100 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 14. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 15. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable-rate debt with longer-term fixed-rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move-in LIBOR will have a less than 1% impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up 6% year-over-year or 7% on a constant currency basis and came in $0.10 above consensus. Delta relative to prior expectations was primarily due to interest income on the Brookfield joint venture funding as well as tax benefits due to a reduction in the corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came in effect during the first quarter. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect to dip back down in the second quarter due to the deconsolidation of the Ascenty joint venture going forward, the absence of the tax benefit in future periods and the forward equity drawdown, as you can see from the bridge on Page 16. We're revaluing in the second half of the year as several large leases commence. As you may have seen from the press release, we're reiterating 2019 core FFO per share guidance. Most of the drivers are unchanged, with the exception of updating financing activity and a reduction to our same-store growth outlook. In addition to continued FX headwinds, the primary change from our prior forecast includes the \"blend and extend\" component of the strategic portfolio transaction executed during the first quarter and bad debt expense related to a subscale private colocation reseller. We also face a particularly tough comparison in the second quarter due to a sizable property tax refund we collected in the second quarter of last year, which also weighs on the full year same-store growth comparison. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 17. Net debt-to-EBITDA remains in line at 5.5 times as of the end of the first quarter. Our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 3.6 times. Pro forma for the ins and outs of Brookfield's funding of the Ascenty joint venture and the forward equity drawdown, net debt-to-EBITDA is just over 5 times and fixed charge coverage is just over 4 times. Over the past several months, the Digital team capitalized on favorable market conditions to advance our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs. In early January, we did all $500 million of our 5.875% senior notes due 2020. We also executed against our strategy of locking in a long-term fixed-rate financing at attractive coupons across the currency to support our assets with a green euro bond offering in early January. This was our second euro bond offering and also our second green bond, following the USD 500 million green bond released in 2015. But this was the first-ever data center euro green bond. The offering was well received, successfully raising gross proceeds of approximately $1 billion of 7-year paper at 2.5% while underscoring Digital Realty's industry-leading sustainability commitment. Market conditions continued to improve over the quarter, and in late February on the basis of reverse increase from investors, we reopened both the 2.5% euro green bond offering due 2026 as well as our recently issued 3.75% sterling bonds due 2030. And we raised another $450 million of long-term debt at attractive coupons. We follow the same playbook with a perpetual preferred equity portion of our capital stock during the first quarter. We announced the reduction of all 365 million of our 7.375% series H preferred stock and we raised $210 million of permanent capital under our new series K perpetual preferred at 5.85%. Finally, we advanced our private capital initiative, closing on the $700 million Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, a leading global asset manager. The successful execution against our financial strategy is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the debt maturity schedule on Page 18, the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity by more than half a year and lowered our weighted average coupon by 30 basis points. A little over half our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 18, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Atkins of RBC Capital Markets. John Atkins : So two questions. One, on the sales pipeline, I was wondering if it looks measly different than earlier this year and late last year. Or do you see a greater mix potentially of double-digit megawatt opportunities as the company brings on more inventory? And are there any notable exchanges by region in Asia Pac, Brazil, Europe and North America as you sort of think about the pipeline rest of the year versus earlier? And then I have kind of a margin question more conceptually, do you see an opportunity to get sustainably past the 60% EBITDA margin level? Or is high 50%s kind of appropriate given your anticipated development pipeline or other investments you're making in the business? Andrew Power : Thanks, Jon. This is Andy. Look, there's, I guess, still a handful questions in there, so let me try to unpack them. Overall pipeline, obviously, we're -- we don't only speak to a specific pipeline number. I think if you look at the composition of our signings in the first quarter, it's quite healthy across regions in terms of competition, size, the deals across industries, a great 43 new logos. So fairly healthy, and I think I've characterized the pipeline going forward consistent with that strength. Your question on the, I guess, more -- see more double-digit megawatt opportunities, say, on the whole, we've seen an increase in double-digit megawatt opportunities roll with additional inventory coming online. While that's been the case for Nashville or Dallas, Chicago, where we've been building out campuses for quite some time, it's been a little bit of a newer phenomenon in Frankfurt and Amsterdam or London or even in Toronto, and certainly Osaka, where, for example, where now these larger customers could see immediate inventory meets their needs, and you can see that runway to growth. So I do think you're going to continue to see that mix of more double-digit megawatt deals continue. I think your next question was a little bit of kind of compare and contrast on the markets. I'll try to do that efficiently. Maybe starting in Asia, I think we've seen some great strength that Bill mentioned. Firstly, in Singapore and Tokyo, markets were literally trying to find extra capacity in the broom closet for some of our customers as it relates to the next leg of our campuses in SIN12 or our newest campus in Tokyo come online. Osaka, this is not to highlight there, where we are bringing on capacity in a series of adjacent campus-like facilities where our customers are growing with us in a nice smooth runway. Hopping over to Europe, Frankfurt's going to highlight their great 3-megawatt signing to an IT service customer that had an enterprise customer that they exported from the U.S. into that market. We've seen some robustness there at a time where, I'd say, supply was quite limited. Back in the Americas, as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the competition was really Toronto. We're building upon our success there, and I think we've seen some incremental inbounds most recently there and some also -- some office -- the other wins in Dallas and Santa Clara. A little lighter on Ashburn, but that was very much subject to inventory. And then Bill kind of gave you a little preview of our entry to Chile and the success with Ascenty. So the second question, just so I have it right, Jon, was about EBITDA margins and where we get to see that going from here. So I guess the midpoint of our guidance is to be at about 58% adjusted EBITDA margin. As a reminder, that's down over 100 basis points year-over-year from ASC 842 accounting change for the expensing of nonsuccess-based leasing compensation. Right now, I could tell you we're much more focused on expanding -- or actually I should say we're less focused on expanding our industry-leading EBITDA margin and more focused on growth. Over the longer term, I think it's pretty intuitive as we continue to scale our platform globally, particularly in new markets that I mentioned with more volume campuses and with greater times and scale. I do see a longer-term trajectory to further EBITDA expansion, pushing up closer to the 60% area that you mentioned. But right now, again, the focus is more prioritizing growth given the feel that we have quite a healthy EBITDA margin. Operator : Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : So first question is on guidance versus sort of the beat in the quarter. Andy, you touched on it when you went through Slide 16, which is always helpful. But I guess, just running the numbers as opposed to looking at the bars, if I backed the $1.73 in the quarter out of the $6.65, it implies that you're going to do $1.64 per quarter in order to get to the full year, or that's what you need to do, at least, which seems like a pretty sizable step down. I know you touched on some of the puts and takes, the Brookfield JV funding, obviously, is a little bit of a drag. The tax benefit, I guess, I could use a little bit of a better explanation for. And then separately, can you maybe elucidate what we should expect to happen on the forward equity a little bit better? Because at least in this illustration, it shows you taking down all of the forward equity prior to 2Q -- or before the 2Q bar? And then I'll have a follow-up. Andrew Power : Sure. Thanks, Jordan. So I guess the components again. So Brookfield closed on its 49% joint venture the very last day of the quarter. So we had not anticipated that to take so long in terms of regulatory approvals and tax and legal structuring, but we did prepare for just in case, and they've compensated us for carrying their share in the investment with a current return. And that's, obviously, going to go away. So it's a bit of a onetime benefit to actually feel in the quarter. To a lesser extent, the U.K. corporate tax rates revised from 21% down with something slightly lower than that, I think, 17%. And obviously, we have non-U.S. dollar investments in London that we have to adjust our tax rate for deferred tax assets or liabilities in this case. So having a benefit to our core FFO, that appears in the quarter as well. So those are the things I'd say that contributed to the several pains of outperformance in the first quarter relative to our original guidance. And in terms of headwinds, that counteracted us in the quarter and also will counteract us in the full year. I think I spelled out we had some bad debt expense. We have a more troubled private colo reseller customer that's a relatively small percentage of our total portfolio, but does provide some headwinds during the quarter. It certainly kind of dampened our same-store NOI pool year-over-year growth and also will provide a headwind to the core FFO per share growth on a full year basis. So I'd say, right now, consistent with prior practice, which is really a philosophy of not sending the starters into the locker room after 1 of 4 quarters, we do keep our guidance constant. And going to your question on the -- a drawdown on the equity forward, so there's a $1.1 billion gross equity. We have not drawn down on any of it. As you can see from the balance sheet at 3/31, we had just over $800 million of revolver balance on the $2.6 billion revolver. We had about $130 million almost of cash on hand. Brookfield literally came in the last day so we couldn't even pay down the revolver with a portion of that till a day later. And I would say we're going to be drawing down a portion of it before the end of the second quarter. We took a little bit of poetic license on the chart. We're putting that bar just to the left of the second quarter bar, but I'd say the bulk of it will be -- bulk, if not all of it, will certainly be done by the end of the quarter. Jordan Sadler : Just to clarify, the Brookfield cash doesn't -- didn't show up on the balance sheet at all. Is it because that's... Andrew Power : I'm just stating we have a $127 million-or-so cash in the balance sheet at 3/31, because that money literally came in that single day and we couldn't send the wire to pay down more revolver balance for that piece. Jordan Sadler : Okay. My follow-up was more on sort of funding longer term. You've recently -- and maybe this is a good question for Mr. Wright. You've recently talked about a self-funding model potentially, and I'm just curious if we can get an update, maybe a few months into the year what it looks like as you've sort of gone after the market or have taken an assessment in the portfolio, how we should be thinking about Digital's funding and sort of harvesting of assets this year. Gregory Wright : Yes, Jordan. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, consistently, we've said previously, although our 2019 guidance does not include any of the disposition assumptions, we continue to remain focused on recycling capital and portfolio optimization. The company has a heritage to that. Bill was doing that 6, 7 years ago, and we continue to focus on those opportunities when they make sense. We're certainly continuing to evaluate the private markets as a source of capital, and clearly, what everyone know when we have anything to report. And with that said, you can reasonably expect us to periodically sell assets, particularly nondata center properties or assets in markets that no longer fit our strategy. Specifically, we discussed selling certain triple net lease assets potentially as well as potentially joint venturing stabilized assets where we can pull out some of that capital. We would joint venture it and redeploy that capital into higher-yielding development assets, which we think is a prudent capital allocation strategy. And look, I think, again, we haven't committed to any specific amounts and timing since. As Andy would touch on, we're fully funded through 2020. I want to say that it could be as high as a couple billion over multiple years, but again, no specific timing are announced. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Funk : Yes, just a couple, guys. I mean, first, Bill, during the call, you made some comments and expectation for maybe a pickup or an absorption in the second half of 2019 from a large to hyperscale guys. I hope you can connect that back to some of the comments we've heard in the last week-or-so from Intel, for example, unit weakness there; NTSI, talking about inventory oversupply. Contrast it with Microsoft talking about building out their global data center regions. Maybe help us pull that together and talk about your own -- your view on the second half pickup in absorption? William Stein : So keep in mind in the first half, we really didn't have any inventory in Northern Virginia, which is our strongest and biggest market, and that's going to be coming on in the second half. So that, at least, will give us some product to sell. I could tell you that just based on conversations that we're having -- well, in fact, backing up, the purchasing cycle of these CSPs tends to be spiky. It can be -- it has been volatile. And not all CSPs buy on the same schedule and some buy in far greater quantity than others, and in some regions, see greater orders than others. I mean, in general, Virginia is the highest and we see smaller orders. Historically, we've seen smaller orders in Europe versus North America. So there certainly was a lull in the first quarter. And I think despite that, we did $50 million in bookings, so we're happy with that. And in some ways, we feel that the quality of bookings is better in the first quarter because it's -- we're less dependent on the large spiky CSP orders. But I have no doubt that those orders will resume in the back half of the year. Michael Funk : Okay. And then you also announced the -- you talked it earlier, the Chile deal in the first phase. I think you announced the size of the deal. Any additional commentary on future phases, what that could look like, the timing, any kind of underwriting commentary you can give us as well. What kind of rates are you underwriting that at? William Stein : Sure, Michael. I'd like to fill in some of the details here. So this is very consistent with our Digital Realty new market entry expansion. Purely customer-led. And this one, in particular, derisked by simultaneous customer signing and our control of land, and ultimately, start of construction. This is a -- initially going to be about a little over 6, 6.3 megawatts data center hall in Santiago, but has a runway for growth too. Could be another 20-plus megawatts with adjacency. So -- and I think on the heels of this, I think we'll likely see additional other customers looking to expand in this market as well. Michael Funk : Okay. And then, real quick... William Stein : Mike, you probably know it, but the initial structure is leased hall, and that is really a function of time-to-market. Our expectation is that we will purchase that asset. Michael Funk : Okay. And then one quick clarification, Andy, if I could. So the adjusted EBITDA guidance, is that apples-to-apples, what you gave us at 4Q? I didn't notice some adjustments for the -- for Ascenty. So just to clarify, is that the same guidance, or was there a change there? Andrew Power : Sure. The -- I think we gave you adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, not Chile EBITDA. But so I'd say, if you look across that guidance table for each of the assumptions and, ultimately, the output row at the very bottom, we've kept that on an apples-to-apples basis throughout without no change. I think if you go back to our initial guidance back in the first weeks of January, we did try to give you what '18 going to look like under the change in accounting for ASC 842. Michael Funk : Okay. So no change, even though if I calculate the adjusted EBITDA. I look at the back of your supplemental, there is the difference with the unconsolidated JV and then the noncontrolling interest now contributing to that. Andrew Power : No. I mean, no -- same accounting for the table and the -- from left to right on there. I mean, the only difference is Ascenty, Brookfield. We owned 100% of Ascenty from December 21 on through all but the last -- very last day of the first quarter. So we recognized consolidated or almost 99%, I should say, of that venture. It actually does only 1% interest through our P&L. And on the last day when Brookfield closed on its 49%, it slipped to an unconsolidated joint venture at the -- and ultimately, given it's literally 1 day, it really wasn't material enough for disclosure on the back of our financial sup. It will be next quarter when we own 49% for a full 90 days. And we did provide a reconciliation on our leverage stats for both net debt-to-EBITDA and fixed charge coverage to make sure you're apples-to-apples in numerator and denominator for our provider share of ownership on those cats. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Colby Synesael : Great. I guess just 2 high-level questions. Your -- Bill, I think in that last comment or question, you mentioned you've no doubt, I guess, to your assumption to the larger deals in the second half of '19. And I'm just curious is that based on recent trends in the last few weeks, in the last month? Or would you feel just as confident, call it, on January 1? And then secondly, M&A. Obviously, it's been a key aspect of your strategy in the last several years. I know there's been some pushback on valuations, perhaps more recently over the last few quarters, if not a year. Are you seeing those change and are you seeing potentially more opportunities for you guys to do something than maybe you would have thought of just a few months ago? William Stein : Sure, Colby, leet me -- I'll handle the first one and I think Greg can pick up on the second one. I wouldn't say that there's been any change since January that causes that. It's just a function of looking back over history and seeing what the buying pattern has been. Obviously the -- some of the CSPs have taken the very large blocks of space in the relatively recent past, which has taken some time for them to absorb. But if you've listened to the Microsoft earnings report today, their cloud business is clearly very robust. And I will assume that the other firms will report in a similar vein. And at the end of the day, you really need to procure a space to house these operations. And that's why we feel as we do. Christopher Sharp : Yes. And just providing a little bit more color on that, Bill. A couple of the elements that we've been looking at the market is particularly around some of the services that we all see all these cloud providers launching. These services are becoming more complex and require a different type of infrastructure to meet their requirements. And so it's all about these huge data lakes and about the ability to do a cat cage or multi-megawatt deployments across our entire Connected Campus, which is where we still see every major provider out there launching a handful of new services every quarter. So there's -- all of that requires infrastructure to continue to meet the market demands of all the consumers globally. Gregory Wright : This is Greg, responding to the M&A question. Look, I think when you take a look at the landscape right now, and so we've mentioned it before. We constantly monitor all opportunities, whether in the public market and the private markets, whenever it may be. At this time, I think your point is right. We're seeing a lot of potential M&A opportunities in the private market especially. And as you can imagine, given our position, we see everything. I think you also -- due to the fact that the pricing remains fairly robust, and that's true. With that said, I think we've shown our discipline and commitment in the past to only do deals that make strategic sense and we believe is the appropriate risk-adjusted return, and that's the way we're going to continue to pursue our M&A strategies. With that said, also another leg of that stool, it's not necessarily M&A, but we're looking at land purchases as well to continue to fund the company's growth. So the reality is we look at 3 different prongs, really: M&A, whether it's public or private; we look at both portfolio -- our private portfolio and one-off acquisitions; as well as land acquisitions. And again, this may change by market. But we go back and we monitor each market, determine what we think appropriate returns are and what our strategy is and what our customers are driving us in that market and weigh all those factors before we embark upon any M&A activity. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Erik Rasmussen : Maybe just circling back in Northern Virginia. Obviously, there's a slowdown we're seeing -- slower absorption in this market. Hearing a lot of inventory in the market and putting pressure on pricing. But can you just kind of talk to some of those sort of dynamics in that market? I know from what we're hearing and some of the things that we've seen so far reported kind of all jives with maybe a second half pickup. But can you just give a little bit more color on what you're hearing from customers there and just some clarity? Andrew Power : Eric, this is Andy. I mean, I'll try to tackle that. So we've obviously been monitoring this market quite closely. It's certainly the most competitive market in the arena. I would also say it's historically been the largest and have the largest amount of demand and most robust and diverse demand across all cloud service providers and enterprise customers. We've, as Bill mentioned, had a pretty great phenomenal success of latest 12-plus months, call it, close to 99 megawatts to the point where pretty much all of our existing inventory had been leased. So we came up -- although short, now we did not anticipate that was going to happen a year prior when we would have grown incremental inventory. I think the way we think about tackling that market, we are closely monitoring relative competitiveness. We are very, very pleased with the fact that we are selling to a very large and growing installed customer base. Many customers want to grow with that adjacency, adjacent suite, adjacent buildings, really a short walk across the road or a conduit for the fiber to be pulled. And many of these customers who have already landed with us have that game plan already rounded out incremental capacity they want to take once they're fully utilizing their existing suites. So having that installed base is certainly a competitive advantage to date, and I think that will bear fruit as our new inventory -- our latest inventory comes online in the back half of 2019. The other thing I'd say is the tool we utilize in pretty much defending our rate of returns of profitability. And any more competitive market is really flexing the muscle of the global multiproduct portfolio and bringing together opportunities for our customer to grow in various supply constrained more rare and unique opportunities, be it Tokyo or Singapore or Osaka or Frankfurt or South America, kind of patching opportunities for these customers and not beholden necessarily do that private one-off competitor that has only has -- anything to sell is rate. So obviously, more to come. I will be even more close to the front lines as we have inventory to sell against that market. But I think we've got a tremendous value proposition and some pretty good tools in our toolkit to make sure we maximize value for that market and for the company. Erik Rasmussen : So great. And so what I'm hearing is that, even though you may have lost out or you could be losing out on deals, it's not like because of your competitive advantage in this installed base, if you lost or out on this sign of first go-around, that business will come back or maybe even customers are kind of waiting for that incremental capacity to come online. And again, it's not just a pricing game or if you had -- because there was a lot of capacity that's in that market and a lot of inventory. So is that a fair way to capture that? Andrew Power : Honestly, I would say that the timing of inventory tightness and demand is taking a bit of a pause kind of coincided for us in that market. So I'm not sure we really lost out based on our look at the market in the first quarter. There was a tremendous amount of deals we lost out on, even if they were at more competitive rates due to our lack of inventory. And I think that goes back to some of Bill's commentary of there we landed large consumers of our product in the prior 12 to 18 months that often take kind of several months to digest in the restocking mode, and then come back and want to grow with that capacity with adjacency. So today, I don't think there's really any regrettable losses in that market of any substance, even with a fairly competitive pricing opportunities out there from certainly many of our competitors that do not have other value-add for their customers beyond just offering a new price. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : Just curious if you can unpack a bit more of the same-store NOI for 2019. As you look into 2020, how should we think about the change in same-store NOI based on the mix of business that you have in the renewals for next year? William Stein : Michael, why don't I -- maybe I'll start with actuals and kind of bridge to guidance table, just to kind of put a -- make it more clear. So our same-store NOI came in at negative 2.5%. That's cash NOI year-over-year for the quarter. I would splice it into there were normal course business that would have had that number coming closer to 1% positive or at least 70 basis points positive, for sure. And we had 3 more episodic -- at least 2 or 3 more episodic headwinds that hit us during the quarter. I mentioned there's bad debt expense that is the net against the revenue and obviously the cash NOI from the coprivate colo reseller that is a customer within our same-store pool. We also have that global relationship multimarket 15-year renewal, which had a, call it, blend and extend component. The customer had like 2.5 years left and we pushed them out 15 years. And while we lowered the rate, which you'll see in our PBB renewals and some of our TKF renewals, those leases are now cut on in the 2.5-plus rate for now 15 years, which we think is a value maximization path there. And then we also had some FX headwinds doing track with the dollar, because now then you hedge on an unlevered basis from the same-store NOI pool. So negative 2.5% as reported cash NOI. If you were to back out the bad debt, the FX and our strategic renewal, that would have been about 0.7 positive. I would say if you kind of then translate actuals for 1 quarter into guidance table for a full year, I would say about half of the decrease in the NOI is due to the bad debt expense and the blend and extend renewal. Again, that's not something we do every quarter or every year. We don't have that many customers that have that much capacity with that short of duration available to renewal at once, and you do renew it once and resets. And I'd say the other half, just overall, the FX, let's say the other half and just what I'd say we're seeing kind of outcomes on potential expiration, potential downtime for re-leasing. So nothing tremendously new, just maybe we're more cautious around looking at the same-store pool. Before I let you get to your second question, I would remind you and others on the call, the same-store pool is one piece of the puzzle just like our cash mark-to-markets. We do a tremendous amount of business that have new leasing tied to existing renewals. I think we've called out that on one of the slides in the deck that our mark-to-markets have actually been flat on a cash basis and positive on GAAP basis, about 1% to 3%. And the subset was customers did $50 million of GAAP with us. So on a relationship return versus same-store versus renewed capacity splicing, it's actually accretive to our cash flow and to our revenue. Michael Rollins : And then how do you think about that for next year? William Stein : Next year, we're really finding our way through the major renewals this year. So we've talked about the big 15 sites strategic portfolio of customer that was not a CSP. We are just at the very beginning of the second quarter executed with a top CSP, a long-term legacy digital customer for about 250,000 square feet, 20-plus megawatts at a pretty attractive renewal, call it, 5 years in term. And I'd say that one is kind of through now. And I'd say other than 1 legacy renewal from a company we've acquired 12 years ago, we're really getting to, I think, finer waters here in terms of these renewal headwinds. And I think we'll talk a lot less about them in 2020 and certainly 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Jon Petersen : Maybe just very quickly. I just want to think it's not in the guidance, I know people will keep asking about it, but I just wanted to clarify. So the onetime payment you got from Brookfield and the U.K. tax benefit, were those contemplated in the initial guidance or was that not expected? William Stein : Jon, we did not expect Brookfield to close 90 days into the first quarter. We thought that transaction was going to close very early in the year. It's not prior to the end of the year, quite honestly. And now we didn't expect that in the guidance, but we're planning for that in structuring of our deal with Brookfield and part of our transaction with Brookfield in exchange for us to assure them a 49% share of the incentive business. As they've navigated their regulatory and legal approvals, they were to compensate us for fronting their capital for what ended up being called just over 90 days. So that was not contemplated and we did not contemplate the change in U.K. tax -- corporate tax rates in our guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Richard Choe : In terms of the commentary you made about focusing on growth, especially with the development coming on at the end of the year. Does it make sense that -- to look at the dividend growth kind of slowing to help fund the growth aspect? Or is that just kind of the law on large numbers? And if we can get a follow-up on how you think about the dividend growth rate, that would be great. William Stein : Thanks, Richard. So I don't think this is a zero-sum game between dividend growth investing the platform for future top line growth. Really the dividend growth is predicated on really the growth in the taxable income as a REIT and ultimately our cash flows. We're now, call it, a 70% AFFO P/E ratio. That's on the heels of our dividend increase of just under 7% last quarter. And as to CF figure, I think you'd see the cash flows grow onto '19 and beyond. I think you'll see the dividend kind of move -- waxed up. Always what I'd say, I'll lean towards not overdistributing and maintaining a good portion of our capital in order to prevent the lines on external markets for funding our developmental growth opportunities. At the same time, we are certainly investing and focusing on accelerating our growth. I think that's a few points across the board. It's, obviously, I think, top of mind for our new Global Head of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer. We've made some changes to kind of accelerate the growth and to kind of further emphasize our focus on the enterprise customer seeking colocation and interconnection on a global platform. But again, I don't think this is one thing or another. These are both missions that I think we can deliver simultaneously. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Stein for any closing remarks. William Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further expanded our global platform, closing the Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, securing strategic landholdings in key global metros and announcing our entry into Chile in support of our strategic customers' global growth aspirations. Second, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises, renewable energy contracts and corporate governance enhancements. Third, we raised the dividend by 7%, the 14th consecutive year we've raised the dividend, dating all the way back to our inception in 2004. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity and the opportunistic issuance of $1.6 billion of long-term capital. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in June. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.+",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. First and foremost, consistent execution against our customer success initiatives drove all-time high new logos, our second highest interconnection and renewal leasing and our third highest total bookings. Second, we leveraged our global platform to prudently allocate capital, where we were able to achieve the most attractive risk-adjusted returns around the world, creating significant value for shareholders. Third, we extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our inaugural ESG report, an official recognition as an ENERGY STAR partner. Last but not least, we capitalized on favorable market conditions to execute an opportunistic $900 million liability management trade, clearing our runway out to 2022 and extending our weighted average duration by nearly half the year while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down by 10 basis points. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. William Stein : Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. The durability of Digital Realty's global platform was on full display in the second quarter of 2019. And our team was incredibly productive over the past 90 days. We delivered the third highest bookings in the Company's history. Demonstrating the strength of our globally diversified portfolio, we also signed the second highest volume of interconnection bookings as well as renewal leasing and we expanded our colocation offering into the Asia-Pacific region with a multi-market new transaction and customer expansion. We also landed an all-time high number of new logos this quarter, an encouraging indication, our efforts to penetrate enterprise demand are bearing fruit and a promising sign for future interconnection revenue growth prospects. Along those lines, I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting MarketplaceLIVE at Spring Studios in New York on November 7, a daylong event connecting the community that builds the cloud network and Internet infrastructure. The event attracts a broad swath across the tech ecosystem and we are expecting over 600 attendees from network engineers and start-ups to solution architects and cloud service providers to CIOs at Fortune 500 companies. We further extended our global platform during the second quarter and we took steps to secure our supply chain with several strategic land acquisitions shown here on Page 3 of our presentation. We closed on three smaller strategic land parcels in Northern Virginia to further physically connect our market leading campus footprint. We also re-entered Paris with new capacity based on significant verified customer demand. And earlier this afternoon, we announced that we are under contract to acquire a parcel in Frankfurt, building upon the success of our sales in the second quarter as well as the recent investment and our coverage of Western Europe. We closed on a land parcel in Tokyo through our MC Digital Realty Japan partnership. Finally, we also announced early this afternoon, we are entering South Korea with plans to develop a carrier-neutral facility in the Sangam Digital Media City in northwest Seoul. We announced the grand openings of an expansion in Dublin in May, the second phase of our Osaka connected campus in June and most recently, we announced that our Latin America platform, Ascenty opened four fully leased facilities in Sao Paulo during the second quarter. We continue to build upon our industry-leading commitment to sustainability with the publication of our inaugural ESG report and we were officially named an ENERGY STAR partner. We continue to invest in our human capital with several key hires. We achieved the Amazon Web Services - service delivery designation for AWS Direct Connect. And last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet locking in our lowest ever 10-year U.S. dollar bond coupon, and opportunistically terming up our 2020 and 2021 maturities. Let's turn to market fundamentals on Page 4. Following the record absorption in 2018, the primary data center metros in North America have been relatively quiet in 2019, especially given the tough year-over-year comparison in Northern Virginia, which is not only the largest data center market in the world, but it's also the most competitive with the broadest selection of existing competitors and the deepest pool of new entrants trying to stake a claim. Loudoun County is ground zero and Ashburn is the most desirable submarket. Even for prime locations, however, the supply demand pendulum has swung away from providers in favor of customers with various new entrants bringing speculative supply online while the most voracious consumers remain in digestion mode. We believe, we have a set of significant competitive advantages in Northern Virginia, given the scale of our footprint, the head start from selling to an installed customer base with a strong desire to grow adjacent to their existing deployments and the longest runway to support their growth. Ultimately, we believe it's a question of when, not if hyperscale procurement cycles enter their next phase of growth and the pendulum can swing back the other direction quickly. In the meantime, we do expect the current supply-demand dynamic will lead to dislocation in the market, which we believe will create investment opportunities for disciplined, well capitalized competitors. The New York metro area, in contrast, has seen a recent resurgence in demand and the market has gradually tightened, as excess inventory has been slowly absorbed while new deliveries have been sparse. In Dallas, there are number of competitors with available supply, but we continue to enjoy good success in Dallas, particularly on our Richardson campus where existing customers consistently expand with us despite the availability of competitive supply elsewhere in the Metroplex. Recent developments in Chicago have been particularly encouraging. The State of Illinois recently passed legislation, creating data center tax incentives that put Chicago back on par with other jurisdictions that have actively encouraged data center investment. Although, we have not signed any major new leases in Chicago, since Governor Pritzker signs a bill on June 28. We have seen an immediate uptick in customer interest. We are optimistic this bill will spur a rebound in demand. We commend Governor Pritzker and the Illinois State Legislature for their leadership in adopting this legislation as well as the Digital Realty Central region portfolio management team which worked extensively behind the scenes, along with the business and labor communities to advance this bipartisan legislation. Supply remain scarce in Santa Clara which is arguably the tightest market in the U.S. and generally commands a pricing premium relative to most other domestic metros. During the second quarter, we saw strong demand from cloud and from enterprise in Santa Clara. Back across the pond, recent market leadership in Europe has shifted from London to Frankfurt, which has been the standout metro in 2019. Following our success with an enterprise customer on our Frankfurt campus last quarter, we signed a major cloud service provider - brand new to our Sausenheim campus with a large and growing deployment. Although requirements in Europe remain smaller than the U.S., partly due to data sovereignty considerations they are getting bigger. The leading global cloud providers remain the primary consumers and these cloud providers continue to exhibit a clear preference for expanding adjacent to their initial deployments. So landing the initial deployment is key. Our Global Connected Campus strategy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this consumption pattern. You may have seen that Amsterdam recently placed a 12-month moratorium on data center construction. This is a developing situation and the potential impact on future projects is not entirely clear. However, from our perspective, barriers to entry just got higher and Amsterdam incumbents such as ourselves have a competitive advantage. We believe, we are very well positioned given the network density of our interconnection hub at Amsterdam Science Park. In-place permits on project, currently under construction at our De President campus and visibility to incremental capacity adjacent to, but not subject to either of the municipalities that have imposed the moratorium. Across the Asia Pacific region, demand remains robust in our key markets, driven primarily by global cloud service provider requirements. We have seen notable strength in Osaka, where we landed a major Japanese integrated communication service provider as a new logo, further validating our Connected Campus strategy for the Kansai region. Similar promising pipeline supports our ongoing campus development projects in Tokyo, Singapore, and Sydney. On the supply side, market inventory remains mostly in check and we remain bullish on our prospects in the region given our first mover advantage into Osaka, barriers to entry in Tokyo, government involvement in Singapore, and rapidly growing cloud adoption in Sydney. While the IT infrastructure landscape across the Asia-Pacific region continues to mature, we see a significant runway for growth for years to come. Finally, we continue to see a strong pipeline of demand for our platform in Latin America, specifically focused across Brazil and now Chile from leading global cloud providers along with new potential customers. We are quite pleased with the performance to date and believe, we are poised to continue to capture an outsized share of demand in this region, characterized by significant upside from growing Internet adoption along with limited availability of institutional quality data center capacity. On balance, we believe customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider. Let's turn to capital allocation on Page 5. The data center sector is maturing as an asset class and we have seen an uptick in fresh capital targeting the sector. This has had the natural effect of compressing returns, particularly in the U.S. This trend is somewhat of a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it has very positive implications for the value of our existing portfolio. On the other hand, it also makes it harder for us to achieve external growth through acquisitions. We believe our global platform represents a competitive advantage in terms of capital allocation as well as access to capital. We have a unique ability to allocate capital, where we see the most attractive risk-adjusted returns around the world while also tapping the broadest, lowest cost pools of capital in the countries where we operate. In addition, we are adapting to the growing demand within the data center investment sales market by seeking to harvest capital from mature assets in the U.S. and redeploy the proceeds into higher growth opportunities elsewhere. We believe, we have a unique ability to allocate capital, where we see the most favorable risk adjusted returns on a global basis and we believe our current investment activity is creating meaningful value for shareholders. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. The global economic expansion keeps plodding along. In the U.S., the recovery is now in its 11th year and earlier this month, became the longest expansion on record. Nonetheless , both fiscal and monetary policy remains supportive. And the U.S. remains a relative bright spot in terms of global economic growth. As you've heard me say many times before data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth. We are fortunate to be operating in a business-levered to secular demand drivers both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business. I'd like to draw your attention to Page 7. As you can see, McKinsey estimates that digital transformation will add $13 trillion to global GDP by 2030 driving demand for distributed digital infrastructures that we are uniquely positioned to address. Thanks to our fit for purpose global footprint and interconnected scale. During the second quarter, we saw early indicators of digital transformation demand on our platform. We captured a record number of new logos, led by our enterprise vertical as these customers begin to deploy and connect components of their digital infrastructure globally. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs. We believe, we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on Page 9. We signed total bookings of $62 million including $6 million from our Latin America platform, Ascenty at our pro rata share and a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $53 million with a weighted average lease term of a little over five years, including an $8 million colocation contribution. As Bill mentioned, this was our third best total bookings quarter and our second best interconnection quarter. I'd also like to clarify that Ascenty's second quarter bookings are in addition to the leases signed in the first quarter with a leading global cloud provider to anchor our entry into Chile. We also expanded our digital realty colocation offering into the Asia-Pacific region with a multi-market new transaction and customer expansion, as you can see from the leasing activity table in our press release. Although this was a relatively small transaction, hopefully, it is a Harbinger of bigger things to come as we move towards officially launching our first fully productized colocation offering in the region later this year. In general, we are winning a greater share overall as well as larger and multi-market and multi-geo colocation deals, reflecting our growing traction within the enterprise segment and these customers' global hybrid cloud use cases. Some of these wins are landing in non-productized colocation data centers. Even though these customers are consuming remote hand services and interconnection solutions commonly associated within colocation facilities. As product lines continue to blur, we are contemplating changes to our disclosure to provide insight consistent with the way we run the business. We will keep you apprised as we contemplate future changes to our disclosure with an eye towards maintaining transparent shareholder friendly communication while balancing continuity against the evolution of our business. During the second quarter, we delivered solid leasing volume up 24% sequentially with balanced performance across sectors, products and geographies. We are also seeing an acceleration of our channel business with healthy double-digit growth relative to the first half of 2018. We added an all-time high 57 new logos during the second quarter, led by strength in our Enterprise segment, which accounted for 40 new logos. This was also a record quarter for new logos sourced through our channel partners, who contributed more new logos in the first half of this year, than they contributed all of last year. We are gaining traction within the enterprise segment of customers deploying hybrid multi cloud connected deployments globally through direct and partnership business combining the best of our ecosystems. Second quarter highlights include HCL, an alliance partner is one of the largest next generation technology companies that help enterprises reimagine their businesses. HCL selected Digital Realty to host their Oracle Demantra infrastructure and SAP cloud environments. This deployment is on behalf of a top 10 U.S.-based food and beverage company with over $10 billion in revenue and a global distribution network. Digital Realty's global platform paired with HCL's expertise and product management, market analytics and sales force management solutions enables HCL's customer to be highly responsive to the evolving pace of consumers worldwide. We continue to benefit from our strategic partnerships, including IBM, a major global automobile manufacturer is relocating their corporate headquarters to be closer to their strategic alliance partners. As part of the relocation, the auto manufacturer is leveraging IBM Direct Link dedicated hosting to enable their VMware environment to harness the power and flexibility of the IBM cloud. This hybrid cloud deployment enables fast direct connectivity of its legacy finance application built on an IBM mainframe to their virtualized environment hosted on the IBM Cloud through a digital realty fiber cross connect. The strategic partnership between Digital Realty and IBM enabled a seamless migration plan for the customer and secured the win for both companies. A large global multi conglomerate manufacturing and services company chose Digital Realty to deploy its edge networking node in our London data center. This company is working with our partner IBM to rightsize their data center footprint and manage their accelerating cloud sprawl and ballooning costs. The client chose Digital Realty as a key component of this complete digital refresh to utilize the speed, security and reliability of IBM Direct Link dedicated capabilities in our London location. By connecting to the multi-zone regional hub, IBM has deployed in our data center, our client can move vast amounts of data quickly and securely between co-located and cloud-based resources allowing them to deliver any application globally, where and when it is needed. We continue to see traction with our global interconnection platform. Mavenir, the only End-to-End, Cloud-Native Network Software Provider for cloud service providers is redefining network economics through automation products and solutions. By leveraging Digital Realty's service exchange, Mavenir is able to offer diverse passing with multiple ways to connect data center environments and ensure 99.999% uptime across their strategic global locations positioning them for continued expansion of their global service delivery. Let's turn to the composition of our customer base on Page 12. Don't forget, the cloud lives in a data center, in fact it probably lives in a Digital Realty data center as you can see from the global accounts that make up over one-third of our customer base. The network segment makes up over 25% of our customer base, and these pipes that connect customers to the clouds aren't going anywhere, regardless which workloads eventually migrate to the cloud. Resellers account for 15% of our total revenue. We think our reseller concentration is a little bit unique, not least because we have over nine years of remaining lease term with these customers and these customers are typically deployed in multiple markets around the world with us as their global partner of choice. Last but not least, Enterprise represents a little less than 25% of our total pie. Here again, we think our concentration is a little bit unique. The financial services sector has long been our largest enterprise vertical. These customers are highly regulated, typically risk averse and symbiotic repeat buyers as evidenced by the new business we did during the second quarter. Three of our top 10 deals were with existing financial services customers. We also see the growth in FinTech being relevant to our platform as they evolve their architectures to achieve, efficient data analytics out of their hybrid multicloud architectures. All of which is to say, it's a hybrid multi cloud world and we believe our fit for purpose portfolio is uniquely well suited to solve for the full supply chain. Turning to our backlog on Page 13. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stepped down from $144 million as of March 31, to $127 million at the end of the second quarter, primarily due to the deconsolidation of Ascenty. I'd like to point out that we've shown here the backlog for our consolidated portfolio which ties to the top line of our P&L. And we have also reflected our pro rata share of the backlog from unconsolidated joint ventures, which runs through the equity and unconsolidated JV line item, at the top of the bars on this chart. During the second quarter, the lag between signings and commencements was slightly above our long-term historical average at eight months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity. On Page 14, we signed a $125 million of renewals during the quarter in addition to new leases signed. This was the second highest quarterly renewal leasing volume in our history. Following the all-time high of $138 million in 4Q '18. Incidentally, the $116 million in 1Q '19 is now the third-highest. So our top three renewal quarters have all come within the last nine months . As you may recall, 2019 was our historical high watermark in terms of lease expirations. Halfway through the year, we have reduced our expirations down from 23% of total revenue as of 3Q '18 to less than 10% remaining as of June 30 while also extending our contracts expire and beyond 2019. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was nearly five years while cash rents on renewals rolled down 5.8%. We've delivered positive cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads in each of the past four years and although rents have been rolling down in 2019, our renewal leasing activity has been in line with our expectations, both in terms of volume, as well as rate. As I previously mentioned, we believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer, we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio . And whenever, we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings including both new business as well as renewals. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 80 basis points to 87.8% due to the customer bankruptcy we mentioned last quarter, as well as development deliveries placing servers in Frankfurt and Osaka, two of our tightest global metros. Same capital cash NOI was down 5%. This includes a 90 basis point FX headwind and you may also recall that we flagged last quarter that we faced a particularly tough comparison in the second quarter due to a sizable property tax refund, we collected in the second quarter of last year. We faced somewhat of a double whammy on the property tax line as we were hit with dramatically higher assessments in the Central region, this quarter, in addition to the refund in the year ago quarter. We intend to vigorously contest these unreasonable assessments and we have an excellent track record of prevailing on appeal. As evidenced by the sizable refund collected in the second quarter of last year. In the meantime, however, we are required to accrue based on the higher assessed values, which unfortunately introduces some volatility in the property tax line item. The U.S. dollar remains elevated relative to prior year exchange rates and FX represented roughly a 100 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 15. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 16. We manage currency risk by issuing locally-denominated debt, to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with a long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 1.6% year over year or essentially flat on a constant currency basis, primarily due to a tough comp from the sizable property tax refund in the second quarter of last year. As you can see from the bridge chart on Page 17, we do expect the quarterly run rate to dip back down in the second half of the year, primarily due to stiffer foreign currency headwinds as the dollar has continued to strengthen over the course of the year, along with a higher share count from settling the forward equity offering. As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating 2019 core FFO per share guidance, although there are few puts and takes in the drivers this quarter. As you may recall, we raised the range for net income by $0.25 last quarter to reflect the non-core activity running through the P&L, most notably the unrealized gain on the contribution of Ascenty to the joint venture with Brookfield. We are bringing the net income range back down by $0.15 this quarter to reflect the loss on early retirement of debt from the opportunistic refinancing of our 2020 and 2021 bond maturities at a 60 basis point savings as well as a non-cash Topic D-42 Charge from the redemption of our Series H preferred stock, which we replaced with our new Series K preferred at a 150 basis point tighter coupon. Both of these financing charges are added back to core FFO. Moving up the guidance table from the net income line, under the balance sheet section, we've updated our assumptions to reflect the actual outcomes on the refinancings I just mentioned. We've also raised our recurring CapEx guidance by $15 million. The higher recurring CapEx guide is not due to higher capital spending on the physical plant, but it's entirely due to capitalized leasing commissions on several strategic renewal transactions and is directly associated with locking in long-term contractual cash flow streams. Last but not least, our expectation for cash re-leasing spreads has improved from down high single-digits to down mid-single digits due to the evolving commercial terms on the mix of renewal transactions we currently expect to execute this year. We are keenly aware of the highly competitive dynamic, particularly in select U.S. markets, but nonetheless, the cash rent roll-down on our - in 2019 vintage expiration does not appear to be as pronounced as previously believed. In addition, although we are pleased with the trajectory of our quarter-over-quarter improvement in bookings, including a 24% increase this past quarter. Most of this activity has been concentrated in facilities still under construction. Given the eight month lag between signings and commencements, recent bookings won't really move the top line needle in calendar year 2019. Although the composition of our recent activity does position our sales team with incremental move-in ready opportunities to be offering customers in the back half of this year. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 18. Net debt to EBITDA stood at 6.1 times as of the end of the second quarter while fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.2 times. Pro forma for settlement of the forward equity offering, net debt to EBITDA remains in-line with our targeted range at 5.5 times, while fixed charge coverage is just under 4.5 times. In addition to proceeds from the forward equity offering, we expect to begin to realize the latent cash flow capacity from signed leases, including the 24 megawatts Ascenty just delivered, which are coming online in the third quarter, but which are not contributing to our last quarter annualized credit stats. Over time, we also expect to use proceeds from our capital recycling program to maintain our target leverage profile. In terms of second quarter capital markets activities, as previously mentioned, in early April, we completed the redemption of all 365 million of our 7.375% Series H preferred stock which we replaced with 210 million of permanent capital under our Series K Perpetual Preferred at 5.85% a savings of over 150 basis points. In June, we capitalized on favorable market conditions to raise $900 million of 10-year to U.S. dollars bonds at 3.6%. The lowest coupon we have ever achieved on a dollar denominated 10-year paper. This was an opportunistic liability management exercise and we use the proceeds to tender for our 3.4% notes due 2020 and our 5.25% senior notes due 2021. A little over 80% of the outstanding bonds were tendered during the second quarter and we settled the redemption of the remaining 20% in mid-July. This successful execution against our financing strategy is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the debt maturity schedule on Page 19, the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity by nearly half a year to 6.4 years and lowered our weighted average coupon by 10 basis points to 3.3%. A little over half of our debt is non- U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 85% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of our Page 19, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we'd be pleased to take your questions. Andrew, would you please begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jon Atkin : I have a couple of operational questions. I guess, first by region, in the major U.S. markets, so I'm wondering, where you see the leasing or demand pipeline, the strongest or quarter-to-date bookings geographically where that has been strongest? I think Bill mentioned a couple of examples in the script. And then on Asia and specifically Korea, I wondered, how you kind of view the puts and takes about deploying capital in that market given the large role that could shape or play in accommodating the hyperscale demand so far in that market and what is arguably lower colocation pricing, than in rest of Asia. And then finally on Europe, I just wondered the new land parcel in Hattersheim and expectations around how quickly one could potentially develop capacity there? Finally, just London, I don't think you mentioned that in your script, but any kind of updated views on the demand dynamics in the London market? Thanks. Andrew Power : I'll try to weave the questions into a couple coherent answers, and I think we're going to probably ping-pong around the team here. So first off, U.S. markets, I would say this, the second quarter was accentuated with some pockets of strength in some more unusual places. As well some places where we've been pretty consistent kind of working from East to West, the Northern New Jersey, New York metro market that is continue to tighten. And we saw few wins in the financial services and other related verticals in that market during the quarter hop down to Dallas our Richardson campus. We continue to expand with both our existing and new customers landing on that campus and quite pleased with the progress on that market. And then over to the West Coast Santa Clara, obviously a very, very tight market we had both enterprise related and also top cloud service provider wins during 2Q. Looking a little bit into crystal ball more into back half of the year, I would say the Toronto market, where we had some great wins earlier in the year continues to be very tight. I think we're very well positioned with our campus location in that market. A brand new asset and we've had a few customers landing and also looking to expand in that location. We are looking at the incremental opportunities in - New York metro area. And also two markets, obviously a little bit more challenge for both Northern Virginia and Chicago. Bill related some of the good news on Chicago. So we're hoping for some green shoots there and in Northern Virginia we're also working on some capacity, some existing customers looking to expand with adjacency as well as some new customers looking to land on our market leading campus. I think you touched on London and Europe, maybe I'll hit that and then hand off Korea to Bill or maybe Craig can chime in on Frankfurt portion. So maybe on the front end, the Frankfurt-market as we mentioned has been one of our hottest markets, we initially ended that market just a few years ago. I think our first anchor customer was a top 3 CSP. We subsequently grew with an enterprise customer. And if you could see the absorption on our leasing table and developments, that was certainly our star for the quarter and we\u2019re rapidly running out of capacity in that market. Maybe Greg, do you want to talk about some of the activity in our other release there in terms of expanding. Gregory Wright : Well, first of all - I think one of the question, was in terms of Frankfurt - sorry I think one of the first question was in terms of Frankfurt in terms of potential timing. Look the contract is subject to conditions including power zoning and planning and that will probably take roughly 24 to 30 months, but again in terms of the layout of the site and the potential for the site. As we said, it's only 3 miles from the Frankfurt airport. We're very excited about that. And lastly over in Europe, London we\u2019re pretty excited about opening up our Cloud House in Docklands\u2019 campus strategy, a highly interconnected series of buildings in the Docklands of London. And we've been working on some strategic colocation story and wins in that market. We also have had some increase on our Crawley Campus and in some other pockets within the London portfolio. So seeing some good opportunities in that market as well, Bill, maybe you want to kick back to John's questions on Korea. William Stein : I think Korea could be - we think Korea is going to be pretty similar to Japan in terms of how it plays out. We're not - we haven\u2019t decided yet whether we're going to pursue that on our own or with a partner, but clearly we went into Osaka several years ago. Created a connected campus that's worked out extremely well for us and likewise, we've been building up in Tokyo. So Seoul is really the next leg of that strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : And I guess the first one is kind of follow-up Bill, earlier this year, I think you made some comments that looking to the second half, your trajectory for bookings that with a funnel look looked relatively strong and I think there has been some mixed commentary out there across the industry. So maybe, just an update, on your earlier comments in this year, about the second half of 2019? William Stein : I'm sure, Michael. Well I mean, I think - that our performance hopefully in the second quarter is consistent with what we said in March, when we said we weren't going to write-off the balance of the year and I think clearly that's not the case. I think if you look at the second quarter versus first, there is a clear positive momentum and acceleration. It's our third highest bookings quarter, as Andy said, with a record number of new logos, standing at 57. And frankly, we expect continued improvement during the balance of the year. It's great to be able to leverage our global footprint. And that's how that's working out. So we expect that international is going to play a major role in the back half of the year. But we still would see a fair share of bookings coming out of North America. To sum up, we remain highly confident in the long-term - demand drivers for our business. Those being big data, mobile and Internet of Things and we really like our position given the strength of our global diversified platform. Michael Funk : And just related question as well, thinking about the new market entry and the expansion that you announced today. Maybe just kind of walk through - I guess the intelligence, the thought process and even the - that the mind of the customer relationships and what you know about their expansion and how that maybe direct some of that new market entry. And the I guess the visibility that gives you into entering the new markets like South Korea and expanded in Frankfurt? William Stein : Well this new market entry, and the expansion into - expansion Frankfurt, the re-entry into Paris. It's all based on conversations that we have with our customers. So it's - we're not going into these markets on a purely speculative basis. It is more than one customers do. Operator : Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : So just wanted to - you touched on Northern Virginia a little bit in your prepared remarks as being oversupplied. And you also alluded to that potentially creating some opportunities I\u2019ll be curious about those opportunities if you could sort of talk about anything that you're seeing there. And then separately Andy in contrast as you were talking about some of the market strength in the back half you mentioned Northern Virginia, which kind of surprised me a little bit as it sounds like that's got the potential to pick up a little bit. Are you - you\u2019ve good line of sight there in the second half or is that just you see customers kicking around some requirements and expecting to land somewhere, potentially with you guys. William Stein : So, in regards to my commentary, I was speaking to our dialogues with our customers and so, not on a speculatively basis, really what we're seeing in terms of opportunities. Listen, Northern Virginia Ashburn obviously the largest market in the world. It's been the most robust and diverse. At the same time, it's become one of our most competitive markets and we're certainly seeing some pricing pressure on new opportunities while at the same time, some of our larger customers have been in code digestion mode for the first half of this year. We think that this market is going to work through this current supply demand challenge and we're optimistic on the market. We think these hyperscales are going to resume their growth and we are seeing some green shoots around some of these private outfits, not just in that market, but broadly speaking. Some of the private outfits who have entered the market in the last 12 to 18 months, who will either not move forward with speculative capacity or we have even seen signs where some of our selling land that they previously bought to build data center capacity. In the meantime, we're just being picking our spots so we're trying to find places where we compete beyond price, where our unique global platform can add substantial value that is customers who need a global partner in the full product suite. It's our installed and growing customer base on our Northern Virginia campuses that wants to grow with adjacency. And then lastly, it's customers to place value on the longest runway for growth for their deployments in that market, which they find in our campuses. Jordan Sadler : So on the opportunity side, it sounds like there maybe some land parcels for example that maybe you guys might be able to pick up. And then separately on the leasing front, it sounds like you've got capacity coming online and even though that you have tenants who have been waiting like passes deliver which could lineup well for you guys in the second half. Is that fair? William Stein : Well, I would just put some finer details, but I don't think we're - I think we\u2019ll feel pretty good of our supply chain in Ashburn and other markets. And it\u2019s these much more tighter markets be it a Paris or Frankfurt, South Korea, new market entry where we're focused on the land. So I don't see us other than the small parcels that really physically connected the campuses and added incremental Ingress/Egress to an existing campus partially owned. I don't see this picking up those land parcels. I do see as a good sign as potential competitor, the tide of potential competitors subsiding a little bit here, which helps overall backdrop. But going back to the demand that I was referencing, it hits all those highlights I was talking about, it was international customers looking for global partners across the full product spectrum. It's customers that landed in like certain building already on our campus and wants to grow 1 megawatt or 2 megawatts right next door. It's the larger customers who - we\u2019ve already built the entire shell for and they're building out their capacity and call it three, six megawatt chunks and I have kind of anchored all their infrastructure on our campus. And lastly it specific customers that say, this is not my first time to lay my workload. I need to find a partner that is going to give me a really long runway for growth and they find that with Digital Realty. So all those are kind of examples I can think of mine of either opportunities we land in recent quarters or opportunities we're working on right now, in a still fairly competitive Ashburn market. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : I'm just going to circle back with Nova once again. You talked about the supply demand imbalance and then more supply coming online. And then still sort of the market in digestion mode, but just trying to balance that and understand your thoughts on maybe and the confidence level you\u2019ve seen some pick up. Obviously you're going to have some supply - your own supplier capacity coming online. But what is that then do in terms of pricing I mean are we really looking at a challenge to get to that low end of your pricing range in that market, and development yields? William Stein : That's a market where there are certain private smaller location operators that are solely competing on price. That will likely in deals just to fill capacity and my guess is will be a short-lived run in our business quite honestly, given the competition. We're picking our spots. We're trying to find customers that really value our product offering and not just going to the lowest common denominator on price and we've been winning on those merits for some time. So obviously that's a market where the pricing has been under pressure given the relative supply demand backdrop. What I would - Eric what my comment really goes to is I don't think demand is bearing as some might suspect, and that's based on conversations we're having live with our customers. And we're going to pick our spots and be competitive and work through a potential temporary dislocation this market. And in fact, when you look at this in the broader digital realty, platform backdrop I think it's just a small piece of our puzzle as you saw from a quarter where we sequentially increased the signings 24 plus percent put up our bronze medal or number three in our records and Ashburn really didn't play to master amount to those signings at all. So I think we're going to work through this and come out the other side of this just fine. Erik Rasmussen : And maybe just on the same cash NOI forecast. You reduce that to the mid-single digits versus high-single digits. How should we think about this and beyond this year and then will the headwinds from the legacy DFT business be completed this year? Andrew Power : Sure so the - what I would say on that front. So we - got a couple things going against us in terms of the same-store pool. Obviously that the FX which we highlighted in the script, we also had the customer bankruptcy that we reserve for last quarter and it's going to flow through this quarter. There also - we also had a tough comp in terms of real estate property taxes. Quarter a year ago had some benefits. This quarter we started accruing for one of our central regions. If you net that out, it's not quite as bad on a kind of same-store basis, I think negative 5 is like closer to negative 2.5 when you kind of do the normalizations on both periods and the negative, it's really due to in our largest exploration year and despite quite strong retention. We've had some down time when released in capacity. As we also highlighted in our script quite pleased with the trajectory of the new signings the 57 new logos, great interconnection signings, multimarket, multi-GO colocation APAC. But there was one point, it's the signed commences, close to eight months. So in year 2019 contribution that might flow through that same-store pool is not as great as we'd like it to be in - the flip side of that that leaves inventory for our sales reps to be selling moving ready space in some hot markets and you could see in our self we will have capacity sitting available in a market like Amsterdam, which is obviously tightening on the backdrop of some of the municipality, moratoriums. Osaka, which has been a harder market and even three meg sitting in Frankfurt. We're quite honestly will probably be a food fight over that last capacity on that campus. And then lastly, I would just say while the same-store pool is very valid and very instrumental looking our financials, our dialogs with our customers is a total commercial package. So we're often tying in multiple product lines, new signings and renewals and a complex commercial solutions for our customers. So some often like a little bit in this quarter and certainly in the prior quarter, we may give a customer some relief on existing contract, but we're winning incremental on a share of their business and good returns and it's a win-win for the customer benefiting from platform digital and a commercial win for the company. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : First, if you could talk a little bit about just broadly the cloud impact that you're seeing on your business in terms of just the direction of bookings as well as what you're seeing on churn and the pace of migrations to the cloud from your customers? And then secondly if you could talk a little bit about what happened in terms of - I think it was the renewal rate in the PBB business and just maybe what caused the dip there? Thanks. William Stein : Mike, I'll take your first question, Andy will take your second. Relative to the cloud, it's been - as you might expect a significant source of demand for us, and we haven't seen the pickup in churn that some of the others have you mentioned some of our peers have mentioned on the calls, I mean look this we've mentioned this is the third-highest booking quarter we've had huge number of international wins, 57 new logos, which was a record, second highest volume in cross connect bookings and we really do see the world. moving to a hybrid multi cloud architecture. And Digital is focused on the enterprise and we think our offerings such as the Service Exchange really enable to shift to a hybrid multi cloud. If cloud ultimately resides in a data center and they leave they sit in an awful lot of our data centers and they're signing many long-term deals with us. So we think we're really, really well positioned to benefit from the growth in cloud demand, but we're also very focused on attracting enterprise customers to sit both in our data center and connect to the clouds on our campuses. Andy do you want handle the second? Andrew Power : And Michael, just so I make sure I address your second question. You mind repeating that you said the renewal rate on the PBB? Michael Rollins : Yes. So if I look at the page 22, I'm sorry, 21 this quarter. I think the PBB retention ratio dropped to that 22.6% from the LTM of 93.5% and was curious if there is anything specific that cause the drop there? Andrew Power : Yes. I think what you have is a little bit of a small sample set as you can see, especially on the square footage 39,000 versus almost 2 million a square feet in the prior quarter. So it's literally only four renewal contracts that happened this quarter. So 1, 1.5 depending on the square footage rating renewed. I believe that was a customer in our Houston footprint, not a large market for Digital Realty or a major focus and I think we only have a site or two in that market, but I would say it's pretty much an anomaly. And as you recall from last quarter, those power based buildings are typically very high retention rates and use the longest duration renewals given the fact that the customer is often putting even more substantial capital commitment into that capacity. So I don't think there is a trend or anything in that renewals time. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : First up on the price renewal change the mid-single digits versus previously the high-single digits. Is that specifically because the legacy DuPont customer has not yet been renewed and is there now an expectation that they will not renew in 2019? And then secondly, there is some things that seem like they would drive your core FFO guidance up. So there is a one-time U.K. tax benefits in the first quarter, it seems like the equity forward didn't come in as linearly as maybe what was anticipated, and then obviously, as we just mentioned the reduction in the renewal spread, are the offsets to why that might not have happened, if I have them correctly, the FX, the bankruptcy, the top real estate property taxes and then the longer book-to-bill. And then just lastly, a higher level question, what does the capacity look like for the back half of this year in terms of available megawatts, if you will, in the markets where you're seeing the most demand. Do you have enough capacity effectively available you think in the markets where you're seeing the most demand to sustain the level of momentum you saw in the second quarter? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Colby. I think there is a bunch of numbers questions in here. So let me try to tackle all three and no specific order. So actually, maybe I'll work in reverse order because it might be easier. So available capacity, I think we're set up pretty nicely in terms of available capacity in the back half of the year and you can see that either and what's on our development cycle in terms of unleased capacity or you can see in the pre-stabilized, just delivered and highlights in that - in those markets are as I mentioned, Frankfurt, Osaka, Amsterdam, London. These markets in our Latin America platform as well. So I think we're set up pretty nicely in terms of available capacity, they're coming on, back half of this year. But as you know, as we move into the back of this year, we're also working on capacity that's even coming on line in early 2020. So and many of these tighter markets be the Tokyo and others, the customers really stretching out the timelines been coming to us even earlier given there such limited capacity. What I'd like more in some of those markets, of course, Frankfurt\u2019s a market where we just seen a rapid acceleration. So and it's a tightening market hence it's been tough to get land parcels and quite pleased with a global investment team is great work and timing that down on the heels of our success. But net-net, I think we're in a pretty good space for back half of 2019 going into 2020. Markets coming online and with capacity in the backdrop attractive demand. Going to - I think your guidance question, if you net out the outcome on the guidance, we obviously beat our internal numbers in the first quarter, largely due to some timings on the incentive close and our funding for bridging of our partners equity and being compensated for that. And as you move into second quarter, we kind of came in line with our numbers and if you look at kind of the math, you pretty much need to kind of flat line-ish with the second quarter numbers into both Q3 and Q4 to kind of get roughly to the midpoint of our guidance. I would say you've got a couple of things going on there. One, you can obviously - NOI coming online for capacity that are signed, but not commence. So that's the positive - the headwinds, which makes us reaffirm our guidance at its current range are, you have FX continuing to be a headwind one, a year-over-year basis. Two, you have our equity forward which we delayed to match our sources and uses to later in the year, so the share count from that equity forward getting drawdown is going to come into the share count and then three, I mentioned the headwind with the property tax accrual. Again, we do look to try to modify those an appeal, but we're not going to win or any type of appeal on that in, call it three months time. So those are the offsetting headwinds. And as I mentioned the signings while great quality on many metrics across the board, it does have a longer signed a commenced time period of eight months, so it's probably doing a little bit more - the second quarter signings are probably paying a little bit work to building this up for our 2020 numbers then actual in year 2019 contribution, but the positive - as I mentioned will leave us with moving ready capacity in several great markets for our sales reps to be selling into right now. Last but not least on the guidance table, we did improve our expectations for our cash mark-to-market for the full year. We don't want to specify any specific confidential customer dealings. What I can tell you is among our large both legacy digital and legacy DFT customers, we're moving closer and closer to final resolution of the path forward on some of their capacity renewals. We've worked with this customer who we've been helping in growing their capacity over the 12 \u2013 last 18 months. Across now, I think I believe all three of our connected Ashburn campus is the triangle that surround Loudon County. We've been helping them with connectivity across these campuses. Their needs and requests over time have changed and I think the shape and form of that renewal will be constructive for both the customer and for digital and likely result in a little bit better outcome in terms of rate as we push out some of those contracts that do expire over several years to begin with. A couple of years from there into the future. So that was really the driver for the guidance table change. So we do expect to complete that renewal in short order. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Bill Stein for any closing remarks. William Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers, delivering all-time high new logos, our second best renewal leasing in interconnection bookings and our third highest total bookings in our history. We extended our global footprint and took steps to secure our supply chain with several strategic land acquisitions. We re-entered Paris, we secured our second campus in Frankfurt and announced our entry into South Korea. We also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with the publication of our inaugural ESG report and our official recognition as an Energy Star Partner. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity and the opportunistic issuance of another $900 million of long-term capital. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us. I hope you enjoy the dark days of summer and hope to see many of you at marketplace live in New York in November. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our 3Q results. In July, we announced we were reentering Paris, expanding in Frankfurt, entering Seoul, and opening four new facilities in Brazil. In September, we announced we are acquiring land in Tokyo and we also announced a $1.4 billion private capital initiative with Mapletree, bringing our year-to-date private capital raising to over $2 billion, including the joint venture with Brookfield we closed in the first quarter. In October, we raised $900 million of long-term capital at all-time low coupons and reached renewable energy agreements in Northern Virginia and Oregon, where we signed an anchor lease to break ground on land inherited through the DFT acquisition. Earlier this morning, the Adani Group announced that we have exceeded a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in India. And last, but certainly not least, this afternoon, we made the very exciting announcement that we have entered into a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Stein : Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. 15 years ago to the day, Digital listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We are thrilled to be celebrating our 15-year anniversary as a public company with a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction that will create a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions with an enhanced presence in high-growth major European metro areas. As you can see on Page 2 of our presentation, we believe the best way to serve our customer needs is by offering a comprehensive set of data center solutions and covering the full product spectrum, from small footprint cage and cabinet environments, all the way up to multi-megawatt dedicated hyperscale facilities on a truly global basis from Sydney to Singapore to Santiago to Santa Clara. Customers form the bedrock of our strategy. And in order to meet their needs around the world, we have invested and partnered with a series of leading local brands. In the Americas, we have partnered with Brookfield to serve our customers through Ascenty, the leading data center provider in Brazil with a community of platform compute and network notes that mock connected via a proprietary fiber network. In APAC, we teamed up with Mitsubishi Corporation to launch MC Digital Realty in Japan, where we have recent announced a pair of land parcel purchases in Tokyo to support growing customer demand. And, of course, earlier this afternoon, we reached a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion, a leading provider of carrier and cloud natural colocation data center services in EMEA. We believe the combination will deliver compelling benefits for customers, shareholders, and employees. I'm pleased to welcome Interxion CEO, David Ruberg and I'd like to turn the call over to him to share his perspective and discuss the strategic merits of the transaction. David Ruberg : Thank you, Bill. I'm excited to be here today to talk about the opportunity to join forces with Digital. Please turn to slide 3. As Bill mentioned, we strongly believe that this combination is highly strategic as well as complementary. Like everything we do, the strategic rationale starts with our customers. For many years, Interxion has been creating communities of interest in our data centers that offer carriers, Digital platform providers and enterprises access to high levels of connectivity and performance with participation in communities that can enhance the value proposition to their customers. This approach has been very successful across EMEA, and we see tremendous opportunity to replicate and extend this model across Digital's current and growing footprint. Interxion's connectivity capabilities are a primary source of our competitive advantage, highly connected locations on a logical destinations for content providers and cloud platform providers, who are seeking to provide services to these content providers. Not only do cloud platforms deploy network nodes in these locations, but there is a growing awareness on their part of the value of deploying compute, especially in close proximity to these network nodes. Workload placement close to the end user is equally critical for data intensive, next-generation cloud native applications that are focused on real-time data analytics, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The combination of Interxion's connectivity capabilities with Digital's hyperscale and enterprise expertise put the combined company in a unique position to take advantage and capitalize on the emerging global digitalization trends and to offer our customers an efficient and cost-effective way to address their requirements. I'd like to spend a moment on this structure and the leadership of the combined organization. This transaction is being structured as a stock-for-stock combination, and Interxion shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.7067 Digital share per Interxion share. Interxion shareholders will own approximately 20% of the combined company, and Digital shareholders will own the remaining approximately 80%. Both boards have unanimously approved this transaction, and I have irrevocably agreed to tender my shares. Bill Stein will be the CEO of the combined organization, and I will be the CEO of our combined EMEA businesses, which upon closing would be branded Interxion, a Digital company. I will work with Bill and our teams to integrate the two businesses. And over the next year or so, I plan to transition from the day-to-day management of the EMEA business to focusing on the combined company's development of communities of interest across our global footprint and working with some of our core global accounts. While the rationale for this transaction is about customers, the execution will be about employees. The success of the combined organization will depend upon our employees, and I intend to spend a lot of time working to ensure that our employees understand and contribute to our efforts to build these leading global platforms. And I want to assure our teams the process of transitioning from two separate entities into a combined global organization will be fair, consistent, transparent, recognizing the importance of preserving the rich culture and country diversity within the combined businesses. We also expect the combination will produce enhanced career opportunities for employees as the combined companies' growth accelerates. I also note that both companies have sizable development pipelines, which represent significant embedded growth potential and provide considerable runway to support our customers' growth, given our strategic land holdings along with Digital's hyperscale development expertise and highly efficient funding model. Finally, we believe our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders will benefit from Digital's investment grade balance sheet and lower cost of capital. In closing, I am personally very excited about the opportunity this represents for all of our stakeholders. I'm convinced that combined, Digital and Interxion will be able to build the leading global platform that can help shape and deliver what our growing universe of customers require. I look forward to working closely with Bill and the entire Digital team to complete the transaction, integrate the businesses and to build the world's premier data center provider. And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill. Bill Stein : Thank you, David. Let's pick back up on the transaction structure here on Page 4. As David indicated, the transaction is structured as a stock-for-stock combination, and Interxion shareholders would receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.7067 Digital Realty shares per Interxion share, which represents roughly a 20% premium to the unaffected share price as of October 9. The transaction is subject to approval by both sets of shareholders, and we expect to close the transaction sometime next year. The breakup fee represents 1% of Interxion's market cap, and the agreement is subject to a 7% overbid color with matching rights. As David alluded to, we are very cognizant of the value of the Interxion platform, and this deal is not about expense synergies. Nonetheless, we do see some opportunity for cost savings, primarily redundant public company costs and interest savings on refinancing Interxion's higher cost debt at Digital Realty's lower borrowing cost in the European debt capital markets. We expect to achieve up to $20 million of annualized synergies, and we expect to realize roughly three quarters of our target in 2021 with the full run rate realized in 2022. Assuming a second quarter close, given the time line for realizing synergies, we expect the transaction will be approximately 1% to 2% dilutive in 2020 and a bit better than breakeven in 2021 and significantly accretive to the combined companies' long-term growth profile. Let's set the stage by framing the opportunity in Europe on Page 5. While GDP levels in Europe and North America are about the same and the population of Europe is significantly larger, the total outsourced data center capacity in Europe today is much smaller. The rapid expansion of cloud and content platforms is driving significant data center demand across Europe. However, within the platform segment, there are significant differences in terms of maturity of adoption across Europe. Even the most technology-centric European countries are 18 to 24 months behind the U.S., followed by a varying degree of maturity across the European continent. This concept is visually depicted on the right-hand side of the slide, which describes directionally how we see the rollout unfolding without intending to provide accurate predictions on the relative size or timing of each opportunity. The cumulative effect of this gradual rollout portrays the significant opportunity ahead of us here in Europe. Let's turn to the standalone Interxion profile on Page 6. As you may know, Interxion's business consist of 53 high-quality carrier and cloud neutral colocation facilities in 13 high-growth metros across 11 countries in Europe and an investment in Africa. They have over 200 megawatts of equipped capacity serving more than 2,000 customers with platforms representing approximately 40% of recurring revenue and the balance put evenly between connectivity and enterprise. Flipping over to Page 7. You will see that our combined EMEA business will service an expanded customer base for more than 90 facilities in 15 metros across 11 countries in Europe. As you can see from the pie charts, the bottom of the slide, not only does the combination create a broader network for landing and expanding customers, but our businesses are highly complementary. Digital's position in London and Dublin dovetails nicely with Interxion's presence in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris and across the rest of Europe. The pro forma business mix covers the continent and is well balanced between the major European metros. Turning now to Page 8. Interxion has successfully executed a strategy in creating and enabling valuable communities of interest in Europe, and an internet gateway in Marseille serves as the digital media hub to 4.5 billion eyeballs across EMEA, as a prime example. We see significant opportunities to extend Interxion's capabilities to identify and develop high-value communities of interest across the combined company's global footprint. As shown on page 9, our customer accounts are similar despite the difference in the size of our businesses, which gives you some appreciation for the density of the communities of interest the Interxion team has successfully created. These communities match up well with the hyperscale compute engine's Digital Realty as successfully landed across our global platform. The combination of our respective strengths should enhance our ability to solve the public and hybrid cloud architectural acquirements of our global customer base. Interxion's developing pipeline represents a source of significant potential embedded growth as shown on page 10. In addition to the 53 facilities currently in service, Interxion also has 500 constructions. These projects are significantly preleased and represent a substantial expansion of the installed base, including land owned or controlled Interxion has the potential to double the size of its existing business. The transaction will also create significant financial benefits as shown on page 11. The combined company will have a global presence in 44 metros across 20 countries on 6 continents with an enterprise value of approximately $50 billion, nearly five times the size of the next largest competitor. We expect the combined organization will have the most efficient cost structure and the highest EBITDA margin in the data center sector. Finally, let's talk about capital structure on page 12. The combined company will have an equity market cap of over $35 billion and a total enterprise value of more than $50 billion. The balance sheet's impact will be leveraged neutral, but one of the key benefits of the transaction is the opportunity for Interxion stakeholders to benefit from Digital Realty's lower borrowing costs and improved ability to fund the growth of the business as well as the continued growth of the per share dividend, which we have raised each and every year since our IPO in 2004. In summary, this combination is highly strategic and complementary. It is prudently financed with a stock-for-stock structure and is expected to be accretive to the long-term growth trajectory of the combined organization. We are excited to deliver this compelling opportunity that we believe will significantly enhance our ability to create long-term value for customers, shareholders and employees of both companies. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 14. We delivered solid leasing volume with balance performance across sectors, products and geographies. We signed total bookings of $69 million, just shy of our all-time second best. Third quarter bookings included an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $51 million with a weighted average lease term of a little over 7 years, including a $7.4 million co-location contribution. We added another all-time high 64 new logos during the third quarter, led by global strength in our enterprise segment. We quietly leased 14 megawatts in Ashburn during the third quarter, and our biggest deal in this market was just 6 megawatts. Although Northern Virginia has been notoriously competitive this year, we view the current supply/demand dislocation as a temporary phenomenon. Particularly in light of Amazon's selection of Crystal City for its H Q2 and Microsoft's selection for the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI contract, we are bullish on the long-term prospects for communications infrastructure in the Commonwealth as well as our position in the market given the value of our strategic land holdings, our ability to support our customer needs today and to provide the longest runway for their growth. In terms of specific wins during the quarter, we partnered with AT&T to devise a solution for a global biotech firm to service their edge network and data center partner for global edge deployments across multiple North America locations, London and Frankfurt, placing the customer in close proximity to their end user customers, improving application performance and consolidating and reducing their network costs. The customer selected AT&T and Digital Realty to deploy their next-generation IT hubs based upon our collective global footprints, proximity to their locations, access to a wide array of network providers, and the ability to interconnect to multiple public clouds, leveraging digital service exchange fabric. One of the nation's most comprehensive integrated academic healthcare delivery systems expanded their commitment to our global platform this quarter. This new expansion has a dual purpose that will serve to consolidate a number of their smaller data centers and serve our closets from their metro regional units, including on-premise facilities. In addition, the lack of a disaster recovery and business continuity site for their production data center puts Digital Realty in another location. We provide a solution with service exchange, which help them access Azure and our SD-WAN platform and dark fiber network between our campuses, enabling them to execute a key part of their hybrid IT strategy. We are also seeing traction in EMEA and APAC based customers joining our global platform. One example this quarter is a European big data and analytics company wanting to expand its operations to North America. Our global platform capabilities were uniquely suited to meet their high performance computing and rapid expansion requirements. Turning to our backlog on page 16. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced, stepped down from $127 million as of June 30th to $98 million at the end of the third quarter due to several large commencements in Northern Virginia, Toronto and Silicon Valley. During the third quarter, the lag between signings and commencement was slightly below our long-term historical average in a little less than five months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 17. We signed $152 million of renewals during the third quarter, in addition to new leases signed. As you may recall, 2019 was our all-time high in terms of lease expirations, and our four highest renewal quarters have all come within the last 12 months, including a new all-time high for quarterly renewal leasing volume this quarter. Year-to-date, we retained almost 85% of expiring leases, a bit better than our long-term trend. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the third quarter was nearly nine years, while cash rents on renewals rose up 7.2%. In addition to the legacy DLR long-term top customer renewals we secured earlier this year, we finally executed the long-awaited legacy DFT customer renewal during the third quarter, and we did better than expected rate but shorter on term. As you may have seen, we raised our guidance for cash re-leasing spreads again from down mid-single digits to slightly negative, reflecting the better than expected outcome. Aside from a few select supply constrained regions and metro areas, we've yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress sliding through peak vintage renewals. The lion share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents, and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerged in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 40 basis points to 87.4%, entirely due to reclassification of the fully leased Mapletree facilities as held for sale at quarter end. Same capital cash NOI was down 3.7%, in line with our guidance and reflected a 70 basis point FX headwind, higher property tax accruals and the restructuring of the private colocation reseller customer earlier this year. The U.S. dollar continue to climb relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 75 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 18. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 19. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up 2.4% year-over-year or 3.3% on a constant currency basis. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 20, we do expect the quarterly run rate to get dip down in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the Mapletree joint venture transaction, which we expect to close in early November. As a result, we are revising our 2019 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05 to reflect the dilution from the joint venture transaction as well as the two opportunistic long-term capital raises in October that were not previously contemplated in our guidance. As you begin to roll your model forward to the fourth quarter and beyond to next year, there are several puts and takes to keep in mind. We expect to close the Mapletree joint venture transaction in early November and the Mapletree portfolio sale in early January. Consequently, we expect a partial period of dilution in the fourth quarter and a full year in 2020. The interest income on the Ascenty bridge loan and the U.K. income tax benefit in 1Q '19 were both onetime benefits in the current year and are not expected to recur in 2020. We've extended the duration of the forward equity settlement which does provide a current year benefit to per share earnings and cash flow but do expect to eventually settle the forward equity offering early next year, which will likewise represent a drag to year-over-year growth in per share earnings and cash flow in 2020. Conversely, knock on wood; we are not currently anticipating any changes in accounting policy in 2020 unlike the impact on the reported results from the change in lease accounting in 2019 and revenue recognition in 2018. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 21. Net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 6.1 times as of the end of the third quarter, while fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.3 time for the Mapletree transaction and settlement of the forward equity offering, net debt-to-EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at approximately five times while fixed charge coverage is just under 4.5 times. In terms of capital-raising activity, in mid-September, we announced a $1.4 billion portfolio sale and joint venture transaction with Mapletree, a leading Singaporean real estate investment firm. These transactions represent an important step towards our goal of self-funding our growth and diversifying our sources of equity capital and setting the stage for accelerating growth as the proceeds are redeployed into accretive investment opportunities. We expect to close the joint venture in early November and the portfolio sale in early January. Likewise, in mid-September, we extended duration of our forward equity offering by 12 months to most efficiently match the timing of our sources and uses given the $1.4 billion of pending proceeds from the Mapletree transactions. In early October, we raised $345 million of perpetual preferred equity and 5.2% in all-time low preferred equity coupon for Digital Realty. The very next day, we opportunistically tapped that Eurobond market, raising approximately $550 million of 8.5-year paper and one in an eighth like wise an all-time low coupon. This successful execution against our financing strategy is a reflection of the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital; sets us apart from our peers; and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 22, our weighted average debt maturities is over six years, and we weighted our weighted average coupon down another 10 basis points this quarter to 3.2%. Half of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for investment outside the U.S. Over 80% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment. And 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 22, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Sean, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the transaction. My first question is regarding the initial dilution and the ultimate accretion surrounding the transaction. Is the assumption for 2020 that initial dilution factoring in the transaction on a leverage neutral basis or as is? And then, maybe you can speak to beyond the immediate term dilution, ultimately, how we should sort of quantify what you think the accretion will look like on a growth perspective to the overall platform. Andy Power : Thanks, Jordan. This is Andy. So we will maybe go to your question on the balance sheet first. This is 100% stock-for-stock transaction. And when you look at the capital structure slide on our investor deck, you can see its leverage neutral, including the friction from any transaction cost. So in a pro forma for our Mapletree and equity forward, we'll rate it right, our 5 times net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio and still have the proceed from those capital to kind of fund the combined companies' growth, which we're really excited about. 2020 is obviously a little bit tough to handicap here, as we're kind of thing at the very end of 2019. We both have to go get shareholder approval for this transaction and also get any regulatory approval. So depending on where you handicap on closing, anywhere, call it, at the end of 1Q or the end of 2Q or so, you have a fraction of the year. We also really do not assume any synergies pull through with combined business in 2020. Maybe that's a tad bit conservative. So happier or less, just a little over half here combined, no synergies. That's kind of how we get to that roughly 1% to 2% dilution per share in 2020. But in 2021, when you look at the combined company, we described this as a bit better than breakeven, so we did describe it as accretive. Obviously, a combination of the relative valuation from the exchange of our shares. We do have a pickup from refinancing their non-investor grade debt with our investor grade euro bonds to pick a couple hundred basis points of savings there. And then, we do see some of the synergy starting flow through in 2021 to just get a little over breakeven. And then, we see pretty solid accretion from 2022 there on out. And, I guess, to reiterate what you said, we also see accretion to the growth profile of the combined company. As you can see, we have a very complementary long term under construction and landholdings in the European market to continue to fuel that growth. Jordan Sadler : Is there a way to quantify that growth profile accretion? You said significantly accretive to the combined company's gross profile, I believe, in the prepared remarks. I'm just, is it 100 basis points better growth in the three to five year period? 200 basis points? Andy Power : I think on a per share basis, when we kind of flip into 2022 and beyond, I think you reverse the dilution estimate we estimated in 2020. So call it 1% to 2% accretive to our FFO or FFO per share. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Yes. I had a couple of questions about the deal and then a follow-up about just kind of market trends. But as you look at regulatory approval in Europe, CyrusOne and Zenium took a couple of quarters longer than initially anticipated. And then Equinix, Telecity, of course, ended up acquiring divestitures. So I'm interested in kind of your expectations around time line and your thoughts about what some of the aspects to consider would be around the country level and EU approval on the deal. And then just as a footnote, maybe to Jordan's question, I just wanted to be sure, but the $20 million of synergy that you identified, is that entirely OpEx or not? I just missed that. And then I guess, just the second question would be around market review, which metros \u2013 Andy talked about this in the script a little bit, but just interested in which metros currently in North America, Europe and APAC are showing the most kind of hyperscale demand? Thank you. Greg Wright : Hey, Jonathan, it's Greg Wright. Let me take the first question, with respect to antitrust. Look, I think in working with both lawyers on each side of the transaction, we take a look at their geographic overlap and the like. I think we feel good about our outcome on any anti-trust issues. In terms of time, it's always hard to say timing. But I think factoring in that, that's why Andy gave you a range from end of first quarter to end of second quarter that would be the long-term debt if you will, for any timing differences. So I would say that's factored into the guidance that Andy just gave. But again, when we look at it, again, both sets of lawyers and other professionals on the antitrust front, we feel good. Andy Power : Hey, Jon, just to add on to perspective then I'll try to round out your other questions. This is Andy. Obviously, I think what you got to hear is a tremendous value proposition for customers, when were bringing together a European portfolio that was very strong in the United Kingdom, in London, and the InterXion team having done fantastic job on Mainland Europe. So, complementary in terms of product and footprint. So I think that will also help sort of our cards when going through regulatory process. On the expenses synergies, I just \u2013 I would characterize expense energies, not OpEx overheads specific type of expense synergies. There is obviously some public \u2013 redundant public company cost here, including our Board of Directors, that are \u2013 it's kind of easier low-hanging fruit to go out first. I do think there's also going to be revenue synergies here that we don't really have factored into our numbers or, our combined customer base are now going to be able to that were able to be the trusted global partner for this combined customer base around the globe across six continents and 20 countries. So do invest in another key element of this transaction. And then last but not least, I think your assessment overall kind of how the quarter went in terms of markets demand. I'll try to go real quickly on that. On the digital side starting with Europe, we had the, I guess, the topping off, or like the \u2013 we have the last kilowatts into our Frankfurt 27-megawatt campus with a top cloud service provider. We had a smaller win with an enterprise customer into the London market. I think those were the highlights there. Over in Asia Pacific, we had another top CSP land in our soccer campus with a fairly large signing down South America. And Brazil, we had continued growth from a top 5 CSP. And North America had a little bit of the same as early in the year, a little bit of different. We had continued success in Toronto with two different top CSPs with strength in the financial services sector in our Northern New Jersey, New York metro area growth from existing customer on our Dallas campus. And in Northern Virginia Ashburn in fact, actually did come back. We had some great wins there, some of which we highlighted in the script : two international wins, one coming out of issue Pacific, one coming out of Europe that landed in Nova, and then also a large legacy digital customer taking down several megawatts as well. So, I would say those are kind of tops the waves in terms of demand for the quarter on our side. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. If I could just follow-up briefly the leverage neutral \u2013 the all-stock deal and the implications for leverage. It sounds like it gives you some dry powder for further expansion. You announced Korea earlier this year, and then India in the last 24 hours. But how do we think about your expansion pipeline in some of these Asian markets versus elsewhere. And for David perhaps, what led you from the InterXion side to kind of favor the all-stock structure versus maybe a mix of cash and stock? Bill Stein : Hey, Jon, this is a Bill. In terms of the Asian market expansion, you mentioned India in particular. India, at this point, is exploratory. It's a 6-month MOU as we\u2019re exclusive to each other, but we have made no commitments in terms of capital. So it's really tough to bracket the amount of capital that's going to be required for that venture. Other than that, I would expect that our capital program will continue as it has been, its a billion dollars plus a year. And we have broke through all-equity nature of this transaction as well as additional asset sales that are contemplated. I would expect that we are self-funded easily through next year on development. Andy Power : And John \u2013 John Stewarts' waving at me, I think we have given you 4 or 5 questions, so we have to get you back in the queue to round out that last question. A \u2013 Bill Stein : But let's ask David to answer that question on all equity. David Ruberg : John is in Europe. If you don't mind, I think the real question I'd like to address is, why did we do this and why did we do this now? And the form of the transaction is less important. The real answer is, the infrastructure requirements of our customers are evolving. And as they've evolved, they have created a greater opportunity for us to do business with them. And we thought that as this has evolved and these 2 companies have evolved, the combination is far greater positioned to take advantage of these opportunities than we were individually. We believe in them, they believe in us. The form of the transaction of the compensation was secondary. Operator : Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thanks and congrats on the deal announcement. It's obviously on the M&A front, it kind of checks the boxes that you've talked about as strategic and complementary, accretive to -- I will say, the long-term growth on an AFFO basis and you mentioned, prudently financed. But where do you see sort of the pitfalls of you getting to some of the metrics you've outlined? I know you talked about it previously, the 1% to 2% dilutive and then slightly breakeven and then, we'll call it low single or a reverse of that dilution. Where is some of the pitfalls? And where do you see some of the opportunities for that to even be stronger than you expected? Andy Power : Thanks, Eric. So I think obviously, the greatest potential risk is obviously this is all about the customers and the people and employees that are making this come together for the customers. So that's why I think we're going to make sure, we'll go through this in a prudent fashion and bring together 2 great teams in support of these customers and real execution on building out capacity for our customers and being their trusted partner, especially in Europe, but also on a global basis. So that's certainly something where we're keeping an eye on the ball. There's other things that I would say are secondary in our mind, whether it's achievement on the expense synergies, which I would say are relatively modest in numbers. And obviously, execution and ability to tap the financing markets to lock in financing synergies. But I really think, it's a continuation at the topline and focus on the customers in order to deliver that EBITDA in 2021, which is going to be the twin spinning for that near-term financial success. Erik Rasmussen : Okay. Maybe just -- my follow-up, you've mentioned Northern Virginia coming back with a couple of nice deals there. But maybe if it would just talk about the pricing dynamic in that market and in hyperscale deals in general that were signed in the quarter. Andy Power : Sure. So in Northern Virginia, really, the success there was selling our platform and our value proposition to our customers, which was about a global organization supporting these customers across numerous countries and continents, the full product spectrum and working to land them in Northern Virginia, which is obviously very competitive. But on -- what we think is the best campus, where many of these customers have an installed footprint and want to grow its adjacency. And many of these customers value the longest runway for growth in that market that we provide. So I think those key elements were really what allowed us to win the day for some of these key signings during the quarter and not have to just compete on rate like some of our private competitors may have had to go. Obviously, the rates are down there on a year-over-year basis. But I would say, I was quite pleased with the volume and the rate activity. It was a big piece of our North America signings that you can see flowing through our TKF line and our total signings that rated down a little bit quarter-over-quarter but not astronomically. So I think we are really adding value to our customers. They're appreciating that value, and that's why they are picking us. And its not just all about based on bottom rate discussion. Operator : Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : This is Michael on for Colby. Two questions if I may. First, I guess, this goes to David. Did Interxion run a full process before agreeing to a deal? Along those lines, is there a formal go-shop period? And secondly, how much leasing came from Ascenty? And what was the Americas pricing for kW, excluding Ascenty, for the quarter? Thank you. Andy Power : Michael, this is Andy. I'll take the easy one. Ascenty was very small contribution this quarter. They've done a great job the last three consecutive quarters, outperforming our underwriting. But this quarter, I think it was like $1.5 million of GAAP or so. So very small contribution. And that's not to say I'm not -- I'm still optimistic. We just, we're meeting with the Ascenty team and Chris have a pretty good pipeline for the fourth quarter. But what actually we reported on our signings was very relatively small of our Americas signings number. With that, I'll hand it back over to David. David Ruberg : Contrary to what was in the press, we did not run a process. What we have basically done is for the last couple of years, we've been approached by a lot of people. We were focused on what we thought it would take to be successful. We were focused on what we thought a good partner would look like. And Bill and I have been talking about this for quite some time, and it was just the appropriate thing to do. And that's how we got here. In terms of what happens from now, you can expect that there is a standard terms and conditions. But this deal to me makes a lot of sense. And again, that's why we've had this conversation for quite some time. So we'll see what happens, but I'm focused on making this the best opportunity that we can. We spent enough time getting to know each other. I think we know what we're doing. Operator : Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Rob on for Frank, actually. Post the deal, what do you believe will be your approximate percentage of revenue from Northern Virginia? Andy Power : Hey, Rob, this is Andy. That's a very good question. We have -- let me see if I can handicap this. There's a slide on our deck that shows a pro forma -- Slide 11 shows the pro forma geographic concentration. That doesn't have -- it shows pods but doesn't have numbers. But the pods are -- just over 60% are from the Americas; about 30, a little over 30% or 33, I believe, percent from EMEA; and about 6% from APAC. If you look in one of the pages in our south, Northern Virginia, it's still our top market. But I would kind of hit a cap in the 10% to 15% of the total pro forma combined company. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jon Petersen : Thank you. So maybe one question on the quarter and then one question on the deal. So the same capital NOI, I noticed, was down 2.6% -- or sorry, 3.7% on a cash basis year-over-year, 2.5% sequentially. And it looks like occupancy dropped 100 basis points. Maybe if you could just give us a more color on what's going on there? Andy Power : Thanks, Jon. So same capital pool, really, it's about the company's obviously largest expiration year. We've done a quite a good job, renewing a lot of contracts, pushing out for staggered various terms. There are -- and even though our retention's a little bit above historical average, we've taken back a fair bit of space to tip that pull. So we do have some downtime for releasing. And I would say we saved a significant chunk of our new signings in this quarter and last quarter was little bit more into new space that's going to be the delivering. So, little bit of interim cash flow hit. I do think it is a temporary phenomenon. Some of this capacity, I think, Dublin is a good example. We're taking back and we're going to convert TKF suite into a colocation interconnection product offering. So, we think that does provide longer term up sign, although you do have the near-term cash flow hit. So, I think there a lot of other good things about the quarter, which thinking a lot of question so far in addition to this quarter, I think a third-highest almost just sniffing our second-highest from last year, it was pretty multi-geographic, multiproduct. Interconnection was up there in terms of number two or three, I think, in terms of signings in the last handful of years and a record 64 new logos. I believe the new logos we signed in the first three quarters this year are more than new logos we signed in the prior two years, so pretty happy about that. But we are having some -- taking back some non-retaining capacity and we're certainly focusing our salesforce on selling to that move-in ready space, tour the day move-in tomorrow type capacity that does certainly help us in certain markets. Jon Petersen : Okay. Thanks. And then just curious, the Interxion business, will that be good REIT income that will require a dividend payout? And if not, how does that change your thoughts on growing the dividend going forward? Andy Power : Based on our -- other than maybe a relatively short time period at the initial close, depending on the tender of the shares where we would have to hold the business in our TRS temporary, we would qualify this as good REIT income based on everything we've seen to-date. So, I don't see this as a drag on our TRS capacity or incremental corporate tax friction. And so based on what we see, this looks very similar in terms of readability to our core business. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Yes. First question, just strategically, you guys have been extraordinarily active at building out the global platform. And different from your original M&A deals early on, the last few have been dilutive in the near-term, part driven by development, part driven by deleveraging and asset sales, but they'll eventually be accretive. But it just feels as though whether it was Ascenty, the Macquarie deal, this Interxion deal, you sort of pushed the growth to eventually coming. What gives investors confidence that you won't do another a deal next year that then impacts 2021 growth and we're just on the sort of flat cycle until you eventually get to a more positive growth outlook? Andy Power : Thanks Michael. So, I think the three transactions, two buys and one sell, I think, have their nuances of near-term or temporary dilution followed by what we see as accretion. Obviously, Ascenty was a pretty strategic entry, acquiring the leading platform in Brazil, which was subsequently expanded into Santiago, Chile, which was a very large in-flight construction project essentially. So, very little near-term earnings. And also we suffer dilution in how we mitigated the risk and that transaction. The sale of the assets -- when you sell $1 billion in change of assets, so the low six cap and you lose that income right away, you're certainly going to have dilution to your per share FFO rate. And this transaction has its unique nuances with a closing sometime in 2020, timing of synergy, realizations are light where there's dilution. I think we're still focused on driving the growth in our FFO, AFFO, cash flow per share. It's what pays our dividends. But at the same time, I think we're looking at especially this transactions, the keystone strategic piece and global platform. And this is part of the reason why we prepare for transactions like this. Hence why we've kept the balance sheet in such good shape, why we've run the AFFO payout ratio so conservatively. It's been close to 70% or south, so very well covered. So, this mild dilution is temporary and I don't think a repeat story. And I think we're positioning the company for growth from all three of these initiatives quite honestly. And we do ask our investors to bear with us and the noise in the earnings and the ensuing handful of quarters. But we think we\u2019re setting ourselves up for a stronger platform with accelerating growth. Bill Stein : Hey Michael, let me also add to that. As David indicated, he and I have been talking for many years now. And the same is true for Chris Torto, we've been talking -- we talked for many years before we closed on that transaction. So these are opportunities that we've been tracking and have been interested in for a long time. There is nothing like that on our horizon today. I can say that unequivocally that we are not talking with anyone else. And that's not to say we won't do another acquisition, but right now, our plate is full. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And then just something specific related to the deal, and it's been a long time since I've been an investment banker. Can you just walk through -- you said it was a 7% color in terms of a bid protection, and you have matching rights up to that 7%. And then it sounded like there was a 1% on equity breakup fee to any other bidder that would come in, so call it $1 a share per InterXion share. How does that 7% overbid with matching rates work? Greg Wright : It's a little different, Michael. It's Greg. It's a 1% breakup fee. And then it's what's called a 7% overbid color. So it means is someone who comes in, if they would top the deal, they would have to pay 1%. And in order to top the deal, they have to be 7% above our bid. So that's how that works. Operator : Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. My main question has to do with slide number 17, and some of the rental rate changes that you've seen, you reported 7.2% cash now in the industry and across some of the private data center operator. There has been probably pricing weakness and essentially cost per kilowatt reduction is down. However, you guys have clearly executed and reported a pretty; I would describe it as strong result at 7.2% above right positive. Can you just give us more color on how you are driving those results, what your customer are doing? Are they deploying to multiple locations? That\u2019d be very helpful color for industry numbers. Andy Power : Sure, Sami. This is Andy again. So, I would want to say, we've certainly had our fair share of negative cash mark-to-markets. And you can look at back in the last quarter as a prime example. This quarter, we were able to have the uplift for a handful of contracts, most notably when the large legacy DFT customers renewed at a shorter duration, the shorter duration that typically comes with a higher rate. So that would certainly contributor, as well as some other contracts were renewed during the quarter that kind of was able to drive a positive cash mark-to-market spread. It really all goes back to the vintage of the agreement, the market and supply/demands with fundamentals within that specific market and also the product segment. So while we're certainly quite pleased with the outcome of the third quarter, I'm not under the assumption that we're going to repeat plus 7% every quarter for the next four or five, we\u2019ll certainly have our ups and downs. But net-net, I do think we are moving through our largest expiration of the year. We've had several record renewal quarters in a row, numerous top customer, multiyear, multiproduct renewals, staggering out those expirations. You can see as we've whittled down what's coming due in 2019 and beyond. And I do think these ties back to a comment you made is that really about selling the platform, the multiproduct, multi-geo offering to our customers, really trying to be a trusted partner and a solution provider to them. So they have one responsible party around the globe to assist them with whether it's a renewal in one market, expansion in other, network node, you name it. That's really how we're trying to drive the business. And I do think that does pay a little bit of dividends to our success overall. Sami Badri : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Choe : Hi. I wanted to revisit, kind of, the longer term outlook the deal provides in terms of the amount of development under construction. How we should think about that growth? And then also the future capacity because it, seems like this is more of a longer-term strategic deal and not necessarily something that's going to impact things right away. And that probably drove more the transaction? Thank you. Andy Power : Hey, Richard. This is Andy. I can speak to the numbers here. There's a slide on the deck that, I think, paints a nice picture of the growth profile. I think it's slide 10. What's quite unique about this transaction, in addition to the broader global strategic nature of it, it really is kind of two interlocking puzzle pieces in terms of inventory and portfolio footprint. As I've mentioned, we basically topped off our growth in the Frankfurt market, and the InterXion team has done a great job bringing inventory on in the near future, so filling in gaps there. In London, that's a market where we've been having a pretty nice and future proofed runway for growth with our cloud house digital documents campus as well as our Crawley and working campuses. And that was more of a newer market. Similarly in France, we just reentered Paris, and the InterXion team has a dominant share in multimarkets in France. So let's call it 18 months out. I think we got a very complimentary inventory position, which we'd like. That includes over 80 megawatts under construction from InterXion that are north 40% pre-leased. We're bringing 40 megawatts to the table at about 40% pre-leased. So I think that kind of dovetails for the near-term picture. And then longer term, the Interxion team really done a fantastic job building out a long-term runway of growth clearly where they either own lease or options on several years' worth of inventory in strategic markets, including some of the budding growth markets outside of the Frankfurt, London and St. Paris market traditionally known for such a strong hold for. So I think it's a combination of near and longer-term growth. Richard Choe : And will that -- this kind of options help you bridge the gap or when you start integrating the sales forces? And how should we think about the sales force integration going forward? Andy Power : I think, this inventory set up is a fantastic thing for our customers. And when our customers have lots of opportunity to move into our footprint of combined company basis, that usually is a good for our sales force at the same time. We are just on the heels of announcement we got. We obviously got to work independently until our shareholders approve of this transaction and we close. And once we close, we're going to work together as well to combine. And with that, I think David wants to chime in. David Ruberg : I just wanted to add, what's fascinating about this combination is when you look at the top 15 or 20 platform players in the world, we actually overlap substantially. But we approach them from two different orientations, one from the large size and one from the small size. And so when you look at this, even the sales forces are highly complementary in terms of the way they approach. When you look at the combined with a number of the top 3 or 4 customers, when you put these two companies together and you look at the relevance that we have as a combined entity for some of these behemoths, it's really impressive. So, it's not going to be as difficult to bring them together, because they bring complementary knowledge. One more on the compute side, one more on the connectivity side. So, I think it works. Operator : This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Stein for any closing remarks. Bill Stein : Thank you, Sean. I'd like to wrap-up our call today by recapping the strategic merits of our combination with Interxion, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. The combined company will extend Interxion's successful strategy of creating and enabling valuable communities of interest in Europe by extending it across the combined companies' global footprint. Our businesses are highly complementary. The combination creates a leading pan-European data center provider, offering consistent, high quality services with low-latency access to approximately 70% of the GDP in Europe. Interxion's co-location capabilities combined with our hyperscale expertise will significantly enhance the combined companies' activity to address and solve our company's public and hybrid cloud architectural requirements on a global scale. Interxion has five projects under construction, which are over 40% pre-leased and represent a 40% expansion of the asset base and a source of significant potential embedded growth and long-term value creation. Last but not least, the transaction is expected to generate significant financial benefit. It's expected to be accretive to the long-term growth rate of the combined organization and will establish a global platform that we believe will significantly enhance our ability to create long-term value for both the customers, shareholders and employees of both companies. Thank you all for joining us, and we hope to see many of you at marketplace live at Spring Studios in New York next week. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Sean. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and SVP Finance, Matt Mercier; CIO, Greg Wright; CTO, Chris Sharp; and Corey Dyer, EVP Sales and Marketing, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Investors are encouraged to read the proxy statement and prospectus with respect to the proposed transaction between Digital Realty and interaction and other relevant documents filed with the SEC because they contain important information. You may obtain a free copy of these documents from the SEC's website at sec.gov or from the websites, our Investor Relations department of either Digital Realty or Interxion. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein. I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We extended our global footprint, reaching agreements to a combine with Interxion and to enter India. We enhanced our portfolio quality, recycling capital from fully stabilized assets into network dense interconnection hubs. We launched platform digital, a unique global data center platform designed to enable customers to scale digital business. We advanced our sustainability initiatives with incremental renewable energy agreements and several industry awards. Last but not least, we've further strengthened the balance sheet, locking in long-term debt and preferred equity capital at record low coupons. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Stein : Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. We advanced each of these three pillars in 2019, culminating with the addition of a new member to the Digital family, and we'd like to congratulate our friend and partner Andy Power along with his wife Sarah on the arrival of their baby girl Power Madison Elizabeth earlier this week. We continued to expand our global footprint. The highlight was, of course, our entry into a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction that will create a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions. We also executed a memorandum of understanding with the Adani Group to pursue a joint venture in India and we are actively exploring opportunities to plant our first flag in this vast untapped market with tremendous growth potential. Yesterday we announced an agreement with Clise Properties to acquire a 49% ownership interest in the Westin Building Exchange in Seattle shown here on Page 3. The Westin Building is one of the most densely interconnected facilities in North America. It is home to leading global cloud content and interconnection providers with over 150 carriers and more than 10,000 cross-connects. As you are probably aware, we've closed $1.4 billion of asset sales over the past three months. Pro forma for the asset sales of Westin Building and the combination with Interxion, network dense performance sensitive assets will make up nearly half our portfolio, up from a little over one-fourth as of September 30th. Taken together, you can see the strategic direction uniting each of these individual pieces. We are deliberately recycling capital from stabilized assets and reinvesting in higher growth opportunities sacrificing near-term earnings growth for long-term value creation. We've also made significant strides extending our sustainability leadership as outlined here on Page 4. In October, we announced renewable energy agreements in Northern Virginia and Oregon. In November, we were honored to receive NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability for the third consecutive year. In January, we earned EPA ENERGY STAR Certification for exemplary energy performance in 29 data centers. The second year in a row we are in the most ENERGY STAR Certifications in the sector. Also in January, we issued \u20ac1.4 billion of green euro bonds. This was our third green bond issuance, and we are now the largest U.S. REIT green bond issuer. Our green bond framework is aligned with ICMA Green Bond Principles, with a second party opinion provided by Sustainalytics. Also in January, and away from Digital, some of our largest customers and investors unveiled sweeping sustainability commitments with a particular emphasis on improved disclosure for shareholders. We have included SASB-aligned disclosures in our 10-K for the past two years and our ESG Report includes extensive additional information about our approach to managing the impact of climate change. Our ESG Report also addresses relevant themes of the TCFD framework. We are committed to managing our environmental impact and then optimizing our use of energy and natural resources, because we believe it's the right thing to do, and because it matters to our customers, our investors and our employees. We are committed to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and serving a social purpose. In January, we announced the appointment of two new directors, expanding the size of our Board from nine to 11. The governance principle behind our Board refreshment philosophy is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. The average tenure on our Board is less than six years, whereas, our Chairman and former Chairman have both served on the Board since our IPO. We are particularly excited about the new perspectives and expertise our two new Directors will bring to the Board. Specifically, Alexis Black Bjorlin brings unique connectivity and customer perspective from her experience at leading global providers across the cloud and communications value chain. While Lieutenant General Dash Jamieson brings in valuable cyber security expertise from her tenure as former Director of U.S. Air Force Intelligence Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Cyber Effects Operations. We are delighted to welcome them both to our Board and we look forward to benefiting from their leadership and expertise for years to come. Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on Interxion. In early January, we raised \u20ac1.7 billion of euro bonds with a weighted average maturity of approximately seven years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 1%. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from these bonds to refinance Interxion 's outstanding debt. The bond offering is not contingent upon completion of the combination with Interxion, but if the combination is not consummated before the end of next January, then we will be required to redeem \u20ac1.4 billion of the euro bonds at 101% of par. In late January, the SEC declared our S-4 registration statement effective and we launched the exchange offer for shares of Interxion. Purely after our registration statement went effective, Interxion filed its Schedule 14D-9, which included the background on the transaction from their perspective, fairness opinions from their advisers and their Board's unanimous recommendation in support of the exchange offer. Once the Schedule 14D-9 was filed, both companies began mailing proxy materials for our respective shareholder meetings, which are scheduled for February 27. In terms of the regulatory process, we've received clearance from the antitrust authorities in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands and we are now just waiting for decisions on our foreign investment filings in France, and Germany where we currently own and operate data centers. In terms of integration, planning activities are underway, but until the transaction closes, it remains business as usual and we continue to operate as two independent companies. In terms of timing, we remain on-track and subject to regulatory clearance and other closing conditions, we expect to close sometime in the second quarter. Let's turn to Page 6. During the fourth quarter, we launched PlatformDIGITAL, a continuation of our focus on the customer in an evolution of our Connected Campus strategy as we also unveiled our platform roadmap to underpin the next wave of digital transformation in response to market demand. Enterprise customers are demanding a global fit for purpose data center platform experience to rapidly deploy, connect and host distributed IT infrastructure to scale their digital business. To address this demand, we introduced four solution offers productizing specific combinations of space, power, cross-connect and management controls. These solutions enable enterprise deployments of network, security and data infrastructure at global points of business presence. The launch of PlatformDIGITAL has been well-received by industry, including customers, partners and industry analysts. At MarketplaceLIVE in November, Cisco, IBM and Vapor launched partner validated versions of PlatformDIGITAL solutions and numerous industry analysts published highlight reports. We are excited about the PlatformDIGITAL launch as it positions us to capture the significant incremental addressable market by serving the global needs of the enterprise. Let's turn to the favorable secular demand drivers underlying our business along with industry analysts recognition of the leadership role Digital Realty has to play here on Page 7. According to the IDC CEO Survey, digital transformation is expected to enable over $18 trillion of economic value add over the next three years. Gartner recently paid enterprise global IT spending at almost $4 trillion, reflecting rapidly growing investment to build distributed IT and data center infrastructure. During the fourth quarter Digital Realty was named as a worldwide leader in the IDC MarketScape Colocation and Interconnection Services Vendor Assessment Report, noting that PlatformDIGITAL provides a global scale platform to enable digital transformation in a consistent modular basis. We are honored by the strong confirmation of Digital Realty's unique positioning to capture the global data center demand opportunity. We continue to see early indicators of digital transformation demand on our platform, we captured a record number of new logos last year led by our enterprise vertical, as these customers begin to deploy and connect components of their digital infrastructure globally. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs, we believe, we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to take you through our financial results. Matt Mercier : Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on Page 9. We delivered another solid quarter of leasing activity with particular strength in APAC and the Americas, we signed total bookings of $69 million, just shy of our all-time second best, fourth quarter bookings included a $7 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $62 million, with a weighted average lease term of a little over six years, including an $8 million colocation contribution. I would like to point out that we see the lines blurring between product types and the distinction is becoming less meaningful. As a result, we expect to evolve our disclosure in the coming quarters to more closely align with our customers' buying behavior and the way we manage the business. We aim to consistently improve the transparency of our financial disclosures and as always, we welcome additional input from analysts and investors in the process. During the fourth quarter, we added 51 new logos. This was our third highest new logo quarter and our two best came in 3Q '19 and 2Q '19. For the full year, we added 250 new logos. Nearly, 40% better than the prior year, underscoring the traction we're gaining within our enterprise segment. In APAC, we saw strength in Sydney, Singapore and Osaka. In the Americas, we quietly leased another 18 megawatts and Ashburn during the fourth quarter and similar to the previous quarter our biggest deal in this market was just 6 megawatts, demonstrating broad-based strengths of demand. As Andy predicted last quarter, the Ashburn pendulum has swung back a bit quicker than just about anyone expected a year ago. In the tremendous scale and the connectivity of our Ashburn Connected Campus outperformed in a crowded, competitive backdrop. On the heels of additional activities since year-end our Northern Virginia active development pipeline is now 100% pre-leased. We've not yet begun to see upward pressure on pricing given competitive supply elsewhere in the market, but rental rates have stabilized. We are beginning to field mutually exclusive requirements for the remaining capacity and available blocks of contiguous inventory are becoming scarce. Needless to say, while the Ashburn market is not entirely out of the supply and demand woods just yet, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects for communications, infrastructure in the Commonwealth, as well as our position in the market, given the diversity of our large and growing installed base of customers seeking additional footprint on the campus, as well as the value of our strategic land holdings, which provide the longest run rate for their growth. Several specific fourth quarter wins speak directly to our ability to address customer needs with our global platform and full product spectrum offering. PathAI is the world's leading provider of AI-powered technology for advancing pathology research, using machine learning and deep learning techniques to drive towards faster, more accurate diagnosis of diseases like cancer. The Boston based startup partners with some of the world's largest life science companies, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, LabCorp and Gilead Sciences. As a company that was born in and until now operated exclusively in the cloud, this is PathAI's first deployment of physical infrastructure. Given the GPU intensive nature of their IT environment and the rapid growth, PathAI was struggling to control their monthly cloud spend. Their deployment into Digital Realty move-in ready capacity will enable them to pull over 80% of their GPU workload out of the cloud to better manage and predict the cost associated with their high performance computing environment. Our PlatformDIGITAL solution address multiple needs for a global social media provider, including the need for network point of presence with the ability to connect directly to our communities of interest locally and globally, as well as a testing environment for their larger deployment in the same location. This customer was able to leverage our Connected Campus and Internet Gateway, which is really the power of PlatformDIGITAL. The ability to connect to the subsea cable that provide substantial bandwidth for traffic to markets across Asia Pacific was another key driver. They trusted the Digital Realty team and we're confident, we can move quickly, think creatively and most importantly, execute. We enjoyed notable success, re-leasing previously occupied or move-in ready inventory with the U.S. based designer, developer, manufacturer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. The Digital Realty team closed a multi-site, multi-country deal with this customer that included a combination of move-in ready locations whilst a large colocation deployment. Digital Realty was awarded the business due to our ability to quickly negotiate terms while remaining flexible in scope to be into market and expansion options. This win was a prime example of our global multi-product platform meeting our customers' digital transformation need. Last but not least, just to give you an example of the breadth of companies using PlatformDIGITAL to enable and help scale their business, we landed a deal this quarter with an advertising company that creates patented, world-class ad tech that delivers viewable high impact ad formats for brands, agencies and publishers looking to maximize ROI. They serve their global client base through an unmissable digital ad formats using patented ad serving technology. They selected Digital Realty because we offer a flexible solution they could customize as they grew, as well as connectivity to global Internet providers. Turning to our backlog on Page 11. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stepped up from $99 million as of September 30th, to a $116 million at year-end. The lag between signings and commencements during the fourth quarter was a bit better than our long-term historical average at four months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 12. We signed a $117 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. As you may recall, 2019 was our all-time high in terms of lease expirations and we signed over $500 million of renewal leasing in 2019, more than 50% higher than our previous record year with a weighted average lease term of nearly nine years. For the full year, we retained a little over 80% of expiring leases right in line with our long-term average while cash rents rolled down 1.3%, much better than our initial expectation of down high single-digits. As you may recall, we successfully executed both legacy deal our long-term top customer renewals, as well as the long-awaited legacy DFT customer renewal in 2019. As you can see from the lease expirations schedule on Page 13, less than 16% of the portfolio expires in any given year compared to the 23% we faced at the beginning of last year, which should set the stage for a low churn hurdle going forward. Aside from a few select supply constrained regions in metro areas, we have yet to see broad based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals, a lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rates and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerge in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of fourth quarter operating performance. Overall portfolio occupancy slipped 60 basis points to 86.8%, due to a handful of move-outs across the portfolio. After successfully navigating the record expiration year in 2019, we expect to generate positive net absorption in 2020 with improving portfolio occupancy on the heels of significant progress back filling this recently available capacity. For the full year, same capital cash NOI was down 4%, at the low end of our guidance and reflecting an 80 basis point FX headwind, continued pressure on property taxes as well as the record high lease expirations in 2019. Although, we still face some same-store headwinds from higher property taxes and downtime from refurbishing and re-leasing available capacity. We do expect to see improvement going forward. The U.S. dollar continued to climb relative to prior year exchange rates and FX represented roughly a 70 basis point headwind for the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 14. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with long-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 20 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth core FFO per share was down 3.6% year-over-year. Primarily due to two months of dilution from the Mapletree joint venture, while we are not providing formal guidance for 2020 at this time given the number of moving parts related to our pending strategic combination with Interxion, as well as the acquisition of our partners interest in the Westin Building. We do want to share a few forward-looking data points. On a standalone basis, we expect reported top line revenue growth for Digital Realty to be roughly flat year-over-year. Reflecting the full year impact of $1.4 billion of asset sales as well as a one quarter consolidated revenue contribution from Ascenty in 2019. Prior to closing the joint venture with Brookfield on the last day of 1Q '19. Adjusting for the revenue related to these private capital efforts and excluding any potential contribution from the Westin Building acquisition, we expect to generate organic revenue growth in the mid single-digits in 2020. We expect to maintain industry leading EBITDA margins in line with the prior year. In terms of financing, we have positioned the balance sheet with outsized liquidity in anticipation of closing the combination with Interxion. In January, we closed on the $557 million Mapletree portfolio sale at a 6.6% cap rate. We also successfully raised \u20ac1.7 billion of Euro bonds at a blended coupon of 1%. As you may recall, \u20ac1.4 billion of these Euro bonds will initially be used to refinance Interxion 's outstanding debt. These bonds included a special mandatory redemption provision and will be retired at 101% of par if the Interxion transaction does not close. Last but not least, we expect to settle our $1.1 billion equity forward in the third quarter. Hopefully, this high level color provides some context for our 2020 outlook and we expect to provide formal guidance, along with the underlying assumptions on the heels of closing the combination with Interxion. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 15. Net debt-to-EBITDA dropped by four-tenths of a turn to 5.7 times at year end. As proceeds from Mapletree joint venture were used to pay down debt. While fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.1 times. Pro forma for the Mapletree portfolio sale and settlement of the forward equity offering, net debt to EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at approximately 5 times. While fixed charge coverage is approximately 4.6 times. In terms of capital raising activity, in early October, we raised $345 million of perpetual preferred equity at 5.2%, an all-time low preferred equity coupon for Digital Realty. The next day we opportunistically tapped the euro bond market, raising approximately \u20ac550 million of 8.5 year paper at 1 and 8. Finally, in early January, we came back to the euro bond market and raised the \u20ac1.7 billion of euro bonds to refinance Interxion 's outstanding debt. Bill mentioned the weighted average maturity was approximately seven years and the weighted average coupon was approximately 1%. This successful execution against our financing strategy is a reflection of the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 16, our weighted average debt maturities over six years, and including the January bond issuance, we whittled our weighted average coupon down another 25 basis points this quarter to 2. 9%, a little less than half our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 16, we have a clear run rate with virtually no near-term debt maturities and a no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also position the dual growth opportunities for our customers around the globe. Consistent with our long term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Sean, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jon Atkin : So my first question is around the transaction with Interxion and wondering, if you have any sort of thoughts about the anticipated timing around the foreign investment filings in France and Germany that you alluded to? And then as you proceed with planning, I know you're understandably limited to a degree, prior to the close. But what steps are you able to take over in Europe, prior to the transaction close to facilitate the integration once the deal is concluded? Greg Wright : Jon, it's Greg Wright, let me take your question. The first one, with respect to where we are in the Interxion transaction, again, specifically, let's just go through a couple of things. We have received antitrust clearance as Bill said, in all three jurisdictions where we need approval in terms of Austria, Germany and The Netherlands. And that's on the antitrust clearance side. We're still awaiting decisions for the foreign investment filings in both France and Germany and look, we're - we think - one thing that's encouraging is we're already in both of those markets. And then trying to handicap, when that comes back, it's hard to do. But we will say, so far, we feel like we're making progress where we should be. And that's really all we have at this point, but we'll continue to announce to the market as we get additional findings there. That was your first question. On the second question, with respect to the steps to integration, we're currently planning for integration, as you could imagine. So far though, the primary focus has been on regulatory approvals going effective with the SEC and launching our exchange offshore. And now we have started to ramp up the integration effort with our colleagues, Interxion. We've gotten to the point where we're identifying people and teams to lead the integration. We've identified and we're working with integration consultants. And we were at a point where we're allowed to have certain people on both sides connect with each other. And clearly, we're making sure that we always consult with the lawyers to make sure we do the right things where we can and can't. So that's where we are with respect to that. Jon Atkin : And then maybe just a follow-up more on the operational side, but PlatformDIGITAL, curious which metros you've been seeing the most commercial progress towards driving more connectivity driven and retail business. Any color around sales cycles and is there any kind of lengthening or shortening that you're seeing as well as kind of book-to-bill trends you talked about that, I think maybe in reference to wholesale, but anything sort of commercially as it relates to connectivity and then retail and PlatformDIGITAL would be interesting to hear. Corey Dyer : Jonathan, this is Corey Dyer. Just going to help out with the PlatformDIGITAL question you had. And you asked a little bit about where we see it happening and where we see it taking route to begin. And I would tell you that, that platform digital really is about the enterprise and selling globally. So it's not really a situation where we're going to look at specific markets for it. But, that said, we launched it in November in MarketplaceLIVE, our new event that we put out or resurrected, really good feedback from all the media analysts, the analysts themselves. If you look the IDC report that we referenced earlier, it has just up in the leader segment for that along with one of their group. So really happy with how it's been rolled out and what we're seeing from traction with customers. So it's been great there, across the entire globe for us. We referenced earlier at couple of different wins. We had one of the largest investment banks, deployed six different network hubs with us to help out with their architecture, as well as servicing their customers and their employees. We also have a large agricultural firm do the same kind of deployment across multiple regions with us. So we've seen it pickup really well for us. And then, I think your questions around commencement date with the follow-on question I think Jordan. And what we think we're going to see is a little bit shortening of that. To your point around wholesale, we tend to see that commence a little bit later. These are going to drive a little bit more co-location for us, a lot more enterprise wins and you'll see a much quicker or shorter time between booking and commencement. I think that answered all the questions. Greg, do you have anything else? Greg Wright : No, I think you've covered it. Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Market. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : So just wanted to circle up to the Seattle acquisition that you announced and discussed on the call here. The thought process on this transaction and the return profile relative to sort of legacy digital and perhaps as well as the growth profile versus Digital. And then, maybe thinking how this sort of corresponds or relate to sort of what you're doing over in Europe if at all. Greg Wright : Jordan, this is Greg. Let me take that question. And like with respect to the Westin transaction, look, I think Bill had gone through really the merits of the transaction, whether it's boosting connectivity and network density. As he mentioned, this is the sixth most interconnected building in North America, you have 250 plus networks and over 10,000 cross connects. It really is the Internet gateway to the Pacific Northwest. And when you look at it in terms of connectivity. First of all, the way the process start is our partner has been a terrific partner, the Colony's family and their company. We've had a longstanding relationship with them. And they decided they wanted to sell. So for us, given how much and we've always said, our strategy has been that we want to increase our ownership to Internet Gateway and highly connected assets. And you really when you and that's your mandate, you can't get any better than the Westin building. So that was really the rationale behind it. In terms of returns, look, I would say I sort of a mid to high 5% cap rate, call that little less than 18 times on an EBITDA multiple basis. And in terms of growth projections, I mean. clearly, with any of these highly connected Internet Gateway buildings, we expect greater growth one than our portfolio average, just because these buildings as we know from Saramacca, 60 Hudson and the like. Those buildings are very special. And so you really do get outsize growth with them. So that was really the strategic rationale. In response to your question with respect to Europe, It's a very similar strategy when you really think about it, right? In terms of the Interaction transaction, I mean, we've said for quite some time now. We've had several objectives. One was we did want to expand our footprint in Europe. Secondly, we wanted to increase our ownership again of Internet Gateway and highly connected assets. We really were striving for a leading European platform and the team. And with all that, we were looking for a significant development platform. And needless to say, with Interaction, we get all of that. And so one of the real benefits to digital there. And then, we're going to get a broader footprint and product offering to serve our customers, which is most important. In Europe and beyond, we're going to be able to do a lot of what they do best and overlay that onto our portfolio. That too is going to result. just as we talked about the Westin building and accelerated growth. And ultimately, with the combination of all of that, it's going to result in increased value creation in our minds. So, I think I've covered your questions Jordan. If I missed, please let me know. Jordan Sadler : No, I think you nailed it. I assume we're going to close in the next couple of months or so. But as it relates to, I'll move on to Ashburn, I wanted to come back. It sounded like, yes, you are quietly signing some significant leases here 18 meg. Can you maybe provide sort of the - were there any new logos in that market signed in the quarter? And then, anything else you can sort of, any other insight you can offer in terms of availability within your portfolio. You said you're, I thought you said part of, I think you said you were largely leased on your development there. But it sounds like you're sorting out some or scoping out some availability as well. Matt Mercier : Yes, Jordan. This is Matt. So I think we've had a lot of success in Northern Virginia both this quarter and last quarter. This quarter Northern Virginia was our number one market for leasing. And overall, I think as we've said in the prepared commentary the market really come - really come back in the second half of the year, although absorption was down, down a bit from 2018 was actually higher than 2017 overall. I think to your question, specific question subsequent to end of the quarter, we leased another 20 megawatt in that market, 12 megawatt of those were in the - our development portfolio, which now brings add up to a 100% lease and another 8 megawatt was within our operating portfolio, which was already I think slightly over 90% leased, so, improves the occupancy in that market as well, so we're excited about the Northern Virginia market and we're continuing to see robust demand there. Greg Wright : Yes. Thanks, Jordan. I'd also like to add a little bit of - just overall work that we've done in that market with our master plans and our land banking. It really allows us to be very prudent on how we can bring infrastructure to our customers in a very balanced manner. And I think new logos is one way to look at it, but it's also new types of infrastructure coming to market. So as you see AI and machine learning becoming more prevalent with all of these major providers, they want to be in proximity to their existing infrastructure. So the work that we've done in that market to master plan the right of ways, and really start to think through how we can future prove to their existing assets and provide a path for them to grow and launch all these new services. It's something that's very unique in that market and we continue to look at the future growth there. It'd be differentiated than what we can provide through a lot of those customers, Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : A couple if I could. I am just going to following on onto last question, it's probably pretty wide range a commentary, about kind of the funnel hyperscale demand in general. Maybe just tie that back to your commentary about Ashburn, what you're seeing there and this funnel in general. And then one of the interactions, if I could maybe remind me about the tax ability for that deal for Interaction Investor were seeing the other details behind that. Corey Dyer : So Michael, this is Cory, I'll take the first part of the question around just the Ashburn competition, because I think that's what you're driving and we'll figure out somebody else for the other questions around the taxes. First off, yes, we've been successful in Ashburn, really about the value of our platform and really the diverse offering that we have. You think about what we've got with customers that are already there and how they're going to build onto it. So, we've got some customers that are already installed there and they're looking for adjacency in the campus, adjacency sometimes in the same building. So that helps us a lot. The same customers are often the scaling customers that we're working with globally and having the relationships from the contracts and everything we do to take care of them on a regular basis, helps us continue to win those deals and those opportunities. And then finally, yes, we're working through the Tetris game of how we accommodate the demand that's continue to come for us and make sure that we're there to take care of them and continuing to build on our success in Ashburn. So we're excited about it. And I think you also asked about our plat our qualified pipeline and we're feeling very strong about that. So we're well positioned for this year with a good start. Michael Funk : And then just a follow-on. Greg Wright : Mike. Let me... Michael Funk : Sorry, go ahead Greg Wright : Sorry, go ahead. Michael Funk : I've got a follow-on, I think you clarified so, I mean are you saying that kind of diversity of the customer base is I guess 80 new Westin bookings that you're seeing more diverse customer base, whether it's industry wide or geographically. Is that part we're seeing here? Matt Mercier : Yes. Let me, this is Matt. Let me take. I mean, we saw in Northern Virginia, we had pretty widespread activity across multiple customers within cloud, content and gaming, we're really leading the way within that market. And also, a number of international clients coming into Northern Virginia. So we had major signs of also APAC-based technology companies within that market as well in the quarter and we expect to continue that going forward. Greg Wright : Yes. Hey, Michael, it's Greg. Sorry to interrupt you there before. And look, with respect to your second question on taxation of the Interxion transaction, you're right. Look something as we had outlined in the S-4, and I had actually mentioned on the original call. The deal is taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for U.S. holders of the Interxion shares. I think there's a couple of things to consider. Look, there were numerous tax considerations when we structured this deal. Their side was well represented and as was ours. We worked and ultimately, we're trying to find as what's the most efficient structure? Quite frankly that allow us to pay the price that we paid. And so, there's a couple of points in the structure we ultimately came up with was that structure, but a couple of points to highlight. One is not all shareholders pay U.S. tax some are exempt. And secondly, not all shareholders have the same basis, right. If somebody bought yesterday, they may have a very minimal gain than they sold today. Third, and I think most bankers will tell you, when you look at it. Taxable transactions are more common when the market value of what's being paid is significantly greater than the tax basis. And the reason for that obviously, is if you get the stepped-up basis, you get tax shelter going forward, which allows us to retain significantly more capital in the company to grow the business. Hence, the ability to pay. And then finally, I think it's important to note, that the way we've structured the transaction, that all tendering shareholders, it's structured to such that they will be able to avoid the 15% Dutch withholding tax as long as they tender. So I hope that answers your question with respect to the tax impact? Michael Funk : No, that's great detail. Thank you very much, guys Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : I had two questions on some of the metrics. So, first, in terms of the commentary on cash releasing spreads, can you unpack a little bit more on what happened in the quarter and the experience that you're seeing between the retail and colo side of the business? And maybe some of the larger deployments from your customers? And then, there was a comment about expecting the same store NOI to be better? And I was wondering, if that meant for 2020 less of a decline or actually net positive growth? And just how to think about what's happening in the mix of all of that? Thanks. Greg Wright : Yes, so let me take the - your second question, then we can circle back on your first one. So within the quarter, yes, we came in at in terms of stabilized NOI growth at the lower end. I think as we said in the commentary, we had about a 1% negative impact from FX rates. We also had another 1% coming in from higher, what I call uncontrollable cost largely around property taxes. And then I'd say, the remaining was tie to what we also discussed with - which was our record expiration year in 2019, despite also having roughly 80% retention, which is a pretty good metric. What I'd say though there is where we see the green shoots is in the fourth quarter, we're at least 15 megawatts into available inventory, which during that - during the quarter was about 40% of our total sign. And seeing in our backlog today, we have about 100 basis points of improved occupancy. In the vast majority of our available inventory right now, I think, is in high demand core markets that we feel pretty positive about the progress within our organic growth going forward. And I think that kind of - that tells also into releasing spreads. We had - within the - more within the year we release over like we said a record year we released over $500 million, slightly down but also did better than we expected. Next year we have a step down in volume of expirations in 2021. So we feel pretty positive about our mark-to-market experience going forward on that front. Operator : Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thank you. Circling back on the deal you announced yesterday with the 49% - additional 49% the Westin property. What's the ability to sort of expand internally or is there any sort of adjacent land that you could potentially develop on that you can - capture additional opportunities? Chris Sharp : Yes. Thanks, Erik, this is Chris. So, definitely we're very excited about the Westin Building. There is some ability to expand there and with some of the new offerings that Bill and Matt talked about in the script earlier around, some of the new offerings that we're bringing to market and how they are leveraging a lot more interconnection, we'll be able to provide more value to the existing customer base in there. And there is some more power that we can bring through there. and I think ownership really gives us that ability to really control exactly how we evolve that infrastructure and really make sure that we get the maximum return for our customers. And I'll turn the second part of your question over to Craig, and let him talk about adjacent lands. Greg Wright : Yes. Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Erik. Look, in terms of adjacent land. I think one thing, it's important, we do own the building next door with our partners at Clise that's important to remember. But I think, one thing about Westin, that it's not just the land next door. I think when you look at the connectivity into Canada and to Asia Pacific, even in to our Hillsboro project. When you look at all that, it is going to give us connectivity across the board and all the connection points. So that's one of the things that's great value with the project like the Westin, if it goes beyond just immediately adjacent - adjacency next door. But instead it goes much broader given the connectivity subsea cables and other things that provide us with that connectivity. So that would be my answer with that. But we - but if there is building, if there is land next door and if I know about it, please let us know because we liked the site. Thank you. Erik Rasmussen : And then maybe just my follow-up. Any sort of update on Brazil and what sort of happening with the Ascenty, how much did they contribute to the America this quarter? And you're seen things start to what's your assessment of that market right now? Greg Wright : Erik, it's Greg. Let me, why don't I answer the first question and then let - Let me, I'll start with second question and let Matt answer the first question. Look, I think when we look at Ascenty and you take a look at 2019 versus budget, we're on top of our writing for 2019. And I think a couple of important takeaways in that market, we saw a lot of the - large U.S, cloud service providers, take a lot of space over the last 24 months. With that said, I want to make sure we're clear on that. If you guys remember when we did that transaction there were 14 assets, there were eight existing assets and six under construction. Those 14 assets right now are 99% leased. So I think that's important. We look at underlying demand and the Ascenty platform remains in our opinion, the dominant platform in the region. So we think we're going to continue to see significant follow-on growth opportunities in additional markets like Chile. And we think, what you'll see is, again, I think there was a slight pause in this last quarter, but we'll see that like we see elsewhere, you'll see the, the demand starts to come back from the customers at that point. Once they absorb and we think you're going to see demand pick-up and we think Chris and his team have done a terrific job and they have an attractive pipeline for 2020. But in terms of how much it contributed Matt would be in better position to answer that. Matt Mercier : Yes. I mean, I think. I think it was the contribution to the quarter was minimal. But what we're seeing right now in the first quarter is an acceleration. They've already signed in the first quarter, more than they did in the fourth quarter. So the positive momentum there in the South American portfolio, similar to what we're seeing in our overall portfolio as the cloud providers continue to ramp up, what we see as their demand overall. Erik Rasmussen : All right, Matt. Thanks. Chris Sharp : There is a little bit of - this is Chris, just on the PlatformDIGITALTM element that we talked about in the script. I think you're seeing early days of a lot of customers going into that market. And so we really see that ecosystem starting to really build out there, and it's a critical element that I think it's important to highlight the fact that it's a customer-led expansion down there. And so, it's still early days like Matt was referencing. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Interesting to get the commentary on Ashburn, that's encouraging. Can you just talk about to what extent there is sort of changes in the competitive dynamic there? Are you seeing any change in the kind of positioning of the private players in terms of committing capital or delaying builds any supply side changes? And then it's good to see the lease renewals being spread out from here, but are there any particular churn events we should be aware of or should -do you expect churn to be fairly linear through the year? Thanks. Chris Sharp : No. I think, Simon, this is Chris, definitely Ashburn is a phenomenal market. It's very unique in the industry as we all know. But definitely from the private competitors, I think one of the things that's often overlooked is the fact that platforms matter in their increasing importance to our customers where they have access to broader revenue in every major market around the globe. And I think also the fact that you can land and expand with us and the work that we've done to build out land banks and beyond what some of these smaller private companies were able to achieve. So that's really a big differentiator for us. And then the overall supply like we had referenced earlier the fact that we've worked with our VMI, or vendor managed piece and a lot of our build outs there, we're very prudent in the way that we can accelerate and build capacity in a very flexible manner to meet that customer requirement and I kind of hand Greg off for the second part of your question there. Greg Wright : Yes. Thanks, Chris. And Simon, I would say echo obviously everything Chris said, and the other important factor here is, look I think by definition when you look and see at the supply and demand situation, it's still exist in Northern Virginia that we'd be very surprised if you see any private new capital coming in deployed a development property in that market. Now what we have seen is some of that space, to Chris's point, where they may not be leased, that's where you see some of the concessions and a like occurring, but we're keeping our eye on that as well. Going back to Bill Stein's routes to be opportunistic and that's one of the reason Bill and Andy are always preaching that and Matt that we always keep the balance sheet pristine and be ready. So look, I think that's how, as Chris said, he talked about the advantages we're having in the market. We're having success. But we think that's because of our platform. And so look, we'll look to take advantage, otherwise, to the extent we can. Chris Sharp : Yes. And... Simon Flannery : And I think on churn... Chris Sharp : At all. Yes, I'll hit on the churn. I mean I think as you kind of saw in our slides in our remarks, we had an elevated overall exploration pool this year, but our churn was relatively in line with our historical average around 80%. We've got a pretty material step down in our exploration pool for next year and we're actually expecting our churn to be even, well, I'm sorry, our retention to be even better in 2020 than what we experienced in 2019. So we're pretty positive about our overall portfolio and the management of the lease it's coming back at us in 2020. Operator : Our next question will come from Ari Klein with BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Ari Klein : On the M&A front, clearly a lot on the plate with Interxion on Westin in the works. But Equinix recently announced the acquisition of Packet. I was interested in your views on whether Digital could pursue similar types of deals as you build out the interconnection platform and are those things customers are asking for? Chris Sharp : No. Thanks, Ari. This is Chris. I'm happy to talk through that. So it was definitely something that was expected in the market. I think the way that we look at this is we have a philosophical difference there, where we really look at our platform is being open. And one of the core things that we value is not competing with our customers and partners, and one of the things that we often look at is how can we invest in them is rather than compete with them. And so some of the work that we've done building out one of the largest SDN fabrics of the world with our service exchange which is powered by Megaport is something critical to us. But one of the other key elements inside of this is, it doesn't change our focus, right. We're building the only global fit for purpose data center platform and it's underpinned by an open ecosystem approach which we want to allow our partners to provide those higher value - higher value, higher up the stack services like Packet is providing. And so we see our approach in being a foundational element to a lot of our partners and customers, being able to service that bare metal opportunity that Packet has looked at, because there is a lot of customers have out there who have already solved that. And so we'd rather focus on solving for more of the data gravity issues and building out a fit for purpose capability for global reach or partnering with the capability if you will. So that's kind of how we view that transaction happening in the market, but we still see ourselves is aligning with our partners and customers and empowering their solutions in a unique way to solve for this enterprise need on a global basis. Operator : Our next question will come from Robert Palmisano with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Robert Palmisano : I made a play that we make the call. So I want to follow up on that on the Packet thing that and possibly adding some additional tools. I mean, I understand the industry not wanting to compete with the customer is now consistently heard that. But do you think maybe there is a point where the industry is a little too religious on that and there could be some more commoditized thing the network being used by some other elements where you could be leaving some money on the table and wouldn't necessarily you take the customers are you getting more direct feedback from them? And then secondly, the follow up, what are you seeing as far as our potential rent roll downs and do you think there is a risk of any of higher churn this year for many customers that might walk rather than move right now? Thanks. Bill Stein : No, actually, I'll take the first part of that question. So we - one of the things that I think is great about Digital and we spend a tremendous amount of time is we're customer-led, right. And our extreme customer focus is we listen to what their needs are, and one of the elements is you do well right and just continue to do that. And one of the things that we have done very well, which is centered around PlatformDIGITAL is again that global reach and that repetitive nature of a fit for purpose product right. That's very unique in the industry that allows customers to do tab, cage or megawatt. But one of the things that we've looked at is in these higher up the stack services, it's not in our remit. And so when we see a lot of these things happen in other industries, either the service fails or that the service becomes pretty complacent rather quickly, so because it's an ever evolving landscape, particularly around bare metal and there's a lot of customers out there - are companies out there that are creating these bare metal solutions. What we see is happening in the market, as you have a purpose-built infrastructure for certain types of workloads right, and so a tuck-in acquisition like this will only give you so much benefit for so long and us being able to align with some of the bellwether powerhouses in the industry would be a better solution for our enterprises to really get the full benefit out of the deployment with Digital. And the second part of the question, I'll hand it over to Matt. Matt Mercier : Yes. I think your question again was kind of centered on churn and mark-to-market. And again, I kind of reiterate some of the comments. So we work through a 25% almost of our portfolio this year. We have a material step down. The amount is of our leases and contracts expiring next year. We feel bullish both on our ability to retain above average within that full expiring in this through this year down 2020, as well as our ability to maintain rates and be positive on that front. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for any closing remarks. Bill Stein : Thank you, Shaun. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our 2019 highlights as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we strategically expanded our global platform, entering Chile with an anchor lease with a leading global cloud provider, acquiring a key land parcel in South Korea and reaching agreements to explore joint venture in India with the Adani Group, and to combined with Interxion to create a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions with an enhanced presence in Europe. Two, we successfully executed on our private capital initiative, closing $1.4 billion of asset sales over the last three months and redeploying those proceeds into highly strategic investments. Three, we launched PlatformDIGITAL, a unique global data center platform designed to enable customers to scale digital business and we landed a record number of new logos in 2019. Last but not least, we further strengthen our balance sheet, raising $3.4 billion of long-term debt and preferred equity at a weighted average coupon of 3.1%. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us and we hope to see many of you on the Spring Conference Survey. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Shawn. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Stein : Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. The last 90 days have been unlike anything that we've experienced in our lifetime, and our hearts go out to all those who have been directly impacted by COVID-19 especially those who've lost loved ones. No one has been immune to this crisis, but the data center industry has been fortunate to remain open for business while huge portions of the global economy have been put on hold. As you probably know, data centers have been classified as critical infrastructure and essential businesses by government agencies around the world. Our top priority is, of course, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. The entire data center industry has delivered a strong track record of operational excellence and uptime throughout this crisis. Digital Realty has made 100% uptime. And while we have deferred preventative maintenance and have asked customers to limit site visits to critical activities, our doors have remained open and our data centers continue to provide the trusted foundation for the digital economy. Business continuity is our core competency. We have a full-fledged pandemic playbook to ensure that we maintain service levels while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. We have received very high marks from our customers for our professional protocol and proactive communications throughout the crisis. For this, we owe a debt of gratitude to our operations team and particularly our frontline employees in critical data center roles. Despite the challenging environment, they have continued coming to work so that industries, governments and families can continue to connect, keep in touch and keep commerce and information flowing. We are deeply appreciative of their efforts. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on page four. In early January, we issued \u20ac1.4 billion of green euro bonds. This was our third green bond issuance, and we are now the largest U.S. REIT green bond issuer. Our green bond framework is aligned with the ICMA green bond principles with a second-party opinion provided by Sustainalytics. In mid-January, we announced that we had achieved EPA ENERGY STAR Certification for an industry-leading 29 data centers last year. In early April, we were honored to be the first data center provider to receive an EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for Energy Management. Finally, in late April, we announced a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. On the social front, we are fortunate to be in a position to give back in the midst of this crisis. We have undertaken a comprehensive, philanthropic initiative consisting of corporate contributions, employee-matching gifts and community outreach initiatives to help support organizations combating COVID-19 around the world. We are also waiving fees for expanded service exchange connectivity for the next six months to help customers in the government, medical, emergency services and educational verticals keep critical services running. On the governance front, Jean Mandeville has joined the Board of Directors, bolstering the additions of Alexis B. Bjorlin and Dash Jamieson in January. Jean was previously Chairman of the Board at Interxion. And he has extensive experience in the technology and telecom sectors, having previously served as the CFO of Global Crossing and Singapore Technologies Telemedia as well as President of APAC for British Telecom. We are pleased to welcome Jean to the Board, and we look forward to benefiting from his leadership and expertise. On a more bittersweet note, we also have a departure to announce. Former Chairman, Dennis Singleton, has reached mandatory retirement age and will not be standing for reelection at our annual meeting. Dennis had a distinguished career prior to joining our Board, most notably as a founding partner of Spieker Properties. He has served as a Digital Realty director since our IPO in 2004, and he served as Chairman of the Board from 2012 to 2017. The company has grown nearly 50-fold since Dennis joined the Board, and he has provided sound counsel and steady leadership through the most critical junctures in the company's history, including the strategic investments that have built the business as well as leadership changes at the Board and the C-suite. He is a true gentleman and his sage counsel and collegial bearing will be sorely missed. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I would like to thank Dennis for his more than 15 years of service to Digital Realty, and we wish him the very, very best. Let's turn to page five, our first quarter investment activity showcased the breadth of our global platform and crystallized the transformation of our business. The highlight of the quarter was, of course, our combination with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction, creating a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions. We also closed the acquisition of a 49% interest in the Westin Building Exchange in Seattle. The Westin Building is one of the most densely interconnected facilities in North America and is home to leading global cloud, content and interconnection providers with over 150 carriers and more than 10,000 cross connects. We closed on the sale of a portfolio of 10 North American data centers to Mapletree in January, generating approximately $550 million of proceeds. We also launched our colocation product offering in Osaka, building upon the success of our hyperscale business in Japan. We opened a new data center in Dublin, the new Clonshaugh facility supports the growth of Dublin's technology sector, which is projected to boom over the next decade. We acquired a small land parcel in Frankfurt, adjacent to our existing Sossenheim campus to accelerate time to market and supply-constrained metro. Separately, Interxion has line of sight on a sizable land parcel expected to represent a strategic extension of its existing Frankfurt campus that would support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity, providing runway to support customer growth in key European metro for years to come. We announced that we turned the power on at SIN12, a 50-megawatt new development in Singapore, partially pre-leased to a major Singaporean bank and a leading global cloud provider. Finally, in April, Interxion announced it has broken ground on Interxion Paris Digital Park, a major expansion project in Paris with up to 85 megawatts of capacity. The first of four new data centers on this site will be Interxion's 8th in Paris. And the first phase is scheduled to open in late 2021. Let's turn to integration on page six. We believe our combination with Interxion has the potential to change the global data center landscape. The combined organization is well placed to meet the growing demand from cloud and content platforms, IT service providers and enterprises seeking colocation, hybrid cloud and hyperscale data center solutions. These are global, long-term opportunities that we are ideally positioned to address. Integration is our top priority for 2020. The combined company offers a comprehensive global platform for our customers and gives us a runway for significant growth. We have obviously had to adapt to the current environment. The transaction closed on March 13, and we began sheltering in place the following week. Many of the initial meetings between teams that would have taken place in person have been virtual instead, and that has obviously created some challenges. But both teams have risen to the challenge. During that first week, we had to implement policies, procedures and customer communications for operating in the midst of a global pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, I'm deeply grateful for the way both teams have come together to continue to serve our customers' needs throughout this crisis. Based on our work prior to closing and within just the past few weeks, we've made progress on our corporate integration efforts, including finalizing our integration governance and combined EMEA leadership structure, which we will be rolling out in the coming weeks. There will be more to come over the next several quarters, but we are pleased with our progress to date. Let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. As we are all aware, the global economy has ground to a halt. As you've heard me say many times before, data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth, and we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business, I'd like to draw your attention to page eight. McKinsey recently conducted a global survey of 3,600 B2B decision-makers on their business outlook and priorities. The surveyed executives stated they value digital interactions with customers as two to three times more important than traditional interactions, reflecting continued need for digital infrastructure and capacity demand for data centers. According to the market intelligence firm Intricately, on average, enterprises utilize 27 cloud products, deployed and consumed across eight points of presence globally. We are seeing indicators of this demand globally across our platform in the volume of new logos led by our enterprise vertical, as these firms shift their strategy to enable digital interactions for their customers. Digital Realty was recently named a worldwide leader in the IDC MarketScape Colocation and Interconnection Services Provider Assessment report, noting PlatformDIGITAL provides a global scale platform to enable digital transformation in a consistent, modular fashion. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our unique positioning to capture the global data center demand opportunity. Given the resiliency of demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meet these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on page 10. As you may have seen from our supplemental reporting package, given the compressed time frame post-closing and the complexity of reconciling different reporting practices with both teams working remotely, we've included the partial period contribution from Interxion in our financial statements, but we have not included Interxion's portfolio statistics in the supplemental until next quarter. We've also tabled most of the changes to our disclosure package we discussed last quarter. We continue to see the lines blurring between product types, and we believe the distinction is becoming less meaningful. As a result, we still expect to evolve our disclosure in the coming quarters to more closely align with our customers' buying behavior and the way we manage the business. We also expect to fully reflect the Interxion portfolio statistics within our disclosure next quarter as well. Nonetheless, we provided a few pro forma data points in summary form here on page 10 to help frame the power of the combined business. I would like to point out that we slightly tweaked our definition of adjusted EBITDA this quarter to include our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture taxes and interest expense. We use net debt to adjusted EBITDA as our primary leverage governor, and we calculate leverage on a look-through basis. In other words, we include our pro rata share of unconsolidated JV debt in the numerator. And we believe that including our pro rata share of unconsolidated JV, joint venture, EBITDA in the denominator is the intellectually honest approach. Our pro rata share of joint venture interest expense and taxes has historically been negligible, but it's becoming more meaningful as we expand our strategic private capital initiative through ventures like Ascenty in Latin America and MC Digital Realty in Japan. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 11. We delivered solid leasing volume with balanced performance across sectors, products and geographies. We signed total bookings of $75 million, our second highest quarter on record. This does not include any contribution from Interxion, which separately signed another $10 million during the first quarter. Interxion's first quarter bookings were entirely colocation and connectivity business, with no single deal larger than 180 kilowatts. Standalone Digital Realty's first quarter bookings included a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $66 million, with a weighted average lease term of nearly seven years, including a $7.5 million colocation contribution. Standalone Digital Realty added 54 new logos during the first quarter on a consolidated basis. In addition, Ascenty landed 20 new logos and Interxion added another 45 for a grand total of 119, underscoring the power of our global platform. In terms of regions, standalone Digital Realty's results showed particular strength in the Americas as well as APAC, notably in Northern Virginia here in the U.S. as well as Singapore in APAC. We leased 25 megawatts in Ashburn during the first quarter, bringing our total over the past three quarters to 57 megawatts. This activity has driven lease-up of active development as well as existing inventory, and we generated nearly 300 basis points of positive net absorption within our Northern Virginia in-service portfolio during the first quarter, from 90% occupied at year-end to 93% as of March 31. We have not yet begun to see meaningful improvement in Northern Virginia market rents, but the available inventory is being rapidly absorbed, and the pendulum appears to be swinging back towards tighter availability and healthy competitive tension. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, we've landed a leading global video streaming platform for their launch across much of Europe, which was a resounding success. Interxion, a Digital Realty company, supports this on-demand, ad-free streaming service by providing their data center infrastructure across five locations in Europe. With the growing demands for OTT video services, this is a sector that relies on highly connected data centers to deliver a superior customer experience, and we are honored to have partnered with its leading provider to help them bring their world-class content to European consumers. We helped a leading European digital service provider stand up a bare-metal cloud offering adjacent to cloud on-ramps in S\u00e3o Paulo to support a major cloud provider's hybrid services in South America on our Ascenty platform. A global financial services firm using NVIDIA GPUs in their high-density compute cabinets chose Digital Realty because we met their high-performance computing requirements, including proximity to their legacy compute environment to ensure ultra-low latency and security. PlatformDIGITAL has been gaining significant momentum since its launch late last year. And customer-spanning industries, geographies and business objectives are making the migration. SEMrush, a SaaS provider offering online visibility and marketing analytics software subscriptions, had a requirement for a data hub with proximity to multiple leading global cloud providers and a global expansion under an aggressive timeline. We were able to solve their needs with a new deployment in Ashburn, including connectivity via our service exchange. Similarly, BIGO, a Singapore-based technology company specializing in AI-enabled video platforms needed a critical infrastructure provider to help them expand into EMEA. BIGO landed on legacy Digital Realty's Frankfurt campus. Interxion's capabilities across the region further solidifies the selection of their ideal partner. We were also able to support the 5G aspirations of a global Fortune 100 service provider by meeting their financial growth and power density requirements. We are continuing to build on our global momentum in the second quarter, and we look forward to helping customers achieve their goals during these uncertain times. Turning to our backlog on page 13. Standalone Digital Realty's curve backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stepped up from $116 million at year-end to $122 million at the end of the first quarter. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit better than our long-term historical average at four and a half months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 14, which again excludes Interxion, we signed $92 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. Activity was heavily skewed to our colocation business, and the weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little over three years. While the positive mark-to-market on colocation renewals largely offset turnkey and PBB roll downs for an average cash re-leasing spread across the product types of negative 1.5%. As you may have seen, our guidance calls for cash re-leasing spreads to be down low single digits. Please keep in mind that our 2020 guidance does include Interxion, whereas we have not reflected Interxion results in our first quarter leasing statistics. Aside from a few select supplies constrained regions and metro areas, we have yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals, the lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerge in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points to 87.2%, largely due to positive absorption in Northern Virginia and Dallas. Same capital cash NOI was down 3.7% due to downtime related to record expirations in 2019 and reflecting a 40 basis point FX headwind. Our full year guidance implies improvement going forward. And barring any unforeseen shocks, we are cautiously optimistic that we put the low watermark for the cycle behind us. As a reminder, Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool, but we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to economic risk mitigation strategies on page 15. The U.S. dollar continued to decline relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 50 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results, from the top to the bottom-line. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we have limited exposure to the businesses that have been most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our April rent collections are in line with our historical average and the sum total of customers who have reached out to request rent relief represent approximately 2% of total revenue. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 11.6% year-over-year. As you may recall, there were several onetime items in 1Q 2019 affecting the year-over-year comparison, including a $0.065 U.K. tax benefit, another $0.065 of interest income on the Brookfield bridge loan and a full quarter contribution from consolidating Ascenty prior to closing the joint venture with Brookfield on the last day of the year ago quarter, whereas we had nearly a full quarter of dilution from the Mapletree asset sales in 1Q 2020. Excluding these non-comparable items, the year-over-year growth would have been up 1.2%. Core FFO per share missed consensus by $0.03 but was $0.03 ahead of our internal forecast, driven by strong leasing performance and operating expense savings. By our estimation, the first quarter miss relative to consensus was entirely due to the share count. Its actual results were 5% to 6% ahead of consensus on the top line and EBITDA. And most street models did not reflect the 54 million additional shares outstanding for 18 days upon closing of the Interxion combination in mid-March. As you may have seen from the press release, we opportunistically issued a little over $650 million of equity on our ATM in late March and early April. In addition, we now expect to draw down our forward equity offering sooner rather than later this year. Our 2020 guidance includes just over $0.25, or 4% headwind comprised of three items; the opportunistic equity issuance and accelerated drawdown of our equity forward; FX and COVID-19 impact, including modest drag from development delivery delays in select markets; and finally, the earlier-than-expected closing of our combination with Interxion, along with additional investments in the Interxion business to fund future growth. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 16, we expect the quarterly run rate to dip down by $0.06 in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter and beyond. Our recent investment activity, including Ascenty in Latin America and Interxion in EMEA, along with our capital recycling initiative and balance sheet management, have lowered the per share bar in 2020. But we believe each of these initiatives will create long-term value and set us up for accelerating growth and a greater share of global customer wallet going forward, while still providing for a well-covered dividend, which the Board raised for the 15th consecutive year in February. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 17. Fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 3.8 times, while net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 6.6 times as of the end of the first quarter, primarily due to showing 100% of Interxion's debt on our balance sheet as of March 31, whereas it contributed just 18 days of EBITDA in the first quarter. Pro forma for a full quarter contribution from Interxion and the Westin Building, the equity issuance activity on the ATM after quarter end and settlement of the $1.1 billion forward equity offering, net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at just over five times, while fixed charge coverage is just under five times. As a result of our proactive balance sheet management, we have ample liquidity to fund our capital spending with nearly $250 million of cash on the balance sheet as of March 31, another $1.7 billion of equity coming in post quarter end and $2 billion of availability on our global revolving credit facilities. The successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 18, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is 3%. 60% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 18, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Shawn, would you please begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking the question. This is Bora Lee [ph] on for Jon. I guess first of all, given the widespread pause in place in Singapore for new permitting and moratorium on permitting in place in Amsterdam, are there any other markets where this is happening? And do you have any update on when these restrictions might be lifted? Andrew Power : Thanks for the question. This is Andy speaking. I think given the Digital team on the call is in different locations right now to social distancing, Bill asked that I quarterback handing off the questions. I think I actually can start the first one and let that team chime in. So, Singapore, obviously, is a country that was early out of the woods and now kind of back in lockdown, so -- and having some impact to our delivery time there. And Amsterdam, a different story, not really COVID-related. It's more of the government's restrictions on certain locations. I would say, in Amsterdam, we've done a very nice job about being ahead of the game there with planning for an existing now multiple campuses with our combination with Interxion, in addition to tying up some lands that are outside the restricted area. I don't -- I'm not aware of restrictions that are akin to the Amsterdam scenario really elsewhere in the portfolio. There's obviously markets where we're running up to supply constraints. I think that Amsterdam scenario is -- lends itself to the incumbent players, like Digital, and keep some of the new entrants out for sure. We are seeing more COVID-related impacts that have government intertwined. Toronto is a market where we have our campus is under construction, building out future capacity, and that the government kind of leaned in and put a halt for some time before reopening, in particular, Hillsboro, Oregon, where we're building out a campus that's significantly pre-leased. That less government restrictions, I'd say, some -- we saw a significant amount of absenteeism that caused some delay in the labor side. But again, this is just a handful of select markets where we saw some potential disruptions to our deliveries that will impact our 2020, which we try to lay out in the script. I wouldn't say it's a widespread phenomenon within our portfolio at Digital. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And for my follow-up question, a few days ago, you announced the launch of Digital Realty Data Hub featuring NVIDIA for the rapid deployment of AI and machine learning workloads. Could you provide further color on this announcement? Are there similar ones yet to come? And what are some illustrative customer use cases that DLR is seeing or expects to see? Andrew Power : Thank you. I'll toss that to Bill, start there. Bill Stein : Thanks, Andy. So, we're absolutely delighted to partner with NVIDIA to extend machine and deep learning to data center to accelerate artificial intelligence. Digital is an early stage partner with NVIDIA. And together, we've pre-certified 24 locations around the world. Our Data Hub solution featuring NVIDIA DGX PODs provides buyers with a validated reference architecture and solution starter kit for rapid AI deployments on PlatformDIGITAL around the world. The combination of NVIDIA DGX and PlatformDIGITAL enables a secure and performance data center architecture for enterprises at any scale. We do have a pipeline of similar ones. In addition to NVIDIA, we've released solution offers with Cisco, IBM and Vapor IO. This is part of the PlatformDIGITAL road map that we published last November when we launched the platform. We're seeing multiple customer use cases across many industries. We've captured multiple customer wins across financial services, transportation and logistics and IT service industries. All of these customers are looking to unbound data processing and exchange limitations to enable intelligent insights for their business. Initial use cases include complex trade analytics and risk, AI-based cybersecurity and route optimization for connected vehicles. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you and good afternoon. I hope everybody is doing well. First question, I guess I'm interested in what you've seen in terms of demand, the pipeline and the funnel as a result directly or amidst COVID, first and foremost. So, I know the first quarter, there wasn't much going on in terms of time, which we had coronavirus, although globally, certainly, there might have been. It happened a little bit earlier in the quarter. But I'm speaking more specifically to what's gone on in -- took place in March, the end of March and then into April and sort of the velocity you've seen and maybe you could parse that across your customer base a little bit. Thank you. Bill Stein : Hey thanks, Jordan. I hope you and your family are healthy and safe as well. I'm going to toss it over to Corey to talk pipeline in response to your question there. Corey Dyer : Hey Jordan, thanks a lot and I appreciate the sentiment on -- for everybody and how COVID is affecting everyone across the globe. I'll probably answer kind of in two parts, a little bit about just what our pipeline looks like and then separately, I'll try to give you a sense of what the COVID impact of that was, if that makes sense for you, Jordan. But I would tell you that from a demand perspective overall, it's really been a strong demand. It's really picked up and continued through when we did our launch of PlatformDIGITAL in Q4. Q1 has kind of continued on that momentum. It was really well received by customers, partners in the industry. You guys -- we just mentioned the NVIDIA sign off, which is just another example of customers and partners adhering to our platform and some of the unique values that we have. Bill, in his opening remarks, mentioned that IDC MarketScape ranked us as a leader in the data center space. And then we saw the same follow-through on our enterprise new logos. So, the new logos, we had -- 75% of them were enterprise. Still staying on kind of that demand aspect and looking forward to Q2, really strong pipeline that we have, continuing that momentum around PlatformDIGITAL that we just started on. And so when we look at it kind of late-stage pipeline, quarter-on-quarter, it's up over 50%, 100% year-on-year. We go and look at new logo pipeline, it's similar kind of robust metrics. And then looked at the enterprise to see if we had anything there thinking who would maybe be the most impacted, Jordan. And a really strong pipeline on our enterprise side. So, happy with it across the board. The concern we have is just as you would expect. We've got some enterprises that are being impacted by it. And those that you would expect where we saw some slowdowns there. But on a net, it was taken up by new enterprise opportunities, CSPs, content network and really interconnection growth across the board. So, I would tell you that the industry, you would expect to get affected work. But on net for us, we still have plenty of demand and a strong pipeline going forward. Jordan, I hope that helps. Jordan Sadler : That's helpful. And then maybe one for you, Andy, on the guide. I think pretty disappointing relative to where The Street is and where expectations were. And I know you had to layer in quite a bit between Interxion and COVID, and I appreciate the $0.25 headwinds. But even relative to the $1.57 you printed in 1Q, just annualizing the $0.25 of headwinds, it seems to point to very limited growth from new business and I know we're already in the year. But I guess it just seems a bit light. And I guess the other sort of comment would be around the re-leasing spreads. The Digital portfolio is a much larger portfolio than Interxion's. I know we've previously talked about maybe being shrewd the most difficult times, and I feel like fundamentals are only have only gotten better, increased demand, less ability to supply. What sort of -- what am I missing? Andrew Power : So, thanks, Jordan. Let me try and tackle this. So -- and one quick clarification. The first quarter came in above our internal expectations at $1.53. I think you might have said $1.57. So close enough for what -- where you're getting at here. So -- and we certainly had a complicated quarter for our friends on -- in the research community to follow us. I think when we're tracking the 23 or so analysts that cover us, I think we -- we only got to around seven that we're able to get all the moving parts, including interaction closing orderly into the numbers. So where we saw consensus, if you did the math, including the interaction in the share count and the like, was closer to 630-ish. And relative to beginning of the year and today, I think the things that changed that we try to highlight in our prepared remarks are -- roughly total a little over $0.25 of impact. Three buckets, the first two buckets being the major components. First one is we took this time in the context of certainly uncertain times, probably more so outside of our industry, but broader capital markets disruption and the like to do some balance sheet management. We opportunistically issued $650 million under our ATM, and we plan to bring our equity forward down sooner. That, I would say is, call it, $0.08 or so of the $0.25, and that was intentional. And that was intentional in the broader backdrop that was intentional because we also see investment opportunities to fund future growth. Hence, we've kind of took a more conservative balance sheet posture. The second major component, what I'd call on the FX and COVID impact maybe, call it, $0.13 or so in total. And I'd say it's roughly 50/50 between those two buckets. COVID has some smaller items like some -- a more conservative posture on our estimations of bad debt expense. But the major COVID item, I would say, is really going back to my response to the first question, was we are seeing certain jurisdictions in select markets putting restrictions on our ability to bring labor to the sites. So, a fantastic -- it's fantastic to have our global platform across 20 countries in 44 markets. But when you have a country like Singapore that was originally out of woods in terms of its exposure and then kind of goes back into lockdown, our 50-megawatt shell or, call it, 11 or 12-megawatt pre-leasing already, is going to certainly get delayed a couple of months. And that episodic thing in a handful of markets, which I highlighted, is certainly going to put a little dent into our revenue that is going to come across the P&L in 2020. But again, temporary impact and really goes back to the fluid dynamics around the COVID situation. And then last but not least, I would say, call it, the small minority, let's say, is Interxion related. I don't think when we stood at the beginning of the year, we thought we'd have the good fortune of navigating numerous European government jurisdictions and multiple shareholder votes and closed the transaction at the middle of March like we did. We initially estimated 1% to 2% dilution on that transaction, but the pull forward in earlier timing. And I would say a little bit, we're seeing some investment opportunities in our combined EMEA business, which will be $0.01 or so till 2020. That kind of rounds up the minority of the $0.25. Net-net, this is obviously -- we are always looking to grow our earnings as fast as possible. At the same time, I would look at our combination with Interxion, our balance sheet management, be it our cap or recycling or even the more smaller opportunistic things like further equitizing the balance sheet to fund future growth opportunities are really setting us up for more accelerating growth. And also at the same time, I don't think doing anything that's reckless in terms of our dividend coverage and the like. And then turning briefly to the re-leasing spreads. Taking a step back for half a second. Four of the five of the last years four of the last five years, we've actually had positive re-leasing spreads, if you go back to our supplemental to each of those years. This year, we're obviously guiding to down slightly. This is a stat where we usually overestimate the negative impact and outperform relative to guidance, as you saw just last year. In any given quarter, they could have an episodic customer that is renewing with an above-market lease. Usually, those transactions, be it any form of renewal, is something that's additive to our commercial negotiations where we can help these customers across multiple products, multiple geos, new business and renewals in a kind of comprehensive fashion. So, I don't think we're out of the woods on every single one of our contracts being below market whatsoever. And I think the trend is moving in the right direction in the stat. And we're certainly looking forward to getting to -- in the green territory on that stat moving forward and overall driving higher organic growth. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Hi, good afternoon. Since this might be one of the last quarters that your reporting metrics for the heritage DLR business, back when you filed the S-4 for the transaction with Interxion, it was inferred from there that organic growth for the -- just heritage Digital business would be about 5%. Can you frame what that growth rate looks like that's embedded in the guidance for 2020 in terms of the expectation for heritage Digital revenue growth? Bill Stein : I think -- honestly, if you look at the results so far, Interxion really only contributed, call it, two weeks or so of contribution. So, the first quarter results is primarily Digital. And just to reiterate, we did really do the facts and circumstances of moving to a work-from-home environment literally the day we closed Interxion. Put all of our statistics in here, excluding Interxion's, you could see the entire legacy or classic Digital business fundamentals. And in terms of contribution to guidance, I was not on the fourth quarter call, but Matt Mercier stepped in and did a very nice job, I thought, in laying out some kind of guide rails for legacy Digital, including on a standalone basis, what our top line would be and adjusting for the ins and outs of our dispositions and capital recycling, what we've called organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digits in 2020, which I would affirm is still accurate. And I would also -- we also stated that we had industry-leading EBITDA margins, which I would also affirm is still accurate. And I think that -- I'd say that's accurate, even pro forma for our Interxion combination, which obviously is a lower EBITDA margin business. So, just the comments were made back in February in terms of our organic growth profile, I would say, flow through into the guidance. And I would say the organic growth of the Digital business was a major driver of the outperformance from our internal perspective in the first quarter, which was a largely Digital-only quarter. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : And now our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Thank you. Maybe just with the Q1 and sort of breaking things down with the -- your Q1 results, the $823 million. Can you just maybe break that down in terms of the organic DLR versus what Interxion's contribution? Obviously, we go back into the math, but just wanted to get a sense of what those numbers were. And was -- were there anything else? And then with that, I thought you were going to be consolidating the Westin Exchange. What's -- what was the can you just maybe comment on what that was in the quarter? Bill Stein : Sure. Thanks, Erik. So, just to be clear, you're asking kind of to unpackage the $823 million of revenue in the quarter in terms of contribution from each of the major transactions. The -- is -- that was your question, correct? Erik Rasmussen : Yes. Thank you. Bill Stein : So, of the $823 million, and I'm kind of bridging you between the quarter's changes, I would say, Interxion was probably like a $40 million -- almost $47-ish million contribution and the rest was really the ins and outs of Digital. And I think we put a cap rate and a return on the Westin purchase, about a 5.8% return so that you can kind of back into flipping that from an unconsolidated joint venture to a consolidated joint venture investment. And Erik, we're also more than happy to follow up post the call or work through any of the granularity. We understand when you joint venture and recycle $1.4 billion of capital in the last 90-plus days, buy out a partner on a $700 million asset and close a $8.5 billion strategic combination in Europe, it's not a simple quarter from anyone's modeling perspective. Erik Rasmussen : No, definitely. I appreciate that. And I will do that. And then maybe just my follow-up on Northern Virginia, it seems to be recovering and we're hearing of improved demand. How are you seeing this market and your opportunities? And can you comment on other markets where you're seeing an improvement versus what you thought just 90 days ago? And that's maybe just not here in the U.S., but obviously, now with Interxion, you have a lot more visibility into that European base as well. Bill Stein : Sure. So, maybe I'll start off with like a little kind of market tour, and I'll ask Corey to chime in a little bit on what he's seeing on the customer standpoint. Northern Virginia was a very strong quarter. It was, I believe, our top quarter top market in terms of overall signings. It was strong on the colocation or connection front. Some great startings at pretty attractive pricings into our colo suites on that campus. We also were very successful in backfilling into that market, numerous recently vacated suites. So, that's kind of high flow-through leasing activity because the suite is already built and constructed. And lastly, it was the home of our largest transaction for the quarter where we imported from out of region, a fairly sizable transaction all on the hyperscale front. So all around, pretty strong. I would say it's not a market that is completely out of the woods. I would attribute our success there due to a few things. One, our offering is really an entire platform offering, numerous of our sales into any market are going to include numerous products and numerous geos at the same time. Two, we have a very large installed and growing customer base that wants to grow with adjacency; and then three, in Northern Virginia, we have, I believe, the longest runway of future-proofing our customers' growth in terms of capacity, potential build-out. And I would say, while more commodity-like providers on the periphery in North Virginia are certainly cutting rates, that kind of almost internal competitive [Indiscernible] for our customers to get specific suites on various products within the various campuses in Ashburn certainly accrued itself to our platform and generate better economics. If you can turn to kind of quickly the rest of North America, brighter spots, I would say, is Toronto. It has been a very attractive location where we're quickly going through capacity there, and we're about to launch our colocation suite, which will be a great new entrance to that market. Northern -- New York City Metro, both in the city and also in New Jersey has been seeing a rebound. That's been on the colocation connectivity side as well as, I'd say, call it, half a megawatt to two megawatt-type scale as enterprise-type demand, financial service in particular. Santa Clara remains very tight. Other markets of robustness outside of North America, Asia-Pacific had a very strong quarter. Early signs in the smaller dollars or kilowatts from our Osaka launch of colocation interconnection, we're off to a great start there. And our SIN12 building, I think I mentioned, has had wins with a major enterprise, a leading Asia-Pacific bank as well as a major CSP. Swinging down to Latin America, S\u00e3o Paulo had success where we export demand from a European-based customer on the enterprise side into the colo connectivity suites in our Ascenty platform. And then last but not least, in Europe, we -- in our prepared remarks, we mentioned the strength of selling some Asia customers into our legacy Digital colo facility in Frankfurt. The London Cloud House is off to a good start. And then last but not least, Interxion, which we didn't kind of put on the page in our results, I would reiterate, did a very healthy $10 million of signings. It was a very attractive book of business with no major signing above 180 kilowatts. I believe the connectivity signings were close to 35-plus percent of the signings. So, also a very successful quarter in terms of the Interxion activity. Corey, anything to add on that? Corey Dyer : You gave him pretty much a rock star world tour of what we've got going on, so I was trying to think of what to add. I guess I would say, Andy, is the only thing to add is that we're really happy with what we've seen in Ashburn, if that's the base question here. We've had deals each of the last couple of quarters that have helped us. And we're continuing to see demand in that area that we're going to continue to source and take care of. It puts us in a position to think about expanding and growing more there. And then as you said, if you looked across our regions, each of our regions was really successful this year or in this last quarter, as well as AP just going gangbusters for us. So, I think you did a great job summarizing it. But we're happy with how PlatformDIGITAL has been received by customers. We're seeing a lot more multi-metro deals come through and a big pickup on the enterprise wins with new logos. So, I appreciate it, Andy. Erik Rasmussen : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Choe : Hi. I just wanted to ask about the base business. And given that there's so many puts and takes on the financial side, just to focus on what's going on with the underlying business. It seems like $70 million in signings has been pretty steady over the past four quarters. Is that the new normal? And is it fair to say, even though Northern Virginia contributed, it doesn't seem like you had a kind of out of trend win there. And later on, that could boost that overall signings number from $70 million to a much bigger number. Andrew Power : Thanks Richard. So, I would say -- I mean we've showed a pretty consistent stair step up over now several quarters. And each and every quarter has gotten a little bit better in terms of its volume and composition on multiple fronts. So, we're at just under 75, excluding anything for Interxion and it was very diverse. As we mentioned, APAC was a big contributor. It was -- Northern Virginia was a solid contributor, but I wouldn't say it took -- stole the entire show. And I think that if you got to really to peel the onion, going back to some of Corey's and Bill's comments, either in our prepared remarks, very healthy new logos. When you add up -- our new logos up, we're up to 120 new logos. So I don't -- usually don't like to annualize that, but on a 4% -- 4,000 customers, we're talking like almost 12% new logo generation growth from the combined platform. So, very pleased on numerous other key performance indicators and I think you heard a little bit about Corey's outlook on the pipeline, moving it into 2Q. Richard Choe : And as a follow-up, the interaction of 10 million signings; is that kind of the normal level? Or was that kind of them having a very good quarter? And how should we think about that going forward? Andrew Power : I'm pretty sure -- I don't believe David's ever given a signings pipeline or even a signings number. So, I'm not going to be the first one to unpack that on public air here. But I'm sure some transactions probably didn't get done during the quarter. I would say Europe, in particular, was in the middle of the COVID crisis a lot sooner than the United States. But I was pretty pleased when I saw close to 10 million of signings with that healthy consistency, numerous -- across numerous markets and so connectivity rich. Richard Choe : It's a nice contribution. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, just you guys have talked about in the past a goal of getting to maybe 5%, 7% core FFO per share. When you think about 2021 and getting past some of the things that you've talked about that are impacting you specifically in 2020, is that still a fair approximation for where you would aspire to see growth going, particularly with the leasing numbers that have been so strong? And then secondly, well, I appreciate you don't guide to AFFO, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color on some of the metrics that go into it, such as straight-line and market rent amortization. I mean some of us do focus a little bit more on that metric as well. Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks Colby. So, I think our growth objectives for the business remain consistent. The only ounce of caution I put then is we're obviously in a whole brand-new world here that could have interim drag or longer-term acceleration, overall digital transformation that could further emphasize the growth of our business. But I think that mid to high single-digits kind of growth in our recurring cash flows or FFO, AFFO per share is still the bogey to -- or hurdle to shoot for and overcome. Going to the adjustments to FFO and to AFFO, really straight-line rents is just a GAAP phenomenon where we essentially kind of include the rental escalations or bumps. And depending on where the customers' contracts are in their life cycle, it can have a positive or negative impact. And depending on what type of -- whether customers ramping into our space or not can obviously have an impact. And the above and below market amortization is also a non-cash impact as well. So, I'm happy to -- with 4,000 customers in the breadth of our business, there's a lot of ins and outs that go into that number. If you want to ask another -- I'm not sure -- maybe I'm not hitting the heart of what you're seeking to understand there in terms of the impact. Colby Synesael : Sure. Well, just given the interaction and how that's a slightly different business than what you guys had what your business predominantly is, I was just wondering if there's any color you can give. But maybe more simply, would you expect AFFO to be notably below, above, similar to your core FFO? Maybe that's an easier way of asking it. And then, I guess, since if you're not able to answer that question, just curious, just in terms of COVID-19, if you're seeing, as a result of that, some of the larger hyperscalers are shifting more to an outsourced model opposed to a self-build model, given perhaps their own desires to reduce their own CapEx expense in this environment? Andrew Power : Yes, I think the more elegant answer to your first question is what's a combination of consolidating our highly connected colocation facility, the Westin Building and our combination with Interxion. Our mix of business is certainly moving much more towards a more granular customer base, more network-oriented customers. We're obviously going after the enterprise customer in hybrid multi-cloud environments. And that customer mix is going to have less -- much, much less of, call it, 15-year steady Eddie bump contracts, which is going to be at the end of the day, narrow, I believe, the gap between our FFO and AFFO per share over time versus if -- going back to our legacy, much more legacy business even -- kind of tell us kind of five years back. And then going to your second question on -- maybe I'll turn this over to Corey or Chris to answer about the second question, about customer behaviors or the buying patterns of the hyperscalers. Chris Sharp : Yes, I can help out with this one, Andy. And I think on the hyperscalers, Colby, there are requirements. They've got them all across the globe. So we're well positioned to help out where they need to look at it. And they generally handle that demand with a combination of like their self-build and their -- and then outsourcing to groups like us. Many of the hyperscaler requirements also involve compute nodes combined with connectivity. And I think we're really well positioned just to take care of them from a full spectrum of data center solutions, both highly connected and wholesale. And I think, while you might hear that some of them want to in-source for whatever different reasons or build their own, we haven't seen that come through in the pipeline yet, and we haven't seen that come through in any kind of change in our customer conversations and our engagements with them, is what I'd I tell you, Colby. Thanks. Colby Synesael : Okay. Thank you. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for any closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead. Bill Stein : Thanks Shawn. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we enhanced the value of our platform, successfully closing on our highly strategic combination with Interxion as well as the acquisition of the Westin Building in Seattle and the Mapletree portfolio sale. Second, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with community outreach initiatives, a renewable wind energy contract and new additions to our Board. Third, we maintain steadfast support for our customers, prioritizing health and safety while maintaining service levels. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the opportunistic issuance of $650 million of equity capital. I'd like to conclude today's call by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, but particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of this global pandemic. I hope you all stay safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. We delivered record bookings, more than 50% higher than our previous all-time high. We beat consensus by $0.07 driven by operational outperformance and the beat flowed through to upward revisions to guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share. Third, we extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our second annual ESG report and official recognition as the first Data center ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet with the issuance of $645 million of common equity and \u20ac500 million of 10.5 year bonds at 1.25%. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Stein : Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. Even though we haven't been physically sitting together for the past several months, we've made significant progress, strengthening each of these pillars. As John just mentioned, our second quarter bookings were more than 50% better than our previous all-time high but we're also more than double our previous trailing four-quarter average. We've now seen improvement for six consecutive quarters so we've clearly seen an acceleration in leasing velocity. We are admittedly a bigger organization today and the bar should be higher, following our combination with Interxion and as well Ascenty. But our second quarter results would have been a record for stand-alone digital realty as well. A world of remote everything has accelerated digital transformation initiatives and data center demand has benefited. But I believe these results also reflect the past several years of hard work, putting together a highly, attractive diversified global platform stability and capable leadership within our broader organization, coupled with solid execution. In particular, I would like to congratulate Corey Dyer and his entire sales team on their exceptional performance. We do expect the second quarter may be the high watermark for the full year and we don't necessarily expect to maintain this velocity every quarter but 2020 is clearly shaping up to be a banner year and we continue to capitalize on the acceleration of digital transformation strategies to build business resilience, which should continue to drive strong demand going forward. Our confidence in the forward outlook is reflected in the upward revisions to guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share. Let's turn to the current environment on Page 3. The COVID-19 global pandemic has changed all our lives. Our hearts go out to the global communities we serve especially those that have been most impacted. We stand in solidarity with them. And our focus remains unchanged, keeping our employees, customers and partners safe. We are fortunate to have been as well prepared as we possibly could have been for this pandemic. Our 280 data centers in 45 metropolitan areas across 21 countries on six continents remain fully operational. We are grateful to be in a position where we can help industries communities and families around the globe continue to conduct business and stay in contact with each other during these uncertain times. We also want to again extend our gratitude to our employees in critical data center roles, who continue to come into work every day at our data centers around the world. They make possible the service and support that we provide our customers. Stepping back, our approach to managing and leading through the COVID-19 pandemic is guided by our ESG strategy depicted on page 4. We strive to lead the global data center industry in sustainable environmental performance. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. We take this work seriously because it matters to our customers and because, we think it's the right thing to do. Environmental stewardship is incorporated into almost every aspect of our business. Sustainability is a top priority for us year round. The industry, governmental, organizations and the press are all taking note. In early April, we were honored to be the first data center provider to receive an EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year Award for Energy Management. In late April, we announced a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. In early June, Interxion announced that it reduced its cooling system energy consumption by 20%, during the first year of an ongoing project with EkkoSense a data center optimization specialists. In mid-June, we were recognized as a green lease leader by the U.S. Department of Energy's better Buildings Alliance. We also published our second annual ESG report in mid-June, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2019, as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, community engagement and philanthropic commitments, diversity and inclusion efforts and other sustainable business practices. In terms of our social efforts, since April, we have committed more than $1 million to partnering with charitable organizations globally combating the COVID-19 pandemic as well as efforts to fight racial injustice. We've also begun a doubling down on our employee matching gift program raising an additional $100,000 on top of our corporate efforts. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities that we serve around the world. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 5. We continue to expand our global platform with groundbreaking announcements in multiple metros across APAC, the Americas and EMEA. In early July, we announced that we would be building our second data center in Hong Kong, allowing us to cater to diverse multi-site workloads. The facilities is expected to be built out and ready for global and regional customers by mid-2021. In mid-June, we broke ground on the first carrier-neutral facility in Korea with the Sangam Digital Media City in Northwest Seoul. We've seen significant pent-up customer demand for carrier-neutral offering in South Korea and we expect to be open for business in the fourth quarter of 2021. In early June, we announced that Ascenty our Latin American platform and joint venture with Brookfield infrastructure was entering Mexico with two diverse locations, anchored by long-term U.S. dollar-denominated multi megawatt agreements to support the growth of a leading global cloud provider. In April, Interxion broke ground on Interxion Paris Digital Park, a market expansion project in Paris with up to 85 megawatts of capacity. The first of four new data centers on this site will be Interxion's eighth in Paris and the first phase is scheduled to open in late 2021. In early July, Interxion announced the opening of the first phase of MRS3, its third data center in Marseille. Interxion's Marseille campus is one of the world's leading digital hubs for intercontinental data traffic with over 150 network service providers. The new facility will offer customers expanded access to the vibrant community in Marseille including numerous connectivity providers, digital media and cloud segments along with local as well as global enterprises. Last but not least, in mid-July, we announced that we had acquired the freehold to the land under Hanauer Landstra\u00dfe campus in Frankfurt. In addition, we are also under contract to acquire the Neckermann site a separate parcel within a kilometer of our existing campus that will support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity. We believe that we are creating significant value by combining the leasehold and freehold positions on one of the most highly connected campuses in Europe, while the adjacent expansion capacity provides runway to support customer growth in a key European metro for years to come. We also made two significant announcements advancing our collaboration with NVIDIA. In early May we announced the platform digital data Hub featuring NVIDIA DGX A100, POD infrastructure, a joint engineered solution that brings the world's first five Petaflops AI compute system to the enterprise to tackle high-performance computing challenges. Most recently in late July, we announced the joint development of an AI platform as a service offering on platform digital combining core scientific plexus AI workflow orchestrator with the NVIDIA data hub solution to address enterprise data lake performance constraints. These announcements validate our strategy of building a portfolio of engineered partner solutions to help enterprises accelerate digital transformation and remove data gravity barriers. Let's turn to Interxion on page 6. Integration is our top priority for 2020. And despite having to do the hard work of integration virtually during the pandemic, both teams have risen to the occasion. Andy will cover our customer wins in more detail, but we are already seeing the benefits of the significant cross-selling opportunities. We said last quarter, that we believe our combination with Interxion has the potential to change the global data center landscape. And in the interim we've received meaningful third-party validation of our view. In mid-July Cloudscene gave us the top billing in EMEA on their H1, 2020 data center ecosystem leader board, which ranks data center operators based on the composition of their facilities, service providers, network fabrics and cloud on ramps. The combined organization is well placed to meet the growing demand from cloud and content platforms, IT service providers and enterprises seeking co-location, hybrid cloud and hyperscale data center solutions. These are global long-term opportunities that we are ideally positioned to address. We've made steady progress on our corporate integration efforts. And by putting customers first, we've been able to seamlessly come together as one company. There will be more work to do over the next several quarters, but we are pleased with our progress to-date. Let's turn to the macro environment. As we are all aware the pandemic has pumped the brakes on the global economy. As you've heard me say many times before, data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth. And we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. The current environment is accelerating enterprise's digital transformation strategies and data gravity is shaping the way enterprises will deploy, host and connect their infrastructure globally. According to IDC by 2025, enterprises will need to manage the integration of 175 zettabytes of data between their private infrastructure and public clouds. 451 Research conducted a global IT leader survey finding 87% of IT leaders need to maintain local copies of critical data at global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements. We see indicators of enterprises solving data gravity globally across our platform in the volume of new logos as well as expansion bookings within our enterprise vertical. Digital Realty was recently named the global leader in GigaOm's market radar for edge co-location, ranking our strategy as the only outperformer in the platform strategy sub segment a strong validation of our vision. The roadmap for platform digital is positioned to capture the enterprise opportunity. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, stakeholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's pick up here on page 9. As you may have seen from our supplemental reporting package, we have included Interxion's portfolio statistics in the supplemental this quarter. The highlights here on page 9 of the deck, give you a sense for the power of the combined platform. We also implemented the changes to our disclosure package we've telegraphed for the past several quarters. As we've said, we see the lines blurring between product types. And we believe the traditional distinctions have become less meaningful. The changes we've made to attempt to more closely align our disclosure with our customers' buying behavior. And the way we manage the business. We hope these disclosure enhancements are helpful. We aim to continuously improve the utility and transparency of our financial disclosures. And as always, we welcome additional input from analysts and investors. Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 10. We signed total bookings of $144 million, including an $18 million contribution from Interxion. The second quarter also included a $12 million contribution from Interxion. And along with the $22 million of network and enterprise oriented deals of a megawatt or less, accounted for nearly 25% of total bookings. The weighted average lease term was nearly 11 years. We landed a total of 124 new logos during the second quarter, including 38 sourced by Interxion again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of regions, demand was particularly robust in Northern Virginia, the New York Metro area, the Pacific Northwest and Mexico City in the Americas, as well as Frankfurt, Paris, London and Marseille, in EMEA. We leased 48 megawatts in Ashburn during the second the quarter, bringing our trailing four-quarter total to north of 100 megawatts. This activity has driven lease-up of active development, as well as existing inventory. We generated another 70 basis points of positive net absorption within our Northern Virginia in-service portfolio during the second quarter, up from 90% occupied at year-end to 93.8% as of June 30. And our Northern Virginia active development pipeline is now 100% pre-leased. Despite a somewhat crowded playing field in this market, we believe we certainly hit above our weight due to the strength of our global platform and sales force, the large and growing installed customer base seeking growth with adjacency on our connected campuses. And finally, our ability to future-proof our customers' growth with our strategic land holdings, providing the longest runway to support their future growth. While we have not yet begun to see meaningful improvement in Northern Virginia market rents, the available inventory has been rapidly absorbed and the pendulum is starting to swing back towards tighter availability and healthy competitive tension. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, the New York metro area was a standout not only is the top destination for network and enterprise oriented deployments during the second quarter, but also with the groundbreaking of our newest connected campus in Northern New Jersey where we will be developing a highly strategic, purpose-built, new infrastructure solution to help a leading data analytics provider optimize data exchange for their employees, customers and partners. In Phoenix, a leading top 12 [ph] university is leveraging our network-dense interconnection hub to optimize their hybrid IT controls. As we announced in mid-May, the Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit security organization working to make the internet secure for everyone is streamlining its data center network with Digital Realty in the Bay Area. Our Paris team persuaded EcoTel [ph], a French global IT service provider to migrate its infrastructure onto our platform by offering flexible commercials and demonstrating their value as a trusted partner. In London, we added Elite, a local fiber and managed service provider to our carrier community, which will attract other enterprises particularly in digital media who will use Elite for their services. In the Netherlands, DigiTen [ph] a fast-growing software company targeting the online gaming community chose our Skiple Right [ph] campus in Amsterdam at its worldwide hub due to low latency connections to the rest of Europe and beyond. A leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturing company deployed across multiple metros is demonstrating the diverse product solutions available on platform digital, leveraging fit-for-purpose interconnection and infrastructure capabilities across three unique sites on our Dallas-connected campus as well as the Amsterdam Business Park. Finally, Hash Power, a leading global content delivery company headquartered in Portugal harness the power of our combination with Interxion to rewire their network in Madrid and San Francisco. Turning to our backlog on page 12. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at a record high $251 million. The step-up from $122 million last quarter, reflects the $44 million backlog inherited from Interxion, as well as the $132 million of combined space and power leases signed offset by $47 million of combined commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our historical average at a little less than seven months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 13. We signed $169 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. We retained 88% of expiring leases above our long-term trend. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was as a little less than six years, while cash rental renewals rolled down 2.8% in line with expectations. Aside from a few select supplies constrained regions in metro areas we have yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets. However, we are continuing to make significant progress cycling through peak vintage renewals. The lion's share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents and we are beginning to see tightening fundamentals and barriers to entry emerging in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued, gradual improvement on cash releasing spreads into 2020 and beyond. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was down 150 basis points to 85.7% entirely due to consolidation of the embedded upside within the Interxion portfolio in our reported statistics for the first time. Same capital occupancy ticked up 20 basis points for the second quarter and same capital cash NOI growth was better-than-expected at negative 1.2% including a 60 basis point FX headwind.  As we indicated last quarter barring any unforeseen shocks, we are cautiously optimistic that we put the same-store low watermark for the cycle behind us. As a reminder Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool. But we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 14. The U.S. dollar began to weaken in late May, but remained elevated relative to prior year average exchange rates for the full quarter. And FX represented roughly an 80 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line.  We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we have limited exposure to the businesses most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rent collections remain in line with our historical average and the sum total of customers who have reached out to request rent relief represent approximately 3% of total revenue.  In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have a roughly 30 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 6% year-over-year, but $0.07 ahead of consensus as well as our internal forecast driven by a beat on the top line as well as operating expense savings primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But the operational outperformance is obviously encouraging.  In terms of the quarterly run rate, as you can see from the bridge chart on page 15, we still expect to dip back down by $0.05 to $0.10 in the third quarter before rebounding in the fourth quarter and beyond.  In early July, we announced that we intend to redeem $800 million of senior notes due in 2022. We expect to fund the redemption by settling the $1 billion forward equity offering in the third quarter and the higher share count along with the expected catch up and deferred OpEx are primarily responsible for the step back down in the third quarter.  As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising the low end of the range for revenue EBITDA and core FFO per share guidance reflecting the second quarter outperformance as well as the strength of our bookings and backlog. We don't typically provide explicit AFFO per share guidance, but given the magnitude of the beat we wanted to offer some additional context.  As you may have seen from the earnings release, we are maintaining our full year guidance for non-cash rent adjustments of $20 million to $30 million as well as our recurring CapEx guidance of $220 million to $230 million, although we are admittedly trending towards the low end of the range. The implication here is that we do expect straight-line rental revenue will continue to moderate over the course of the year narrowing the delta between cash and GAAP and enhancing the quality of earnings. But we still expect to spend nearly the same recurring CapEx budget for the full year despite the lower spend year-to-date.  The bottom line on the AFFO per share outlook is similar to core FFO per share. The second quarter beat does flow through the full year forecast, but similar to the OpEx running through the P&L a portion of the recurring CapEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. And we expect the quarterly run rate to dip back down in the second half. Last, but certainly not least. Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 16. The fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6 times while net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7 times as of the end of the second quarter. Pro forma for the settlement of the $1 billion forward equity offering net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at just over 5 times while fixed charge coverage is just under 5 times. As a result of our proactive balance sheet management prior to the redemption of our bonds due in 2022, we have over $4 billion of liquidity to fund our capital spending including over $500 million of cash on the balance sheet as of June 30th, another $1 billion of equity coming in upon settlement of the forward equity offering and $2.5 billion of availability on our global revolving credit facilities.  The successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is 3%. A little over 60% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 95% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, provide the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 17, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Andrea would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jon Atkin : Yes, good afternoon. My first question is on kind of leasing. I wondered given the strong performance if there's any kind of credence to the notion that this is sort of a pull forward and kind of your views on that topic and what we might kind of think about in terms of timing first half versus second half on demand. And related to that you did indicate Bill a little bit about pricing but I wondered are you within kind of the midpoint, low point, high point of your targeted yield range on the larger deals that you signed in Northern Virginia and other markets? And then I've got a follow-up. Andy Power : Hey thanks Jon, this is Andy. Maybe I'll start this one off and then hand it over to Corey to talk about 2Q and also kind of more forward-looking in the back half of the year. I can tell you we're always trying to pull forward deals as fast as possible at the end of every month and every quarter. So, I don't think there's anything particularly unusual about this quarter's results which we're certainly quite pleased with. I'd characterize it broadly back to something Bill kind of mentioned in the prepared remarks really we worked pretty hard for several years now putting together a highly attractive, highly connected diverse and truly global portfolio and platform. And that along with consistent, stable, and productive broad organizational talents and leadership and just solid execution is really kind of what contributed to numerous wins across the board whether it's the vault leasing signings, volume and well -- as well as mix. But I'll let Corey speak to a little bit more of what he saw in the quarter and then we can come back and talk about returns on the larger deals. Corey Dyer : Yes. Thanks Andy. And yes, I would say that it really was not a pull forward on COVID. I would tell you that we really had a great quarter that we've been building it Andy you mentioned it five or six consecutive quarters of growth. A lot of work that the team has been doing to build our platform, position us the correct way and really build trust with all of our customers. So, I wouldn't view this as a pull forward even though we pull deals forward all the time. This is really just the fruits of our labor playing out for us. But when you think about the segments that we actually had a ton of success with. So really good success across the hyperscalers. Again they value our global platform the geography all of the work that we've done for them with our trusted set of hands and our ops team that continues to provide support for them. And then really just a heritage of success and relationships that we've got going with them. From an enterprise and a network perspective, investing in the team, our sales team, our go-to-market, our global capabilities and then we improved our messaging and our positioning around the value. When we launched PlatformDIGITAL back in November, I think you're starting to see the fruits of that; customers media analysts really just a broad base of people that picked up on that. And then we've had a lot more success with our reps quarter-over-quarter. So, a lot more contribution from the reps. And then finally, I would just say that as we look ahead we think that we're going to really focus on the makeup of our quarter. How do we continue to grow new logos, enterprise wins, or communities of interest interconnection, colocation. And then finally, I think you're also going to see that some of the messaging we brought out has been really picked up and some of the trends that we're driving are starting to drive the industry and how they're thinking and the thinking in the industry around the importance of centers of data and around the importance of data gravity which requires some architecture reconsiderations. So, we expect to see more and more of the industry following our lead in these areas as well. I think I hit most of it Andy but go ahead if there's something else. Andy Power : Jon anything else or should we hit? Jon Atkin : Yes. Yes, that's good. And then maybe the follow-up on Interxion and maybe the two of you again on the -- kind of on the integration side whether it's systems or IT integration, Andy, if there's any kind of future milestones to call out? And then for Corey as you have worked for global organizations in the past and picking up a very valuable kind of European operation anything you see going forward in ways that you can maybe optimize one obvious example is cross-connect pricing, which has seen some nice lift over the last couple of years on the part of one of your major peers? Andy Power : Maybe, Bill can start off on the integration front. Bill Stein : Yeah, sure. Happy to take the -- take part of that, and I'll hand off to Andy. First of all, as you know, we closed the transaction on March 12. So just about the end of the last quarter, and I've said it on several occasions, but the integration of Interxion is our top priority for 2020. And I will tell you that, we are absolutely pleased with the progress made to date. Particularly given the impediments created by the pandemic. And I think we've done a good job of identifying synergies, expense synergies, and we're seeing potential revenue synergies as well, which is what we'd hoped, but didn't underwrite. As I mentioned last quarter, I'm very, very happy with the collaboration that's occurred within the two firms. David Ruberg and I speak several times a week. I had the utmost respect for what he brings to the data center business. And I do believe that, providing essential services during a global health crisis has had a unifying effect on the -- on both teams. Andy, I'll turn it over to you. Andy Power : Just to add a little bit more and then make sure we get to the heart -- the last part of your question about cross connects. Obviously, we're continuing to progress it despite the technology or not being able to do it in person hit some key milestones in the last several months of organizational announcements, and certainly, tiebacks to our global organization now working on some specific work streams, such as our technology and, how we bring together our IT systems and business processes, and in addition to kind of just the people front. So a lot of great wins there in terms of customer referrals. Cross-selling, multisite bidding and great progress, I think the piece you mentioned on the cross-connect Jon, obviously the commercial model for cross-connect has been different in Europe overall. Interxion over the last several years moved to a model where there is better commercialization of the cross-connect opportunity. That being said, I look at the combined global portfolio and call it roughly half of our cross-connects sit in EMEA yet, probably only closer to 20% of our interconnection revenue originates from that part of the world, which I think speaks to opportunity to really make sure our customers are getting value from our services overall, and there's an equitable commercial relationship for that value we deliver. Corey, I'll hand it over to you to wrap-up Jon's point, if you have anything else to add? Corey Dyer : No, I think you guys covered it well across the board unless there's something that Jonathan that you'd like. Operator : Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thanks and good afternoon. So first, I just wanted to speak to pricing a little bit. It seems this volume pretty significant. I noticed sequentially domestically or at least in the Americas pricing seems somewhat stable maybe even better despite the increased volume. But in Europe, it looks like pricing came down quite a bit. I know, maybe not a perfect comp, but I'm curious to what degree the success achieved in the quarter, a function of maybe more aggressive pricing, and maybe in that context, can you talk about what you're doing in terms of thinking in terms of returns and underwriting fee base? Bill Stein : Sure, Jordan. So by and large, I would say we did not see much of a change in the pricing dynamic during the second quarter. And I think, what's evident of that is you can look at our returns on our development table, which I think barely moved in North America. I think a little -- it's a little bit tough quarter-to-quarter comparisons overall region-by-region, because the mix within a region can certainly sway that outcome. But when we stack it up internally and go market by market, deal size by deal size, we did not see a degradation in pricing. I think further evidence of that dynamic that, you may have seen in Ashburn, we're essentially added another 70 bps of net absorption after close to 300 prior quarter. And our development pipeline is 100% pre-leased for north of 50 megawatts in Ashburn. So when you have a dynamic when you're literally selling the last kilowatt or megawatt, or a project underway, you're certainly not trading price and you're certainly not doing it in a quarter that had this robustness of overall volume. In Europe, I think really just a mix. The prior quarter that we reported signings was just legacy digital. It didn't have a of larger scale deals this quarter. We had the contribution of Interxion, which had two good components. It had consistent more enterprise or network oriented smaller deals call it $10-plus million of that. And then it had some of the cloud computing nodes in a few markets, which are obviously multiple megawatt deals that if you compare EMEA quarter-over-quarter, you would just see a mix shift that would have changed the pricing. So, net-net still see pretty good stability in the pricing for what we saw in 2Q. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then sticking with pricing, the releasing spreads, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you could see some gradual improvements in cash releasing spreads in the second half of 2020 and that dynamic seems to be tightening, but no change in the guidance. And along the same lines, you had a lot of success on the leasing front this quarter. And I would think that that might translate into increased capital spend or development spend and that also kind of remained the same. Any sort of commentary on those pieces? Andy Power : Sure. So, a few things. Maybe I'll take these in reverse order. The capital spend, just to remind everyone, we put out our guidance with the first quarter call. So that number really wasn't stale all the way back to the beginning of the year or the end of last year. So, I'd say our progress was somewhat anticipated, and quite frankly, it's the range of that number is in the hundreds of million dollars type of range. So, it's relatively bigger dollars. With regard to releasing, I would say in a broader sense, as a reminder, four of the past five prior years, we've had positive cash releasing spreads. This year, we guided to slightly negative. And we saw that in the second quarter. I would say the preponderance of the actual releasing was in the positive territory. But there was always an exception or two. The two exceptions here, which had good customer and commercial reasoning. One, we did a multi-site multi-geo network node for one of our large global account platform customers are very strategic to being part of our community type customer at an advantageous rate, given the attractiveness of that customer that you see kind of muting what typically is, call it, 2-plus percent increase on those zero to one megawatt-type deployments. And then on a little bit larger, I think just over a megawatt, we had an enterprise customer who did a simultaneous new signing with us in Europe in addition to a renewal with us in our Southeast region. So, when you parse those stats, you obviously see the negative on one piece, but it contributes to the positive elsewhere. We still think it's a strategic advantage to come to the table with that relationship and those incremental arrows in our quiver. But those were some things that contributed to it. And I don't think -- we didn't change the guidance on that quite, frankly, because it's probably one of the toughest to predict, because it depends when the customer wants to in the renewal of its contract, which can be early or can be very much down to the wire. So, it's -- you're handicapping not only the outcome or what period actually happens. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just one and one follow-up. First on enterprise, if you could share any sort of updates on your discussions with enterprises how demand is trending? And I guess the ability of PlatformDIGITAL to sustain this type of new logo growth? I think it's been about 120-plus new logos in the last two quarters. And then secondly follow-up, maybe for Andy. I think you've got about $3.07 a share in core FFO, first half of the year. I think the midpoint is about $6.05. And so, I'm just wondering can you talk about the puts and takes around incremental headwinds embedded in the outlook? And I guess more specifically the COVID-19 deferred OpEx that's driving about half of that drop you expect in 3Q? Thanks. Bill Stein : Hey, Corey, maybe you could hit the first question, and then turn it back over to Andy. Corey Dyer : Yeah, sure. I'll take the first question on enterprise demand and what we're seeing and really what's driving it. And I would tell you that, -- Matt, thanks for the question. There's really been no silver bullet to it. We've had a great team supporting customers selling the platform and really building out our platform for us. And so, I would tell you it's a confluence of all these things coming together. We also had a great message that we -- I mentioned earlier, with platform digital and how that's being taken up by the industry and by customers. Our enhanced go-to-market approach has helped us. So, it's a lot of things we did, but we're also encouraged by our rep tenure. We've got better relationships. We've got customers having better relationships with our employees at longer. We've increased the number of reps making quota. We've got a ton more sites that are happening multi-site deals, multi-national deals, average deal size is up. So, from a demand perspective on enterprises, I really believe that the work we've been doing for the last five years and longer as well as the improved messaging and go to market puts us in a position where we're sustained for it. And then you add on to that the Interxion adjustment for us and what we've got from an interconnection and a networking capability and platform, that really puts us in a really, really well positioned spot to go and help enterprises as they navigate hybrid IT and then navigate through COVID and really feel like the breadth of customers, the breadth of our geography. There's going to be some customers in the enterprise world right now that are going to maybe slow down and I've heard that other places. I think because of how many we're helping and the solutions we're bringing to them to help them take advantage of hybrid IT or manage through COVID has really helped us kind of be a little bit insulated from that. Hope that helps Andy if you've got something else to add. Andy Power : No I think you nailed it on, but going to your second question Matt and welcome back. It's great to have you back cover digital. The question on the 307, why can't you just time that by 2, I don't know if you're colluding with our CEO, because he asked me that same question as well. I did have to remind him two things one of which you highlighted. One we are -- we have been doing some strategic capital management matching our sources and uses. And we are redeeming some notes, but all along to fund our capital spend we were planning to draw down on that $1 billion equity forward. So those shares from the equity forward are not in our share count for the first half of the year, they're going to come into the second half of the year, as we close out that in the third quarter. The other piece COVID-19, maybe I'll take a quick second to really give another tremendous thank you to our operations team globally, who have just gone above and beyond. We obviously with this crisis stayed fully operational, but we did scale down our staffing to make sure we put the safety of our customers, employees and partners first and foremost. So we delayed any type of maintenance spend or repairs and maintenance that could be delayed. And that spend we don't think it's going to be delayed forever. We're working in a safe manner to continue to maintain the equipment. And we expect some of that spend that was thought to be planned and happening in the first half of the year to resume in the second half of the year. Matt Niknam : Got it. Thanks Andy. And it\u2019s good to be back. Operator : Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. My question is mainly to do with the re-leasing spreads on page 13 of your slide deck. And I know you've touched on elements of this already over the call. But I was just looking at the releasing spreads for leases size between zero and one megawatts. And I saw that the re-leasing spread is a little bit negative. And just given the dynamics we're seeing with such a big surge in demand coming specifically from enterprises and really the whole spectrum of constituents within the data center ecosystem as far as customers. I guess the perception would be that that would be a little bit more positive than it would be negative. And is the reason why it's negative potentially, because it may be a very large customer that's distributed into multiple locations? And in aggregate they got a discount for releasing. Or maybe you could just give us the puts and takes for customers in that specific size band what exactly is the case? Andy Power : Sure. Thanks Sami. You are correct. I mean, if you look historically that category would be closer to two-plus percent positive and if you look through what's happening in there there's numerous renewals happening in there on a very granular basis. The reponderence of those renewals are in the positive territory and you hit the nail on the head with -- there was a specific customer that renewed across three or four sites globally with network deployments so small deployments that add up to a larger sizable deployment. And that customer is not only incredibly important to our platform based on its size and scale, but also the value it brings to the other community participants and customers here at digital. So we wanted to make sure that we found the most fair potential outcome for that renewal to secure their future here with digital. It was a little bit on the longer side for that size of deployment in terms of renewal, it's always the rates a little bit longer -- lower rates or longer, but really more of a strategic renewal within that category that brought that into the slightly negative cash mark-to-market. Sami Badri : Great. Thank you for that color. My other question has to do with the interconnection commentary that you gave earlier with EMEA representing about 50% of the portfolio's cross-connects, but only making up about 20% of revenues, I was hoping if you could give us maybe like a time frame or a trajectory some kind of like time-lapse on when you think you would be able to get that 20% of revenue mix maybe even closer to the 50% of revenues reflecting 50% of cross-connects in Europe just so we can understand like the pace or the cadence of transition you're having with your customers in EMEA? Bill Stein : Sami, I'm going to hand this over to Chris to give you a little bit more color on the history and the trajectory of what we're doing. I'm not going to -- unfortunately, I won't sign up for a raising of the cross-connect prices time line on this call. I don't think David Ruberg would be too pleased with me if I did that. But I can tell you we're all about bringing value to our global customers now that total 4,000 customers, and making sure that we are commercially treated in a fair actable way for that value. But Chris maybe you can chime in a little bit about on the cross tech pricing and trajectory. Chris Sharp : Absolutely, happy to do it Andy, thank you. And thanks for the question Sami. So you're absolutely correct. And I'll echo the sentiments throughout the call is that, we're very happy with the addition of Interxion into our broader portfolio. And I think what that represents to our customer base is, these are major epicenters of value for kind of current and future customers. And so really what's represented within that is, these communities of interest and the amount of interconnection that's been generated over the years that exists and that continues to grow. And I think one of the things that's very important to us and it's just shared vision within the Interxion team as well is that, there has to be a very balanced approach where we want to ensure that we don't cycle our customers' ability to grow and to continue to derive unique value out of this overall platform digital. And so I do think that you'll see a lot of our other existing customer base coming into Europe. So that platform effect will start to build that up. So I think over a period of time you'll definitely see that grow. But we're really conscientious of taking a balanced approach and having a very open platform so that we can allow customers to grow and continually expand. And I think a critical element of a lot of this is, not only the interconnection element but the multi-market and the unique advantage of our fit-for-purpose product where you can do both smaller colo and larger scale deployments. So the value of all of that coming together is the unique position that PlatformDIGITAL equips our customers with. Operator : Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to get some high level thoughts. We've obviously had a very strong first half of the year. We saw data before the quarter results started to come out for yourself and peers that Northern Virginia was -- and some of the U.S. markets had a pretty good absorption number so far. We're now seeing it with you guys as well, but what are your thoughts about -- what sort of could be creeping in, in that digestion and maybe us having sort of a repeat performance of what we saw in 2018 and maybe what's different this time around based on what you see today? Andy Power : Thanks Eric. So maybe I'll start off and hand it to Corey to kind of take more forward looking here. So I think a few things to your question. I think we had a really strong quarter in Ashburn, but I think we also had a really strong quarter in North America as well. Just a quick highlights New York City, metro area, top enterprise, network oriented smaller footprint deployments and connectivity, as well as a very strategic build-to-suit project on our Jersey connected campus. Out in the Pacific Northwest continued support of a hyperscaler on a highly strategic project in the Hillsboro market. Continued great wins in Chicago both on the connectivity side within the financial services vertical, as well as a different hyperscaler growing on one of our campuses in the Chicago area. So -- and I think that theme speaks to a little bit about your question. If you do rewind the clock back for a second with the digestion of the last go around I think our business did quite well which I think goes back to serving our customers across six continents, 20-plus countries, 44-plus metropolitan areas and having that globally diverse 4000-plus customer base, has allowed us to not be wed to a specific market or the ups and downs of one specific customer. And last I would say, I don't think each of these customers are on the exact same pacing. They're all at different places in their race or different points of their build-outs of their infrastructure which allows us to kind of help them when one customer is maybe taking a pause or looking to grow in different markets. But Corey please share your thoughts as well. Corey Dyer : Yes. I'll add to it Andy from an enterprise demand perspective. And I feel like you touched on a good bit of it. If you think about the power of our comprehensive global platform and where we're across a 4,000 global customers, 20 countries, 33 markets, 44 metros. And then you think through the new ideas and solutions we're bringing to our customers, at the same time with this combined Interxion and digital merger that we've done here. It puts us in a really good place to be able to address customers that need and want to continue buying those services. And it really moderates us from any kind of an exposure on an individual or an industry or a geo that's a little bit different. So we're pretty excited about where we are. I also feel like we've got the right kind of funnel and demand going. So we're going to be fine with growing to the cloud and continue to drive the demand that we're seeing and making investments in the data centers right? And so I think that it might be possible that some people see some new logo, sites or maybe a little slowdown there because you're trying to get into new sites that you're not familiar with. But like I said I think we've got enough customers. We've got enough breadth of our platform and our geography that I think we're insulated from it a good bit. And then when I just look at our pipeline going forward, it definitely supports the numbers that Andy has put forward to everybody. So I think we're into place. Hope that helps? Bill Stein : Since 2018 we've added the Ascenty platform in Latin America. We've expanded materially in Europe with the acquisition of Interxion. We've added new markets in Asia specifically new development sites in Tokyo and so. And I would expect that in the second half of the year you're going to see additional contributions out of LatAm EMEA and Asia Pac. Corey Dyer : Yes, really good point. Thanks, Bill. Erik Rasmussen : Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just my follow-up. You'd mentioned in I think in the press release there was some marginal construction delays. What sort of, impacts it has had on the business? And maybe can you comment on which regions that might stand out for that? And how are you going to resolve those? Thank you. Andy Power : Sure, Erik. So also another big thank you in kudos to our global construction team working day and night and weekends for sure in really crazy times. We -- well, I can't say we're able to make up time we've had from some delays from specific jurisdictions like a Toronto or Hillsboro from pulling labor off sites. I can say globally, we are in a really great spot going forward in terms of getting our teams back to work and delivering on our delivery times. The one -- the exception, I'd say -- not exceptional potential spot that we're keeping an eye on and we're not at full staffing in Singapore. Given the labor situation in that country we are not at 100% capacity, but we are continuing to make progress. That being said. So I think we're in a much better place today than we were when we reported on that topic a few months ago. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Thanks very much for squeezing me in. So I know Bill you kind of said that any meaningful M&A is likely kind of off the table for the remainder of the year. But I just wanted to confirm kind of the plan is obviously integrating Interxion and kind of no near-term plans for any additional acquisitions. And to that degree if any opportunities did arise? Are there any kind of geographic reasons -- that would get into? Andy Power : Yes, Eric. No, I'll reiterate and reaffirm that Interxion remains our highest priority -- the integration of Interxion. We certainly are acquiring land parcels around the world for development. There may be very, very small tuck-in acquisitions but that's really for the purposes of new market expansion and/or maybe product enhancement or growing markets. Greg you might want to add to that? Greg Wright : No, Bill look I think, you've covered it. As Bill said we're going to -- we understand that integration is our top priority and we really have become more risk-averse in this environment. But as Bill said, we're procuring land where our customers need to be. And with facilities that really adhere to our PlatformDIGITAL and community of interest strategy. And as Bill said, we're selectively monitoring opportunities in the market where if an asset is strategic it will be smaller and we can create value and get the right return we'd probably do it. I think a lot of people are speculating in terms of acquisitions in this environment where we are with respect to distressed opportunities. And quite frankly, we haven't seen any distressed opportunities in this market yet, but we're actively monitoring things. Now longer term we may see some distressed opportunities for smaller more thinly capitalized companies that may have debt coming due. But a couple of things. Look we originally thought that as assets outside of the data spend and center space got hit harder than data centers and became relatively less expensive that we'd see private capital migrate towards those opportunities and decrease competition for data centers. However, what we're starting to see is that the private investment community have come to appreciate really the strong underlying secular trends in our space as well as the creditworthiness of our customers and the growth potential of the sector and they're becoming more educated and looking to invest. So look as Bill said, we have we're going to continue with that strategy and that's where we're focused right now. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great. Thanks for getting me in. Two questions if I may. Maybe Greg just to stick with you. I was wondering if you could give us an update on potential asset sales if that's something that has been put more on the back burner because of COVID-19, if you're still moving forward and if there's still a possibility we could see something maybe this year? And then secondly with the U.S. government threatening to close down specific Chinese social media applications and websites, I believe that they've been a big purchaser of data center services over the last few quarters. I'm just curious how you guys get comfortable underwriting the risk of taking on a customer like that in light of all the geopolitical uncertainty that could be impacting them? Thank you. Bill Stein : Greg, do you want to hit the first one and I can hit the second. Greg Wright : Yes, sure. Hi, Colby. How are you? Colby Synesael : Good. Thank you. Greg Wright : Look I think with respect to asset sales, I think, it's fair to say that the level of chatter and activity has picked up quite a bit. But what the exact impact will be on pricing for larger deals is still hard to say. It's important to again note everything we were saying about investors, how they're viewing the sector in terms of the secular trends, the credit worthiness in the growth potential which clearly I think you're starting to see the data center space migrate to more of a core asset class that investors particularly through this pandemic are starting to appreciate. As you know we just sold the asset in the middle of the pandemic in Europe and we got the pricing we expected. We continue to believe that our multiyear guidance of a few billion dollars over the few years of noncore assets or noncore markets. We still think that's the right guidance. We've already done about $1.4 billion of that. It's important to note that we're fully funded and we'll continue to recycle capital opportunistically, when it makes sense and the price is right. But it's always good to be in a position where you have no sense of urgency, if you can't get fair value. And I think you probably also noted we gave guidance of $600 million to $1 billion earlier in the year. And with the Mapletree transaction itself, we've already achieved the bottom end of that range. Again, so why we're not expecting -- we weren't expecting COVID-19, but we are comfortable and confident where we are with respect to our capital recycling activity. So -- but look it's going to continue to change daily and we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel like we're in a good position. Bill Stein : And then Colby on your second one, obviously, doesn't have to be specific to a headline in the news, we obviously look at various risks and that's part of our job and our business evaluating risk and return. When it comes to Asia Pacific in general, I mean, I think when we go back to is one we're a global company across 20-plus countries, six continents in numerous markets. And we have a global customer base 4,000-plus customers and rapidly expanding that 124 outages this quarter. I think the diversity of our offering and the diversity of our revenue streams give us a lot of comfort in evaluating risk. If you look at our top customer list, our top 20 customers totaled just under 48% of our annualized recurring revenue. And if you go down that list you got to go past number 19 to find a non-U.S. company just given the size and scale of some of the top cloud service providers and hyperscalers that we're doing business with. Or the number of locations we're doing business with some of the network providers. So you kind of get to like the 1% or less territory when you might run into a customer. So that's a long-winded way of saying we want to welcome all the right customers into our fold. And I think we do the right things in evaluating the right risk, but I think the diversity is what insulates us or protects us to any type of exogenous shots. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you, and congrats on the strong result. Bill Stein : Thank you. Andy Power : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. Bill Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers prioritizing health and safety while maintaining service levels and reaching record highs in our bookings and backlog. Two, we delivered solid current period financial results beating consensus, beating our internal forecast and raising guidance. Third, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with the publication of our second annual ESG report and our official recognition as the first Data center ENERGY STAR partner of the year. And last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with excellent execution on the raising of $1.2 billion of long-term capital. I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family and particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of a global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy. We hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today\u2019s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. We built upon the recent momentum in our business, landing a record number of new logos across broad and robust bookings that were well diversified by customer type and geographic region. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share $0.05 ahead of consensus and we raised our outlook for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share for the second time this year. We extended our global platform, entering Croatia with the acquisition of Altus IT and securing customer growth in existing markets across EMEA, with key land purchases and new builds. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet, raising over $2 billion of long-term capital and retiring nearly $2 billion of high coupon debt and preferred equity. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Stein : Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. And despite the pandemic, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global, with nearly 60% of third quarter bookings outside North America and we landed a record 130 new logos from around the world. Bookings were also well diversified by customer type, with enterprise co-location and interconnection accounting for nearly half the total. This robust and diverse business mix demonstrates the power of our global platform and further validates our strategic vision of being the only global provider dedicated to the full customer spectrum. Let\u2019s turn to our health and safety measures on Page 3. We remain focused on keeping our employees, customers and partners safe during this pandemic. We remained fully operational across our 284 data centers and we continue to support our customers\u2019 growth by bringing additional capacity online, while expanding our global platform. We have implemented enhanced safety protocols, such as requiring mass, social distancing, engaging specialty cleaning services, and maintaining rotational 24/7 staff coverage by leaning on local personnel. As the pandemic continues, we are seeing signs of permanent adjustments that are likely to be long-term tailwinds for our business. More enterprises are embracing a distributed workforce with our growing work-from-home component, while our recent Gartner survey of nearly 2,000 CIOs around the world found that accelerating digital innovation and leveraging emerging technologies are key priorities during the pandemic. Of course, I would be remiss if I did not again extend our gratitude to our employees in critical data center roles who continue to come into work everyday at our facilities around the world. They make possible the service and support we provide our customers. Thank you to the terrific onsite Digital Realty team. Let\u2019s turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 4. In April, we reached a wind energy agreement to supply approximately 30% of our power needs in the Dallas, Texas area with renewable energy. In late August, we further expanded our renewable energy capacity in Texas by sourcing approximately 65 megawatts of solar power. Once the solar project is fully operational by mid-2021, our entire Dallas portfolio will be powered by 70% renewable energy. We completed our first wind power transaction in 2016. And we have since gone on to contract 240 megawatts of wind and solar energy in Texas. We remain committed to manage our environmental impact, optimizing our use of energy and natural resources, serving a social purpose and delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Let\u2019s turn to our investment activity on Page 5. We continued to expand our global platform with a small, but highly strategic acquisition in Southeastern Europe, along with land purchases and groundbreakings in existing markets across the continent. In early September, we announced that we had acquired Altus IT, the leading carrier-neutral data center provider in Croatia, expanding our connectivity footprint into the Balkans and Eastern Europe and establishing a gateway to Southeastern Europe, through access to one of the most interconnected data centers in the region. This transaction was also a prime example of how seamlessly the classic Interxion and classic Digital Realty teams are working together. In Zurich, we are breaking ground on a new data center, two of our five biggest deals during the third quarter landed in Zurich and the expansion of our campus will provide runway for customer growth as the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. We also recently acquired land parcels within 1 kilometer of our highly interconnected campuses in Vienna as well as Madrid. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. In early July, we announced the opening of the first phase of MRS3, our data center in Marseille. Interxion\u2019s Marseille campus is one of the world\u2019s leading digital hubs for intercontinental data traffic with over 150 network service providers. The new facility will offer customers expanded access to the vibrant community in Marseille, including numerous connectivity providers, digital media and cloud segments, along with local as well as global enterprises. Finally, in mid-July, we announced that we acquired the freehold to the land under Interxion\u2019s 10-hour Landstra\u00dfe campus in Frankfurt. In addition, we are also under contract to acquire the Neckermann site a separate parcel within a kilometer of Interxion\u2019s existing campus that will support the development of up to 180 megawatts of IT capacity. We believe that we are creating significant value by combining the leasehold and freehold positions on one of the most highly connected campuses in Europe, while the adjacent expansion capacity provides runway to support customer growth in a key European metro for years to come. Let\u2019s turn to Page 6 for an update on the Interxion integration. As you have heard me say before, integration is our top priority for 2020 and we continue to make solid progress despite the pandemic. Both teams have risen to the occasion and have come together to continue to serve our customers\u2019 needs throughout this crisis. It is great to see this collaboration. Andy will cover our customer wins in more detail, but both sales engines are working well together and we have begun to realize some of the cross-selling opportunities we envisioned when contemplating this transaction. We remain on track to meet our synergy targets and underwriting budgets. Title retention is also running ahead of plan at over 95% with no loss of key personnel. Along those lines, as we announced when we first broke the news of our combination with Interxion 1 year ago today. Early next year, David Ruberg will be transitioning within Digital Realty from his day-to-day responsibilities as Chief Executive EMEA and will be moving into a global strategic advisor role. In this capacity, David will be responsible for the development and oversight of our corporate strategy, including the company\u2019s effort to organize and execute a program to identify and develop High Value Communities ventures across our global platform. David plans to remain on the Board of Directors of our Dutch holding company and he will continue to play a leadership role on certain of our key global customer accounts, bringing to bear his longstanding relationships and thought leadership in addition to supporting our team on new market and product development, as recently demonstrated in Eastern Europe. Upon David\u2019s transition, legacy Digital MD, EMEA, Jeff Tapley and legacy Interxion MD, [indiscernible], will continue to oversee the company\u2019s EMEA business. I would like to thank David for his tremendous contributions and his successful efforts to integrate our businesses. We look forward to benefiting from his strategic insights for years to come. Let\u2019s turn to demand drivers on Page 7. We are fortunate to be operating in a business leverages secular demand drivers. As a leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. Our customers are solving some of the most complex infrastructure connectivity and workload use cases across network peering hyperscale, low latency, high-performance computing, big data and artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen a growing trend of leading multinational enterprises deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints across multiple global sites. We have conducted research, build a global database and devise a method to measure, quantify and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on IT infrastructure. We have recently published our findings as the Data Gravity Index, a report designed to assist both enterprise and service provider customers as they shift their infrastructure strategies to address challenges presented by Data Gravity. Our global data center platform is uniquely positioned to help customers address the Data Gravity challenges. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s pick up here on Page 9. As Bill mentioned in his comments, the Interxion integration is coming along on schedule and we are seeing the power of the combined organization with more than 280 data centers in 48 metros across 23 countries on six continents. The power of the global platform is on full display for our installed base of 4,000 global customers and growing. Let\u2019s turn to our leasing activity on Page 10. We signed total bookings of $89 million, including a $14 million contribution from interconnection, which along with the $29 million of network and enterprise-oriented deals of a megawatt or less accounted for a record contribution of nearly half our total bookings. The weighted average lease term was over 6 years. We landed a record 130 new logos during the third quarter, including 40 sourced by Interxion, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. Activity was well balanced across all three regions, with the Americas and EMEA each contributing about 40% of total bookings, while Asia-Pacific accounted for nearly 20%. Singapore was the star in Asia-Pacific, while Zurich, Frankfurt and Marseille were staying out today in EMEA. In the Americas, we again experienced strength in the New York metro area as well as Chicago and Toronto. In Northern Virginia, where we have leased more than 90 megawatts of the previous 9 months, we signed just over 2 million GAAP during the third quarter. As our active development pipeline remains 100% pre-leased while our in-service portfolio remains the only 94% leased. We do expect to get back to 17 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity in Ashburn at the end of this year. And together with the existing vacancy within our in-service portfolio, this will give us a total of 40 megawatts of available inventory to meet demand and support customer growth for the next several quarters until we are able to bring additional capacity online around the middle of next year. Although we aren\u2019t entirely out of the competitive woods just yet, we remain very well-positioned to continue to hit above our weight given the strength of our global platform and sales force, the large and growing installed customer base seeking growth with adjacency on our connected Ashburn campuses, and finally, our ability to future proof our customers\u2019 growth with our strategic land holdings, providing the longest runway to support their future growth. In terms of specific lengths during the quarter and around the world, in Marseille, we won a significant connectivity deal with PCCW to land the PC subsea cable at our MRS2 data center. This is a higher strategic deal as it enables our customers to directly access this 12,000 kilometer high capacity cable that will provide the shortest and most direct subsea data route from North Asia to Europe. In Hong Kong, we are excited to support a Fortune 500 multinational professional services firm, with the implementation of a data hub deployment on Platform Digital. In London, the classic Digital Realty and classic Interxion teams work closely together to add Canonical, a leading UK based software and IP service provider and the publisher of Ubuntu, a leading Linux distribution. Boosteroid, a cloud gaming platform expanded their platform across Western Europe in the third quarter with a deal that involved 4 metros, Paris, Marseille, Madrid and London. G-Core, a gaming CDN expanded their use of Platform Digital in four locations across North America and Europe for their growing infrastructure demands and new AI platform. Staying with the gaming theme in the Bay Area, we have the Blade Group a cloud-based gaming company enabled daily intensive gaming. While in Ashburn, Capital Online selected Platform Digital to support their cloud development platform for gaming, e-commerce, education and big data. Finally, in Brussels, we are helping Ahold Delhaize, a leading global grocery retailer migrate from their legacy on-prem facility to Platform Digital for multi-cloud access and flexibility for future expansion. Turning to our backlog on Page 12, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $229 million. The step down from the $251 million last quarter will fetch record commencers in nearly $100 million during the third quarter offset by the $75 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at roughly 6.5 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 13, we signed $160 million of renewals during the third quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the third quarter, was a little less than 2 years, reflecting a mix of activities skewed heavily towards the deployments, smaller than 1 megawatts. Cash rents on renewals were essentially flat, down just 20 basis points across all categories and cash rents on renewals above and below 1 megawatt were both essentially unchanged, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 78% of expiring leases, essentially in line with our long-term trend, but dragged down a bit by network customer who churned out of powered Shell capacity at our downtown Los Angeles interconnection hub. Similar to our strategy we have successfully executed with recaptured self space in Chicago, we expect to redevelop this scarce inventory within a highly desirable interconnection hub into significantly higher yielding co-location capacity. In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 20 basis points driven by fully leased development projects placed in service, primarily in Chicago and Hillsborough. Same capital occupancy was unchanged for the second quarter and same capital cash NOI growth was in line with expectations at negative 1.9%. As a reminder, Interxion and the Westin Building are not included in the 2020 same-store pool, but we expect both acquisitions will be accretive to organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 14, the U.S. dollar softened over the summer before steadying at those lower levels, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the third quarter relative to prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly 100 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment, with limited exposure to sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remained in line with our historical average and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy and matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 8% year-over-year, but $0.05 ahead of consensus, driven by a beat on the top line as well as lower property taxes and a lower share count due to the late September settlement of the $1 billion forward equity offering offset by higher than expected corporate taxes due to the higher statutory rates in the UK. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising guidance for revenue, EBITDA and core FFO per share again this quarter, reflecting the third quarter outperformance. We now expect to be at or above the high end of our original ranges for all three measures. In terms of the quarterly run-rate, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 15, we expect to be flat to down $0.01 in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the higher weighted average share count, as the additional shares from the forward equity offering will be outstanding for the entire fourth quarter compared to just 6 days in the third quarter. As you update your earnings models and begin to roll forward to next year, please keep in mind our 2021 results will entail a couple of partial periods complications. For starters, we all of course report a full year contribution from Interxion next year compared to just three quarters this year, which we expect will help drive double-digit revenue growth. On the other hand, the sooner we return to a more normalized operating environment next year, the tougher the comps as current period results are benefiting from the deferral of some overhead and OpEx as well as maintenance CapEx. Finally, the additional shares from settlement of the forward equity offering and mid-year ATM issuance will be outstanding for the full year in 2021 compared to a partial period in 2020. As a result, although we expect to rollout the formal guidance early next year, we are currently targeting mid single-digit growth in both earnings and cash flow per share. Last, but certainly not least, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on Page 16. As expected, the third quarter activity on the ATM and settlement of the forward equity offering brought leverage back down in line with our target range. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA stepped down to 5.6x, while fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.4x. We also capitalized on favorable conditions in the debt capital markets and executed several proactive liability management trades during the third quarter. In mid-September, we raised $750 million of long 11-year green Euro bonds at 1% and $300 million of 2-year floating rate notes at an initial coupon of 0%, achieving all-time low coupons for Digital Realty. We also retired $1.2 billion of bonds due in 2022 and 2023 and a blended coupon of 4.1% as well as $500 million of preferred equity, and a blended coupon of 6.1%. We had $970 million of cash on the balance sheet at September 30 although one of the preferred redemptions and one of the bottom redemptions straddled quarter end and approximately $650 million of that cash was used to fund those redemptions in mid-October. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 16, we have extended our weighted average debt maturity out to 6.5 years and ratcheted our weighted average coupon down to 2.5%, a little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investment outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 16, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about pro forma revenue growth in a couple of contexts. First, if you are to look at the third quarter, what would be the year-over-year constant currency growth by region, whether you are looking at Europe, U.S., Asia, just to get a sense of where each of these businesses are growing, as if you owned all of these assets a year ago in terms of what you acquired or what you have divested? And then secondly, as you look at the guidance or the indications or the aspirations you just described for 2021, can you further unpack with that double-digit revenue growth, what would be the organic part of that versus the benefit of the acquisition and maybe walk through a little bit more detail of the pluses and minuses that are affecting the core FFO per share? Thanks. Andy Power : Hey, thanks Michael. So, this is Andy. Let me maybe try to take that in reverse order. And I will see if I can get all the details by region. So, I think the second part of your question was speaking to what next year\u2019s growth looks like and we shared a little bit of preview although obviously our guidance will come out till early next year. Really there is no we were speaking to the bottom line or core FFO per share growth so there is no apples and oranges, benefits, because the cost of our Interxion acquisition is kind of baked in, the share count, and obviously, the debt. So it\u2019s not like there is inorganic growth, supplementing those numbers. If you kind of deconstruct it, from the top line, I mean, I think you can look at our, our signings volume, probably the last two quarters is the best trend given those are two quarters, where we reported Digital plus Interxion together for 100% of the quarters. In terms of P&L contribution and signings this quarter is obviously a strong $89 million, the prior quarter was the record $144 million the two of them kind of averaged out to low 100 to 115 or so. And coincidentally our revenue in the in the quarter is now ready to billion dollars. So that makes the math easy for what kind of revenue growth would be kind of going forward called in the low teens, obviously have to net our any churn. But I still think you arrive at a high single digits revenue number at the top line for the aggregate business. And that obviously nets down to that mid single digit square foot per share growth model. I think that headwind or to obviously think about is we are having the less spend this year, well, obvious things less T&E, delay in maintenance of OpEx, right that was going kind of just critical staffing. And assuming we are all fortunate to be in a better place versus this virus next year, we would assume a lot of those costs involve them in some capacity return. Breaking that going back to your first part of the question and looking at the revenue contributions was I don\u2019t I apologize, I don\u2019t have a segment by segment P&L in front of me. But I think I can get to the crux of it, we just look at our development schedule, which is just under 200 megawatts of capacity under constructions 56% pre leased, was returns, it creped up a little bit in our favor, this quarter relative to last quarter. And you can see, relative to our existing mix of business, a disproportionate share of our new capacity coming online is outside the U.S. relative to our installed base. And was not on that schedule given unconsolidated joint ventures Latin America further amplify that math based on the activity we are doing with Ascenty. So, obviously, our growth relative to the install base is much larger in India, in Latin America, and Asia Pacific, given the amount of new capacity that we signed, or bringing online in those markets relative to those bases. Relative and makes sense. Obviously the North American market is by far the most mature and is our largest portion of the pie. Michael Rollins : Thanks, Andy. Andy Power : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead. Jon Atkins : Thanks. I wanted to ask kind of a big picture question about energy and sustainability and then a question about lease expirations. So wondered if you could maybe dive down a little bit into future initiatives around sustainability In any kind of future milestones that you are working towards, and then the in the supplemental looks like the lease expirations next year, you know, increase and a lot of that is in kind of the sub 1 megawatt range, although it does tend to there is a bump up in expirations in the annual rent across all categories. And I wondered as we think about 2021, how do we kind of frame that from the standpoint of lease roll downs or increases in rent or churn or whatnot? Thank you. Andy Power : Bill, do you want to take the first part and I can take the second part on expirations? Bill Stein : Yes, sure. Hey, thanks, Jon. Okay, here at Digital we are committed to going well above and beyond minimum renewable standards. We think that the consistent renewable sourcing efforts allow us to decouple the growth of our portfolio from the growth in our carbon footprint. Our approach prioritizes cost competitive net new renewable energy sourced within the same grid regions where our data centers are located. We work with electric utilities to support them in bringing new renewables on the grid and our customers strongly prefer local net new renewables and our approach reflects that. We do not use unbundled commodity renewable energy credits. These are called RECs to meet our long-term objectives. We price what\u2019s called additionality in our approach. That\u2019s a concept where more renewables are brought online because of our actions. And also when we sign on to a project early on in its development cycle, it\u2019s important to recognize that as an investment grade counterparty, this enables that project to both be financed and built. Andy, you want to handle the renewals question? Andy Power : Yes. Thanks, Bill. So, John, obviously, we are still in 2021 budget season, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I do look at kind of what\u2019s ahead in 2021 in terms of expirations as being very favorable in terms of volume mix, mark-to-market relative to our history, which I have shared for some time in some of our investment polls you have obviously hosted. If you kind of go to our expiration table and our supp, I look at them really two discreet buckets, the first one being call it that 01 megawatt category, with about 17% of our expirations in 2021, which is concentrated in our most highly connected, highest pricing power sticky albeit shorter term co-location contract bucket, pro forma for our combination about half of that, contracts coming due in that from legacy Interxion in the Western portfolio. So, we do expect to continue to see very strong pricing power there and the other half is really from our legacy North America co-lo portfolio. Overall, the markets are call it major metros, the London and New York cities, Frankfurt, San Francisco, Paris\u2019 in terms of the top markets coming due in that bucket. If you do look at what I think maybe was the emphasis of your question was kind of looking at the greater than a megawatt bucket that category is a little bit less than 8% as you can see on the supp and it has stepped down about 300 basis points from I think the peak was the third quarter of 18%, about over \u2013 just over 11%. Other than Ashburn in that category of expirations north of megawatt, no market other than Ashburn is greater than 1%. So, it\u2019s pretty diverse. And when you \u2013 I mean, I know it\u2019s a little bit of tough comparison, because we broaden our definition or change our definition slightly when we changed our disclosures a couple of quarters ago, but if you look at the rates per kilowatts, we look at our rates on expiring contracts having come down call it $15 or so per kilowatt in that time period from that prior peak, so setting us up for more favorable comparison. And then last but not least, as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, really the most concentrated expiration is just under 17 megawatts. Fortunately, it is in the Ashburn market, obviously our largest market and probably going to come at a better time given how well our team has done in leasing that market, 90 megawatts of the last 9 months really [indiscernible] organization on that. So I know I am certainly aware of customers right now that are anxiously, awaiting for that adjacent hall in their buildings and one of our connected campuses to become available. So, I think we will be able to weather our way through that. After that concentration, the next largest call it chunk would be less than 4.5 megawatts from any single customer and half of that expiration in Santa Clara, which is a really tight market for us. So, hopefully, I will provide a little bit more color and a little bit more about the [indiscernible] index as what we see ahead in the expirations. Jon Atkins : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Good afternoon. So, I wanted to start with sort of capital, it would be hard not to notice the move in the stock year-to-date in the extraordinarily low cost of debt, which you guys have availed yourself of Digital has historically been pretty active on the M&A and investment front. So maybe you could tell us what you are seeing in the market today and the opportunity set for inorganic growth as you see it? Bill Stein : Maybe I will hand it off to Greg to speak to cover the broader M&A landscape. I think you are on mute Greg? Greg Wright : Sorry can you hear me now? Sorry about that, Jordan, okay sorry about that. Look I think the current market we are seeing today, which I don\u2019t think will surprise you seeing demand for the data center assets is really strong. This was previously really a niche asset class that I would say is going mainstream, or has gone mainstream, we are seeing more core like capital come into the sector, given the strong supply and demand fundamentals, and how well, the sector has performed during the pandemic. And both of those things, I think, combined with the credit worthiness of the customer base, all of those underlying elements drive for more core like capital. So look, we think you are going to continue to see a focus on data center and asset class this capital is capital that was previously invested in areas like offices or strip malls, and they started to migrate towards our space, I would say the environment is increasingly strong right now. So I mean, again, I think we will continue to see strong demand for the sector for quite some time, Jordan, on the M&A front. I think we have seen, we have seen some of these private portfolios trade, and they continue to trade at, decent levels, for example, I mean, you saw the asset that we sold last quarter in the Netherlands, we sold that and it was a non core asset. And we sold it for roughly a 6.7 cap rate. So, look, I think when you look at the overall environment right now, I would say there is a lot of interest and a lot of demand, which should bode well for the sector. Jordan Sadler : And just maybe as a follow-up along the same lines in terms of let us say, the net dollar of investment, where would you be focused in from an M&A front? Is it increased market share in a mature market like North America or is it adding new markets? Greg Wright : Look I think there is yes, when you look at our global strategy, I think it\u2019s different for each market. Jordan, I think, look clearly in Asia right now, the way we have been growing is organic growth in our existing markets through land acquisition and development of near term in our existing land bank, right. I mean, we have rolled out products across seven of the APAC markets for example, we created the first network mutual data center in South Korea, we build out a campus of 100 plus Meg\u2019s in Tokyo. I think it was 5 or 10. Meg\u2019s in Osaka, we powered on a 50 megawatt building in Singapore, which is our third asset there. And that you also saw us announce our second site in Hong Kong. So clearly, when we look at, we look at Asia right now. it\u2019s a harder market to grow in, right because it\u2019s much more fragmented. But we like it. I think in terms of Europe and EMEA, I think you got to look at first thing you have look at is really our under construction pipeline, which we had in legacy Digital as well as the legacy Interxion but you look at markets like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Zurich, Marseille Stockholm, we have assets in each of those markets under construction and really being driven by customer demand, as well as in those in that same European markets, organic growth, again, in existing markets through the land acquisition, or development of our existing land pipeline things places like Madrid, Frankfurt, Vienna in Paris, clearly in that market to, as you saw in this press release, we will have select dispositions in capital recycling. and you will see some redevelopment, right on our head, our campus that Bill mentioned, one of the beauties of that transaction is we get a, we are going to have redevelopment opportunity for several buildings that we did not previously own. I think when you keep going back then across the globe, and you look at South America, Andy mentioned in organics really been organic growth through land acquisitions and development in South America. Again, like all markets, that\u2019s really a customer driven approach. So you talk about incremental dollars, a lot of times where we go is dictated on where our customers want to be right. And I was \u2013 there are no two places that are better examples of that in both Chile and Mexico. Obviously, Brazil was the same. And then when you come back to the U.S., which is a more developed market, again, you will see development in select markets. But I think you will see continue to see acquisition of highly connected assets with what we would call established communities and interest in buildings such as the Westin. And again, there just like in Europe, you will see select capital recycling. So, when I say when you talk about incremental dollars, there is just a quick snapshot of how we are thinking about things across the globe. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, my questions are on the hyperscale. So one of your peers this morning was talking about getting more aggressive lowering the yields they are targeting for hyperscale deals down to the 8% to 10% range. So I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about the pricing and competitive backdrop you are seeing in the hyperscale arena and whether things are getting more competitive relative to what they have been like in the past? And then just a quick follow-up on enterprise, you talks about record new logo growth and heightened deal velocity at a time when a lot of your peers are actually talking about more growth coming from the embedded base. So, I am just wondering what\u2019s enabling you to win you share, where are these new customers coming from? Thanks. Andy Power : Hey, thanks, Matt. Maybe I will start off on hyperscale and I will toss it to Corey to speak to what I really thought was a really fantastic quarter when it came to enterprise, in particular. The \u2013 I mean, I think the hyperscale arena is something that we have excelled it for several quarters on and year. And I think I got a hunch, the competitor that you were referring to and I think I know it\u2019s a new leadership regime, but I would say that\u2019s, they have been a pretty fierce competitor for some time and aggressive, I have not seen a change in the posture from our day-to-day activities. I think it goes back to Digital, our platform has been able to win more than its fair share by coming to table with many ways to support these global hyperscalers whether it is being across numerous countries and markets, where they want us to grow or they are entering new markets, as Greg mentioned, side by side with them, where there is no truly established player to deliver to our capabilities, whether it is owning the adjacent land holdings that really allows us to future proof that growth and other things like making sure we are delivering the health and safety standards they require and making sure we are operating these facilities to the level that they require as if it was their own building and they have high expectations, I think Digital strives to exceed across the board. And I think you see that paying dividends in our results this last quarter, as I mentioned a second ago, our returns on our development, which are obviously weighted very much to our success within the hyperscale arena, actually went up across a couple of markets. And I think our success in the Ashburn market over the last few quarters, which is a hotly contested market, we have been able to be 100% pre-leased and rather full speaks to our success within that category for sure. So, I think that\u2019s kind of capsulated, I don\u2019t think there is no real dynamic shift in the competitive landscape. I would even say, the customers continue to mature and want to fin down their buying groups with more global partners, trusted infrastructure partners, like the Digital. But Corey maybe you could pick it up and really speak to what you \u2013 what we have been doing on the enterprise front. Corey Dyer : Yes, thanks, Matt, for the question and Andy for transitioning to me. On the enterprise front, Matt, I think you asked a little bit about where the new logos are coming from and just where the enterprise wins are coming from and I would tell you, Andy referenced earlier record number of new logos. And then we are just excited about the quality of the new logos and what the growth and the future that they can drive as you think through it. Some of the notable wins we talked about were global markets company, there was one of the largest financial derivative exchanges we have signed and convinced during the quarter. We also had a mobile marketing platform that fuels many of the popular mobile gaming that are with [indiscernible] marketing technology and a major participant in the investment industry. So, we just had a really broad base of wins in the enterprise lately. As you think through it, we also kind of keep track of service exchange support. So that went up for us. And then interesting this quarter, more than 50% of our new bookings this quarter, as Andy mentioned, were from deals less than 1 megawatt, which is generally assigned to the enterprises coming to you. And then if you think longer term Matt about where we are going, there is a lot of studies out there that show 80%, 85% of the enterprise, we are thinking about going hybrid cloud strategy. And so as you think about that migrating to hybrid clouds implies that they are going to put some of them in the public cloud, but a majority of it is in their kind of co-location facilities like us. So we don\u2019t see that we see that as an another advantage and something is going to continue to drive more enterprise growth for us. And then there is probably a little bit of COVID, of expediting kind of a transition to a distributed architecture for the enterprises, which again, we are really well positioned to take advantage of. So above and beyond that we are doing a lot with our go to market that we are changing that we did in the last couple of years, that had huge success for us. And then the channel that we have built here in the last couple years has been amazing for us to already normal than 20% of business out of the channel. So feel like we are really just kind of hitting on all cylinders when it comes to the enterprise right now. And I feel really, really happy with what we are doing and where we are progressing the business. Hope that helps, Matt. Matt Niknam : Yes that\u2019s great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jon Petersen : Okay, thanks. So on Europe, I am wondering if you could break out the how much of the leasing was legacy Interxion versus legacy Digital, so we can get an idea of like apples-to-apples versus prior years, if that is possible. I know it gets more difficult every quarter we get away from that merger? And then also, I didn\u2019t go back to look at all your supplements. I think this is only the second time that wholesale leasing in Europe was greater than North America Just curious how long you think this trend of kind of strong wholesale/hyperscale demand in Europe will last and when we start to see, if we start to see a shift back to Americas in the coming quarters? Bill Stein : Hey, thanks, Jon. So to answer both of those questions, the lion\u2019s share of the activity landed within legacy Interxion sites within EMEA. We did have a very strong contribution from the legacy Digital co-lo sites, but overall GAAP wise, it was call it less than 10% of the EMEA contribution. So, as and which should be expected, obviously, the legacy footprints are weighted, their legacy footprint in the EMEA was a fair bit larger than our legacy footprint in EMEA. And then on your question in North America versus EMEA, I mean, I think this kind of goes back to the first question Michael Rollins today asked about, we are certainly seeing outsized growth relative to our installed base in these non-U.S. markets, although I do at the same time, you have to put it in the context. We are coming off a quarter in North America where we absorbed a tremendous amount of capacity in North America, including Ashburn. So, I am not sure I had pointed in the direction that EMEA overall was going to be larger, especially in the plus megawatt category for some extended duration. But we are definitely pleased with the success of our combined EMEA platform. And I think for what I am seeing, we are not done for the year in that category yet as well. I know, another way we are differentiating ourselves with some of these hyperscalars is kind of continue to support them in more and more EMEA markets, not just the traditional flat markets, so some growth leading the flaps has been a great place to where we have had success in EMEA as well. Jon Petersen : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you for the question. I just wanted to touch up a little bit on Slide #13 regarding the releasing spreads and this clearly shows a material improvement versus the last couple of quarters. And I just wanted to round out to see if this is essentially, your cleared runway, out of all the releasing spreads at least the majority of the vintages that you guys are trying to process through last couple quarters from prior acquisitions is it safe to say now that this is kind of the new range in this, plus 1%, plus or minus 1% range on releasing spreads for rental changes on a cash basis? Bill Stein : Thanks, Sami. So, congratulations as yours are in order and some of the IR rankings, so good work there and we are glad to see that recognized. But to answer your question obviously, that those data points are pointing in our favor a bit in terms of our cash mark-to-markets. You saw that in the quarter basically flat to low 20 basis points negative in the less than megawatt category, but basically flat across both and flat overall and what we have put up in terms of renewals in the third quarter. We also improved our characterization of our mark-to-market in our guidance from a beginning we are down low single-digits in terms of our expectations for our cash mark-to-markets. And now we have, in the words of John Stewart, are slightly negative. So, moving in the right direction for sure there, I would put an asterisk or caveat just to be more transparent that you can see in the document here, the readings this particular quarter were overall much more in the call it most highly connected, network oriented megawatt or less type category. So that obviously blends in our favor. Those are locations, both legacy Digital and legacy Interxion with some of our strongest pricing power. And the overall sample set in the greater than megawatt category was certainly on the smaller side. So, I don\u2019t think we are ready to put the victory flag up behind us on this topic, but I do \u2013 I am taking some conviction that we are moving in a better direction here, which is the product in some regards of not only the market fundamentals, but also the REIT characterization or complexion of our portfolio that is much more diversified across both the U.S. and non-U.S. markets, more connected and highly connected and now we are going into destinations. So, I do think those things, in addition to the market fundamentals, are helping us on the cash mark-to-markets. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you and thanks for the note. Just one other follow-up regarding channel that came up earlier, I think if someone said at 20% of bookings are coming from the channel, and I just wanted to check on one additional detail there. Has this percentage of contribution from the channel gone up with Interxion or was it always essentially in the 20% range every quarter and with Interxion under the hood? Does that mean that this mix could potentially increase over time? Bill Stein : Corey, you want to pick on that \u2013 pick up on that and I can fill on with some details as well. Corey Dyer : Yes, so, Sam thanks for the question. What I would tell you is that our percentage of our sales from a legacy Digital perspective has continued to grow are well over 20%. With the Interxion that might moderate it a little bit, but I think it gives to your point, a huge opportunity for us as we build out the channel globally and we continue to take the same learnings we have had across North America throughout the globe. So, I think there is a huge opportunity for us. I think that was your question. Sorry, if I didn\u2019t answer it. Sami Badri : Thank you. Bill Stein : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have seen a number of press releases recently, where you are referencing your Data Gravity Index. I am wondering how this has changed your communication with clients, does it lead to them or is it something that they already understand and does it lead to any different type of deployments than the clients otherwise would have? Bill Stein : Chris, why don\u2019t you share a little bit about what we are doing around Data Gravity and what that means for customers and also Corey, please chime in as well. Chris Sharp : Absolutely. Thanks, Brendan for the question. No, it\u2019s a very unique formula that\u2019s been evolving over 10 years. And what it really does is it identifies key challenges facing enterprises today around the power requirements and the growth of data, so that we can design solutions to alleviate it. And so I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s unique to \u2013 Digital has unique assets to really solve for this kind of ever evolving problem that\u2019s being generated around the massive amounts of data being created. And so what\u2019s unique in the fact that Digital can allow customers to be in proximity to these data ocean that already exists within Digital Realty. And so they have the efficiencies of proximity to those data oceans and then we also provide, most recently, we just did a press release with path AI, where they can now be placed in a space where they can do analytics against that. And so the artificial intelligence trend that\u2019s happening in the industry is another underpinning element of what the Data Gravity Index represents is how customers can get in proximity to existing data, and then also do analytics through AI, with our unique asset class and product portfolio. And so, it\u2019s, a bit of a educational basis, that we really just want customers to be aware of the buyers dynamic and helps them solve for the burgeoning underpinning of data and the amount of data that\u2019s being grown. And I think, there is some great statistics out there where enterprises are going to be creating more and more of their own data in a very distributed manner. And so that is where, you see us being able to solve for not only in our traditional types of offering for these data, gravity problems and the burgeoning sets of data, but also some of the emerging edge workloads as well. And being able to tie all that together in our comprehensive set of product offerings and interconnection capabilities that is really what is underpinning that data, gravity kind of formulas, and just educating our customers of that, and I don\u2019t know Corey if you had anything else you wanted to touch upon? Corey Dyer : No, Chris, you did a great job on framing up what it is, what I would also add to that maybe is, it really helps us have a point of view, and, some perspective for customers, as they think through the changing architecture what they are going to need is to go through COVID and get going into much more distributed world. And so you are going to have to start thinking about how you handle data, not just interconnection, alright, and the data that is going to matter to all of us. It\u2019s what really drives all of our businesses. So if you have got some customers that are curious about it we have got a whole bunch of people and team members here that are more than happy to get engaged with to talk about how you can make take advantage of it. Brendan Lynch : Great. Thanks for the color. Corey Dyer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Just wanted to get an update on the European assets sales that you guys have talked about from a timing and size perspective I have seen some reports where that might be moving forward? And then secondly I appreciate the color you gave on 2021 core assets per share growth of mid single digits I was wondering if you can give us a little more color in terms of what is assumed in there as relates acuity needs leverage CapEx those types of things that obviously have a pretty big impact as well? Thank you. Bill Stein : Greg, why don\u2019t you start with the overall dispositions of philosophy there and then I will pick up on the second question? Greg Wright : Hey Colby. How are you? Colby Synesael : I am doing good, Greg. Greg Wright : Good. Well, I am not sure we have ever talked about a specific when we have we know we sold our one asset here in Europe here as we mentioned in the quarter in the Netherlands and we thought it was attractive capital for the asset so look I think when you think about our philosophy or approach when it comes to portfolio optimization I mean look we have talked and we remained focused on capital recycling and portfolio optimization, as I mentioned earlier we think it\u2019s a strong market right now to sell assets and once we sell those assets out of what for us again there are still good assets, these are just not core to Digital, our ability to then turn around and recycle those proceeds and deploy capital and other assets that further align with our strategy. Again, we want to do smart deals that maximize shareholder value. And that is where we are focused. So look, I think, over time, the guidance we gave, I guess it\u2019s been, it was an official guidance. But when we talked in the market, I guess it\u2019s been close to two years ago we said a few billion over a few years. We are about halfway through that now. And, but we have been pleased with the results so far. But again, the good news is, we do that we don\u2019t have to do this, we only do this when we think we are going to get fair pricing, and it makes strategic sense for us. Luckily, Andy and John in the team have the balance sheet with a change so that we are never forced to have to do asset sales, but we do them again, when it\u2019s a fair price and make strategic sense to Digital. Colby Synesael : Thanks. I have just one quick follow-up to that, which is your own valuation has gone up since the last asset sale you did with Maple \u2013 with the Mapletree. And I am just wondering if that factors into your decision-making when you think about the accretion dilution aspect to these potential sales in the cap rates you can get? Greg Wright : It does 100%. I mean, we look at \u2013 we look and see what we are trading, a lot of times for these assets will run marketed processes. So, we get a true market check, but yes, it definitely factors into our thinking, where our stock is trading and what our redeployment strategy will be. Yes, you can be best believed it factors into our thought and approach. Bill Stein : And then Colby, just real quick on your second question, obviously, we are not pulling forward on call with our guidance for next year, call it 180 days or whatever it is. But I think the point \u2013 that point most relevant to the heart of your question was funding sources and thoughts. Greg touched it little bit, but I think I would kind of capsulate in the following snapshot, obviously, where it stand today at our targeted leverage levels and that\u2019s with a substantial backlog of non-income producing assets that are going to be coming online and producing the EBITDA here shortly to kind of grow our EBITDA without much capital requirements to finish those projects. Two, as you saw, we have got about little more about \u2013 little over $300 million of cash sitting on the balance sheet, which is just the net of the capital raise relative to the data preferred redeemed. So, there is kind of cash sitting there, not earning anything as we speak, but obviously we will go towards our funding sources for the next 12 plus months. We have redeemed about $500 million of professional preferred in the last 2 months. So, we do have professional referred capacity and those coupons we have been quoted are close to 4%. Greg touched on potential dispositions in the call it \u2013 if we get to the high end of our guidance, let\u2019s call it another $500ish million of size. So also those are un-levered, also contributing equity sources. And then longer term, I think we are going back to that question you just had raised of always continuing to expand our capital partners with sources of private capital where we can put in fully valued, maximized, fully leased long-term assets and retained management control. And we have also not been shy of prudently using the ATM on the margins here. So I think we have got a lot of arrows in our quiver here in terms of capital sources to fund some pretty attractive opportunities we see in the front view mirror here. Thanks, Colby. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead. Bill Stein : Thank you, Andrew. I would like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further strengthened our connections with our customers, landing a record number of new logos in the quarter with a book of new business remarkably well balanced across customer type and geographic region. We also delivered solid current period financial results, feeding consensus and raising guidance for the second time this year. We further extended our global platform, providing customers a gateway into Southeastern Europe and our runway for growth across the continent, with strategic land acquisitions and new development starts. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, with exceptional execution on $2.5 billion of long-term capital raises and we use the proceeds to retire $2 billion of high coupon debt and preferred equity. I would like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family and particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of a global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and EVP of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We delivered high-quality quarterly bookings in terms of total volume as well as the product mix, geographic split and the number of new logos landing on PlatformDIGITAL. We extended our global platform entering Greece with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe and securing customer growth in existing markets around the world with key land purchases and new builds. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share $0.08 ahead of consensus, driven by operational outperformance. Finally, we further strengthened the balance sheet, lowering our weighted average cost of debt with the redemption of high-coupon debt and preferred equity, while extending our weighted average duration with the issuance of attractively priced long-term capital. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. William Stein : Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. The fourth quarter capped off a transformational year for Digital Realty. We acquired several highly connected assets, including the Westin Building in North America and Interxion in EMEA, along with the leading colocation and interconnection providers in Southeastern Europe, significantly expanding our platform in EMEA, while trimming non-core assets in North America. We delivered record bookings for the full-year, an extraordinary performance under any set of circumstances, but particularly amid the headwinds of a global pandemic. Our business is increasingly global. In 2020, we nearly doubled the number of countries where Digital Realty has a presence and EMEA accounted for more than half our fourth quarter bookings. The first time ever a majority of our bookings has been outside the Americas. We more than doubled our Cross Connect count in 2020, reflecting the growing concentration of network-dense highly connected assets on PlatformDIGITAL. We landed a record number of new logos in 2020, more than twice as many as our previous record, in fact, driving consistent growth in our enterprise colocation and interconnection business. The vibrant communities on our campus environments are attracting a growing set of new customers, diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams. Service providers and enterprises alike are strengthening their partnership with a select number of trusted global data center partners to help meet their growing needs around the world, and Digital Realty is uniquely well-positioned to serve as their partner of choice. Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. In October, we formally committed to reducing direct and indirect emissions by 68% and indirect emissions in our value chain by area by 24% by 2030 in line with a 1.5 degree climate change scenario. We set our target with science-based targets initiative, along with over 1,000 organizations that have committed to reduce emissions. And we also signed the UN Global Compact business ambition for 1.5 degree C, joining leading companies who have committed to ambitious carbon reduction targets. In early December, we announced that our operations in France were on target to achieve a carbon-neutral footprint by the end of the year, and are expected to remain carbon-neutral through 2030 for both existing facilities and future expansion based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In mid-December, we were honored to receive NAREIT\u2019s Leader in the Light Award for data center sustainability for the fourth consecutive year. In early January, we issued our fifth green bond, extending our lead as the largest U.S. REIT issuer bonds committed to sustainable investments. Our green bond framework is aligned with leading global best practices, including GRESB\u2019s green bond principles, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And Sustainalytics has provided an independent second-party opinion, including that our green bond program is considered robust, credible and transparent. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. In terms of our social efforts, we recently selected diversity, equity and inclusion as one of four company-wide philanthropic areas of focus in addition to sustainability, disaster relief and STEM education. As you may be aware, NAREIT recently instituted a dividends through diversity and inclusion program, which I am honored to be co-chairing, along with Tom Baltimore of Park Hotels and Debbie Cafaro of Ventas. Dividends through diversity will promote the recruitment, inclusion and advancement of women, minorities and other under-represented groups and REITs in the broader commercial real estate industry. We have also joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO Pledge on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative that aims to rally the business community, to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to cultivate a trusting environment where employees feel empowered to have discussions on these topics.  Participating in these programs and others like them is critical to our industries future because it is the right thing to do and because we serve a broad, diverse community. And we believe that to help our customers prepare for the future, we need industry professionals whose insights and perspectives reflect the communities we serve. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let's turn now to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to expand our global platform with the acquisition of the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Southeastern Europe, groundbreakings and existing markets across EMEA and strategic land purchase on the continent and in Asia Pacific. In early November, we acquired Lamda Hellix, the largest carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection provider in Greece, led by an accomplished management team who will continue to manage the business. As leading service providers continue to expand their footprint, we expect Greece and other parts of Southeastern Europe will be major beneficiaries. We are well positioned to capture the key cloud and connectivity deployments that will accelerate the regions digital transformation. In Denmark, we began construction on our third data center adjacent to the two existing facilities on our Copenhagen campus and offering direct access to leading global cloud providers, numerous networks, Internet exchanges and a transatlantic subsea cable system. We also broke ground on a new data center in Z\u00fcrich, where we have seen robust demand from leading global service providers. The expansion of our Z\u00fcrich campus will provide runway for customer growth at the leading cloud and interconnection hub in Switzerland. We also acquired a land parcel within one kilometer of our highly interconnected campuses in Vienna and halfway around the globe in Sydney, we are under contract to acquire two parcels that will support the development of up to 250 megawatts. These strategic land holdings will provide additional capacity, enabling local and global service providers to seamlessly expand adjacent to their existing deployments. Let's turn to Page 5 for an update on the Interxion integration. The successful integration of Interxion was our top priority for 2020, and we made excellent progress despite the pandemic. We build a solid foundation for the assimilation of our businesses and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives and synergies we outlined when we first announced the transaction. I am proud of what we've accomplished today and excited about our prospects as we move into the implementation phase in 2021. When we announced the transaction, we stated that the combined company would have enhanced capabilities to address and so the public and hybrid cloud architecture requirements of our global customer base that would allow us to build upon each company's current relationships with leading global customers, while also enabling us to effectively compete in the broader target markets. The early results are very promising. We've enjoyed excellent success with global platform providers and early cross-selling wins have surpassed expectations with numerous referrals between the sales teams. The significant embedded growth potential was another key element of the Interxion and investment thesis. We believe the combined organization has already created significant long-term value by executing on the existing development pipeline, acquiring the freehold to the land under key positions in Frankfurt and Paris and securing land in key markets to support future growth. Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 6. We continue to be fortunate to be operating in a business leverages secular demand drivers. As the leading global data center provider, we have a unique vantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge. We recently introduced the Data Gravity Index, which measures, quantifies and forecast the growing intensity of the enterprise data-creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. This groundbreaking index is a by-product of our market intelligence analysis as well as our obsessive focus on understanding customers\u2019 deployments and supporting their evolving infrastructure needs. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of Data Gravity. According to the market intelligence firm IDC, 80% of the world's data will reside within enterprises by the year 2025. A 451 Research global IT leader survey recently found that 87% of IT leaders will need to maintain local copies of critical data and global points of presence to meet regulatory requirements.  We continue to see these indicators as enterprises expand their private data infrastructure deployments and integrate data exchange with adjacent business and service provider partners across our global platform.  Digital Realty recently received Frost & Sullivan's APAC Data Center Strategy Innovator award, recognizing PlatformDIGITAL for providing an innovative global platform enabling enterprises to scale digital transformation in a consistent modular fashion and addressing the unique infrastructure requirements for integrating private data flows across multiple public platforms. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to meeting the needs of our global data center customer base. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed total bookings of $130 million in the fourth quarter, including a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-oriented deals of one megawatt or less totaled $31 million, building upon the consistent momentum throughout the year and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over eight years. We secured 120 new logos during the quarter with more than half of those new logos landing in EMEA, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. EMEA accounted for more than half of our fourth quarter bookings while Asia Pacific contributed over 15%. As Bill mentioned, this was the first time the majority of our bookings were outside the Americas. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a rapidly growing cloud-based cybersecurity provider selected PlatformDIGITAL for multiple environments in London and Boston to facilitate modernization and embrace high performance compute technology while maintaining an exceptional user experience. In New York, the Digital Realty\u2019s teams\u2019 deep understanding of a global retailers growth strategy enabled us to tailor a solution for their Americas markets on PlatformDIGITAL. We also overcame lockdowns and international travel restrictions to demonstrate to a digital telecom provider as they can leverage PlatformDIGITAL to meet their current and future growth requirements in existing and targeted markets at their required pace. A rapidly growing gaming platform experienced their hedge to rewire their network and optimized data exchange with third-party clouds, the growth of their existing footprint with us in Northern Virginia and a new deployment in Chicago. Likewise in Chicago, a global exchange operator leveraged PlatformDIGITAL to extend their access into our highly interconnected community. In Singapore, two leading global financial services firms expanded with Digital Realty due to our platform offering and long history of operational excellence, while a software developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to expand their proprietary cloud offering into the region. Turning to our backlog on Page 10. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $269 million. The step up from $229 million last quarter, reflect $78 million of commencements during the fourth quarter offset by roughly $118 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at 8.5 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 11. We signed $156 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average term loan renewals signed during the fourth quarter was a little over three years, reflecting a roughly even split in the mix between deals above and below one megawatt. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were plus 1% and cash rents were positive on renewals above and below one megawatt, an encouraging sign for pricing. We retained 79% of expiring leases in line with our long-term historical average. In terms of fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points, driven primarily by leases commencing on recent deliveries in Ashburn and the sale of a vacant building in Amsterdam. Same capital occupancy was down 40 basis points from the third quarter due to no move-outs, partially offset by positive absorption in Silicon Valley and Chicago. Same capital cash NOI growth has continued to improve since bottoming in 2019 and ticked up slightly to negative 1.6% in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.9% or a little over 100 basis points better than initially expected. As a reminder, the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Hellix and Altus IT are not yet included in the same store pool, but we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. The U.S. dollar softened in the second half of the year, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the fourth quarter, relative to the prior year average. Overall, FX represented roughly a 50 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In terms of vertical concentration, as you can see from the pie chart on the upper right, we are fortunate to be primarily serving customers whose businesses are thriving in the current environment with limited exposure to the sectors most negatively impacted. Rent collections remained in line with our historical average, and requests for rent relief have largely subsided. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy and matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term, fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, the fourth quarter core FFO per share was down 0.6% year-over-year, but $0.08 ahead of consensus driven primarily by operational outperformance. For the full-year, core FFO per share came in $0.22 or nearly 4% ahead of our initial guidance. As previewed on our third quarter call, we expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth driven by a full-year contribution from Interxion and the record colocation in interconnection and overall bookings in 2020. We expect that EBITDA margin will remain in line with the fourth quarter throughout 2021. As Bill mentioned, we remain on track to achieve the synergies we underwrote on the Interxion transaction. Although the rationale for the deal has always been accelerating revenue growth rather than realizing expense synergies. We've already made great strides on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 1 billion green euro bond offering in early January at five eights in addition to solid progress on the capital recycling front. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. In terms of FFO per share guidance, our forecast is largely unchanged from the preliminary outlook we previewed on the third quarter call, although the year-over-year bar has been raised in the interim given the outperformance in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, our 2021 guidance represents growth of approximately 4%, which includes near-term dilution from capital recycling. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down by about a nickel in the first quarter, then to ramp up fairly steadily over the rest of the year. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options or minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Fixed charge coverage reached 5.1x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated to 6.1x as of year-end, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through the combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as leases commenced from the record leasing activity in 2020. In mid-October, we redeemed \u00a3300 million or 4.75% sterling bonds due in 2023. We also redeemed $250 million of high-coupon series G preferred at [5.78%]. In early January, we raised a 1 billion of 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all time low-coupon for Digital Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023. And we paid all $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides the access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 14, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out nearly seven years or ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%, and little over half our debt is euro denominated reflecting the growth of our global platform post-Interxion and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities, and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we would be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. So the first question regards - is regarding leasing and you talked about logo capture, but I wondered of your largest kind of multi-megawatt deals, any kind of highlights by geography or type of company? And then the second question kind of gets to M&A and divestitures and new market entry and kind of any \u2013 any kind of a highlights to call out in terms of your appetite for any of those types of projects heading into 2021? Andrew Power : Hey. Thanks, Jon. I can probably kick it off on the question on the multi-megawatt side, and then I'll probably hand it over to Greg to speak to M&A. So I'm very pleased with the results overall in terms of 4Q. I think the diversity of the platform really shine through in both categories, not only the less than a megawatt in interconnection, but also on the scale or hyperscale plus. If you do a quick kind of run through the regions, EMEA, first time more than 50% of the signings, it was very diverse. There were six different markets across the EMEA that did a north of a megawatt deal each. So it was London, Paris, Marseille and two others that escaped my mind. And then over in the Americas, we had both in Ashburn and also in Hillsborough, and the cast of characters for all these are the combination of the major CSPs, SaaS providers and, call it, B2C hyperscalers as well. And then last but not least, I'm pleased with the results in both Brazil and we signed our second customer in Santiago, Chile, in the hyperscale arena, another top CSP. And then last but not least, had a project with a top three CSP down in Sydney. So really diverse contribution from numerous major metros. And I'll turn it over to Greg to pick up on the M&A piece. Jonathan Atkin : Actually just continuing on that, as you look at the pipeline into 2021, whether you, Andy or Corey would want to comment, but is there any kind of change in procurement activity or just dialogue with your customers that gives you particular confidence around repeating some of this recent momentum? Andrew Power : I\u2019ll toss that to Corey. Corey Dyer : Hey, Jonathan, this is Corey. I appreciate it. Just broadly on the sales funnel, I'll just tell you that we're happy with the momentum and the success we had in 2020. We see that continuing. I think Andy mentioned to you the regional variances that we've had, meaning first time that EMEA is our largest region for sales and for bookings there. So that was really good and positive. So we feel good about it. And then regarding the industries, I think you might ask about those that are work that are taking advantage of the current work from home are doing more and more quickly with us. And so we're happy about that and how we're supporting them. And then also we're seeing strength from those industries that were strong prior to the pandemic, cloud, digital media, et cetera. And then those that are being kind of suffering a little bit from it, we're seeing them maintain their IT services and they still got to continue to have our support to go after their mission-critical needs. So we're happy about it. And as we mentioned earlier, year-on-year record growth from new logos, standalone, really good success from digital and Interxion as we combine the two groups. So real happy with the funnel. Hand it back to you \u2013 over to Greg, sorry. Go ahead, Greg. Greg Wright : Why don't I take it? Okay. Thanks, Corey. Hey Jon. Hope you're well. Let me \u2013 I guess in the order, let's go to M&A first, then we can talk about the divestures, which are somewhat related. Like I think with respect to M&A, as we've said before, like we remain focused on integrating Interxion, while doing a few tuck-in acquisitions as we would call them like Altus IT in Croatia and Lamda Hellix in Greece. Look, we think the M&A is likely to be more episodic than annual. I think we've already said that. And look, as we look at the M&A environment right now, we would say it's probably gotten more competitive over the past year as additional capital is coming to the space. But we also think this could serve to benefit us as we seek to dispose of assets in our capital recycling program. I think, look, with respect to our divestitures or capital recycling, our criteria for asset sales remains consistent with our prior commentary. We're seeking to sell non-core assets and select non-core markets. Today, we follow these criteria and dispose of various PBB assets and other quality standalone assets. That really just are not part of our Connected Campus strategy. We're about $1.5 billion through the multi-year guidance we gave, which was to sell a few billion of assets over a few years. The good news for us is we don't need to sell these assets. So we have the ability to be strategic and only offer these assets when it\u2019s likely that we are going to receive a fair market value for the assets. And we do expect that these assets sales that will recycle their capital will provide some of the capital needed for our development program this year and going forward. Again, that's really the state of play. Again, tuck-in acquisitions are going to be more focused deals that are strategic, as both Croatia and Greece where there are highly connected assets in the regions. The assets, combined with the management teams, provide a strong launching pad for further activity in the region. And that's really the way we look at it and we'll continue to try to find similar deals like these two to the extent we can. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : Yes. Thank you all for the questions. A few, if I could. First, I noticed the GAAP base rent per square foot step down across the regions quarter-over-quarter. Can you comment on that? Andrew Power : Hey, Michael. So I think there's a few - two items to note in there in particular. And I think you're mostly talking about the greater than megawatt because I thought we had pretty strong pricing power on a less than a megawatt category, more enterprise network workloads landing in those sites. On the greater than a megawatt piece, it's a little bit of apples and oranges in comparing each market quarter-over-quarter. You\u2019re probably better off going back to the second quarter in terms of more of an apples-to-apples comparison volume. And then in the fourth quarter, we had a particular deal structure that make that skew that stat lower in terms of reported results. You may recall a year or two ago in the Ashburn market, we did a almost build-to-suite type project, where we built a rather large 36 megawatts Shell for a customer that was paying us for that Shell on a long-term lease. And then we dropped down and built out suites in six megawatt or still increments over time. So as those \u2013 as the takedowns of those suites happen, you're only getting a fraction of the entire economic cost for that customer flowing through our leasing stats because we already recognized the signing and already realizing the return on the Shell. And that phenomenon happened actually in North America and also in Asia Pacific, this particular market. Strategically, I mean, it's great tool in our toolkit that I would say not all competitors can really have, really given a customer the runway that they desire and the timing flexibility and digital with it scale and breadth of portfolio and as well as our land banks are able to kind of structure those types of transactions that I think is a strategic advantage for those types of customers. Michael Funk : And then Andy, on the FFO growth bridge you provided, maybe how it actually quantify the impact from the potential sales, the $600 million to $1 billion. Can you quantify that for us? Andrew Power : Yes. So we reiterated really the same quantity of capital cycle for this year as last year. We feel good near-term on the lower end of that range. It's a contributor to the, call it, 4Q to 1Q, bridging the quarterly rhythm of core FFO. Just kind of rough math. If we kind of just hit the low end of that range, $600 million, use the same type of cap rate we are using for the last outright sale. We did call it a mid to low-six cap. You call it about $40 million of NOI and our share count could be as high as 2%. Now that's assuming you sold the entirety of those assets the first day of the year, and you didn't have any redeployment of proceeds. So when you kind of use the appropriate calendarization based on our expectations and also redeploy those proceeds, either paying down debt near-term or in lieu of really equity, I would call it a ballpark in 50 to 100-ish type basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth that is. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey guys. Thank you. [Technical Difficulties] but has not happened yet. I just want to clarify. And then secondly, more related to hyperscale in the U.S., if someone could just give an update on the pricing competitive backdrop you're seeing within hyperscale and whether deals are getting any more or less competitive than they've been in the past? Thanks. Andrew Power : Sure. So two elements. First on your base. We definitely had some outperformance in the fourth quarter that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. Some of that was, call it, operational-related just commencing revenue faster, but some of it was out of our control and FX was a tailwind. As you saw the U.S. dollar kind of plummet and then retrench into 2021. So that makes a little bit of an apples to oranges comparison between 4Q and the run rate for 2021. The answer to your question on the dispositions, other than a small one-off asset for, I think, $6 million, we have not executed on any of the next leg of capital recycling yet that we framed as a \u2013 at a low range of $600 million to high range of $1 billion, and we expect the low end of that range to be executed upon in the pretty near-term future here. Hence, when you sell that quantity of assets even at a 6, 6.5 cap rate, you have immediate loss of that income. Just to remind you Matt and then the broader audience, the dilution or near-term, we think, a) is offset by longer-term accretion. We're selling non-core slower growing parts of our portfolio and using that capital often in lieu of equity to fund our growth. And two, that dilution is baked within the approximate 4% year-over-year growth. So we're arriving at that year-over-year growth comparison off outperformance at the last and back half of this year and absorbing that dilution. So it's not incremental to the guidance that we've already laid out. Matthew Niknam : Got it. And on the hyperscale? Andrew Power : Thank you for reminding me the first question. Matt, your question was about hyperscale pricing and the like. Matthew Niknam : Yes. Pricing and competitive nature because we've heard maybe some anecdote thing, it was maybe on the margin. Things were beginning to get a little bit better. But I'm just curious to get your take in terms of what you've seen. Andrew Power : Yes. I think the \u2013 a couple of data points that I would say point to our continued confidence in the opportunity set and really differentiated offering that I think allows us to outshine our competitors, especially any fledging, we're newer competitors. One, you've seen now a string of quarters in a row where we have a global platform offering for the hyperscalers and to address their pain points, future-proof their growth and deliver operational excellence across now, 49 metros, six continents, 24 countries. So the trend has been our friend in terms of success there. I think if you look to our development pipeline that stepped up about 13% quarter-over-quarter, now 220 megawatts or so under development, still about 55-ish percent pre-leased. You've got to imagine there's a lot of hyperscale business in that. I think the returns have been pretty steady in that category, if not stepped up in certain regions. I'm not saying or blushing off that there is \u2013 some of this business is competitive. I think our most competitive market is certainly the U.S. In that market, I think our value proposition has allowed us to \u2013 even in a challenged market like Ashburn do particularly well with all of our customers, but hyperscalers in particular. And I think if you then look where the pipeline is going and where the growth for our business is going, we're seeing more and more opportunities to generate higher returns from both our colocation and interconnection offering, but also serving those hyperscalers in places where we have a really differentiated value proposition. Certainly tighter markets like Santa Clara in the U.S., but international markets like Frankfort, Marseille, Brazil and Singapore as well. So listen, not saying that hyperscale became an easy business overnight, but feel very good about what we're delivering to those customers. Operator : The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Good afternoon. Andy could you just elaborate on the downtime on vacancy a little bit that sort of baked into the sequential nickel decline you're pointing to on Page 13. I'm not sure if that factored into the 1.3% churn you saw in the fourth quarter, or if that's sort of hitting elsewhere? Andrew Power : Yes. I would say that the fourth quarter actually \u2013 and then I'll get to the first part of your question, Jordan. The fourth quarter actually was pretty pleased with the customer retention and pricing dynamic in both categories in terms of pricing, in both categories in terms of retention and potentially called in the 80s and positive mark-to-markets for both above and less than a megawatt. The impact that we see hitting 2021, but certainly the first quarter of 2021 really goes back to what I mentioned in our call a quarter ago. We ended the year with our largest amount of non-retained capacity in any given market, just under 17 megawatts coming back to us. It literally came back to us the first of the year. The customer had both physical and economic occupancy of the suite until the year changed. It's across multiple suites, across numerous campuses in Ashburn. We're going to \u2013 we're refurbing that capacity and getting it back out to the market. Of that 17 megawatts, I can tell you, we've already released to a new customer. They haven't commenced yet, but they've signed for it, 2.3 megawatts, we're likely to take another 2.3 megawatts suite and convert that to productized colocation given the success of our offering in the market. And then we've got a pretty strong pipeline for those other opportunities of vacancy. And it is a bit serendipitous in our favor that we've had such success in Ashburn. Despite the broader market challenges is that we're being able to focus all our efforts in re-leasing that capacity because our newest building doesn't come online until roughly the July 1. So really it's that downtime until we get the new customers and new shapes and forms, certainly taking a temporal hit to 2021 in the first quarter. Jordan Sadler : And what's the biggest chunk of the 17-meg. You mentioned 2.3 is already been re-leased. They're not contiguous, but biggest contiguous chunk. And then just back to the $0.05. Is that \u2013 the bulk of that coming from this departure? And how will this hit 1Q, maybe you talk about 1Q and 2021 churn guidance overall? Andrew Power : So let me try to unpack a few there. So the biggest hall is the 2.3 megawatts, but there's numerous contiguous halls. So if we wanted to \u2013 if a customer wanted to have numerous contiguous halls, which certain customers value that. I think we can string six or so of those together. I'm sorry that can't be right. I'm looking at the wrong schedule here. We're going to \u2013 we can string, I think, three of those together of contiguous data halls, but each POD is roughly a 2.3 POD. That is the largest driver to the $0.05, in terms of quarter-over-quarter step down. And then Jordan could you just remind me the second part or the third part of your question there. Jordan Sadler : Just churn. So what do you think if churn was 1.3 in 4Q, what would it be in 1Q and then just maybe full-year expectation while we're at it? Andrew Power : So that's a greater than a megawatt capacity churn, or less than a megawatt capacity churn looks like it's going to be basically in line. And I don't have the implied first quarter churn. I think the 80s steps down on a full-year basis to call it like 69% for the full portfolio in the greater than a megawatt territory. But you can use 17 megawatts as a proxy, and you can see our quantities of expirations. I don't have all the ingredients to give you the exact math on the first quarter measurement right here. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan Petersen : Great, thanks. Just a couple from me. So the recurring CapEx and the fourth quarter looks a little elevated. I wonder if there's just anything that we should be thinking about there and how it will trend in the next year on a quarterly basis. Andrew Power : Yes. Not just for recurring CapEx, but I would say some of the OpEx as well. You're seeing some of the COVID fluctuations. If you look at the \u2013 I think it's scheduled $28 million recurring CapEx step down to \u2013 as low as $34 million in the first quarter of 2020, $38 million in the second quarter of 2020, then $53 million and $83 million. So we did have a little bit of a catch-up period in terms of call it timing. As you can see, Jon, our guidance for the current CapEx for all of 2020 is roughly the same numbers as prior year. So $220 million, I believe, or $230-ish million. So we have a little bit of fourth quarter catch-up in there. Just the only major items we had \u2013 we had some refresh capital and some second generation space and I think we\u2019re converting to colocation, when a [PEB or TKM] customer had exited. So that kind of hits \u2013 that's not first-generation so it hits through the recurring CapEx. I think that's a product of, call it, maturation of our portfolio and customer to new types of customers in different shapes and forms. But I wouldn't \u2013 you can't just analyze that as next year. You've got look to our guidance table for more appropriate view for the full-year 2021. Jonathan Petersen : Okay. All right. And then I kind of ask about market rents. I mean, do you guys have a sense maybe if we just think about your greater than one megawatt tenant. Do you have a sense of where the mark-to-market is on in place rents versus market rents? And then, I know you talked about your leasing spreads being relatively flat this year. But I mean, based off the market dynamics that you're seeing, what are your expectations for rent growth over this year and over the next few years? Are we to a point where we can start to see rents start to grow again? Andrew Power : I think, there's a couple relevant data points to look at that. Obviously the activity we are seeing coming through our renewal activity both in the fourth quarter as a trajectory throughout the year. And we had consistent progress to the point where we had positive plus one megawatt cash renewal spreads in 4Q. Some of the stronger markets were renewed and shining through there. Santa Clara was a standout in that renewal. We have not \u2013 our guidance includes a slightly negative outlook for the cash mark-to-markets, but, I know we used the language there instead of exact numbers. I think our language is less conservative than it was last year. So I think we're moving into better territory. If you look at just the lease expiration schedule in 2021, I think we're getting into a better place both in volume mix and mark-to-market relative to leasing history. You called out particularly the greater the megawatt category, which is called 7.5-ish percent of our expirations down from a high, call it over 10% at one point. It's pretty diverse with no market other than Ashburn being even greater than 1%. And the mix and geographically, you're seeing a sizeable part component from not only Santa Clara, our titers U.S. market, but also our international markets in the coming contracts. And then last but not least just looking at the new signings because more of a forward indicator of what to come, by and large in the greater than megawatt category I saw \u2013 we saw pretty good firmness in the pricing. And I would \u2013 as I say strengths in Americas were, call it New York, Chicago, excuse me, I\u2019m looking at the wrong schedule. In the greater than a megawatt, you had pretty much stability in both Northern Virginia and Portland. Again, it goes back to that structure I mentioned previously where the customers taking down shells at pre-committed rates at their discretion. So really not room for negotiation there and a desire for them to grow with adjacency. And then EMEA, we saw strength in the greater than megawatt plus category for Zurich, and Marseille were particular standout markets. And then last but not least, Singapore, that market has been a star. And I think you're going to see that continue into 2021. And that is certainly a market where we're doing a sizeable amount of megawatt plus activity as well. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good afternoon. Curious, probably two things if I could. The first is if we turn to Page 25 of the supplemental, you provide the development yield by region that you're expecting. And just curious for your take on the movement over the last few quarters where it seems like North America has moved up a little bit. EMEA is down a little bit. Asia-Pac near the level on this page. And where do you see that going over the next couple of years based on the activity and the demand in the pipeline? And just separately, curious to go back to one of the comments, I think Bill made it at the beginning of the call, describing that some of the larger customers are choosing a select number of global data center partners. And curious just on that theme, are you seeing a greater percentage of your large customers embraced multiple providers? Or are you seeing more of a winner-take-all evolution where one data center provider could take the disproportionate share of business from some of these customers? Thanks. Andrew Power : I\u2019m going to give Bill the honors to answer the second part of the question first, and then I'll come back and do the numbers questions on development cycle on Page 26. William Stein : Yes. Thanks for the question. We're definitely seeing a shrinking of the number of participants in the business. I think that clearly plays to our strengths, but I think that COVID in particular has demonstrated the importance of having a very credible counterparty on the other end of these partnerships and we\u2019ve received excellent feedback from our partners, particularly among the hyperscalers about our procedures around not just COVID, but some of the other social unrest that has occurred in the last several quarters. Andrew Power : And then Michael on your second question, I mean, I think there's a few observations and some of this is repetitive. The development pipeline, one, you're missing it from here because it's a unconsolidated self-managed joint venture is not on the schedule. But we've seen tremendous activity in Latin America, including a continued growth in Brazil. Not only our first, but second customer in San Diego, Chile and probably expect us to experience the same in terms of our second customers landing into New Mexico City. On this schedule, the volume has stepped up about 13% to 221.5 megawatts. The pre-leasing has remained roughly intact at 55%. If you go market-by-market, I think you're accurate in seeing this trend of a larger and larger share of our new capacity capital going outside the United States. The Americas region is a little muted because we delivered capacity. That was 100% pre-leased in Ashburn and the shell which will show up with megawatts on the schedule. I think in a quarter or so, just hasn't popped in here, but I still think the thesis is constant. And you're seeing also a year-over-year improvement on the yields in the Americas. And I think another relevant data point is the non-U.S. markets are also becoming more diverse. In EMEA, as I rattle off at the very beginning of the call, rather ineloquently was across six different EMEA markets with north of a megawatt signings. You can see on the schedule from Amsterdam to Zurich, numerous markets with capacity coming online. And I think the same phenomenon is going to happen. Ours continue to happen in the APAC region as well. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi, thank you. The first question is on interconnection. You reported the interconnection and the backlog. But can you just give us some color in terms of how that backlog is mapping the respective region? That's the first one. And then the second one is, may Bill, Andy, anyone can really address this. Has digital adopted maybe a different philosophy on speculative construction versus only building with pre-leases in hand? Has kind of the playbook changed a little bit just given the very rapid and high volume leasing that tends to come pretty big cycles that we've seen as the strategy kind of changed a little bit? And I'll leave it at that. Andrew Power : Bill, do you want to \u2013 again, we'll try to do the same format. You take the second question first on strategy and then I can go back to the interconnection details. William Stein : Sure. So I would say that the strategy today is we don't really go into any of these new markets without a pre-lease in hand, without an anchor. So that's what we've done in Chile. That's what we've done in Mexico. Now we did buy existing businesses, obviously in Croatia and Greece, so that's different. But in general, I think we're looking for one of our good customers that it may \u2013 and probably more than one to tell, so they really want us to, to go into that market, and then [indiscernible] an anchor lease with us. As far as existing markets are concerned, those are used. Those are almost always expansions with existing customers. And that business to be quite Candace is a fast and furious. In some instances I would say the challenge is just keeping up with the demand in existing markets with particularly the hyperscalers. Andrew Power : And then Sami on your question on interconnection. So quite pleased with the interconnection signing contribution. Yes, it's stepped down quarter-over-quarter, but it was up 4% from the prior quarter and 3Q was quite outsized winter in terms of interconnection signings. The cast of characters are similar in terms of the type of verticals industry-wise that we experienced in the past. Regionally some of the start, I would say the EMEA region, it was definitely a standout in this category not just in the fourth quarter, but on the full-year basis. I believe their interconnection revenue was called up into the double-digits type growth trajectory. I also \u2013 I know you quite asked this question, I also really look at these things part and parcel with the less than a megawatt signings because they also often go hand-in-hand in terms of our most interconnection rich type customers, day one and certainly post-landing with digital. I would say we put up the third quarter or fourth quarter in a row of consecutive growth in that category of a really strong 3Q. We put a record [indiscernible] the interconnection and less than a megawatt or colocation type signings category. Those are also led by EMEA, but APAC played a great role. We've launched now our colocation offering in Osaka and Singapore and Hong Kong and our first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, South Korea are right around the corner. So great early days in that category as well regionally. So we're definitely expanding the breadth of the product offering across more and more markets and pleased with the success we're seeing in both the interconnection and the, call it, enterprise and network-oriented less than a megawatt category. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you, Bill and Andy. And actually just one quick follow-up and this is pertaining mainly to Europe. And since you guys have now kind of integrated Interxion and you've looked at some of the pricing in each of the respective market. Do you expect the cadence or at least the stabilization of pricing or I mean, maybe that's the wrong way to phrase it? The right way to phrase it is marking it up slightly, right, to reflect pricing that looks more comparable to U.S. market. You guys see \u2013 the rate at which you guys are increasing, is that starting to moderate or is pricing relatively flat and consistent and not really changing or evolving much in Europe? I just want to understand kind of like what's going on from a local type of pricing perspective. And I think I'm mainly referring to the zero to one megawatt type leases specifically. Andrew Power : Thanks, Sami. That was a very elegant way of asking, if you're going to increase cross-sell prices in Europe, I think. But I'm going to pass this over to Chris in a second. But I think we're very focused on delivering as much value to our customers in terms of increased performance, increased security, increased efficiency, and do that in a global platform offering here in PlatformDIGITAL. So it's not a episodic one market, has to match another market. We're very attuned to the customer needs and also supply demand nature in each market. But maybe Chris, do you want to talk to \u2013 touch a little bit about our product roadmap and how pricing relates to that? Christopher Sharp : Absolutely. I appreciate it, Sami. Definitely we look at driving value to our customers through our global interconnected platform, which Bill stated in his prepared remarks, but double our Cross Connect count in 2020 is pretty impressive. And particularly to EMEA, we\u2019re constantly watching exactly how our communities of interest have really grown there with network dense highly connected assets as a part of PlatformDIGITAL, but we absolutely align our Cross Connect pricing based on the market dynamics within EMEA. And we'll continually evolve our platform to ensure that pricing is aligned with the value that we see these communities of interest continually getting out of the platform. But one of the things that we're very happy about is we continually see the attach rate within each of these markets continually increasing and it's core to our platform going forward, that we removed complexity from the customers so they can get access to that value in a more simplistic fashion. So you'll see that play out over the coming year and exactly how we achieved that. But it's something that we're constantly watching and making sure that the customers are getting the true value that they need in a very simplistic fashion. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead. William Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the fourth quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we've further strengthened our connections with our customers, meeting more of their needs beyond the U.S. and reaching a much broader set of enterprise customers with our enhanced colocation and interconnection product offerings. We delivered extremely solid current period financial results, delivering full-year FFO per share that was nearly 4% above our initial guidance. We extended our global platform, providing customers with a gateway into Southeastern Europe and runway for growth around the world with strategic land purchases and new development starts. And last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, extending our average duration while further ratcheting down our average cost of debt by locking in attractive pricing on long-term capital and retiring high-coupon debt and preferred equity. I'd like to conclude today's call by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, but particularly our frontline team members in critical data center facility rules who have kept the digital world turning in the midst of this global pandemic. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up. Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Operator. The speakers on today\u2019s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I\u2019d like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First, we demonstrated our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises and corporate governance enhancements. We continue to enhance the value of our global platform, extending connectivity offerings globally, recycling capital and investing to fuel high quality organic growth. We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. Finally, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, lowering our weighted average cost of debt with the redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity, while extending our weighted average duration with the issuance of attractively priced long-term capital. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Stein : Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework and our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of this framework. Our business is increasingly global, with first quarter bookings very evenly balanced across regions. We continue to align PlatformDIGITAL with our customer\u2019s digital transformation issues by expanding our unique interconnection capabilities focusing on connecting centers of data across our robust, reliable global platform. Last, but not least, we continue to advance our initiatives to deliver sustainable growth for all stakeholders. Let\u2019s turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on page three. We were recently honored to be named EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for Energy Management for the second year in a row. We were also recently honored to receive the 2020 largest financial Corporate Green Bond Award from Climate Bonds Initiative. We expect to publish our third annual ESG report during the second quarter, providing transparency on our ESG performance for 2020, as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy commitment, resource conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion, and other sustainable business practices. We are committed to minimize our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society. In terms of our social efforts, we recently joined leaders across 85 industries, inciting the CEO pledge on CEO action for diversity and inclusion, an initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our Board of Directors also amended our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. Finally in February, our Board of Directors amended our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter to formalize oversight of our ESG programs, including sustainability, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let\u2019s turn to our investment activity on page four. We continue to invest in our global platform, with 44 projects underway around the world, totaling more than three 100 megawatts of incremental capacity scheduled for delivery over the next 18 months. Half of this expansion is underway in EMEA, while the balance is split roughly evenly between the Americas and APAC. In EMEA we continued our extension of the highly connected legacy Interxion campus in Frankfurt and began construction on the Neckermann expansion campus. During the first quarter, we broke ground on the first 26 megawatts on the expansion campus which are scheduled for delivery next year. Demand in Frankfurt remains strong and our campus with access to over 700 carriers and ISP continues to attract customers from around the world. In France, we were adding capacity in Marseille, as well as Paris. Demand in Marseille is largely driven by the 14 subsea cables that terminate in our facilities where we are transforming a former abandoned World War II U-boat bunker into a modern and vital communications hub for over half of the world\u2019s population. In Paris, we continue to develop Interxion Paris Digital Park, while the Dunant subsea cable that links Paris to Virginia Beach, was connected in our Paris campus during the quarter. We are also expanding our highly connected Brussels campus and breaking ground on another facility in Madrid to serve the broadening needs of service providers, as well as enterprises. In APAC, we recently announced the grand opening of our third data center in Singapore. We were particularly pleased to be recognized by Singapore\u2019s Desmond Lee, Minister of National Development, highlighting the sustainable design of our most energy efficient data center in the region. Despite some COVID related construction challenges last year, we were gratified to be able to deliver this highly connected and sustainably designed facility to meet customer needs in our tightest market. Finally, in mid-March, we closed on a sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million, executing on our strategy of recycling capital from stabilized assets, reinvesting proceeds into higher growth opportunities, while prioritizing long-term value creation over near-term earnings growth. Let\u2019s turn to the demand drivers on page five. We are fortunate to be operating in a business leverage of secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique advantage point that enables us to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. In the second half of last year, we introduced to our customers the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that projects the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. In the first quarter of this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross industry collaboration for our customers, as they tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. Market intelligence from Gartner recently hosted an executive retreat and surveyed over 400 Chief Data and Analytic officers, with 83% of CEOs expecting to increase investments in digital business, with a large percentage of these firms prioritizing digital data products to drive growth. With this transition to data driven businesses, Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 75% of companies will deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission critical data analytics, sharing and governance. We are seeing growing momentum across our enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and analytics environments in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL. As I mentioned earlier, Digital Realty was recently named ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the second consecutive year. This award reflects our sharpened focus on driving sustainable design and operations on PlatformDIGITAL, underpinned by ambitious science-based targets to significantly reduce our carbon footprint by 2030. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market leading innovation to capture the growing global data center demand opportunity from data driven businesses. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting these needs, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold and store. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s turn to our leasing activity on page seven. We signed total bookings of $117 million in the first quarter, including a $13 million contribution from Interxion. Network and enterprise oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less total $33 million, building upon our consistent momentum and demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL, as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over seven years. We landed 100 new logos during the first quarter, with strong showing across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform. The midst of our new signings was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA, each contributing approximately 30% and the Americas accounting for the remaining 40%. In addition, nearly 40% of bookings were generated within the megawatt or less plus Interxion category, with strengthen in the e-commerce, gaming and financial services segments. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a particular highlight of the quarter was landing a leading APAC-based diversified digital economy platform in Singapore, where we were able to support this customer\u2019s needs across our full product spectrum, from colocation and connectivity to a hyperscale dedicated data hall. Elsewhere in APAC, a leading cloud service provider expanded with us simultaneously in both Melbourne and Osaka. Subsequent to quarter end, we landed a leading cloud provider to anchor our Tokyo campus in Inzai, where we\u2019ve assembled a runway of over 100 megawatts of growth capacity, as well as key magnetic connectivity solutions. In EEMEA an automotive digital technology maker deployed an artificial intelligence machine learning footprint on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to a community of leading cloud service providers on our Frankfurt campus. In the Americas, a leading cloud provider spin it on our campuses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. A global 2000 industrial manufacturer leveraged a partner to deploy on PlatformDIGITAL to support growing demand, enabled by our global platform and runway for growth on our Suburban Chicago campus. A global digital advertising exchange platform expanded its presence on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to connected data communities in the Northern Virginia Metro area. Also in Ashburn, a leading video game developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to build centers of data exchange. And finally, a global IT service provider expanded a multiple metros across North America to enable new services on PlatformDIGITAL. Turning to our backlog on page nine, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reach another all time high of $307 million. The step up from $269 million last quarter reflects $66 million of commencements during the first quarter, offset by roughly $104 million of combined space and power leases signed. The lag between signage and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average adjusted on eight months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We signed $193 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the first quarter was a little less than three years, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt. We retained 75% of expiring leases, just a bit below our long-term average. Cash re-leasing spreads on renewals were negative 2.1%, which was in line with guidance, but weighed down by to customers who were new to existing capacity as part of the expansion of their footprint on our platform. These transactions are prime examples of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we\u2019re competing for new business with a customer, we -- that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business, as well as renewals. In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy tick down to 100 basis points, driven by anticipated churn in Ashburn, as well as the sale of 11 almost fully leased facilities in Europe. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 2.8% in the first quarter, in line with guidance and largely driven by this same Ashburn churn. As a reminder, our recently acquired Western building in Seattle, Interxion across EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia, are not yet included in the same store pool. But we expect each of these acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the first quarter, but still remain somewhat depressed relative to the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind in the first quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, 100-basis-point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50-basis-point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share was up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecasts was driven by a beat on the topline with an assist from an FX tailwind, as well as operating expense savings, primarily due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment and a later the budget of closing on the non-core European portfolio sale. A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than permanent savings. But substantially all of the beat flows through to the raise and we are taking core FFO per share guidance up by $0.075 at the midpoint. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we still expect the split between first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately 49/51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, we expect to dip down by about $0.10 in the second quarter, before wrapping up fairly steadily over the rest of the year due to the mid-March closing of the non-core European portfolio sale, as well as an expected catch-up in OpEx spend previously budgeted for the first quarter. I would like to point out that although we are raising our G&A forecast by $15 million at the midpoint, our implied EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged, as the lion\u2019s share of the increase is due to geography on the income statement as we finalize mapping the Interxion cost structure and reap characterize a portion of Interxion\u2019s OpEx spend as overhead. In terms of our financing plans, we\u2019ve already made great strides this year, with a highly successful $1 billion green euro bond offering in early January at 0.625%, in addition to the proceeds from the asset sales in March. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year and we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing at attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities. Last but certainly not least, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on page 13. As previously mentioned, we\u2019ve closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt, bringing net debt to adjusted EBITDA back down to 5.6 times in line with our long-term target range. Fixed charge coverage reached an all time high of 5.8 times, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options, while minimizing the related cost and extending the durations of our liabilities to match our long lived assets. In early January, we raised $1 billion to 10.5-year green euro bonds at an all time low coupon for Digital Realty 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023 and we\u2019ve repaid all $530 million outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. In mid-April, we announced the redemption of $200 million of preferred stock at 0.625% also bring total preferred equity redemptions over the past 12 months to $700 million and a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25, effectively lowering leverage by another 0.3 turns. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 13, we extended our weighted average debt maturity up to nearly seven years or ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see on the left side of the page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to feel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we\u2019d be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkins with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jon Atkins : Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about, I guess, customer retention, as well as about new logo generation. As we look at your pending lease expirations out through year end 2022, any kind of update you can give us on which markets might have greatest exposure? And is there a way to characterize how much of that you will consider it to be highly likely to renew or extend their commitments? And then on the kind of on the new business that you\u2019re bringing on, if you think about your sub-megawatts or low single-digit -- megawatt colocation win, any way to characterize how much of that has a high kind of connectivity attach rate to it? And more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe just review initiatives you have underway to enhance productivity in your direct and indirect channels and manage those ongoing relationships? Thanks. Andy Power : Hey. Thanks, Jon. I will -- maybe I\u2019ll try to tackle some of the number of questions on the beginning and I\u2019ll turn it over to Corey to talk about our channels and productivity. So just a cut them up in a little bit order here. So I would characterize, going to your second question about how much of our less than megawatt of colocation is kind of connectivity rich, I would characterize that is a highly connectivity rich piece of our business. In terms of the numbers of our customers of the 4,000 customers that we have a digital, the lion\u2019s share of the customer count falls in that. They sit in typically some of our more highly connected destinations either dating back many years to our legacy Telx business or Interxion or Westin building or where we\u2019ve organically grown our colocation connectivity suites across North America, I think, we have five markets across Asia-Pacific and elsewhere around the globe. So you typically see fairly sticky high retention, low churn, as well as fairly substantial pricing power quarter-after-quarter and you can see that in the retention table at the back of sup. And the definition didn\u2019t change all that much when we migrated from the work colocation to a sizing definition. I think the first part of your question was called, look at the expiration schedule. I thought I heard a post year in 2022. I\u2019m not sure my crystal ball can go with that much precision out that far. I would say, dramatically, we\u2019ve been working through a few years now of more tougher sledding when it came to our expiration and that was in 2020, 2019, 2018, that was in size of the volume of the expirations, that was in the mix of expirations, in terms of kind of going back to more higher -- less pricing power locations, telco deals, concentrations of some multi-market, major customer renewals, I think we\u2019ve done a nice job chopping a fair bit of wood and the front view mirror on the expiration schedule. What certainly looks better than what we\u2019ve come through and I think you\u2019ve seen that now, in terms of how our mark-to-market has called is being progressing in back into a better fashion as we kind of work through some of the lumpier contracts and you\u2019re going to see it on the percentages of where the expirations kind of fall between the plus or minus megawatt category. So feels like we\u2019re heading in the right direction on the expiration schedule and I didn\u2019t touch -- definitely geographically just by the maturity of our business much were non-U.S. are out, call in EMEA, APAC type expirations into the future, which also call up higher barrier to entry, tough -- high pricing power markets. But I will turn to Corey to hit your -- the last part of your question. Corey Dyer : Yeah. Hey. Thanks, Andy, and Jon, thanks for the question. I think I kind of captured it and you correct me if I missed it. But you asked a question around channels and how we\u2019re doing there. And then a little bit about with the new logo that we\u2019re getting an increase in interconnect I think are the questions, and, Jonathan, if I missed it, then you can always clarify it later. But I will tell you that really happy with the progress we\u2019re making on channels of our, I will call it, enterprise business, non-scale business, the channel is now about a quarter of the business. So we\u2019re pretty happy with the progress there. And then your question around new logos and how much of the new logos are adding interconnection to it. We\u2019ve seen an increase in that. It really kind of just comes through when you think through PlatformDIGITAL and how we\u2019re getting many, many more multi-use cases deployment, multi-site deployment, most of those look like network connectivity, as well as in control our hub. And so we\u2019re seeing good progress across those and we\u2019re seeing, I guess, the net of it is the channels bringing up a lot more new logos and those new logos are a little bit more interconnections in and they were in the past. Hopefully that answers the question. Jon Atkins : Yeah. I was -- just given the challenge you brought on from Interxion and then a lot of legacy Equinix people such as yourself that are on Board, just interested in any kind of machine learning, AI, predictive analytics, tools\u2026 Corey Dyer : Oh! Okay. Yes. Jon Atkins : \u2026are continuing. Yeah. Yeah. Corey Dyer : No. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. That\u2019s good question. Yeah. I\u2019m pretty familiar with that. And I\u2019ll tell you that, you referenced a few places that some of have been, so we are not going to comment on what they\u2019re doing. But I would tell you that, yes, we do use call it AI and I\u2019ll say target based data set for both our prospects, our customers. And I\u2019ll tell you that we use data and that\u2019s really what the essence of the Data Gravity Index was, it was a -- Data Gravity Index published based on data and what we see in the industry. And it really helped us identify the shift in the infrastructure placement and connectivity that\u2019s required across the full spectrum colocation. And so I feel like we\u2019re doing pretty good across both those Jonathan using AI, using data to make our decision to how we target our customers. So, pretty on top of that, oh, yeah. Operator : Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. I wanted to touch base on sort of the connectivity piece of the business, looked like there were some particular strengths in your connection this quarter sequentially in particular and just kind of curious if the pacing and the growth is something that\u2019s sustainable, that you potentially got some momentum there or if there was anything in particular that drove it? Andy Power : Hey. Thanks, Jordan. I would say, all -- in total volume connectivity new signs was up. I think in terms of, call, lumpier concentrations, our Latin America portion of the portfolio was certainly a major contributor. In terms of the top markets for just overall the interconnection signs, in North America was some of the usual, New York Metro, Chicago, Atlanta. But also, I didn\u2019t notice we had some pretty strong connectivity growth in both our Northern Virginia campus, as well as our Franklin Park Chicago campus. So not necessarily a legacy highly connectivity dense location, but it\u2019s great to see that enterprise is landing there and growing their connectivity footprint. An answer to -- partly answer to Jon Atkins question we track our new logos on a year-over-year growth basis. We don\u2019t have this for all of our new logos, because we\u2019re kind of combining businesses over the last year, but I call the legacy digital subset that were here a year ago, there -- they grew their connectivity footprint north of 10% on a year-over-year basis, so the new logos are growing post-landing with us. So definitely pleased, and I mean, I think, it goes back to a lot of what Corey was saying about our reorientation across the Board in terms of bringing some critical puzzle pieces together in terms of our asset profile, our go-to-market strategy led by Corey, our PlatformDIGITAL bringing to the market and many other elements I think are tied together that\u2019s driving that success. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then maybe just honing in on Northern Virginia, you touched on it there in interconnect -- interconnectivity, but what\u2019s your availability looking like in that market and how -- what are you seeing in terms of customer demand there This year? Andy Power : Yeah. So, Northern Virginia, Jordan, obviously, you\u2019re aware we have pretty incredible 2020 close to 85 megawatts sold overall. We kind of ran pretty darn tight on inventory based on that success, which is not necessarily a bad thing, given that the Northern Virginia has been kind of working its way out of the woods for some time now. So we ended the year with our development pathway with 100% preleased. We are now under construction and delivering building are in terms of our new build that will come along this summer. We did close to 5 megawatts of leasing in total in that market, including the full product suite. I would say the lion\u2019s share of our focus is on the capacity we got back at the very beginning of the year. So which I mentioned we already released or pre-released on the last call. So really focusing on some of that non-retained capacity on our existing campus, but also we did landed anchor deal, a little chunkier enterprise deal and the building are coming on back -- on the back half of the year, then building on as a large shell that will call it deliver 6 megawatts suites in call it every other month type of fashion. So little tight right now, focused on where we\u2019re place -- pushing customers, but a longer, larger runaway we\u2019re building our company on the back end of the year. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. So, first, I am wondering if your posture or your approach to rental rates and renewals has changed at all in the last 12 months, given the tightening in some of the markets. Andy Power : I mean, I think, we have a pretty responsive pricing dynamic holistically, Mike. So it\u2019s not just on renewals. We have a call it inventory price book for every type of capacity, for every duration of contract, for every market, for every product that is update on a recurring basis in response to what we see in terms of the supply/demand dynamics in the market. We obviously don\u2019t have certain overlays in terms of customer relationships or in the larger growing customers or newer customers that we kind of make sure we\u2019re responsive to at the same time. We\u2019re certainly not sitting by idly when a market is weaker and we need to respond to that with pricing to be more competitive. And on the other flip side of that coin we\u2019ve had experienced like in Singapore or other markets like Santa Clara or Frankfurt, where we raised rates over time and those rates are impacted our renewals and our new pricing in response to, call it, the overall supply/demand dynamic. Michael Funk : And then one more if I could, Andy, so on the guidance, I saw the non-core expense add back increased for 2021. I didn\u2019t hear you call that out in the prepared remarks. What was the increase in the non-core? Andy Power : The increase in the non-core, I believe, we got a whole list of items in our FFO reconciliation that kind of hits the non-core that includes our investment in Megaport is good stock price mark-to-market when that flows through, and that obviously, is in the core up or down to our business. I believe there\u2019s a revaluation on our debt at SMP, given it\u2019s a resilient entity and with the U.S. dollar denominated debt to match the currency of the lot lion\u2019s share of our contracts. And we also have, I think, in this particular quarter, a little bit of a benefit from our PPA settlement that we added back, because we didn\u2019t do that as recurring benefits on core FFO. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you. And maybe I could go back to Corey, can you talk about where we are on sort of return to normal in terms of the sales process in some of the regions? Are you still able to get the virtual tours and get the connections or do you think there\u2019s still more room to come back to normal here? And then any commentary on the supply chain, I think you did talk a little bit in your disclosures about, generally not seeing huge issues, but in terms of building costs or building -- you\u2019re building up inventory there? Thanks. Corey Dyer : Andy, you want me to take the enterprise demand question and just date of use and you can just follow on the second half? Andy Power : Please go ahead. Corey Dyer : Okay. All right. So, yeah, thanks for the question. I would tell you that we\u2019re getting closer to the state of normal, if that\u2019s what you want to call it. Some of the things are opening up. But we\u2019ve got a lot of ability around doing tours virtually, we\u2019ve found a bunch of different ways to augment the need and take our customers during the pandemic. So I feel like we\u2019re getting close to it. We\u2019re not quite there. That said, enterprise demand has been really, really good. It\u2019s been strong, broad-based success, still on our platform, Andy mentioned it earlier, but early innings with long tail left. We\u2019re looking through some of the more macro trends. Gartner\u2019s got IT spending getting at 6% growth, with about $4.1 trillion annually and only about $400 billion of that go into public cloud. So we think that enterprise demand and the point of presence and the multi-use cases, as well as multi-markets that we\u2019re going after are going to be there and we\u2019re seeing it continue to sustain. Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s a complete back to normal. We haven\u2019t seen, I guess, in enterprise demand and quite frankly, we think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job adjusting through it with all the ops and FCs and SAs we have important to it [ph]. I think that answer the question, I\u2019m not sure if I did it. Simon Flannery : Yeah. That\u2019s great. Thank you. Corey Dyer : Okay, Simon. Okay. Andy Power : Hey. Simon, can you just repeat the second part of the question to make sure we\u2026 Simon Flannery : Yeah. It was really around the supply chain issues and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the COVID impacts on your ability to bring on data centers on time, on budget, and any cost issues you might be seeing or inventory issues? Andy Power : Okay. Great. So let me take the, call it, our digital supply chain, I will let Chris touch on the customer supply chain, because I know that\u2019s been a question out there as well. So, I think, really hats off and kudos to our operational design, construction team and supply chain team for always keeping ahead of this consistently. Obviously, we do all have the benefit of our scale, our global nature, our deep operational expertise. But we\u2019ve not in recent quarters had any, call it, disruption to critical equipment, delays, cost impact and so the team really -- has done a really incredible job of navigating through that. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case for all providers in the data center world, especially smaller stature, but they\u2019ve not been disruption today. And I\u2019d say we\u2019ve -- what we\u2019ve looked at our, call it, 300 megawatts of capacity under development is pretty darn insulated to these any potential inflation shocks and we\u2019re also keeping a keen eye on that. But, Chris, why don\u2019t you hit on the chip piece as well. Chris Sharp : No. Absolutely not. I echo your sentiment, Andy, the vendor management program that we have in place today, I think, is something that has allowed us to overcome some of the shortcomings of some of the infrastructure within the facilities like breakers, optical infrastructure, things like that. But that\u2019s something that operating on a global basis has been a big benefit digital going forward. But we also stay very close to our customers and really watching if they\u2019re having trouble procuring infrastructure to deploy their architectures into our facility. We haven\u2019t seen a material impact on that as well. I know there\u2019s been a lot of concern around chip shortages and things like that, but again, just to reiterate, not all chips are the same and there\u2019s a lot of variability out there and so have not seen any kind of material impact from customers being able to deploy into the facility. And quite frankly, some of our larger hyperscale customers, they build the entire stack themselves, so they have strict control over their supply chain and so they\u2019ve also not experienced any slowdown in being able to deploy the massive amount of infrastructure required for their deployments as well. Simon Flannery : Thanks. Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good evening. So when I look at the updated guidance, it seems like the only major change there really is the FX assumption around the pound. So is it fair to assume guidance is going up simply because of changes in FX assumptions or is there something also kind of operationally there\u2019s an improvement that that should also be signaled through the guidance increase? Andy Power : Hey. Thanks, Tayo. The -- I mean the sterling is especially today a much more smaller piece of our business, pro forma for some of our acquisitions over the last year. So while FX did contribute to our outperformance in the first quarter, and obviously, that flows through the guidance, I would not say that was the only thing that drove our increase in guidance. We did have a beat in terms of our internal forecast and was called in the same ballpark as where consensus was. We\u2019ve essentially raised a few elements, the revenue, the EBITDA, the G&A piece is really just the P&L geography you\u2019re mapping from Interxion integrations. And then we also kind of made sure that showed that that flowed through to the bottomline with, call it, an increase at the midpoint of the range, up, I think, $0.075, so 5% year-over-year growth and not all due to FX, it was due to some of the operational outperformance. Not all of our beat flowed through, because some of it was OPEX delayed from 1Q to 2Q, 3Q, 4Q rate of the year, but definitely pleased with the result and which, I would say, gave us the confidence to raise here in the first quarter, which is little, I don\u2019t think I can recall last time we did that in my now six years in Digital, but definitely pleased with the progress. Omotayo Okusanya : Is that way to separate the effect of those things, the rate some of the carriers do? Andy Power : Is -- I\u2019m sorry, is there a way to separate those things away from the -- Omotayo Okusanya : The impacts of the two things of actual operational improvement versus FX in the guidance range the way some of your peers do if you can actually tell what\u2019s guiding\u2026 Andy Power : I would\u2026 Omotayo Okusanya : \u2026 what? Andy Power : We used to have a constant currency disclosure at the bottom here. I\u2019m not sure -- I don\u2019t think we have that anymore. I mean I would ballpark the $0.075, maybe $0.03 from FX. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. First, maybe on bookings, can you talk about some of the strengths seen in Asia-Pac and what drove the uptick in bookings during the quarter? And then just on maybe a little bit more of a housekeeping item, margins in the quarter were pretty solid, I think they were the highest since you closed the Interxion deal, but we also saw tenant reimbursements pick up. And so I\u2019m just wondering what was behind the pickup in utilities reimbursements, was that tied to the winter storm in Texas? And then maybe what drove some of the offsetting cost benefits that helped drive EBITDA margins as high as they were? Thanks. Andy Power : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So maybe I\u2019ll try to take in reverse order and I\u2019m going to, I think, probably bring in Corey here when we circle back to APAC, but just to the housekeeping piece. A little bit of a funky quarter on the margin front. So I\u2019ve guided you to, call it, to our full-year guidance table on the EBITDA margin. We do have a footprint across Texas, Dallas being the largest piece of that. We were impacted by the winter storm. Again, our operational team did a really marvelous job keeping up and running and customers happy. I literally kind of personally got a cold call from a CTO of a global customer who also had their own asset or data center in the market and needed diesel fuel rerouted to them in order to stay running and our operations team sprung it in action with like an hour\u2019s notice and kind of really saved that CTO\u2019s day. But -- so on the power front, power did increase unusually given the storm. Luckily, one, our team did a nice job hedging in terms of our power cost. Two, while it inflates the expense, it also inflates the reimbursement, because we have a sizable portion of our Dallas or Texas footprint is metered power, so reimbursed. So net-net, especially on the size of company, not really a major negative, but certainly funky when you got that spike in power when you look at your EBITDA margins coming through. In terms of APAC, I mean, I\u2019ll turn it to Corey over here, but I mean just really standout quarter across the full customer product spectrum. We\u2019re now live with, I believe, five, almost six colo projects across our platform from Seoul to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and I\u2019m missing one. So we have great success selling into those markets. And then also on the hyperscale or larger footprint front, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one top CSP signed with us both in Osaka and Melbourne. We also had subsequent accord and anchor customers in Inzai in Tokyo. And then Singapore, maybe I\u2019ll let Corey kind of talk to some of the success we saw in Singapore. Corey Dyer : Yes, Andy. I would just add, you hit most of the data points I was thinking through in the response. Really broad-based success across the portfolio is what I would say. AP was really successful as well. You mentioned it in your prepared remarks, diversified e-commerce customers that\u2019s been doing a lot of business with us and we really are happy with that. But I would also tell you that our new logos coming out of that region has tripled in the last year. We\u2019re really happy with the team. It\u2019s where most of our organic growth as far as the sales team that we\u2019re putting out there in place. So we\u2019re really happy with it. But I wouldn\u2019t get focused just on AP. I think about the broad-based platform success we\u2019re having across all the regions. I think our largest export region this last quarter was EMEA. So we\u2019re really excited about just kind of broad-based successful we are, and we think there\u2019s a ton of opportunity in Asia Pacific, and, yes, in Singapore, we were pretty successful selling through that large building there that we have. Andy, was there any other data point I missed? I think we hit most of them. Andy Power : No. I think you got it. Thanks. Corey Dyer : Okay. Thanks. Matt Niknam : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Looking at your table, it looks like Europe seemed to have sort of taken a breather this quarter with leasing down and especially in the greater than 1 megawatt category. Has anything changed there, I mean, I know you talked about a pretty robust pipeline? But maybe some commentary around that, just to understand where the opportunities are and what drove this decline and if there\u2019s anything else you can comment on? Andy Power : Thanks, Erik. So, I mean, really, Europe or EMEA just really came off of a blowout the quarter prior. I still think I was pretty pressed with the results and thought a really healthy quarter. On the larger footprint side, we had four different CSPs sign across three different markets, Frankfurt, two in Zurich, one in Amsterdam. So definitely pleased with the diversity of demand and from a customer energy offer standpoint. On the enterprise customer standpoint, within the flap, Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, certainly stood out this quarter in terms of new signings. And within the non-flap, Marseille, Stockholm, and Madrid were some of our top EMEA markets. So -- I -- and as you can see on our development table, we\u2019ve been continuing to increase our footprint of development and building out larger parcels in EMEA on our highly connected campuses there. So I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m still pretty really positive about the growth in Europe. Erik Rasmussen : Great. And then maybe just on the releasing spreads, the greater than one megawatt. How does that 11.3% decline on a cash basis? How does that compare on a historical basis? I know this is all dependent on customers and mix and there\u2019s a few other things? But can you talk about that 11.3% in the context of what is -- what you\u2019ve seen in the past? Andy Power : Yeah. It\u2019s -- that\u2019s just a statistic when you slice it down to a quarterly basis and depending on what mix actually gets renewed in that quarter, because it\u2019s not just what actually expires, customers will renew quarters or even years earlier sometimes. In particular, there was two specific customers, one top-five CSP, another enterprise customer that did, call it, fairly chunky renewals in combination with new signings. The CSP was a multi-market renewal, multi-market growth. The enterprise was in one particular North American market. So we thought it was a very fair commercial compromise and love to see them continue to grow with us. I don\u2019t -- I mean, that bounces around and we\u2019ve had worse than that in a given quarter and we\u2019ve had much better than that in a given quarter, and I still -- as you saw we confirm that guidance on the mark-to-market. So we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a truly bad omen or anything like that. And as I mentioned, I think in response to John Atkins\u2019 question on the front part of the call, definitely feel like we\u2019re moving toward better and better territory and expirations based on the product mix and the geography. Operator : Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : Hi. Thank you. I want to go back to slide number 10 and also back to the 11.3% that we\u2019re looking at for the greater than one megawatt. Now, I guess, if we go back to about a year ago, you guys are working through a very large vintage of leases and we were kind of -- we were informed that they would be high single-digit or double-digit negative roll down there. But are we pretty much done with the majority of those leases or could we expect a bit more negative rates at least at this magnitude in other quarters in 2021? Andy Power : Yes. Sam, kind of consistent with my response to Erik\u2019s question, being able to predict with accuracy, the quarterly blend to that precision is pretty challenging, because it\u2019s really out of our control when the customer inks a renewal. But I think I would agree with your outset statement, we started out 2020 with an outlook of net -- call it mid-to-high single-digit negative cash mark-to-markets overall and as we worked our way through that year, we outperformed that expectation. It ended up negative, but it was very slightly modestly negative. And then we went to guidance. Our guidance, again, was really in that same territory where it ended up, so a better outlook than the prior year. If you look at the overall results here, negative 2%, a cash market across all the products, it\u2019s kind of right in line, even, overall, it\u2019s kind of right in line with the language we\u2019ve described here. So, again, I can\u2019t promise you every single quarter is going to be positive. But I do believe, based on our understanding of the expiration of the contracts and the supply/demand market dynamics that we\u2019re heading into better territory on those mark to markets. Sami Badri : Got it. The other thing is on the zero to 1 megawatt range for the 1.6%. In that zero to 1 megawatt and in those releasing spreads, could you give us an idea on customer mix in there in terms of how much of that is enterprise versus cloud versus other? Andy Power : Sure. In that zero to 1 megawatt, some of the chunkier deals were -- and those are kind of no particular order. In the New York Metro area, there was a fiber-oriented customer and also a content-oriented customer. In London, there was a top-five cloud service provider. In Singapore, there was a multinational financial services company. In Northern Virginia, there was an ad marketplace type business. Operator : Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Brendan Lynch on for Tim. Your slide deck indicates you\u2019ve announced commitments to reduce direct emissions by 68% and indirect emissions by 24% by 2030. Can you -- first I\u2019ve seen those numbers or any specific targets announced, can you provide some color on your execution strategy around that and what it means in practical terms for your operations? Bill Stein : Sure. This is Bill. We -- as you noted, we\u2019ve established carbon reduction targets in conjunction with the science based targets initiative. And in connection with that, we\u2019ve committed to reducing direct admissions by 68% by 2030 and committed to reducing indirect emissions by 24% by 2030. As you also are probably aware, we lead the data center category and the REIT industry and green bond issuance. We\u2019ve issued $5.6 billion of green bonds since 2015. We also lead the data center industry in green building certifications. We have 796 megawatts of green building certifications. And we also have 556 megawatts of renewable energy that\u2019s contracted, which, of course, contributes to the direct admissions reduction and that includes 154 megawatts in two renewable projects in Texas. For the second year in a row, we\u2019ve been voted the ENERGY STAR partner of the year and for the fourth consecutive year, we\u2019ve been voted NAREIT leader in the Light Award for the data center category and NAREITs only had that leader in the Light Award for data centers for four years. So we\u2019re batting 1,000 right now. Brendan Lynch : Yeah. That\u2019s great color, and clearly, you\u2019re making some progress there. How does that affect your negotiations to the extent that it does with customers and how are they responding to these initiatives? Bill Stein : The customers -- many of these customers share the same corporate values that we do with respect to ESG and we\u2019re all about reducing our carbon footprint. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re totally in sync with what our customers\u2019 long-term goals are in this area. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Looking at the rent schedule, it looks like about 35% of the rent comes from 1 megawatt and below business. And I\u2019m just curious, given all the comments that you shared on the call today in terms of the financial performance of these rents. Is it a strategic priority within digital to continue to lift this percentage of mix that comes from the 1 megawatt or below leases? Andy Power : Thanks, Mike. I mean, maybe Corey and I can tag team this for a second. I mean our strategy is to be the leading global provider dedicated full customer spectrum from the service providers, all of the hyperscalers to the enterprise customer. I think we\u2019ve certainly demonstrated a pretty solid and consistent track record on the first leg of that stool with your, call it, top five CSP having 20, 25, 30 different locations with us on average, depending on the specific name. And that value prop of our land and expand and future proof their runway for growth, that operational expertise to the highest demands. Certainly proud of that, and you\u2019ve seen the success in our results. But I think going after and supporting the enterprise is a place we\u2019ve been investing in just as much over the last several years on a multifaceted front. Certainly in terms of the critical pieces of the business we\u2019ve acquired, putting the puzzle pieces together of the rightmost connectivity rich destinations. But also on many of the things both Chris and Corey have been, call it, driving here for digital for some time. So I\u2019ll let them speak to that a little bit as well. Corey Dyer : Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Right on to that. You think through just the tools we were talking earlier about how we use data to target. So we\u2019re moving that forward as well down that path, if you\u2019re asking about kind of how we\u2019re going after the market if we\u2019re going after that part of the business. As far as the demand that we have going forward, I\u2019m sorry, if I missed some of the question, but I think that was a sales funnel question as opposed to just how we were targeting it. Did I get it all? I\u2019m hearing background noise, sorry, guys. And Michael, can you repeat the second part of the question, I just want to make sure I\u2019m getting it right. Michael Rollins : Yeah. So the question is just how much of a strategic priority is it for digital to increase the revenue contribution from the one megawatt and below business? Corey Dyer : Oh! I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve got it. Yeah. I am sorry\u2026 Michael Rollins : Just given the financial nature and performance of this type of business versus the larger scale business that you have. Corey Dyer : I guess I would tell you that we\u2019re going to try to increase both of them. We\u2019re not going to win every customer without discerning between them. But our plan is to continue to grow the enterprise and drive that. I think that will move that mix a little bit naturally, but it\u2019s not going to be at the expense of the CSPs. We\u2019re going to go continue to partner with CSPs, continue to partner with online customers, anybody that\u2019s in e-commerce, AI some of the high-performance computing. So we\u2019re going to continue to grow it everywhere as long as it adds to the value of PlatformDIGITAL and is helpful for us. So I just don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re only trying to raise one without the other. We\u2019re going to try to raise that enterprise business may be faster than others to help us with that mix, but we\u2019re going to win everything. Thanks. Michael Rollins : Thanks. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to now turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead. Bill Stein : Thank you, Matt. I\u2019d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we understand our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and we were honored to be named the EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year for the second year in a row. Two, we continue to enhance the value of our global platform, calling non-core assets and extending connectivity solutions. Three, we delivered very solid current period financial results, beating expectations and raising our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising attractively priced long-term debt, recycling capital and using proceeds to hire -- to retire high coupon debt and preferred equity. Our hearts go out to all those impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. And as we approach a post-pandemic environment here in the United States, I\u2019d like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world running. I hope all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up and we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today\u2019s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I\u2019d like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. We continue to enhance our product mix, with a record contribution from our sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection category. We extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our third Annual ESG Report. We raised revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. Last but not least, we further strengthen the balance sheet with the redemption of high coupon preferred stock and the issuance of low cost long-term fixed rate debt. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Stein : Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. We continue to advance along these lines during the second quarter. Our business continues to globalize, and once again, we generated solid performance and strong bookings across all regions. Our full spectrum product offering continues to blossom, with record sub-1-megawatt bookings in the second quarter and regional highs in both EMEA and APAC. Together with interconnection, the sub-1-megawatt category comprise nearly half of our total bookings, demonstrating customers enthusiastic adoption of PlatformDIGITAL to help accomplish their digital transformation initiatives. I\u2019ll discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on page three. In June, we were awarded the Green Lease Leader Gold Award from the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy for the third year. We remain the only data center provider to receive this award, which recognizes Digital Realty as a leader in the real estate industry that incorporates green leasing provisions to better align our interests with our customers and drive high performance and healthy buildings. During the second quarter, we published our third Annual ESG Report, detailing our 2020 sustainability initiatives, including the utilization of renewable energy for 100% of our energy needs across our entire portfolio in Europe, as well as our U.S. colocation portfolio, and reaching 50% of our global needs. We also reported progress towards our science-based target, ensuring a deep focus on our renewable energy, energy efficiency and supply chain sustainability initiatives. Our ESG Report highlights many of our ongoing initiatives including our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, along with our community involvement. Digital Realty is committed to being an active member of and giving back to the communities where we operate globally. We encourage and celebrate community involvement and employee engagement activities through our Do Better Together initiative. We also recently underscored our commitment to transparency and accountability on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey with the publication of our EEO-1 report. Events over the past year and a half have demonstrated that now more than ever ESG belongs at the forefront of our business. I\u2019m proud of our leadership in this area as we advance our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the communities we serve around the world. Let\u2019s turn to our investment activity on page four. We are continuing to invest in our global platform, with 39 projects underway around the world as of June 30th, totaling nearly 300 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is scheduled for delivery over the next 12 months. We\u2019re investing most heavily in EMEA, with 19 projects totaling over 150 megawatts of capacity under construction. Most of this capacity is highly connected, including projects in Frankfurt, Marc\u00e9, Paris, and Zurich. Demand remains strong across these metros and each continues to attract service providers, as well as enterprise customers from around the world, many of which contributed to a truly stand up performance by the region during the second quarter in the up to 1-megawatt category. In North America, over half of our capacity under construction is concentrated in two hot markets, Portland and Toronto that can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more traditional North American data center metros. We\u2019ve had tremendous recent success in these two metros. We have 30-megawatts under construction in Portland or more specifically Hillsborough that are now fully pre-leased. While our Toronto connected campus continues to gain momentum as the premier Canadian hub for global cloud service providers and enterprise customers. Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we are accelerating our organic growth in this underserved region. We opened our third data center in Singapore, a 50-megawatt facility that received permitting prior to the moratorium on new data center construction. Demand for this scarce capacity is robust and we have another 18 megawatts largely pre sold and scheduled to open this quarter. Also coming soon in this region, are a pair of MC Digital Realty data centers in Japan. With the world\u2019s eyes currently on Tokyo for the Olympics, we are opening a new Tokyo facility that\u2019s poised to win the gold medal. We\u2019re also opening another data center in Osaka this quarter, along with our first data center and the first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, Korea during the fourth quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity in Seoul and earlier this morning, we announced that we\u2019ve acquired another land parcel to expand our connected campus, enabling us to accommodate the hyperscale demand that has been clamoring for capacity and our first highly connected facility. Finally, earlier this month, we announced our intention to enter India in partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure, given the success of our existing partnership on the Ascenty platform in Latin America, the complementary skills and expertise that we both bring to this partnership, and with the significant growth opportunity available in India, we are excited to expand our footprint in this robust and dynamic market. Let\u2019s turn to the macro environment on page five. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique advantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. The first of these trends is the growing importance of data gravity for Global 2000 Enterprises. Last year, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool, which forecast the rolling intensity of enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure between key global markets. Earlier this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto enabling connected data communities to guide cross industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Earlier this week, we announced a collaboration with Zayo to further interconnection business through the creation of an open fabric of fabrics. With data sets exploding and data gravity challenges expanding, this initiative will enable multinational enterprises to connect these data oceans through fabric and orchestration. Third-party research continues to support data gravity\u2019s growing importance. Market intelligence firm Gartner recently conducted its sixth annual survey of Chief Data officers and less than 35% of these executives reported their business have achieved their data sharing objectives, including data exchange with external data sources that drive revenue generating business outcomes. Issues often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing meeting places, together with the need for appropriate security controls and the inability to overcome latency challenges with direct private interconnection between many counterparties. PlatformDIGITAL was designed to solve these problems. Digital transformation is compounding as enterprise data and connectivity problem. Recent research indicates that enterprise workflows utilize an average of 400 unique data sources by exchanging data with 27 external cloud products, Digital Realty\u2019s enterprise and service provider customers are turning to PlatformDIGITAL to overcome these issues by deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in and across multiple metros. Our leadership position is resonating with industry experts and influencers. For the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was named a global leader by IDC MarketScape for Data Center Colocation and Interconnection Services, further acknowledgement of our consistently improving customer capabilities. This recognition reflects our execution against the PlatformDIGITAL roadmap, providing unique differentiated value for customers with our fit-for-purpose, full spectrum, global capabilities. Earlier this month, Cloudscene again ranked Digital Realty as the strongest provider of Data Center Ecosystems in EMEA for the second consecutive year. Digital Realty was ranked second in both North America, as well as Latin America, and jumped up three spots to number seven in Asia. Also in July, Kagame [ph] published their analysis of edge infrastructure capabilities. Digital Realty ranked as an industry leader on multiple criteria across three broad categories. Our capabilities were ranked highest in vendor positioning and evaluation metrics comparison and second among the key criteria comparison. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to meeting customer\u2019s needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold and store. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s turn to our leasing activity on page seven. We signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise oriented deals of 1-megawatt or less reached an all time high of 41 million, demonstrating our consistent momentum and the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over eight years. We landed 109 new logos during the second quarter with a strong showings across all regions. Again, demonstrating the power of a global platform. The geographic and product mix of our new activity was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA each contributing approximately 20%, the Americas representing nearly 50% and interconnection responsible for a little over 10%. The megawatt or less plus interconnection category accounted for almost half our total bookings, with particular strength in the cloud, content and financial services verticals. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world. We landed a top five cloud service provider to anchor our new Tokyo campus. Close on the heels of this magnetic customer deployment, Japan\u2019s most popular social media application selected PlatformDIGITAL on the same campus. NAVER, the leading Korea based cloud provider serving the greater APAC region selected our new carrier-neutral facility in Singapore to support data intensive workloads for their high performance computing and I -- AI intensive technology based platform. A European broadcaster is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in Vienna and Frankfurt to rewire their network in favor of data intensive interconnection with benefits in performance, scalability and cost savings. A Global 2000 Enterprise Data Platform is adopting PlatformDIGITAL in Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt to orchestrate workloads across hundreds of ecosystem applications, delivering improved performance, security, cost savings and simplicity. In London, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting a top three global money center banks fortification of their business continuity capabilities, without compromising their data intensive interconnection requirements On the continent, our connectivity and operational capabilities are helping two independent FinTech customers, improve performance, enhanced -- and enhanced access to their connected data communities. Finally, in North America, a life sciences digital marketing firm chose PlatformDIGITAL to improve their network architecture enable future growth. Turning to our backlog on page nine. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced ticked down from $307 million to $303 million as commencement slightly eclipsed space and power leases signed during the quarter. The live between signings and commencement was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just over seven months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We signed $178 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was just under three years. Again, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1-megawatt. We retained 77% of expiring leases, while cash releasing spreads on renewals were slightly positive, also reflective of the greater mix of sub-1-megawatt renewals in the total. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down by 60 basis points, as we brought additional capacity online across six metros during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.5% in the second quarter, largely driven by the churn in Ashburn at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, the Western building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia, are not yet included in the same store pool. So these same capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. Let\u2019s turn to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11. The U.S. dollar fluctuated during the second quarter, but remained below the prior year average providing a bit of an FX tailwind. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to acts as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing, given our strategy and matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt and 100 basis point move in benchmark rates were roughly is 75-basis-point impact on full year FFO per share. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share was flat year-over-year, but down 8% from last quarter, driven by a $0.12 non-cash deferred tax charge related to the higher corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came into effect during the second quarter. Excluding the tax charge, which was not previously contemplated in our guidance, we outperformed our internal forecast due to a beat on a topline with a slight assist from FX tailwinds, as well as operating expense savings, partially due to lower property level spending in the COVID-19 environment. For the second time this year, we are raising our full year outlook for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the underlying momentum in our business. The deferred tax charge does run through a core FFO per share, but as you can see from the press release, we are lowering the midpoint by just $0.05, which all else equal would imply $0.07 raise excluding the deferred tax charge. Since it is non-cash, the deferred tax charge does not hit AFFO. Most of the drivers of our guidance table are unchanged. But I would like to point out that we are lowering our expected recurrent CapEx spend for the remainder of the year, setting the stage for accelerated growth in cash flow. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 12, we expect our bottomline result to improve sequentially over the balance of the year, as the deferred tax charge comes out of the quarterly run rate and the momentum in our underlying business continues to accelerate. We do still expect to see some normalization in our cost structure, with an increase in property level operating expenses that have been deferred due to COVID along with an uptick in G&A expense, as we return to the office and resume a more normal travel schedule, so your models should reflect these higher costs. Last but certainly not least, let\u2019s turn the balance sheet on page 13. As you may recall, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of non-core assets in Europe for $680 million late in the first quarter, which impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA to the tune of approximately $10 million. As a result, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated 6 times as the end of the second quarter, but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year, through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as signed leases commence. Fixed charge coverage ticked down slightly, also reflecting the near-term impact from asset sales, but remains well above our target and closer to all time high at 5.4 times, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long lived assets. In mid-May, we redeemed 200 million of preferred stock at 0.625%, which brought total preferred equity redemptions over the prior 12 months to $700 million and a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25 effectively lowering leverage by 0.3 terms. In mid-June, we issued 0.5 million shares under our ATM program raising approximately $77 million. In early July, we raised another $26 million with the sale of the balance of our Megaport stock. We also took our first trip to the Swiss bond market in early July, raising approximately $595 million in a dual tranche offering of Swiss green bonds with a weighted average maturity of a little over six and a half years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 0.37%. This successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of a global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six and a half years, and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. Over 70% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and serving as a natural FX hedge for our investment outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see on the left side of page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we\u2019d be pleased to take your question. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead. Jon Atkins : Thanks. I got one question and then a follow up. First on M&A, Interxion is now more than a year under your belt and then you announced kind of the JV expansion into India. I wondered if you could maybe symbolize your strategy for organic growth as it pertains to the potential purchases of existing platforms or assets. Sometimes there can be assets out there with dislocated valuation, so I thought it would be worth asking about that topic and getting a refresh? Thanks. Bill Stein : Sure. Jon, happy to provide a refresh. First of all, we don\u2019t comment on M&A speculation, particularly as it relates to specific opportunities in the marketplace. But to refresh everyone\u2019s memory, we try to do only strategic deals. And by that, I mean, we\u2019re looking for investments that enhance either our geographic footprint or our product offering, thinking about specific deals. When you look back on Interxion, I think, we were fortunate with there we were able to do both. We were able to enhance our geographic penetration and add significantly to the colocation mix in Europe. We -- as it relates to --and the CyrusOne situation, which I think is what you probably were alluding to. We think that\u2019s a good platform. We have all this respect in the world for both Bruce Duncan and Steve and Dave Ferdman. But its gives us more of what we already have. And so I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that would be of interest to us. Jon Atkins : And then on asset recycling that Andy mentioned towards the end, there was a press item from June about the potential formation of a Singapore REIT. And I wonder if you could give us an update as to what\u2019s happening and kind of the rationale? Andy Power : Thanks, Jon. So I think there\u2019s two concepts kind of interlinked in your question. So non-core capital recycling, we\u2019ve been doing a fair bit of that, most recently executed on portfolio in EMEA close to $700 million. That was not core or strategically digital. And it\u2019s kind of similar to a transaction we did back in, I think, 2019. So call it, folks in our portfolio, we see the most robust and diverse customer growth. So that\u2019s one leg of the stool that you can see will continue on, we activated this year, again, in terms of funding our business plan by recycling that capital into more strategic projects. We\u2019ve also done what\u2019s I will call it private capital partnerships. So similarly with that same transaction back in 2019 with Mapletree, we raised 80% stake and $1 billion of core assets, assets that we never really want to part with and we maintain operational control of as a minority partner. And so, I think, you\u2019ll see us continue to do both. But there\u2019s a big difference in our minds. Non-core things that we\u2019re willing to call it 100% and we wish the new owners well, and core really keeping those assets as part of our collective platform and just trying to recycle capital of the slower growth assets. Both of which I think at the end of the day, hopefully, accelerates our growth and allows us to redeploy that capital into higher return opportunities. Jon Atkins : Anything specifically about the price item from I think Bloomberg and data center knowledge about forming a REIT in Singapore? Bill Stein : I can say that kind of ties to both the questions. Coincidentally, Singapore REITs have been the buyers of our two biggest portfolio sales. They\u2019ve not been the only buyers. We\u2019ve also done other one-off assets sales to other private buyers that were non-core. As relates to any vehicle that we would do like that, we would only think about that in the core contacts, if we\u2019re going to extend our brand and sponsorship to it. So I think -- I can\u2019t comment on what that specific rumor was kind of pointing to, but it kind of is interwoven with both concepts a little bit. Operator : The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Good afternoon. So I wanted to follow up a little bit in terms of sort of investment opportunity. Bill, you\u2019ve talked about, strategic, accretive and I think enhancing growth -- growth enhancing for some of the strategic objectives or criteria for acquisitions. If you can check those boxes, it would seem that, an acquisition even something domestic could make sense. The piece that I am struggling with a little bit, it may be like the growth enhancing. Strategic make some sense that even though there\u2019s some overlap accretive, I get -- we can figure that out, growth enhancing, the piece I wanted to ask you about was, does market share help in terms of sort of the growth outlook. In other words, if you\u2019re controlling certain -- a greater extent of the marketplaces and certainly these large hyperscale Tier 1 markets in the U.S. You think that would mitigate some of the downside rent pressure we\u2019ve seen in that vertical? Bill Stein : Yeah. Jordan, I guess, when I think about -- so what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here and certainly in recent history, I mean, you saw the press release today, right, where we bought a piece of land in Seoul Korea and we already own a carrier-neutral data center in downtown Seoul, and now we\u2019re going to build a campus out in the suburbs. And what we\u2019re trying to do is replicated and so what we\u2019ve created in other markets in the world -- and around the world to the connected campus with a carrier-neutral dense network that you can tether the campus back into. And I think that when you look around the world today, they\u2019re just aren\u2019t that many platforms. I mean, there is not an Interxion in Asia. And I think that would you going to more likely see from us is what you\u2019re seeing in Seoul, we are in fact pursuing similar models in other parts of Asia and in other parts of the world where we\u2019re going into new markets and planting the flag with both network dense facilities and campuses. So just to repeat what our criteria is, yes, it has to be strategically important to us in terms of either geography or product additive to both, it needs to be, we\u2019d like it to be accretive to our near-term earnings idea and certainly accretive to growth, which is what Interxion was and Ascenty. And importantly prudently financed, so a capitalization\u2026 Jordan Sadler : Okay. Bill Stein : \u2026 that is consistent with how we finance the rest of the business here at Digital. And anything you want to add or? Andy Power : I got two\u2026 Bill Stein : All right. Andy Power : Yes. I got two out of three right. Bill Stein : You did. And we -- we\u2019re not the levered up in other words to make\u2026 Andy Power : It was very to higher [inaudible] rate... Jordan Sadler : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bill Stein : Yes. Jordan Sadler : Okay. I hope this wasn\u2019t the interview. Bill Stein : But to put a finer point on it, we\u2019re not going to lever up these assets to make the number works -- numbers work. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Andy, if you have anything else, I will follow up. Andy Power : I think the second or third part of your question was, can you drive pricing power to market share, which I think episodically there is opportunities to do that. I think if you look back to our DuPont Fabros transaction that was a market share moving transaction where we up-tiered our relationships with many customers to kind of to control near-term supply. And I think that concept maybe works in more overall supply-constrained markets predominantly outside the U.S. or even like a Santa Clara for that example. I do not -- I\u2019m not confident. I think your line of thinking would be other domestically-focused larger footprint players is that, does that M&A create better pricing power and today\u2019s backdrop, I don\u2019t see that same events playing out, but again life such in America. Jordan Sadler : That\u2019s helpful. And then coming back Bill to sort of been around the world. India, can you guys potentially de-size the India JV opportunity for us? Just sort of initial sizing, I mean, is this -- could we see a platform purchase like Ascenty, like you did with Brookfield then there or is this going to be a de novo opportunity? Bill Stein : I\u2019m going to hand that one over to Greg. Greg Wright : Okay. Thanks. Hey, Jordan. Look, I think, describe the India joint venture. Jordan, it\u2019s actually a hybrid. Look, as you know, we\u2019ve had a strong relationship with Brookfield. We\u2019ve had a great experience with the Ascenty, but when we purchase Ascenty, we bought -- we came into that platform together and purchase an existing platform that had 14 assets. Eight of which were under construction, six of which were operational assets and a team in place. This is going to be different from that. But we are, again, going in 50-50 joint partners, joint branding and alike, which you\u2019ve seen in some of our press materials. But here, we\u2019re going to be and we have some folks that are already residing in the JV, but we\u2019re actually going into India here to build a platform, and ultimately, we expect it to be like Ascenty. I mean being a standalone platform with a strong management team that drives the business. And I think when we look at India, we\u2019re not looking to go into India and just do like-for-like product. We\u2019re looking to do differentiated product and we think Brookfield as a partner here and given their presence in the tower space, and given what\u2019s happening in India in the mobile market and alike. We think we have a great opportunity to do that. And so, but the general governance and construct if you will is very similar to Ascenty, but the basic premise of going in. We\u2019re going into build a platform. We\u2019re not buying a platform. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s how I describe it. Operator : The next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Sami Badri : All right. Thank you. First question I just wanted to just run by you guys is, maybe you could give us a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on releasing spreads? Because in the greater than 1-megawatt releasing spread slide, which is slide 10, there was a meaningful improvement in spreads and I think we were going from down 11% to just down 1%. And I was hoping you just walk us through this. So that\u2019s part one of the question. Part two is, are essentially done with a lot of those high negative renewal spread, I mean, leases that we\u2019ve kind of been discussing on a last couple of quarters. Are you guys in the clear, is this -- are we going to see some lumpiness? Thank you. Bill Stein : Hey. Thanks, Sami. Let me tackle that. So, like-for-like megawatt -- north of a megawatt quarter-over-quarter certainly saw an improvement from down just close to 11% on the prior quarters, 30-ish megs, the 23.5 megs came -- renew this quarter, came through this quarter, basically flat, negative 90 bps. Overall also improvement basically at 0.1% positive and over 2% positive GAAP. So, definitely move in the right direction. At the same time, I wouldn\u2019t call it be standing on the aircraft carrier with a victory flag just yet. We\u2019re still working through some still certain contracts that are above market. Hence we maintained, I will call it, language around our full year guidance of slightly negative. I did -- since parsing through both categories, in the -- in that category literally 82% of the megawatts that renewed were positive. So close to 2% positive. So really was like one or two negative that drug down the category to be flat. And in the over-to-up to that is greater than [Audio Gap] percent positive cash mark-to-markets in terms of the megawatts renewed. So, I would call, it\u2019s still episodic, moving in a better direction and that\u2019s a thematic things that I don\u2019t think this one quarter was a massive inflection point. We did gradually getting to better territory this year versus last year. And also feel that same trend kind of continuing based on the mix we see in the future. Sami, can you remind me your second question though? Sami Badri : I think you kind of already hit it, but the second part of the question was just kind of, are you guys essentially going into the clear regarding a lot of the high negative renewal spreads leases that came with the DFT portfolio? You kind of answered it, but that was the second question? Bill Stein : I don\u2019t think, I won\u2019t kind of go through my victories piece here. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re fully out of the woods, but where the trend is moving in our direction and we benefit from an incredibly diverse platform and as you look at our expirations going into this year, rest of this year or 2022 and beyond. The mix just is improving, right? The bars have gotten shorter. The concentration in the greater than megawatt is become more international, places where we\u2019ve had greater pricing power. So, not fully in the clear, but I feel like we\u2019re inching our way into better territory every day. Sami Badri : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Andy, I\u2019ll just follow up on that renewal issue. It does seem like things are going better now. Is it possible that a few years out renewals could actually be a tailwind or are the escalator structured, so that it\u2019s generally neutral at best? Andy Power : Yes. I think there\u2019s definitely potential for fewer out cash mark-to-markets to be a positive tailwind here. I mean, we -- if you look at our -- the diversity of our product here we are -- it\u2019s a very sticky product. We\u2019re typically doing renewals in many markets better than new rates on new deals given the propensity inertia for our customer to stay. Our interconnection capabilities kind of further that stickiness, these markets where we\u2019re even bringing on new capacity are running up to physical barriers, whether supply of power, access to land, connectivity, government moratoriums are popping up in certain countries. And then the whole concept inflation and its impact to newer incumbents and overall cost structures. All those things point to a world of higher pricing power in this aspect and certainly more so for Digital relative to a new entrance. Brendan Lynch : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe a question for Chris as well. Chris, maybe you can give us just a little bit of insight on the fabric of fabrics platform and kind of simplify that for us if you can? Chris Sharp : No. Absolutely. Appreciate it. Yeah. So it\u2019s a continuation. We\u2019ve been investing in PlatformDIGITAL to make it more robust, where we have over 4,000 customers today. And as Andy alluded to earlier on Bill\u2019s comments earlier that we\u2019re adding 100 new customers every quarter. So, what we\u2019ve talked about with the fabric of fabrics and the partnership that we pulled together with Zayo is that these capabilities are proven to be very successful with our enterprise customers. And I think what we\u2019re talking about here today is about expanding those capabilities and those connectivity capabilities to a broader set of customers. And so I think that\u2019s one of the core things that we\u2019re really starting to drive and it\u2019s resonating well with our customers and that a lot of enterprises are out there looking for an open platform to really achieve their goals and remove complexity out of their deployments. And so that\u2019s what the PlatformDIGITAL is and what fabric of fabrics means as we pulled together a carrier-grade partner with Zayo and there the first partner that we\u2019ve executed this with and you will see other partners coming online to expand that value focused on our customers\u2019 success. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Funk of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Funk : Yeah. Thank you for the questions, and good evening, everyone. First was the basic just math question to check my facts. So, I think, in the first quarter you did core FFO of 167 a share. I think you guided same kind of down $0.10 sequentially due to a number of factors. But the $0.12 non-cash charge wasn\u2019t in that guide, right? So, if you strip that out, you actually were really only down about a penny quarter-over-quarter, right, for the core FFO. And if you think about rolling that forward the second half of the year saying you really had an $0.08 core FFO each, why wouldn\u2019t that core FFO per share a be excluding the $0.12. Why wouldn\u2019t that recur in 3Q and 4Q? What\u2019s going to change in those two quarters stripping out that one-time charge? Bill Stein : So, two data points. One, we are increasing the guidance, net of the $0.12, right? So the $0.12 is a non-cash deferred tax hit. Sensibly, we revaluing a liability that due to the U.K. changing its corporate tax rates by 600 basis points that $35 million or $0.12 flows through one-time and it\u2019s non-cash, does not hit AFFO, which you can see that I think the lowest payout ratio we\u2019ve had in five quarters now. So, by the fact that we\u2019ve increased the guidance notwithstanding that $0.12, it\u2019s essentially would have been a raise. And if you backed out the $0.12 to the midpoint of our new guidance you\u2019re close to, what would be 6% year-over-year growth on the core FFO. The reason it doesn\u2019t all the beat in this quarter to heart of your question like it doesn\u2019t all flow-through some of the beat which is OpEx timing, so timing relative to some of the OpEx spend which got pushed out from 2Q into back half of the year. Michael Funk : And that was related to some of the deferred OpEx in 2020, is that still what you\u2019re talking about? Bill Stein : Correct. Correct. I would call COVID-related\u2026 Michael Funk : Okay. Bill Stein : \u2026 catch up a little bit. Michael Funk : Got it. Understood. And then let me a little bit of commentary on the leasing environment. I know there was a lot of concern about leasing this quarter for the industry, but came in very strong, given the visibility you have into the back half of the year would have it might be. What are you seeing in terms of demand from hyperscalers and/or demand picking back up from enterprise customers? Bill Stein : I think, Corey, why don\u2019t you pick us up there? Corey Dyer : Yeah. Sure. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Mike, for the question. With regard to enterprise demand and then I\u2019ll let you handle the hyperscale I think was part of this question as well. But in our opening remarks, we mentioned that over $50 million of our business was from the sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection, which is really approaching about 50% of our bookings. That\u2019s really proxy or our -- for our enterprise business. On top of that our best channel quarter ever, we also saw an increase in multi-site, multi-region customers, which are all indicative of kind of the strength of the enterprise demand where we\u2019re going. So, I would tell you that for the second half we see strong sufficient demand across all the regions, as they take care of and addressed the needs for data gravity and hybrid IT architectures, all of which has been driven by enterprise customers across all the regions. We mentioned the strength in each of the regions both AP and EMEA, as well as North America. So we\u2019re seeing that kind of flow-through. And looking at our funnel, we see strength across all those regions multiple industries and verticals, financial services to cloud and others. So, pretty excited about where we are and confident in demand from the enterprise side and I feel like that\u2019s going to continue. I don\u2019t know if, Andy, want to talk to the hyperscale part of it. Andy Power : Yeah. I\u2019ll just add on real quick on the larger hyperscale customers, strong Americas quarter, which is really largely, we did have a top five CSP land with us in Sao Paulo, but the lion\u2019s share was Hillsboro in Toronto. So, some great wins from hyperscalers in that market. Top five hyperscale landed both in Paris and Frankfurt, grew with us in Paris and Frankfurt and then over in APAC as mentioned in prepared remarks at the leading Japanese social media platform landed with us in Tokyo in addition to a top five CSP. I think we\u2019ve now set as the anchor to Tokyo -- our Tokyo campus on the prior call. So, I think, dramatically two things are playing out here. One, the hard work in terms of creating this global platform for these hyperscalers across approaching 50 metropolitan areas on six continents and really trying to be their trusted partner of choice around the globe is certainly benefiting our leasing or signing activity. And I would also say, we\u2019re making some great inroads to whether you call it next here or next-gen hyperscalers. We made -- I think couple of quarters ago, we had a hyperscale win with a Singaporean-based technology company. I mentioned the Japanese social media company. We mentioned Korean company NAVER. So, definitely penetrating a broader cast of customers than just top five CSPs that we have done. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. First, if you look at the bookings trajectory and just some of the commentary we just heard, as well as just the backlog position. Should 2022 to be a better year for organic revenue growth and core FFO per share growth relative to 2021. And then, secondly, on a separate topic, just curious as you have a range of assets in your portfolio, some very young, some older, what are you seeing in terms of the maintenance capital and the pricing on facilities that are a bit more tenured relative to maybe similar facilities that are a bit newer in vintage? Thanks. Bill Stein : Sure. Michael, why don\u2019t I try to tackle those in reverse order? So in terms of maintenance capital, obviously, the older facility, the more you propose end of life on various components. But that\u2019s no different than any piece of infrastructure or real estate. So, we\u2019re placing the roof, placing a chiller, you kind of get to these 20-year, 30-year end of life and one by one. Now, the good thing is, we\u2019ve built this portfolio over many years and essentially keep adding newer product to the mix at the same time. So, we\u2019ve been able to keep our -- recurring CapEx at a pretty modest hit to our AFFO. We actually dialed it back slightly just this for the year our guidance table. So, I wouldn\u2019t say any material upticks and we do a lot of maintenance throughout the year in terms of fixed repair, preventative and to ensure that there is no looming infrastructure headaches call on the horizon. From a pricing standpoint, obviously, there is a smaller nuance, whether it\u2019s PV efficiencies or power densities, which we certainly are innovating and bring to bear a new technologies in terms of legacy facilities. But net-net, the biggest drivers supply and demand in the market, a data center that becomes available for us in Santa Clara or Singapore or Frankfurt or markets that are compelling demand outpacing supply, customers are creating the availability and not looking for the birth date. So, I think that\u2019s more of a driver of the pricing activity. From your first question, I mean, on call it, 2022, I mean, we\u2019re only called halftime here, so not ready to rollout season two or wherever. But I would say, a couple of things that set us up for accelerated growth overall. One, I just talk a little bit to the cash mark-to-market position and it\u2019s been improving this year relative last year and see horizon where it could continue to prove. Two, this year, we took significant -- relative to our certainly -- actually we took back significant amount of capacity that we\u2019re chopping wood on releasing. So that we\u2019re having downtime from that baking capacity in our numbers this year, you can see that our occupancy as well. And you\u2019re going to see that kind of come online as we refill that and have a greater contribution to revenue in 2022 than it does in 2021. So, I think those elements and the fact that I think we\u2019ve now put up I should count this, but I think it\u2019s close to eight pretty darn good quarter of consecutive leasing, right? You obviously have to adjust to our pre-Interaction days relative to our denominator, but the leasing has been pretty darn consistent for some quarters now. So, I think, all those things paint the picture, as well as a pretty attractive development pipeline, which will obviously create as contribution to 2022 to 2021. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Great to see the enterprise coming back this quarter. Do you think we\u2019re pretty much back to normal now in terms of your operations? I know there\u2019s been COVID and picking up again in certain regions. Any comments around supply chain inflationary impacts and how that might be affecting you? Bill Stein : Let me try to give up that question, because I think there is a couple of great points in here. Maybe, Corey, you want to pick up on enterprise demand? I was really pleased on that front of -- north of $90 million in EMEA, zero to 1 megawatt close 30% of our bookings, before I could speak to that and then maybe Chris and I can handle inflation impacts on our customers and our supply chain. Simon Flannery : Thanks. Corey Dyer : Yeah. Thanks. I mean I went through it a little bit with some of the kind of I\u2019ll say proxy items for enterprise success and the fact that we\u2019ve got a strong pipeline. And I call it a strong well-qualified pipeline with quality as well. So really feel good about where the enterprise is and the follow-on. All of the acceleration in the hybrid IT and the move to, I\u2019ll call it, work-from-home, I think, it\u2019s just accelerated the enterprise demand and how we\u2019re set up with our channel initiatives and what we\u2019re doing there are just going to help us continue to build on that. So, rather than repeat what I -- I think I answered with Mike earlier, I would just tell you that the enterprise demand is strong and I think we\u2019re in a good place going forward. It\u2019s been accelerated a little bit by the pandemic in the last couple of years. But in a good place going forward. Bill Stein : Yeah. No. Thanks, Corey, and I appreciate the question, Simon. I think from a supply chain and what we\u2019ve seen in the industry, we haven\u2019t seen any material impacts or delays at this point in time. We work extensively with our customers to understand their needs and the requirements for the infrastructure in their deployments and so we align their orders to manufacturing dates. There has been some delays, but most of the time we can signal that right in the beginning of the sales cycle to ensure that they can order them and not miss any kind of delivery dates from that perspective. But again it\u2019s something we constantly watch with the different types of manufacturers out there. And I think, Andy, referenced this earlier, our VMI program with the infrastructure that we leverage and delivering our own services. We\u2019re way ahead of that and I think we\u2019ve really differentiate ourselves with the weight in the market that we can execute I think beyond most of the other companies out there. So, it\u2019s something that we watch closely, but no material impacts to-date. Operator : The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Q2 leasing was somewhat steady in the quarter. I know you called out U.S. and hyperscale came back, and then I think the strength on the less than 1-megawatt category. But were there any limitations with overall capacity in certain markets or is there anything else to sort of call out that could have put a damper on or kept a lid on sort of your leasing in the quarter? Bill Stein : I mean, in any given mark -- quarter, there is always certain markets that I call it tighter on the inventory standpoint. I mean we spoke about that how we went into that Ashburn, luckily, it was a good time for us to run into that in Ashburn because the market has softened. What comes to mind right now, Erik, are a few markets that are certainly a little bit on the tighter side. We have -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a much activity in Santa Clara for several quarters now, because that market has been so tight and we are waiting for a new capacity to come online. In Atlanta where we\u2019re really solely focused on colo connectivity of 56 Marietta, which is both highly connected data center in Southeast is 100% full. We\u2019re waiting for an annex building essentially to bring on the call it several megawatts of colo capacity. Outside the states, Frankfurt, has been a bit of a Tetris game in terms of fitting the customers in, in certain markets. And then Singapore, that\u2019s a market where I don\u2019t think we\u2019re fully sold out, but it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve raised our rates, given the supply/demand -- tremendous supply/demand imbalance. We do look at -- any turn will have in that market, where we look to reprioritize for enterprise colocation and connectivity. Those are the ones the main we want to come top of mind. But I mean, across 47 metros and developing a new capacity, at least half of them. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one or two else that will be similar. Erik Rasmussen : Great. And then maybe just staying with the leasing, Europe seemed to -- there was some lower leasing on the greater than 1-megawatt category. Has there been any change in sort of the hyperscale side that would suggest that things may be slowing or that we could be getting a little bit of an air pocket there or, I wouldn\u2019t say, air pocket, but just a slowing or is it more of just sort of timing in that market and just the lumpiness nature of overall hyperscale? Bill Stein : I don\u2019t see anything close to an air pocket in Europe. So, as a reminder, Europe had a pretty phenomenal 4Q and a pretty strong 1Q. So you are coming off two quarters of pretty good leasing and what we\u2019re seeing in the back half of the year. I think that trends going in the north of megawatt territory is going to continue its broad phrase. It\u2019s certainly flat oriented where we\u2019ve talked about Paris and Frankfurt is to extend our markets, but we\u2019re also seeing some great demand outside the flat markets and we now have a European platform that\u2019s across 10, maybe 12 European countries. So we\u2019re servicing the hyperscalers and some larger enterprise requirements in many of them. But I think -- the thing -- what -- I hate, Europe didn\u2019t have a great, what -- north of megawatt quarter because had a really fantastic less than megawatt quarter over $19 million and had numerous markets through major contribution in that less than megawatt interconnection category. So net-net, still really pleased with Europe Operator : The last question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you very much. On Singapore, what goes up comes down. It\u2019s been a really nice boost this year with kind of their, where they restricted the supply. But at some point, is that -- at some point, it probably resolves itself, what kind of terms are you getting there with the higher prices, signing leases, are customer just taking shorter duration terms given the price hikes. And are we looking at a -- some of this pulling back a little bit in 12 months or 24 months or do you think this is going to be a longer term situation there? Bill Stein : Yeah. One, I would say, the customers are not seeking shorter contract durations, because we price those at higher rates. And you saw the activity, the Singapore rates are clearly shown through our APAC rates, which you can see our up again quarter-over-quarter. I don\u2019t -- Singapore is one part of the world that I have a high degree of confidence. What goes up may not come back down. I mean, one, it\u2019s an island state. It is incredibly government-controlled. Everyone\u2019s operating under long-term ground leases with the government and they take a very thoughtful and measured approach to supply chain overall, who gets land, who gets to bring data center capacity online and they\u2019re really trying to curate it, so they have the right providers and do so in a more environmentally friendly way. That\u2019s the genesis of this, right? So that\u2019s a market I do not see, in addition to the fact it\u2019s an island. So, you quick -- more quickly rather the natural resources in Singapore. Frank Louthan : Great. All right. Thank you very much. Bill Stein : Thanks, Frank. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. Bill Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I\u2019d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter. As outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we continue to enhance our product mix, with record bookings within our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection category demonstrating the progress we\u2019ve made in offering the full product spectrum to our customers globally. We are also committed to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders and we provided additional transparency with the publication of our third Annual ESG Report. We\u2019ve also raised full year revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow. Last, but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, redeeming high coupon preferred equity and raising very attractively priced long-term fixed rate financing to support customer growth around the world. I\u2019d like to wrap up today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. I hope all of you stay healthy and safe, and enjoy the rest of your summer. We hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. John, please go ahead. John Stewart : Thank you, operator. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our third quarter results. We further strengthened connections with customers, landing record new logos and delivering our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 million of bookings. We also continued to deliver for our customers around the world despite volatility in the global supply chain, leveraging our scale, diversification and strategic procurement processes to continue to deliver on time and on budget for our customers. We continue to enhance our global platform by expanding into new markets with tremendous growth potential while continuing to expand capacity in existing markets around the world. We delivered solid financial results, with double-digit revenue growth leading to a beat in the current quarter and a raise to the outlook for the balance of the year. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by raising approximately $600 million of low-coupon Swiss green bonds and over $1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. A. William Stein : Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the third quarter. We continue to globalize our business with significant bookings and solid performance across regions. Our bookings were diversified by both region and product type, reflecting our unique full-spectrum global product offering. We also announced our entry into 2 high-potential emerging markets, India and Nigeria, during the third quarter while expanding our connectivity capabilities by working with Zayo to develop the largest open fabric-of-fabrics that will interconnect key centers of data exchange. We are also extending our capabilities for customers to the edge with the announcement of what will be one of a few strategic partnerships in this arena. Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the third quarter, Digital Realty was honored to be recognized by GRESB as an overall global sector leader in the technology and science category for exemplary ESG performance, receiving a coveted 5-star rating from this leading global ESG benchmarking organization and reflecting Digital Realty's commitment to being a global leader in ESG. We also became a UN Global Compact signatory in September, aligning our ESG goals and commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals with a global initiative. We also advanced our sustainable financing strategy, raising our first-ever Swiss green bonds and publishing the allocation of $440 million of proceeds from our September 2020 Euro green bond, which funded sustainable data center development projects in 4 countries across 3 continents certified in accordance with leading sustainable rating standards. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of these stakeholders. While on the topic of energy, I'm pleased to report that Digital Realty experienced only a small negative impact from the substantial rise in energy costs during the third quarter. In Europe, where concerns of an energy crisis were most acute, we typically contract for energy supplies a year or more in advance, providing price visibility and certainty for our customers. Elsewhere around the world, energy costs are typically passed through to customers, minimizing our direct exposure. We continue to keep a close eye on energy prices, but given the resiliency of our business model, we do not expect rising energy costs to impact our reported results by more than a few pennies. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. As previously announced, we entered into a joint venture with Brookfield to expand PlatformDIGITAL into India, a giant underserved market with the fifth largest GDP in the world. Like many emerging markets, India presents some unique challenges, underscoring the need for local knowledge and experience. To that end, we were pleased to announce the hiring of Seema Ambastha as CEO for the India joint venture. Seema has years of experience in the Indian IT sector broadly and in the data center industry specifically where she most recently served as a senior executive leader with the NTT Netmagic data center business across India. We believe the India data center market has the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade, and we're thrilled to have such a strong partner and strong leader in this exciting new venture. During the third quarter, we continued to expand iColo, our Kenyan data center operator, acquiring a land parcel in Mozambique to build a facility positioned to land subsea cables and other connectivity-focused customers. We also acquired a controlling interest in Medallion Communications, the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Nigeria in partnership with our existing African partner, Pembani Remgro. As the African Internet economy matures, we expect Nigeria will represent a significant growth opportunity, given its large and relatively young population, a growing and diversifying economy as well as a maturing regulatory environment. Given the connectivity of Africa from our existing hub in Marseille, our platform will now offer the market-leading destinations, connecting Africa to Europe and beyond. We're also investing to organically expand our capacity. As of September 30, we had 44 projects underway around the world, totaling almost 270 megawatts of incremental capacity with over 250 megawatts scheduled for delivery before the end of 2022. We continue to invest most heavily in EMEA, where we now have 27 projects underway in 15 different markets totaling 150 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is highly connected, including significant expansions in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris and Zurich. Our investment in organic development is a reflection of the strength of demand across EMEA. We're being a bit more selective in North America. We're seeing strong demand in Portland where we have a 30-megawatt facility under construction that is 100% pre-leased and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year, while we also have significant projects underway in Northern Virginia, New York and Toronto. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we continue to pursue strong organic development, both on our own and with our joint venture partners. We are adding capacity in Hong Kong that will open this quarter and expect to open Korea's first carrier-neutral facility in Seoul in early 2022. We are building a connected campus in Seoul to provide the full spectrum of solutions for our customers. The larger second facility will accommodate up to 64 megawatts of capacity and will be located within 25 kilometers of our first facility. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, and our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect developing trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. Just over a year ago, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. Earlier this year, we published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. According to IDC, the amount of digital data created over the next 5 years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage. This digital data creation is expected to drive exponential growth in enterprise user data aggregation, storage and exchange, providing a powerful tailwind for data center demand. We continue to see enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL to accommodate their own data creation growth. Recently, for the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was ranked as the only outperformer and global leader by GigaOm for edge colocation. This ranking reflects our continued innovation and the execution of our PlatformDIGITAL road map for delivering global differentiated capabilities and value for our customers and partners. We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. For the second straight quarter, we signed total bookings of $113 million, this time with a $12 million contribution from interconnection. Deal mix was consistent with the prior 4-quarter average, sub-1 megawatt deals plus interconnection represented about 40% of the total, while larger deals represented around 60%. Space and power bookings were also well diversified by region, with EMEA and APAC contributing 45% of our total, about the same as the Americas, with interconnection accounting for the remaining 10%. The weighted average lease term was a little over 5.5 years, and we landed a record 140 new logos during the third quarter, with strong showings across all regions, demonstrating the power of our global platform. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a leading cloud-native cybersecurity platform is expanding its high-performance computing capabilities by leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in 4 markets across North America and Europe, connecting with cloud providers, improving performance and driving down cost. A market-leading autonomous driving technology developer partnered with Digital Realty to tailor an innovative and unique infrastructure solution for simulation workloads. Two major North American energy firms chose Digital Realty to leverage our geographic reach and re-architect their network to interconnect with cloud providers and implement security controls as part of their hybrid IT strategy. A public university in the eastern U.S. is launching a global research initiative with other universities in EMEA and deploying PlatformDIGITAL network hubs across 2 continents and 3 cities to help enable this project. A maker of high-performance computing systems is expanding their footprint by deploying on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions to guarantee GDPR compliance while enhancing their security, performance and sustainability. And finally, a Global 500 fintech provider is expanding their own hybrid IT availability zones into multiple new metros, using PlatformDIGITAL to support their data-intensive and high-performance computing requirements. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $303 million to $330 million, and third quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was down slightly from last quarter at just over 7 months. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $223 million of renewal leases during the third quarter, our largest-ever renewal quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the quarter was a little over 3.5 years. Renewal rates for sub-1 megawatt deals remain consistently positive. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were skewed by our largest deal of the quarter that combined a sizable 30-megawatt renewal with our largest new deal for the quarter, which will land entirely in existing currently vacant or soon-to-be-vacant capacity across Chicago and Ashburn. Excluding this 1 transaction, our cash mark-to-market would have been a positive 1%. This multifaceted transaction was a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals. In terms of first quarter operating performance, reported portfolio occupancy ticked down by 50 basis points, largely driven by the sale of fully-leased assets during the quarter. Upon commencement of the large combination renewal expansion lease I mentioned a moment ago, portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 70 basis points. Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 5.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a spike in property taxes in Chicago, where local assessors have adopted a very aggressive posture along with the impact of the Ashburn churn event in January. Of the 70 megawatts we've got back on January 1, approximately 80% has since been released to multiple large and growing customers. As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool, so these same-capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. And while we're still in the early stages of our budgeting process, we are optimistic in terms of where our same-store NOI growth goes for 2022. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the third quarter, providing a small FX headwind in the third quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Our Swiss green bond offering during the quarter is a good example of this. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have approximately a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, third quarter core FFO per share was up 7% on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by strong operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs from the debt refinancings and redemptions of preferred stock over the past year. To avoid any confusion, our core FFO outperformance excludes the benefit of a nearly $20 million promote fee received in connection with the monetization of our joint venture with Prudential. Heading into the final quarter of the year, we have solid momentum so we are raising our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share to reflect this underlying momentum in our business. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. We continue to recycle capital by disposing of assets that have limited growth prospects, raising over $100 million in the third quarter for our 20% position in the Prudential JV and some land in Arizona. We also raised approximately $95 million of common equity under our ATM program in July, as well as $950 million of common equity in a September forward equity offering. Our reported leverage ratio remains at 6x, but including committed proceeds from the September forward equity offering, the leverage ratio drops to 5.6x, while our fixed charge coverage improves to 6x. We continued to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. Our 2 capital markets transactions this quarter are examples of our prudent approach to balance sheet management. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%. 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Jonathan Atkin : I think I'll ask both of mine upfront. I wondered, first of all, if you could talk about the factors that are affecting your CapEx to develop incremental capacity. John Stewart, I guess, in the prepared remarks talked about on time and on budget. But going forward, given what's happening with materials costs, I wondered whether you see an opportunity to adjust your pricing on new leases accordingly. And then the second question is just earlier this month, you acknowledged that you're exploring the potential creation of a Singapore REIT, and I wonder if you can just provide an update on that around the timing and scale and rationale on that project. A. William Stein : Thanks, Jon. I'll take your first question and I'll hand it over to Andy to adjust the -- to answer the Singapore REIT. First of all, I think you're right about inflation in terms of the opportunity that it presents. I think there's no doubt that it disproportionately, adversely affects our smaller competitors and widens our competitive moat. Over time, I would expect that rental rate increases will disproportionately accrue to the larger incumbent providers. There are basically 2 pieces to the inflation issue : the first is development, the second is operations. On the development side, we are -- our pipeline is on time and it's on budget, and they're kudos to Erich Sanchack, who leads our operations and procurement team for the vendor management programs that he's put in place, providing us fixed pricing for several years out, for diversifying our vendor mix and for allowing our -- for locking in our general contractors. We have a lot of construction sites around the world, and we're able to move our GCs around and keep them fully occupied. And I think our global scale as well as our maturity as a builder gives us a substantial competitive advantage here. But again, I don't think there's any doubt that market rents will eventually need to move up to maintain risk-adjusted returns. And I think that, that's both because of the increase in construction costs that show up in the denominator. But I think for our private competitors who are operating with more leverage, I think you're going to see that show up in the higher interest rates. So to -- I think they're going to have to raise their costs for that reason as well. And I think the readthrough here is actually really positive for our renewals because as our rates on new product increase, our rates will also, I expect, increase for renewals. So the bottom line there is that modest inflation, we think, is quite healthy for the business. And in terms of our customers, this shouldn't come as a surprise to them because to the extent that they're doing it themselves, they're seeing this development in their own supply chains. Relative to the operations of the P&L, I think as you probably know, our leases provide for significant pass-throughs. So for example, over 90% of our utility costs this last quarter were passed through to customers. We also have rent bumps generally between 2% and 3%. And then we have, I think, the highest operating -- or the best operating leverage of highest margins in the business. So what that means is that labor or labor costs, which I think is what's most susceptible to inflationary pressure, is a relatively low percentage of the revenue component in the income statement. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Andy to talk about the Singapore REIT. Andrew Power : Thanks, Bill. So Jon, you picked up obviously in the 8-K we put out there a few weeks ago. We are kind of heading down the path of exploring essentially an IPO of a portfolio on the Singapore market. This is not our APAC business, which has significant amounts of capacity under construction and land and the like. This is essentially being more analogous to almost like a private capital partner to Digital Realty for stabilized, fully well-leased, high-quality core long-term hold data centers to Digital and our strategy. Somewhat analogous to one of our joint ventures that we've done in the past couple of years with that one of which was with a Singapore REIT. We're still working through this. It's a long IPO process. There's no certainty on the outcome or completion. Sizing would be obviously a modest IPO size to begin with. But we do think this option has the merits of being an attractive long-term partner vehicle to Digital Realty. Operator : The next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : So first, I wanted to follow up, Bill, on sort of the price increase opportunity. I'm interested specifically in the greater 1 megawatt rents achieved in the Americas this quarter. They seem quite the opposite. I wonder at $80 per kW, it seemed like a low point relative to recent prints. I'm wondering what portion of that is a function of geography mix, et cetera. And then any color you could provide around the ability to push rate there. A. William Stein : Jordan, it's definitely a function of geographic mix. It's also a function of an extension that we were doing with existing customers that we were providing some rentable concession as well. Andy, you want to add anything to that? Andrew Power : Yes. Just maybe just a little more color. I mean the overall sign was a strong quarter, well north of $100 million. In North America, as you pointed out, it was in our prepared remarks, we had a sizable signing where we essentially came to the table with a holistic relationship-oriented solution for our customer, combining a renewal that impacted our mark-to-markets as well as the new signing. On the renewal, if you pulled that out of our mark-to-markets, we're positive 1%, but it was a 30-megawatt signing so it was a large kind of contributor to that. And on the new signing, I think it was into 4 or so different data halls. It was spread across both Ashburn and Chicago. It was 100% into existing vacant or to-be-vacated capacity, so a direct flow through to the bottom line, not, call it, future re-leasing. And so we think it was an attractive combination of helping a customer grow with us on our campus. And this is a customer we see future growth in years to come. So happy to support them. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then coming back to the supply chain, I have a little bit of a two-parter, which is one, how much urgency are you seeing from your larger customers that are looking to procure available inventory and just have line of sight to future product and infrastructure? And then second, how far forward have you pre-bought critical construction materials like generators, PDUs, crack units, UPSs? Andrew Power : So maybe I'll -- Jordan, this is Andy again. I'll try to take them in backwards order. So we have, call it, approaching 300, 270-something of megawatts, shovels in ground all the way to opening doors as we speak. And we are insulated in terms of our cost and procurement, whether it's through our VMI programs or through just supplier contracts and other things we do have been focused on building new capacity for so many years consistently. Beyond that, we are not fully insulated but those VMIs I just mentioned do extend. They're primarily focused in North America. They extend until 2023 so we do have a fair bit of insulation. We're not whistling by the graveyard on this topic. Obviously, inflation is here and will impact anyone that's called in the development arena. But we do believe given our size, scale as the largest developer and track record, that we're going to fare better than our competitor set and especially any newer incumbents to development. In terms of urgency, I think our customers are always urgent despite making massive financial decisions. Maybe I'll have Corey jump in a little bit to give you a little bit of flavor on the customer plans. Corey Dyer : Yes, sure. I can do that, Jordan. On the questions around this with via demand from the shortages in chips, we haven't seen it negatively affect any of our pipeline across the regions. We've actually seen it grow. And then also, we've got some sophisticated customers that thought forward about what was going to happen with the chip shortages and planned accordingly and therefore, have accelerated some of our opportunities across the globe. So at a net perspective, we kind of see it as a positive and people are thinking through it. Our customers are thinking through it. And on our end, it has really helped us kind of grow our pipeline at this point. Operator : The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. David Barden : I'll ask my 2 upfront, too, if I could. I guess the first one would be, Bill, investors have been waiting a long time to kind of see how the big data center companies evolve their edge strategies. You've obviously struck a partnership a week or 2 ago and it sounds like you're planning on doing some more. Wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit now on what you're looking for and how you settled on this path that you've chosen with Atlas to begin with. And then maybe, Andy, just I want to kind of go back to the power thing. 90% pass-through, that leaves about $20 million on the income statement. A few pennies, still about $15 million of exposure. Is that kind of what you're budgeting to potentially happen in 2022? A. William Stein : Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Chris to handle the edge questions since he spends a fair bit of his days on that particular initiative. Chris Sharp : No, I appreciate it, Bill, and thanks for the question, David. Yes, we've definitely been watching the edge for some time now. We do see -- it's still in its early stages of being a material opportunity. But one of the things that we've done is partner with AtlasEdge that we think they can provide a significant value in extending our platform deeper into the metro. And so that's something that we're looking at learning and understanding how to gain more intelligence in their new types of infrastructure they're bringing to market. And quite frankly, it expands and enhances our core to edge strategy so that our partners and our customers can get the benefit of extending their existing infrastructure out to the edge when it matures over time. I would also say that a critical piece that I think you picked up on, David, which is great, is that we at Digital, we're open, right? This is one of many partners and relationships that we're going to continue to prosecute because we see that there's many types of avenues out into accessing this edge infrastructure. But you're going to see a lot of partnerships over the course of the next couple of quarters where we'll further invest and refine exactly how we're going to prosecute that edge opportunity. A. William Stein : Andy? Andrew Power : And then David, on the second question, so just to review a few facts. So 90%, if you look at our just P&L, 90% of the power is reimbursed overall. We do pursue a hedging strategy primarily on our deregulated markets where you see potential greater volatility. We're about 85% hedged with contract durations ranging from 1 to 3 years. We also, as you know, are incredibly focused on sustainability. Green power procurement is a massive part of that playbook, and we pride ourselves in what we've done in that efforts to further green our portfolio, including power purchase agreements. Some of those have a potentially offsetting impact if in the event that power prices are to surge that provides an incremental hedge to power costs. So where we see it in the event that this elevated power scenario plays out for the duration of 2022, we'd look at it as just a couple of cents, which call it, every $0.01 is just almost $3 million. So not -- I wouldn't say a material headwind at this time. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Andy, I just want to clarify, you made a comment that you're optimistic on 2022 same-store NOI growth. Does that mean you can -- you think it's going to be positive or better than this year? Any clarity you have there? And then just more broadly, Bill, and to maybe just talk about leasing has been consistently strong this year. How does the pipeline look? And how does the competitive environment look going forward? A. William Stein : Thanks, Simon. So listen, we are in the middle of budget season, and I got my head of FP&A to my right and he'll step on my foot really painfully if I get out of my skis here. But that being said, listen, we got a same-store pool that's going to materially grow. And I think it's in a positive direction with the addition of Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, our business in Athens. We've acquired higher pricing power components added to the mix. We're also making great progress on re-leasing the capacity that was vacated at the beginning of this year, a huge portion of signings as -- that I mentioned we did this quarter has been falling into vacant or vacated capacity, so a quick resumption of cash flow from that space that sat idle for a portion of 2021. So net-net, I think there's a few things that kind of point to this kind of more positive trajectory in the same-store pool. Hence, my comment about optimistic of where we're going for 2022. Unknown Executive : And then Q4 is best situated to address the pipeline. Andrew Power : Yes. And then also from a pipeline perspective, Simon, I would just tell you that PlatformDIGITAL and just our thought leadership around data gravity is really taking hold, right? Our enterprise pipeline's growing across all regions, so really happy with that. Gartner was forecasting solid growth in enterprise IT spend. It just feels like we're in kind of the early innings of the IT transformation for the enterprises. As mentioned in the opening remarks, this quarter represented a new high for us, new logos at 140 new logos, so think about that as a proxy for enterprises continuing to decide to buy and partner with us. So we feel good about the demand signals in our pipeline going forward. Hopefully, that answers your question, Simon. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : Both of these are maybe piggybacking a little bit on the back of Simon's questions, but first, on the competitive landscape. I'm just wondering, you mentioned upfront being a little bit more selective as it relates to investments in the U.S. Just wondering if you can update us the competitive landscape you're seeing from both public and private peers, whether that's changed much at all in the last 3 months. And then secondly, as we think about core FFO or maybe even AFFO per share growth next year, I don't want to jump the gun, I know we may get an outlook in 3 months' time. But Andy, if there's any updates in terms of how you're thinking about that bottom line growth into '22, that would be great. Andrew Power : Sure. So Matt, maybe I'll do it in reverse order here for just in order of efficiency here, make sure everyone gets the question. So core FFO, we're not -- we didn't pull forward our 2022 guidance dramatically. But I think we're definitely pleased with how we're putting up results this year that has got, call it, double digits top line, kind of 7% year-over-year performance at the bottom line. We've now raised our guidance, so we're just over the 5%, call it, year-over-year for 2021. And you heard from Corey and Bill and the others we're confident in the pipeline. So we think -- we're looking to kind of grow the bottom line higher next year than this year. So that's a continuation of things I've been saying for pretty much every quarter of '21. But sorry, no sneak preview on '22 guidance just yet. On competitive landscape, I think that refers to leasing competitive landscape, and has there been any changes on the backs of M&A or whatever in our space? I mean, Corey should chime in here, but by and large, I don't think I've seen any dramatic change. I think the trend has been our friend, for now, several quarters of more and more customers attracted to a global platform across 25 countries, 50 metropolitan areas, spanning the full customer spectrum, supporting those -- most of those 4,000 customers in the retail-oriented environments all the way up to the dedicated data halls for hyperscalers who we have in, call it, north of 45 different locations. And I've not seen any dramatic change in that. And I think you can see that now on several quarters of consistent, call it, results. But Corey, I don't know if you have any different observations. Corey Dyer : No, I would just add to it that yes, we've had consistent results for a long time. To your point on our scale, we see all the competition out there. Our win rates and our cap rates are improving. So yes, I would just pile on to what you said and the success we're having and what we're seeing in the pipeline, the demand. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : Two questions, if I could. First, just a little bit more on the edge strategy. Just curious how you're contemplating the edge in the North America market. And is that something that you're looking to create some further progression on in the near term or is that more of a longer-term ambition? And then just going back on some of the portfolio and pricing commentary. Just curious, when you have these large multi-megawatt deals where you're discounting to get new business or you have some repricing risk, is it because some of the needs of the customers are changing? Is it just market rents? Like what are some of the factors that are driving that? And how should investors think about just what might be left in the portfolio to get through on that basis? Andrew Power : Thanks, Mike. Maybe I'll take the second question and hand off to Chris to talk about what's next on edge. So I mean, listen, we're always in active relationship-oriented dialogues with our customers but especially our largest customers who we're supporting in so many different markets and really the full suite of products from network-oriented deployments, hybrid IT, all the way out to their true massive cloud compute. And we just want to -- we try to come to the table with holistic solutions. If they have a renewal that's coming in the coming years, we just make sure that's part of the conversation, right? And it often leads to situations like which recently transpired in the last quarter where they may not take some of the new business out to a full search of the market or say, \"You know what, I've already deployed on your campus and then growing these adjacent data halls is the right move.\" So it's really a holistic relationship-oriented approach. As it relates to, I think, the heart of your question, yes, we don't like having any mark-to-market go down at all, so a negative 5% quarter is not great. But in the scheme of things, we're still holding our guidance for the full year. We had a positive 0-point -- a very modest positive last quarter and we're seeing strength in the fourth quarter. And we've been saying for some time, we think the front [ review ] of these expirations are getting better in terms of the mix, more higher pricing power footprints as well as more international footprints where we have greater pricing power on these renewals. And that's putting aside incremental uplift potential from this inflation-related impact that Bill kind of highlighted that should manifest itself over time. Chris, do you want to tackle the edge? Chris Sharp : Absolutely. Thanks, Michael, for the question. It gives me an opportunity. I just want to also commend Giuliano as getting the role of CEO over at AtlasEdge. It's a great opportunity for him and we'll continue to work closely with him. So I appreciate the question, Michael. But going one step further, and I think you're spot on in that we often talk about the edge evolving from the core out deeper into the metro. And I think one aspect of that is no 2 markets are equal, so there's definitely varying degrees of capabilities in each of the markets globally. So Europe is one, in a general sense, North America and APAC. We absolutely are pursuing different types of partnerships within all of these markets because, quite frankly, our largest customers are looking for a global solution. And so we're always looking at what is the best path to enable our customers in the most efficient way possible. That's at the core of what is our edge thesis that we continually refine and that's what we referenced even in the prepared remarks, I think, in Bill's section about you'll see other partnerships in different markets just to really helping us prosecute that opportunity when it matures over time. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Frank Louthan : What is sort of the development yield that you're targeting on that re-leasing, particularly the new customer that kind of dragged down the greater than 1 megawatt leasing? And then I've got a follow-up. Andrew Power : Honestly, Frank, they're backfilling vacant capacity so it wasn't like we were building out a new building. I think a good chunk of that is legacy DFT capacity, which we did a stock-for-stock deal and hence, it was kind of a currency exchange. So I don't think the development -- I don't think the development yield would be the right way to look at it. You can look at the -- given its size, it was the preponderance of the North America signings in the plus megawatt category, which -- listen, we always want rates to be higher, but we -- those are 2 markets where I would say that we -- I think we garnered a fair economic rate for that capacity, and we're refilling something that's already built in our capitalization. We're paying tax -- real estate taxes on it. We're operating the capacity so it's going to flow through to our bottom line. And we've not changed, I would say, our development target returns on the, call it, 270 megawatts that we have under construction. That actually inched up a smidge this last quarter. Frank Louthan : All right, great. So the follow-up. Bill, you mentioned that you could see inflation work in your favor in the re-leasing. When should we expect that? Or I guess, it didn't help as much this quarter. Or is that going to help more broadly for colo and smaller deals as opposed to more hyperscale deals? A. William Stein : Yes, Frank, I mean, that's -- I don't think that's going to be -- that's not going to show up next quarter or the quarter after, I think. But I do think if you see sustained inflation, it's going to start flowing through to our competitors' construction costs. As I said, I think it will show up in higher interest rates. And I think it will put upward pressure on rents across the board, which will affect not just our new leasing but renewal leasing. But it's hard to put a specific time on it, certainly not going to be in the next quarter or two. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Curious on what you see in the enterprise funnel. We heard there are some larger deals coming to the market, particularly in the financial services arena. Have you seen deal requirements across enterprise picking up in size? And do you think an acceleration in deal flow could give you the opportunity to do even better in that arena as we go forward? And then just one more question. You've said in the past capital recycling may start to moderate in the coming years. But given the cap rate on the Prudential joint venture sale sub-5%, are there opportunities to maybe sell more noncore markets or assets in the coming years? Andrew Power : Corey, why don't you hit the first one and Greg and I can tag team the second one? Corey Dyer : Yes. So Eric, thanks. The question, I think, was on enterprise demand and continuing that as well as possible deals we have for the quarter. I'm not going to talk through specific deals. But we do see an uptick in requirements as well as uptick in the size of the requirements, which is what you were specifically asking when you think through our full spectrum of offerings and opportunity that we have for the enterprises that uniquely positions us around PlatformDIGITAL and how you're going to handle the data gravity and the opportunities around that. So yes, we're seeing some larger footprints go in across, call it, our 300 kW band and 600 kW band that speaks to people thinking through data performance hubs for us and data hubs out there for us to improve in their enterprise solutions. So yes, we're seeing that across the board. Did I get you your answer, Eric? Eric Luebchow : Yes. Yes, that's great. Gregory Wright : Eric, with respect to capital recycling, I guess what I would say is things are still consistent with what we said a few years ago. And a few years ago, we said we were going to sell a few billion dollars of assets over a few years. And again, the reasons that we were recycling out of those assets and redeploying that capital into more core strategic assets remains. Whether they were assets that weren't core to our business or certain markets that weren't core to our business, that's why we're selling assets. We're not just selling assets because there's strong cap rate activity in the market. Now that obviously helps. But again, if an asset is core to us, we're not going to sell it just because cap rates are getting better. But again, it does put a little wind at our back to the extent we are selling assets now, given the improved pricing we're seeing in the market. And you're right, we saw strong pricing in our portfolio disposition in Europe this past year. And now on the Prudential deal, we saw very strong pricing, as you said, on the stabilized assets. It was mid-4s, of which we were fortunate to recognize almost $20 million of promote out of that transaction as well. So look, your point is right, pricing is strong. We think that bodes well for the sector and for big owners of assets like ourselves. But maybe I'll turn it over to Andy to go ahead and see if he has anything to add. Andrew Power : Just one thing, just 2 buckets there, selling outright noncore assets that Greg did a great job of describing, streamlining our portfolio, aligning with growing customers, long-term growth assets. And then I think it was touched on one of the first or second questions on also evolving our capital sources in terms of core assets and raising private capital, all of this with the initiative of trying to accelerate our bottom line growth through capital efficiency. Operator : The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Erik Rasmussen : Just two. First, on the Africa JV. You announced that yesterday with Pembani. Can you just provide any additional color around how big these data centers are, maybe some details around the acquisition? And then as you look -- what sort of investments are you looking to make as you look to expand in that market? Gregory Wright : Sure. Erik, it's Greg again. Look, I think when you look at the transactions, right, the transactions we've talked about here are clearly a company called Medallion Communications in Nigeria, and the total consideration for that project was $29 million. We partnered with Pembani on that, so the amount of capital we have is even less. And another transaction we disclosed was the acquisition of a land parcel in Mozambique, again, with Pembani. That was for $3 million. So I mean, look, these are clearly -- what I would say is these are small Cs that we're planning in these highly connected assets because they are, they're highly connected communities of interest. And we're doing it with a smart local partner in Pembani. And when you look at a market like Nigeria, right, it's got the largest GDP and population in Africa. And the size of that investment, as I said, is very small for a company our size. And as I mentioned, Mozambique is even smaller. And we did that one to gain a location that again will play a critical role with the subsea cable activity that will encircle Africa. I think as you think about it, right, you look and see in Europe, right, we have Marseille in Western Europe, right, which is a highly connected hub. Then we've done a transaction with Lamda Hellix in Greece, which we believe is going to become a highly connected hub. And as you look at that, so you have Marseille to the west, you have Greece to the east. And as you move down into Africa, right, you look at Nigeria on the west, you look at Kenya in the east, right, and then you look at Mozambique that goes down to the south, and we really view this as really one large, like, crossroads of connectivity, if you will, that we think are going to bode well long term for the company. Erik Rasmussen : Great. Look forward to hearing more about it. And then maybe just on the Q3 leasing. It held steady at $113 million. As the U.S. and, I think, hyperscale ease somewhat, were there any limitations with capacity in certain markets? Or was there anything else that you could really call out as we think about Q3 results? Andrew Power : Erik, I don't think there's any limitations. We always have room for more leasing in any given quarter. And I know Corey's also chomping at the bit for more inventory to sell into quickly. But listen, I think it was a pretty very healthy quarter. You look at the geo mix, how well spread across each of the regions. You look at the enterprise mix with less than 1 megawatt in interconnection, call it, 40%; record 140 new logos. That record 140 had a record contribution from -- on quarter lease, [ reckon ] last 6 quarters from North America and I think #2 from an EMEA contribution. You could see from the new logo or some of the logos we called out in my prepared remarks, kind of like more old world enterprise, global power firms and universities to burgeoning technologies like autonomous driving. And I think on the hyperscale side, a little bit similar. Some of the, call it, house names of digital growing with us into existing inventory as well as some, call it, next-generation hyperscalers landing with us in Tokyo, which I think was our second and third largest signing. So broadly pretty healthy and we're not done yet for 2021. Operator : The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Colby Synesael : A few questions. One, on renewals, renewal spread's down negative 5.6%, still guiding to slightly negative for the year. Do you think renewal spreads could be positive in 2022? Second question, just a little bit of clarification. Are you saying that your biggest deal, which I guess was the combination of Chicago and Northern Virginia was for 30 megawatts? Or was that what the megawatts were that were renewed? And then Facebook just put out their earnings last night. They increased their CapEx budget for 2022 by over 50% to somewhere, I think, near $30 billion. Do you think that, that could have positive implications for the data center space? And then forgive me, but you just did an ATM. You have an 18-month draw on that. The ATMs you've done in the past have been 12 months. I'm curious why you pushed it out to 18. Andrew Power : So Colby, I think that's 4 questions relative to our 2 limit, but [indiscernible] color to... Colby Synesael : Some of them are like 5 seconds. Andrew Power : So we're going to get them all rapid-fire here. Listen, I think we've been saying for some time, we think we're moving into a better territory on the cash mark-to-market. And I think the -- what you see in our guidance, including the fourth quarter, relative to what we are trending already reported for the year speaks to that. And I think I've been saying that for some time that I think we're heading to more -- better territories. So again, we're not done with the budget and certainly not our guidance for 2022, but it feels like we're -- based on the mix, both product and geos and composition, we're in a better territory than we were certainly at the beginning of this year on that stat. We did -- across 4 or so suites, so different buildings across roughly half and half Ashburn and Chicago, a total of about 30 megawatts of new signings with the same customer that also did roughly 30 megawatts of renewals in the same quarter. And you could see this was a really super high renewal quarter overall for us. We've usually been doing like 100 megawatts or just shy of that in that plus than [ 1-megawatt ] LTM standpoint on. And so you can see, I think we had 53 or something in that category this quarter. So a high renewal activity quarter. So hopefully, that paints the picture on those two. Undrawn forward equity offering, yes, we -- listen, we -- the equity offering was again opportunistically derisking our development CapEx plan, and we're able to extend the duration of that contract so we have greater flexibility to essentially feather it into our sources or uses over time at the right time for the business, which hopefully better -- is better measured and help contributes to our earnings growth in the ensuing years. Facebook CapEx increasing, I don't think we have got any inside information on that. They're a large customer. We've done -- we did new business with them in the last quarter. But I don't see how it could be a negative necessarily, but I don't want to over-index that is super positive to the industry. Operator : The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : Andy, earlier on the call, you kind of mentioned inflation is here. How is that flowing through from a lease pricing standpoint? Are there any terms that are changing tax DLR against inflation, maybe some kind of change in that escalator structure? Andrew Power : Yes, Aryeh, so I mean, inflation -- I believe inflation is here. If you filled up your car or purchased milk at the grocery store, I think Bill's comments to one of the questions, it didn't mean like overnight, the data center industry got a rate reset. I think we've seen inflationary pressures prior to this hard cost inflation happen where markets just got tighter as they ran up to the physical boundaries of infrastructure, right? So our Santa Clara and Northern -- Santa Clara's an example of that. I mean our leasing success has been certainly a [ healing ] to the Ashburn market. We saw this in Frankfurt. Singapore saw this in terms of supply limitations, driving up pricing, which we've raised pricing there at least 5 times, I think, in the last 12 months. And I think Bill's commentary is that, listen, as this continues to hit [ car ] costs and delivery or access to the infrastructure is to bring on new supply which is, we believe, is going to be disproportionately impacting smaller subscale newer entrants, that means that our customers have less options in terms of their providers. And I think that as our costs get inflated, we have to examine our rates and on a market-by-market supply and demand and costing basis. And listen, I think we're -- do the -- going to be the best out there in terms of insulating our customers from this. But I know -- I think if this period continues for a long time, we haven't had inflation realistically since, call it, the end of the Carter administration. So we're in new territory for many of us. But I think it's -- I think we're going to fare better at the end of the day. And we are insulated in terms of we have rent escalators, fixed bumps in most of our contracts. And I think our scale and purchasing power on an operating side as well as the build cost side provides insulation in addition to some of the other risk mitigations we mentioned earlier in the call. Aryeh Klein : And then just on that large renewal, how did that mark-to-market rate compare to actual market rates? Or was it some percentage above market rates? Andrew Power : I would -- I believe it's probably 10-ish percent above new signings in apples-to-apples comparable markets. We typically see renewals have greater pricing power than new deals, just on the customer has a strong preference to not risk infrastructure or workload on a move. Aryeh Klein : And is that 10% kind of the normal range that you'd see? Andrew Power : It could be higher than that, actually. I would say it's probably that's maybe on the skinnier side. But it all depends on the facts and circumstances of the supply and demand, the utilization of the infrastructure, the customers' growth plans, the workload. Is it B2C? Is it B2B? All these things kind of go into the factors that drive the commercial outcome on those. And it was 30 megawatts all at once, right? So 30 megawatts of new signs for 30 megawatts of renewals, all with a stroke of a pen. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. A. William Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter as outlined here on the last page of the presentation. One, our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. PlatformDIGITAL attracted a record number of new logos. We had another quarter of strong new bookings and a record level of renewals. Most importantly, customers know that we will do what we say. Even when global supply chains are stressed, Digital Realty delivers. Two, we're continuing to extend our global platform. We are investing organically to enhance our global footprint while expanding our platform into India, along with additional strategic connectivity destinations circling the African continent. Three, we generated double-digit revenue growth during the third quarter, once again exceeding consensus expectations. And once again, we raised our full year outlook. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, locking in attractively priced long-term debt and supplementing it with equity capital that will be drawn down over the next 18 months to support our global development program. I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that you all stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you virtually in a couple of weeks at NAREIT and hopefully in person again sometime soon. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question plus a follow-up and we will conclude promptly at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Huseby, Digital Realty\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Huseby : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on today\u2019s call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call, and they will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today\u2019s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks related to our business, please see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I\u2019d like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. We further strengthened connections with customers with $156 million of new bookings with record results in both a zero to one megawatt and greater than a megawatt category and ended the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase over the prior year. We also continue to enhance our global platform with the completion of organic development projects in multiple metros despite the continued challenges presented by the pandemic and the global supply chain in addition to strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider. Financially, we had a solid quarter with full year results above the high end of the guidance range that we provided this time last year. And finally, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the establishment of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers. As a perpetual capital partner, Digital Realty and Digital Core REIT can continue to work together while providing our customers with a seamless experience. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill Stein : Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And we made further progress on each front during the fourth quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-one megawatt and greater than one megawatt categories. We also announced two significant global initiatives. First, in December, we announced the successful listing of Digital Core REIT as a standalone publicly traded company on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Digital Realty contributed a 90% interest in a portfolio of 10 core data centers concentrated in top-tier markets across the U.S. and Canada, valued at $1.4 billion at a 4.25% cap rate. We generated net proceeds of over $950 million from the transaction and we retained a 35% equity interest in the publicly traded REIT. The offering was very well received, and Digital Core REIT has traded up approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the gain on our remaining ownership stake. In addition to providing investors a stable cash flow stream from a portfolio of high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic benefits to Digital Realty. First, Digital Core REIT is a perpetual capital partner. It has a long-term investment horizon and a global mandate to invest in stabilized income-producing data centers. Second, Digital Core REIT has been carefully crafted to provide a seamless customer experience. Digital Core REIT is sponsored by and externally managed by Digital Realty. We will continue to manage the properties providing the same level of operational excellence, and we will earn fees for asset and property management as well as acquisitions, dispositions and development. From a customer perspective, nothing changes when we contribute an asset to Digital Core REIT. Third, Digital Core REIT is an ideal partner vehicle for Digital Realty. We expect to contribute additional stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future, and we may also co-invest alongside Digital Core REIT on future investment activity. Finally, our interests are aligned. As mentioned, Digital Realty will continue to own a 10% direct ownership stake in each of the assets in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle. Digital Core REIT is led by two long-time Digital Realty team members, John Stewart, who most of you know well, along with Dan Tith. We are excited about their opportunity to create value for Digital Core REIT unitholders, including Digital Realty. Our second global initiative, which we announced just after quarter-end, is the definitive agreement to acquire roughly a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa\u2019s leading carrier-neutral colocation provider. This acquisition immediately establishes Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider on the high-growth African continent and builds upon our earlier investments in Africa with iColo, in both Kenya and Mozambique and in Medallion in Nigeria. Teraco complements these investments as well as our highly connected facilities in the Mediterranean by hosting the key strategic landing endpoints for subsea cables circling Africa. From Marseille and Athens in the North; Mombasa and Maputo along the east; Durban and Cape Town in the South; and Lagos along the Western Coast, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting the growth of our customers as well as the broader digital transformation of the entire African continent. Teraco has seven state-of-the-art data centers across three key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises. Teraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and hosts seven cloud on-ramps and provides direct access to seven subsea cables. Teraco has historically generated healthy double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA. In addition, more than half of Teraco\u2019s in-service portfolio was developed within the past two years. The current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%. And Teraco owns land adjacent to its highly connected campuses in Johannesburg and Cape Town that will support another doubling of the in-place capacity, representing significant embedded growth potential and providing considerable runway to support our customers\u2019 growth. Leading global cloud and content platforms have recently begun making significant investments in Africa, given the existing capacity within the in-service portfolio, the incremental capacity currently under construction and the strategic landholdings to support future expansion. Teraco is uniquely positioned to support the expected growth of digital infrastructure in Africa over the next several years. Let\u2019s discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. During the fourth quarter, Digital Realty earned Nareit\u2019s Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, complementing the company\u2019s five-star GRESB rating and top ranking within the technology and science sector. Digital Realty was also named one of America\u2019s most responsible companies by Newsweek and was the number one ranked data center company. We continue to advance our sustainable financing strategy, recasting and upsizing our credit facility with improved terms while incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance against certain green targets. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors and our employees, along with the broader society and advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all these stakeholders. Let\u2019s turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in the expansion of our global platform. In addition to the Teraco transaction, we\u2019ve grown our presence along the Eastern Coast of Africa with iColo and supplemented our acquisition of Medallion data centers in Nigeria with two land purchases in Lagos for future development. Over the next decade, we expect to see huge opportunity for global businesses to tap into Africa\u2019s rapidly growing Internet economy, and Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable this growth. We also continue to invest in the organic growth of our platform. We spent $580 million on growth CapEx in the fourth quarter, our largest quarterly growth CapEx investment to date. We currently have 44 projects underway, totaling more than 250 megawatts of IT capacity in 27 metros around the world. This capacity was 46% presold as of year-end. Geographically, we continue to invest most heavily in EMEA with 27 projects underway, totaling more than 140 megawatts across 16 metros. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered several development projects during the fourth quarter, including facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong. In January, we opened Digital Seoul 1, our first data center in South Korea and the first carrier-neutral facility in the country. This facility will serve as a connectivity gateway for latency-sensitive customer workloads, but can be connected to hyperscale applications hosted in our second facility in Korea, totaling over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside of the city center. The two facilities will be tied together with fiber to create a connected campus and will complement each other by providing solutions for the full customer spectrum, from small performance sensitive colocation customers to huge hyperscale deployments. In North America, our development pipeline is diversified by product mix as well as geographically with projects underway in seven different markets. We continue to see strong hyperscale demand in Hillsboro, while we are expanding in Downtown Atlanta to bring on additional colocation capacity at one of the most highly connected destinations in the Southeastern United States. We are bringing capacity online in both these markets, among others, given the robust demand backdrop and our tightening inventory position. Let\u2019s turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We\u2019re fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platform digital. Our customers continue to solve some of the most complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges. We are witnessing a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments, deploying and connecting large, private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. Industry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies. Additionally, Gartner believes that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies. These forecasts are consistent with our view of where the puck is headed. Our market intelligence tool, the Data Gravity Index, forecasts similar growth in the intensity of data creation and its gravitational pull on global IT infrastructure. In addition, our industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities serves as the global playbook for industry collaboration to tackle data gravity challenges head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. Digital Realty was recently named Company of the Year by Frost & Sullivan for North American Data Center Best Practices. This award reflects our continued focus on operational excellence, underpinned by continuous innovation and execution of the PlatformDIGITAL road map. We are honored by the strong validation of the differentiated value proposition we are creating for customers and partners. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we delivered record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter. Volume was elevated across both of our primary reporting categories in the quarter with a healthy mix between enterprise and hyperscale business. For the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60/40 split between greater than one megawatt and less than one megawatt plus interconnection. The EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings led by Frankfurt with standout performance across product types. The fourth quarter was also notable for the strength of cross-selling between regions. Nearly 30% of our sub-one megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform. Not surprisingly, the Americas was our biggest exporter with most deals landing in EMEA, followed by APAC. Both EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-one megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region. The weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA. We landed over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter\u2019s record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos. We are encouraged by the consistent organic growth of our customer base, and we view these results as strong validation of platform digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Graphcore, a British semiconductor company that develops accelerators and systems for AI and machine learning, selected PlatformDIGITAL to address their density, security and scale requirements. The initial deployment will land in Amsterdam to be followed by a global rollout, and we are also collaborating on solution engineering and joint go-to-market activities. A leading high-frequency trading shop is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to extend their high-performance computing platform across two continents and expand trading into two new international metros, while approving cloud access and business continuity state side. A Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros. A leading aerospace manufacturing and services company is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging dense interconnection to support data exchange across four new markets. A Global 2000 insurance brokerage is consolidating their data center footprint and has adopted PlatformDIGITAL to remove data gravity barriers and interconnect with clouds across multiple metros. An Ivy League university is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to exit their own on-premise facility and enhance their access to the health care provider community for data exchange. And finally, a major APAC food services organization selected PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and leverage the local centers of data exchange in Japan. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, rose from $330 million to $378 million as our fourth \u2013 record fourth quarter signings more than offset commencements. The lag between signings and commencements was unusually high at nearly 14 months primarily driven by long-term leases on recent development starts in EMEA as customers accelerated efforts to secure a long-term runway for growth against a backdrop of steadily dwindling inventory. Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $151 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter in addition to the record new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the fourth quarter was nearly four years. Renewal rates rolled down 4%, driven by a handful of large deals in North America as negative re-leasing spreads on greater than one megawatt renewals more than offset the positive releasing spreads on the sub-one megawatt renewals. In terms of operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 60 basis points, almost entirely due to development deliveries placed in service during the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by churn in North America as well as higher property operating and net utilities expense. As a reminder, the 2021 same-store pool did not include the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece or Altus IT in Croatia. Each of these businesses will be included in the same-store pool beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and each is expected to contribute to improving same-store growth going forward, partially offset by higher property taxes as well as FX headwinds expected in 2022. Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened during the fourth quarter relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 130 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to the currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in base rates would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed with a well-diversified menu of public and private capital sources available to fund the growth of our business. In terms of earnings growth, fourth quarter core FFO per share was up 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, driven by solid operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs due to proactive balance sheet management over the past 12 months. For the full year, core FFO per share was up 5% year-over-year and came in $0.03 above the high end of our initial guidance range, which did not contemplate the contribution of $1.4 billion of assets through Digital Core REIT in early December. As a reminder, full year core FFO per share excludes the $20 million promote fee on the Prudential joint venture in the third quarter as well as the $25 million PPA settlement in the first quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect core FFO per share will be between $6.80 and $6.90, including the 1% dilution from Teraco as well as 100 basis points to 200 basis points of expected FX headwinds due to the strength of the dollar relative to 2021. We expect to deliver revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion. Given the tightened supply environment, we expect flat cash renewal rates in 2022, up from slightly negative in 2021. And we expect overall portfolio occupancy to remain within the current range despite the significant new capacity scheduled to come online during the year in addition to the embedded lease-up potential within the Teraco portfolio. We are off to a great start on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful \u20ac750 million bond offering in early January of 10.5-year paper at 1 3/8% [ph] coupon. Finally, we expect to raise $500 million to $1 billion from capital recycling whether through contributions to Digital Core REIT, noncore asset sales to third parties or a combination of both. In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board-level decision. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend, just as we have had each and every year since our IPO in 2004. Last, but certainly not least, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on Page 12. As of year-end, our reported leverage ratio stood at 6.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 5.4 times. Pro forma for settlement of the $1 billion September forward equity offering, leverage drops to 5.7 times, while fixed charge coverage also improved to 5.7 times. We continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. As Bill previously mentioned, we recast our credit facility during the fourth quarter, upsizing from $2.35 billion to $3 billion, extending the maturity by three years and tightening pricing by five basis points. We also incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our commitment to sustainable business practices. Subsequent to quarter end, we raised approximately $850 million from the 10.5-year euro bonds at 1.375%, and we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all $450 million of our outstanding 4.75% U.S. dollar bonds due 2025. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is just over 2%. A little over three quarters of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment. And 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thanks. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about supply chain. Last call, you talked about kind of on time and on budget in terms of delivery of turnkey inventory. Any update on that? And did that play a role in the slightly more elongated commencement timeframe associated with your leasing of 14 months compared to what you\u2019ve done in the past? Bill Stein : Thanks, John. We are seeing some effects on the supply chain. Clearly, most of the equipment is strained in terms of availability, including data center infrastructure, servers and network gear, and shortages in things like chips and fans are impacting many industries, not just ours. Our VMI program, the vendor-managed inventory program, utilizes our knowledge and market way to overcome some of these disruptions. I believe that we\u2019re the gold standard for managing vendors and for forecasting. And this gives us priority for production slots with our suppliers. This program has allowed us to reduce lead times by an average of 70% versus standard. Increased \u2013 we increased the VMI pool when COVID hit. So, I think we\u2019re pretty well prepared for the current disruptions. And we\u2019re evaluating the program to expand it even further to better support our programs. Steel, aluminum and copper is also rising, which affects some fit-out by cages and cabinets. This is only \u2013 this really only comes into play though, for projects that are scheduled for completion in the next six to 12 months. And in those cases, we\u2019re working closely with our customers to order gear early to lock in the pricing and avoid any shipment delays. Let me hand it over to Andy to address the relationship to delay in construction and anything else that he might want to add. Andy Power : Sure. I think Bill covered it. But just on the \u2013 John, the elongated book-to-bill or time line, which had nothing really do with supply chain. Two factors there : one, you can see in the Americas region, we did a powered base shell deal, obviously, a longer lead time to develop that and bring that online; and then in Europe, where we have the concentration of our large deals obviously, stand out quarter for EMEA across the board. Some of the plus megawatt deals were rather large in size and takedowns. And I think there\u2019s a project or two where we\u2019re literally at land state and the customers are looking to really just book that future runway to growth. So that was kind of what drugged the overall time line out for sign to commence. Jon Atkin : And then maybe more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe comment on the willingness to flex for \u2013 your CapEx budget to a higher level, you accelerated compared to last year. But given all the demand that\u2019s out there and all the aggressive investment by some of your peers in order to maintain your share, what is your thought about flexing the CapEx budget higher? And any kind of updated thoughts on financing mix as to how you might do that? It seems like that would really affect 2022 CapEx. But further out, any kind of broad thoughts on that would be appreciated. Andy Power : Sure. So, we finished 2021 at south of $2.2 billion of development CapEx or so. Our guidance range is a step-up of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of CapEx. You can just look at our press release throughout the year. We\u2019ve been opening new markets, expanding addressable market, building out the pipeline from land to shells to finish suites to colo and connectivity inventory. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking to change our posture. We really go market-by-market supply chain \u2013 or excuse me, market-by-market supply-demand view. And we think we\u2019re positioning ahead of our competitors. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a really necessary reactionary flex needed into our business. But if the opportunity presents itself, we look at that, and we\u2019ll make those investments. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got a diverse menu of capital sources to fuel our growth. Jon Atkin : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. I was curious, first, if you can unpack the guidance for the same capital cash NOI growth of down 2.5% to 3.5%. Maybe some of the puts and takes in there and how that might play out over the course of the year? I can share the follow-up after this one. Andy Power : Sure. Thanks, Michael. So just a quick backdrop on same capital. So last year, we guided slightly negative on same capital or \u2013 and we came in at 4.4% same-capital cash NOI is negative. This was slightly worse than the year prior. As I mentioned, that was a real subset of the pool that we reported in 2021. You flip to 2022, you call it almost 80% of our company is in that pool with the addition of the Westin Building, Interxion, Lamda Hellix and Altus IT in Croatia. So you get a much larger sample set and an improving complexion. So from negative 4.4%, we guided to, call it, negative 3% at the midpoint. It\u2019s really being impacted by two elements : one, currency. We hedge to the balance sheet. So all the currency fluctuations are hitting that pool, if you call \u2013 look at that on a constant currency, you\u2019re probably closer to negative 1%. And then if you peel back the onion on that, it\u2019s really strong positives \u2013 several \u2013 like 3% or so in that APAC, close to flat in EMEA due to the utilities being elevated and then the negative contribution largely focused in the Americas region, where we are getting hit by what looks like it would be a property tax increase that\u2019s going to hit us in that year \u2013 or excuse me, in 2022, but not continue in 2023 and beyond. And the major driver of still not being more firmly into positive, although improving really is downtime for releasing of some of the larger non-retentions. We\u2019ve been working away at that and making good activity. Actually re-leasing it and then moving those customers into that space. It just takes time, not because of supply chain politics, more of that one 5-megawatt customer leads and a new 5-megawatt customer refills the refurbs, the new PDUs, et cetera, it just takes time. And for those chunky deals, you lose a month or two or rent in a year, that\u2019s just \u2013 it won\u2019t flow through until you get into 2023. So net-net, not in positive territory firmly on a reported basis yet, but heading that way. Michael Rollins : And just to follow up on some comments that you and the team have provided earlier on just pricing. Can you give us an update on the pricing strategy, the opportunities to leverage price, whether it\u2019s because of the inflationary backdrop or some of the other macro factors that you\u2019re dealing with? And then how that would affect the financial performance over time? Andy Power : Sure. So I mean, pricing from two lenses. Obviously, you saw in the guidance, the \u2013 we\u2019re guiding towards flat releasing spreads on our renewals for 2020. So that\u2019s not new news. We\u2019ve been mentioning that we\u2019ve been working our way into that positive territory partly due to mix of expirations, but certainly, I would say, pricing related and then also, call it, pricing on new deals. Holistically, I think our supply chain team has done a really and design [indiscernible] team done a really good job insulating us given our scale, our consistency in market. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s industry-wide. And if you\u2019re a newer, smaller, more fledgling or regional competitor that\u2019s creating disruptions from an inflation standpoint and there\u2019s just overall strains on delivery of capacity, whether it\u2019s moratoriums in certain countries or the ability to deliver power. All of these elements, I\u2019d say, add up together to, I think, be an incremental benefit to our value proposition to our customer of having this incumbent platform of 26 countries, 50 metros with one way for growth that the pricing pendulum feels like it\u2019s continuing to slowly swing more and more in our favor. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk about the strength you had in the less than one megawatt category. Maybe you could break down where you\u2019re seeing the most success, whether it\u2019s traditional enterprise, smaller hyperscale edge nodes? And do you think that study improvement you\u2019ve had is sustainable going forward? And then my second question was on the asset disposition front. Andy, I think in the past, you said you don\u2019t have a lot left to do on noncore. So should we assume that on a heavier weighting towards SREIT contributions throughout the course of the year? And related to that, where do you think your leverage slightly north of six times, should we expect it to remain elevated? Or are you looking to drive that down with the Teraco financing and potentially other asset sales? Thanks. Andy Power : Well, I\u2019ll have Corey start us off on the enterprise less-than-megawatt interconnection category. And then I can filling any factoids and talked about source and uses on your second question. Corey Dyer : Yes. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re really happy and feel good about the healthy demand that we\u2019re getting out of the sub-1 megawatt smart space. It seem to be consistent about kind of where we\u2019re growing that and how it\u2019s been building. We mentioned the enterprise demand and just where it\u2019s coming across. It\u2019s coming across from a lot of our customers trying to take advantage of hybrid IT environments. And so we\u2019re seeing that come across the board. Across the globe, we have really strong demand in pipeline. And the nice thing about it is it\u2019s coming from an enterprise perspective from us, two thirds of that pipeline is coming through as enterprise. And we\u2019re also getting good channel progress from it. So from a sub-1 megawatt perspective, is it sustainable? Is it something that we\u2019re going to continue. I think you\u2019re going to see it continue. And we\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re seeing that demand across all regions and coming through the channel specifically and then also enterprises. So, we\u2019re happy about where that is, and I think it\u2019s going to continue. Andy Power : Just to add a couple of more reasonable tidbits, Eric. So EMEA was an absolute standout for the less than a megawatt, as you saw in the numbers. Frankfurt, London, Paris, Amsterdam Marseille, big contributors. Over half of our new logos actually came out of that region. In the Americas, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta were the top markets and Singapore is obviously the standout in APAC. And do you \u2013 Eric, do you mind just repeating the second part of your question about the source use? I know I heard the first part about it is noncore versus contribution actually. What was the second part of your question? Eric Luebchow : And just how we should think about your leverage throughout the year? You\u2019re a little above six times. I know you have the equity forward, you have the Teraco financing. Just how we should think about the cadence of leverage this year? That would be helpful. Thanks. Andy Power : Sure. As so you see in the guidance table, we put about $0.5 billion to $1 billion of, call it, capital recycling, which would be both of these categories. We ended the year with really a 60 \u2013 a one-off asset for $60 million that will be likely redeveloped into a residential project in San Jose. And there are, call it, a short list of whittling down of incremental noncore dispositions that could happen during the year it would be a piece of that. And then I think looking for incremental contributions to digital core REIT would probably be the larger segment of that source of capital. That\u2019s obviously been a great success. John Stewart, after 32 earnings calls, hung up the HP 12C, now looking to grow that vehicle. In terms of funding for the year, \u2013 we finished out the year with about almost $1 billion of proceeds if you include that one-off asset plus digital core REIT in December. That all put the back on 12/31 with $140-ish million of cash, $40 million of \u2013 excuse me, $400 million drawn on a $3.3 billion credit facility. We got lucky and beat the rate march with a $850 million euro bond beginning of the year. That\u2019s probably an incremental $500 million proceeds. We still have the $1 billion undrawn forward that will take down. So those combinations of forces and uses will essentially fund the closing of the $1.7 billion purchase of Teraco. And then obviously, those incremental noncore dispose or incremental contributions in the back half of the year will be the, call it, the replenishing of the capital stack, and we\u2019ll look to leverage to, call it, say, to move more in line to our targeted leverage levels below six times for sure, as we move through the year. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thank you very much. Good evening. Andy, I just wanted to continue on the Digital Core REIT. How should we think about what to expect there for 2022? Is this going to be something where it will potentially do more deals with you? And how are those? Is it really North America focused today and in the near term? Or could we see assets from Europe or elsewhere go in there? And you mentioned the stock price appreciation. Is there any magic is 35% of magic number in terms of your stake? Or could you get \u2013 use that as a source of funding as well to take your stake down in the critical. Thanks. Andy Power : Yes. So the \u2013 this was essentially an evolution of our capital sources here. Date back to probably the origins when Bill created a prudential JV that just actually ran its course, and we recognized a promote in the fall. Perpetual externally managed public vehicle with a global mandate, although albeit originally a North America portfolio. So over time, I would expect it to \u2013 through contributions of assets from Digital Realty, and they can also \u2013 and can also acquire third-party assets, diversify its portfolio geographically. But really with core assets, data centers that Digital Realty believes in for the long run, that have really long-term weighted average lease terms, high occupancies core to our strategy. We don\u2019t have a set exact dollar amount or time of 2022, where we\u2019re looking to do a contribution, we\u2019ll work collaboratively with John and his team to position that at the right time for Digital Core REIT and its shareholders and Digital Realty\u2019s funding plans. But I would think it will diversify over time and continue to scale, and it\u2019s been well received to date. And I think that we\u2019ll be able to build upon that success. Simon Flannery : And your 35% stake? Andy Power : I\u2019m sorry, that \u2013 there\u2019s no magic to that. That was really just a product of the size of the initial portfolio, the conservative leverage we\u2019ve put on the vehicle day one in a modest IPO size. We \u2013 the underwriters\u2019 lockup tactically expires in the next several months. So not \u2013 it\u2019s right around the corner. We have no interest to sell down. We can sell down if we want to. More likely, over time, I could see us being diluted down as digital quarry buys for cash, more assets and Digital Realty makes room for incremental investors both institutional and retail to participate in the growth of the vehicle. Simon Flannery : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. Eric Rasmussen : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. New logos were quite strong. I think you highlighted in your record in the quarter. Maybe just talk about what\u2019s behind the success there? And then maybe do you see that momentum sustaining into the New Year? Corey Dyer : Yes. So, what was our second \u2013 so first of all, thanks for the question and also thanks for just the acknowledgment of the success we\u2019re having around new logos. Second highest quarter in new logos yet our highest year in new logos at $480 million. It\u2019s really with customers coming to a hybrid IT and a data-centric kind of mindset around what they\u2019re going to do, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing come through on the new logos. We\u2019ve got a lot of customers now picking us consistently in making those decisions on it. Where we\u2019ve seen kind of an outside growth from the new logos is around our channel. We went from channel sales of 15% up to \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, from 10% in 2020 to 15% in 2021. But the new logos we\u2019re getting are close to 20% to 25% on a quarterly basis from the channel. So when you ask where it\u2019s coming from, it\u2019s coming across the whole globe. You also think through our exports. We mentioned that 30% of our export business \u2013 or 30% of our business is growing export, meaning across regions and landing in EMEA at 60%. So really good progress, across the globe on new logos supported by strong success with the channel. And I think we\u2019re going to see that continue as well. So thanks for the question, Eric. Eric Rasmussen : Great. And then maybe just \u2013 my follow-up, obviously, hyperscale was strong. But maybe talk about the types of hyperscalers you\u2019re seeing \u2013 is there a shift in the customer makeup? And what\u2019s driving that demand? Andy Power : So, I would maybe go region by region real quickly. I just saw there wasn\u2019t a lot of activity in APAC this particular quarter, but we had a great 2021 overall in that region across all product types, but certainly including hyperscale and we\u2019re seeing significant demand continue. And really excited with the introduction of Seoul 1, which we just opened up as well as significant activity across the Japanese market. In EMEA, we had four of the five top CSPs, all signed new business with us during the quarter. A lot of activity in Frankfurt, both in the East with the legacy interaction campus in the West with the legacy digital campus, Zurich, Marseille, Madrid and Paris were also contributors as well as Amsterdam. In North America, in the \u2013 I would say, the social media category has been a contributor and Ashburn was probably the standout for the quarter where we\u2019ve remained incredibly tight during the recovering market and continue to see strong demand. Operator : The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Two, if I could, please. One was, Andy, you talked about co-investment with the Singapore Core REIT. And I\u2019m wondering now, given -- I think we\u2019re looking at about a 3.7% cap rate implied on the market cap now. whether this \u2013 how this affects how you guys think about mergers and acquisitions, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of partnership models emerge across all sorts of digital infrastructure asset classes. I\u2019d be interested in kind of hearing a little bit more about what you meant by that. And then Bill, look, I\u2019m a long-time listener, first-time caller. It\u2019s not gone unnoticed that John is taking over as CEO of Singapore Core REIT. Andy has become President, you\u2019ve moved to Austin. I mean, we\u2019re all big fans of what you\u2019ve done, what are we \u2013 should we be expecting something? And I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the succession right now. Thank you. Greg Wright : David, it\u2019s Greg Wright. Let me take the first question. Your question with respect to the SREIT and how we think about it in terms of our M&A strategy. I mean, look, I think when you look at the mandate that John and his team have for that vehicle, it\u2019s clearly \u2013 it\u2019s a yield-driven vehicle. And obviously, we assess that cost of capital for that vehicle like we do Digital Realty stand-alone. And those assets that are going to go into that, they\u2019re not going to be development, they\u2019re going to be stabilized. You\u2019ve heard John\u2019s pitch in terms of the types of assets they\u2019re looking for that to put it into that vehicle. Well, if we do future M&A or anything like that, and there happens to be those kinds of assets, they will be a natural home for that. Now we obviously have a partner, how to pursue those transactions simultaneously and be able to bifurcate the assets and to get the best cost of capital. So that\u2019s how we think about it from an M&A standpoint. But in terms of cost of capital, we still go back, we do our underwrites we\u2019re going to go out and do DCFs and take a look at the projections and take a look at the risk of the asset and we\u2019re going to price it accordingly. And obviously, having a vehicle that\u2019s got a better cost of capital is helpful. But that\u2019s generally the approach we\u2019ll use for M&A. Andy Power : The only thing I would add to that question, John \u2013 David was \u2013 listen, Singapore is opening up its moratorium in a very rational and prudent way. Now with the development of, call it, three new data center locations. I can\u2019t think of a better partner to be one of the three given our experience in this business, 4,000 global customers. Leadership and sustainability, experience in region. And last but not least, having a partner Digital Core REIT listed on the Singapore Exchange that could be an eventual owner of that asset allow all the citizens of Singapore to participate in the digital transformation of that country in the region. So that\u2019s a unique incremental attribute, that could play in the future. Bill Stein : Relative to the move to Austin, I am not the only person who has moved to Austin. We moved the corporate headquarters to Austin. January of last year. And I\u2019m surrounded by people who have also moved to Austin. On my right is my Chief of Staff, Bill Bradley, on my left is my Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright. I\u2019m looking down the table here at our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Sanchak. So we have quite a few people who have moved. Andy Power is planning to move at the end of the year. So this is the corporate headquarters. We made a conscious decision to leave California for a number of reasons. I think we\u2019ve articulated that. We\u2019re going to be moving our staffs out of California and New York. We\u2019ve announced that. We have downsized in California, our offices there. We moved from [indiscernible] center up the block to space it on California Street, and we\u2019re going to be downsizing in New York as well. So there\u2019s nothing about this move to Austin that is related to succession. Relative to the movement of Andy into the President\u2019s log, I think that\u2019s your question. Our \u2013 my goal and the goal of the Board is to try to give our top-performing executives as much experience and different experience as we possibly can. So this gives Andy an opportunity to spend time in operations as well as working with Chris Sharp on the networking side, the product development side, the innovation side. We have a number of very capable executives that work for this company that report to me. And I think many of them are potential candidates to succeed me. My obligation to the Board is to make sure that they have choices. And I\u2019m trying to provide for that. And so when the time is right for me to move into retirement, I\u2019d like our Board to be able to look at a number of potential candidates inside the company and potentially consider at candidates outside the company as well. But I have no plans to step down at any point in the near future. I like what I do. And I think we\u2019re pretty good at it. Operator : The next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead. Brendan Lynch : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe this one is for Chris. With your growing pool of colo assets, do you have any interest in creating an internal software-defined network? And if so, what would that entail? And what competitive advantages would that provide to you? Chris Sharp : Yes. Thanks, Brendan. I appreciate the question. Absolutely, right? That\u2019s what the customers are looking for. And I just want to go back a little bit on what Eric had asked Corey on what\u2019s driving that sub-1 megawatt. It\u2019s a sweet spot where customers are starting to outgrow colo. So it\u2019s very beneficial to our asset class to be able to support that growing need and allow them to land and expand even beyond the one megawatt and start to go to more market. But that all requires an SDN, just a software-defined networking, for the broader group, that capability to tie it all together. And so one of the things you\u2019re going to hear about later in the year is, we are absolutely bringing to market one of two platforms in the world that is purpose built for orchestrating at a higher level, that type of capability on our customer behalf, right? And I\u2019ll just impress upon everybody, it\u2019s not improving on a 10-year-old product. It\u2019s definitely purpose-built. And at the core of that is enhancing our customer experience where we\u2019re removing that technical complexity that a lot of customers are impacted by around interconnection and making it easier for them to procure and deploy in all of these locations. And that\u2019s why that new logo growth is starting to grow at record numbers, and you\u2019ll see that continually feed off of itself because they\u2019re getting a big benefit out of the community of interest that\u2019s being created around the globe. But again, at the end of the day, it\u2019s about open access and unfettered customer experience, which allows all of our customers to access the right partners throughout the globe. And this fabric, again, will facilitate the easiest route to all destinations. Brendan Lynch : Great. And maybe you could give a little color on the type of investment that, that will take? Chris Sharp : Yes, absolutely, Brendan. And we had referenced a while back. We had acquired a smaller firm that was some of the leading software developers out in the market. And it\u2019s something that Andy and I constantly talk about on the right amount of capital. And so we have a dedicated software team that is purpose built in delivering that capability. And so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s material as of yet, and we\u2019re not disclosing the details around the investment, but the impact that we get with having that team dedicated to building not only an SDN capability, but that broader orchestration is absolutely going to be beneficial, and we already have some great conversations with beta customers that are driving the direction of what those feature functionalities are going to be. Andy Power : And Brendan, I can confirm that the cost CapEx otherwise is included and not material to the guidance we have on the sub today. Operator : The next question will come from Matt Nickman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Nickman : Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me and I\u2019ll keep this brief. Maybe two for Andy. First off, does the 2022 guide, can you quantify what\u2019s embedded in there from Tareco, just thinking about revenue, EBITDA and core FFO? And then secondly, maybe detailing on that. Typically, you\u2019ll give some directional color on how to think about forward quarter core FFO. I\u2019m just wondering if there are any puts and takes for 1Q core FFO per share that you would flag to be mindful off? Thanks. Andy Power : Sure. So just working backwards. So \u2013 we didn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have like our famous bar charts without numbers on them for you in terms of the weighted distribution. We do have a pretty decent moving part here with the timing of Teraco, which I can\u2019t remember Greg mentioned this yet, but I mean we\u2019re working through the closing conditions and really the process for, call it, competition community review. But feels like it\u2019s going to happen in call it the early \u2013 very early second quarter to a couple of months in the second quarter time frame. So that does put a little bit of puts and takes from a quarterly blend. It is just to confirm the dilution from Teraco is included in our guidance table in the sub. So at the bottom line, our midpoint is call it growing, call it, 5% which is about 100 basis points increase from our guidance a year ago, which we did beat by 140 bps. We also are absorbing call it, 100 to 200 basis points of FX headwinds. And so if you normalize for those items, you call it close to the 6.5%, call it core FFO per share growth. The components of Teraco, I would call it, ballpark for a rough swag, a partial year contribution to revenue and an EBITDA basis, call it, $100-ish of revenue and 70-ish of EBITDA contribution of rough swags. Just a reminder, a data point, our year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth is deflated when you just look at our reported financials. Remember that we had a PPA in a settlement NH promote in 2021. So that plus \u2013 really that plus FX calls it has \u2013 what you call it, and 9.3% growth on a revenue basis on a constant currency basis. And then as a reminder, we\u2019re also losing revenue from our contribution to the Singapore REIT, Digital Core REIT. So that puts you up another 100 or 150 basis points higher on the revenue standpoint from a constant currency basis. Matt Nickman : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. Bill Stein : Thank you. I\u2019d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for 2021, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. We booked over $0.5 billion of new business in 2021, a 15% increase over the prior year. While attracting nearly 500 new logos. Digital Realty\u2019s operational excellence is second to none, whether it be uninterrupted performance during a record Texas ice storm or on-time delivery of new capacity despite a global pandemic and the resulting strain on global supply chains. Our customers trust us with mission-critical applications and digital delivers. We\u2019re expanding our global platform, establishing Digital Realty as the unquestioned leading colocation interconnection provider in Africa and positioning PlatformDIGITAL at key points of interconnection and subsea cable landing stations. We announced our expansion into India, together with our partner, Brookfield, and we invested in Atlas Edge gaining exposure to the European edge market all while investing over $2 billion in organic development around the world. We posted solid financial results and core FFO revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our initial guidance. Our 2022 guidance represents mid-single-digit growth in core FFO per share despite absorbing headwinds from FX, Teraco and capital recycling. Constant currency guidance for CFFO, if we were to exclude Teraco, would be in high single digits. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising $1 billion of proceeds from asset sales all the while positioning ourselves as the leading global provider of the full spectrum of data center solutions. I\u2019d like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles, who have kept the digital world turning. I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again soon. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, we kicked off the year on a high note with record bookings of $167 million, led by strength in the leases greater than 1 megawatt and supported by steady bookings in the 0 to 1 megawatt and interconnection category. Second, we saw a notable and broad-based improvement in our re-leasing spreads in the quarter, reflecting a healthier pricing environment but also the active engagement we are having with customers on the Digital Realty value proposition. Third, we remain poised to continue our expansion in Africa with plans to close our investment in Teraco later this quarter. And finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus' expectations despite FX-related headwinds. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein. Bill Stein : Thanks, Jordan and welcome to the Digital team. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework and we made further progress on each front during the first quarter. First, we continue to globalize our business with the announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco in early January. We also continue to grow our business organically around the world. We posted another record quarter of global bookings totaling $167 million of annualized rent, including our second highest quarter in each of the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, together with another solid quarter in EMEA. Bookings this quarter were led by strong results in the greater than 1 megawatt category, particularly in the Americas, while sub-1-megawatt bookings remain steady and in line with our 2021 average. Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders. During the first quarter, Digital Realty was named one of America's Most Just Companies and third overall in the real estate industry by Just Capital and CNBC. We also maintained our status as a member of the FTSE4Good Index which measures the performance of companies demonstrating strong ESG practices, continuing our record of recognition for our leading sustainability initiatives. During the first quarter of 2022, Digital Realty continued our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts through our employee-led DEI council which seeks to promote inclusion and create opportunities for each of our employee communities. Through the DEI council, Digital Realty has expanded its philanthropy and community engagement activities with strategic donations and partnerships with global charitable organizations. Digital Realty has also taken a stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and those impacted by the Russian vision. We do not have any data centers or operations in Russia or Ukraine and our company will abide by sanctions against Russia. Until the peaceful and legal resolution of this conflict, we will not invest in Russia. Furthermore, we are funding philanthropic organizations to support Ukrainian refugees, those displaced within Ukraine and the growing humanitarian crisis. Let's turn our investment activity to Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform. We acquired land in 3 markets for organic development, including the first location for our joint venture with Brookfield in India, along with 2 parcels in Europe to support the strong demand in that region. After the quarter, we purchased 3 additional land parcels in Europe, including a beachhead in Barcelona, marking our organic entry into this complementary Mediterranean metro. Our active development pipeline reached an all-time high in the quarter with 44 projects underway supporting over 300 megawatts in of IT capacity in 28 metros around the world. 58% of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. We've expanded our development in the Americas, adding further capacity in New York, Northern Virginia and Toronto. Demand remains very strong in EMEA and we are continuing to invest across this region with active development projects in 17 of our 18 markets. Frankfurt is still the most active development market in EMEA, followed by Paris. We continue to make good progress toward closing the Teraco transaction which we still expect to close in the first half of this year. Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. We are also proactively managing risks to help insulate Digital Realty against the impact of the current inflationary and rising interest rate environment. We are well protected against the impact of rising energy costs given the pass-through nature of substantially all of our customer contracts and we are effectively managing against rising input costs through our vendor-managed inventory program and the expansion of our prepurchase equipment pool. We are constructively engaging with new and existing customers on the impact of rising costs which is translating into better pricing. This is partly reflected in the broad-based and improved cash leasing spreads we experienced in the first quarter but is also showing up in new lease transactions across most of our markets. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on Platform Digital. Our customers continue to solve the most complex IT infrastructure in activity and data integration challenges. We see a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on platform digital across multiple regions and metros globally. Recently, industry research firm, IDC, updated their global data sphere forecast for 2025, Predicting the annual data creation rate will exceed 180 zettabytes per year or roughly triple the '21 rate. IDC concludes that companies of all sizes will need to prioritize data sharing and security to improve business resiliency and create a differentiated experience for their customers. Earlier this week, we published our inaugural Global Data Insights survey with strategic insights from 7,200 companies across 23 countries and 9 industries about the role of data in their business agenda. According to the survey, 70% of these companies are prioritizing secure data exchange in their current plans. The global data survey will augment our Data Gravity Index to provide telemetry for our customers, partners and their respective industries as they evolve their business platforms to harness the power of data and co-located infrastructure to unlock a new era of growth through connected data communities. In addition, Digital Realty recently joined the iMasons Climate Accord as a founding member. This coalition of leading companies is united in their views on carbon reduction in digital infrastructure. The group will establish an independent governing body to define an open standard that provides transparency, traceability and measurement of progress toward reducing carbon from sourced power and embodied carbon found in materials, products and operations of digital infrastructure. This is another great example of our commitment to the continuous innovation and execution of our platform digital road map to provide a sustainable and differentiated value proposition for our customers, partners and the broader industry. Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $167 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the first quarter. This is our second consecutive quarterly record and the seventh time in the last 8 quarters we have delivered bookings over $100 million. While our new business was healthy across product types, larger deals accounted for 70% of the quarter's bookings, while sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 30% of the total. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. Demand was particularly strong in the Americas with Northern Virginia and Toronto leading the way. Fundamentals continue to tighten in both metros, as reflected by the high levels of pre-leasing on our development pipeline. In EMEA, Frankfurt remains the standout, while in APAC, demand remains robust in Singapore and Japan. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region, with most of those exports landing in EMEA followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. We landed 128 new logos during the first quarter, maintaining the momentum we have built over the last several quarters which has been a strong validation of Platform Digital and our global strategy. In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Zenlayer, a global edge cloud provider, is expanding on Platform Digital across 3 continents to improve its geographic coverage, scale and access to customer communities across various industries. A Global 2000 consumer financial services firm continue to expand with Digital Realty, leveraging Platform Digital's full suite of capabilities, including rationalizing data centers, implementing IT controls and interconnecting with key business communities. Box Technologies, a leading innovator of high-performance desktop-as-a-service applications, is deploying on Platform Digital, supporting enterprise data architecture applications, serving the manufacturing, construction and engineering industries. A leading IT company is leveraging our full product spectrum by utilizing our connectivity offerings to support data exchange across 3 metros in North America and Lat Am to improve performance and scalability and reduce costs. Magnite, a global independent advertising platform is expanding our platform digital in multiple metros across EMEA to enable their hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 reinsurer selected Platform Digital for mainframe migration with seamless connectivity to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced grew by 15% and from $378 million to a record $436 million, driven by the strong first quarter signings which outpaced commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated to 7 months with nearly 2/3 of our $436 million backlog scheduled to commence later this year. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $177 million of renewal leases during the first quarter at a positive 3.3% cash re-leasing spread. Renewal rates were positive across the board, were spread in the black across product types in all 3 regions. 2/3 of total renewals were sub-1-megawatt deals, resulting in a smaller sample size for the 1-plus megawatt category in the quarter. Excluding one larger short-term extension, our cash renewal spread would have been positive 2.5%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory on renewal spreads as well as constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, portfolio occupancy ticked down by 30 basis points sequentially, driven by previously reported churn events, most of which has already been re-leased. Consistent with our full year guidance, same capital cash NOI growth was negative 3.1% in the first quarter, primarily driven by 220 basis points of FX headwinds, the timing of no move-outs and a customer bankruptcy. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months and FX represented a 200 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 11. Our operations, along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 12. A little less than 60% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, followed by approximately 25% in euros and roughly 5% each in Singapore dollars and British pounds. In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy of matching duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in SOFR would have roughly a 75 basis point impact on full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share of $1.67 was flat on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Despite FX headwinds, a $0.01 impact related to a customer bankruptcy and a difficult comp due to the contribution of assets to digital core REIT. In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect the split between the first half of the year and the second half of the year to be approximately $49.51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect to dip down a couple of pennies in the second quarter due to normalized OpEx spending and near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction before bouncing back in the second half of the year as leases from a record backlog commenced. Most of the drivers underlying our guidance remain unchanged but given the improving pricing environment, we are bumping up our outlook for cash re-leasing spreads for the full year to slightly positive compared to flat last quarter. We are maintaining our existing core FFO per share range of $6.80 to $6.90 despite the customer bankruptcy and stiffer FX headwinds. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 250 to 300 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. We were active again in the capital markets during the first quarter. We took advantage of favorable OEM market conditions to lock in EUR 750 million at 1.375% for 10.5 years. And later in the quarter, we completed a dual tranche Swiss bond offering, raising a total of CHF 250 million at a blended coupon of approximately 1.25%. We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem 450 million of bonds at 4.75%. Reported leverage ratio is 6.3x while fixed charge coverage is 5.5x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the forward equity offering last September, our pro forma leverage ratio drops to 5.9x, while fixed charge coverage improves to 5.7x. We continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets. This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is over 6 years and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. A little over 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a fixed a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Jon Atkin : Two questions. I wanted to find out a little bit about the elevated demand and the record leasing. And I wondered how much of that you might attribute to in the greater than 1 megawatt category, any kind of a shift in the mix between building, self-building and leasing on the part of the hyperscalers. And then the second question around pricing, given higher costs and some of the developments that you mentioned, do you see this as really having the impact of protecting your target development yields given the higher cost or perhaps aiming to enhance your target yields? Bill Stein : Well, Corey will start off. Jon, thanks for the question on the ad product demand. I'll pick up hyperscale and I think Bill will tackle the second part of your question. Corey Dyer : Yes. So we'll be pretty comprehensive here with our answer to you, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. I would tell you that with regard to the enterprise demand, we've got customers that are just being driven to the business needs and opportunities that are in front of us. Bill mentioned earlier we just published our Global Data Insights survey with data becoming a critical agenda topic for all the businesses and it raised really 5 key things. Data was pervasive, it's the business agenda, it requires aggregation and control and it's localizing and it's a data first strategy's win. And so we're seeing that is really what's driving a lot of the demand across the enterprise. As far as where is it happening from a regional perspective, if you even want to do a baseball analogy, sometimes you guys ask, I'd say North America is probably middle innings with a healthy bullpen that you ought to have in it. And then, I'd tell you that EMEA is probably third inning, maybe anything behind APAC, a little behind that as customers are still really waking to the data opportunity that's right above all of us and it was really highlighted in the index that we just did in that survey. I'd also tell you that we had really strong exports across all regions which was great. And then we're seeing an uptick in all the multi-market and multi-region wins. So really happy with the enterprise. I'll let Andy give you a little bit of perspective on the hyperscalers. Andy Power : Thanks again, Jon. The -- I mean I think we've now had a several -- I think in the prepared remarks, 7 or 8 quarters north of $100 million of gap which speaks to consistent demand in the hyperscale being a major component of that. You had a record, call it -- in the fourth quarter, you had another record and these records, I'll call it, demonstrably higher than the prior, call it, $100 million averages. If your question about the self-build versus procuring through Digital Realty or other providers, I don't think the pendulum has swung to a point where the cell builds off the table. But I would think in times like today, when there's increased volatility, supply chain issues, a war in Eastern Europe, having a global platform to support hyperscaler growth across now 50 metropolitan areas in 26 countries, it's a tremendous value-add to our hyperscale customers. And I think their demand has been consistent for the last several quarters, with some peaks along the way and we see the forecast remaining quite strong as well. Bill Stein : Relative to pricing, Jon, pricing dynamics are clearly market specific and will depend on both supply and demand in each market. So when demand exceeds supply, we've been able to raise our prices. And this is reflected in our results. So for example, if you look at our first quarter leasing results in Northern Virginia, our average prices were about 6% higher than just last quarter in the fourth quarter. That market is increasingly tightening. We're also fortunate to be in a position where we're well insulated from the increased costs on our current development pipeline and that's because of our contracts with suppliers and our vendor managed inventory program. So -- and this has obviously helped us not just in terms of cost but to assure that we do have the supply to continue around the world. Jon Atkin : And then lastly, just on the bankruptcy filing from earlier in April that had some implications for digital core REIT and then kind of a letter of guarantee from you. This has been kind of going on for a couple of years but any sort of an update with respect to that customer and your direct exposure? Are they current on payments, what are you sort of anticipating with respect to that tenant? Andy Power : Sure. we'll give you an extra question here. So that customer from a current -- on receivables, they had a very modest amount of called pre-petition outstanding receivables. They were regularly current paying customer, not a late paying customer and they're fairly pretty well up to date, a couple of million, I would say and really concentrated in the U.K. was outstanding when they entered bankruptcy. Obviously, they're going to go through a process under U.K. administration, in the U.S. and also Canada. That will play out over several months. The -- I think if you take a step back, really what -- I think what's more relevant is that customer obviously got, call it, sideswiped by 2 particular issues. One, obviously, a part of their business what's not common in our customer base was disaster recovery for office which has obviously got impacted by the Zoom-ification during the pandemic; and then secondly, the elevated power prices, especially in Europe at incremental liquidity constraints. I don't see that as a really recurring theme in our customer base, especially the first piece of what I described. And this customer is going to obviously work through with this bankruptcy process. And I think we've been taking active steps not just related to this customer but in general, to continue to streamline and focus our portfolio on core assets that we have -- we see robust and long-term demand, multicustomer facilities, less single stand-alone facilities. And quite frankly, why we entered the colocation interconnection business several years ago was not only was the growth to our business but also to be prepared in the event that some of our colocation resellers ran into financial times and we had to step in and support their end customers only in the event that leases are rejected, obviously. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : So one follow-up and one question. So on the follow-up, when you're talking about leasing, can you unpack the opportunities to lease up the existing inventory? And how much of the bookings you're seeing go towards that and where occupancy on the existing portfolio can get over the next 12 to 24 months? And then just a second question, I think it's Page 20 in the supplemental, the same-store numbers. How does that look if you were to put that on a constant currency basis in terms of the rental performance on the revenue side? And how does that look over the next 12 months as you talked about the pricing opportunities and some of the positive renewals that you're seeing? Andy Power : Thanks, Michael. So let me try -- there's a couple of numbers questions in there. So let me start and try to get through some of those and then also hand off on the leasing question a little bit to Corey as well. So in reverse, in our earnings deck, we tried to provide both as reported and constant currency. And we also tried to show adjustments for apples and oranges in comparisons on a year-over-year basis. So you could see that the second set of bars on that chart has had our as reported same-store cash NOI down negative 3% which was in line with our guidance. On a constant currency basis, it's down 90 basis points. And the hit I just called out in terms of the bankruptcy customer, call it, $4 million, $5 million or whatever, that was -- I think it's about 60 -- almost 70 basis points of that negative 90. Those are all on an NOI basis. I apologize I don't have the revenue equivalent off the top of my head. That same pool is also getting impacted by a year-over-year elevated property taxes which we previously mentioned. And more importantly, we're re-leasing vacated capacity which I think dovetails with your first question. We've made a concerted effort to focus more and more of our leasing wherever possible and to already build infrastructure given the high flow-through of contribution of that revenue into that capacity and having an installed base that wants to expand with adjacency or grow in our campuses is always a little bit easier than going out and landing a new customer. In terms of the leasing into that capacity, if you basically just take the signed already in this quarter or last quarter or 2 that has not commenced to hit our occupancy and that would bring our same-store occupancy up about 80 basis points by itself, i.e., the leases are signed, they're just literally waiting for the customers to move in throughout the year. That obviously is going to flow through into our '22 results in a partial year period and then a full year period in '23. We are -- as I mentioned, we're very focused on re-leasing that vacant capacity. We're incentivizing wherever possible. And quite honestly, some of the supply-demand dynamics that are playing out industry-wide in addition to execution against our platform are really lending itself to fill that up at a more accelerated pace. I think we did about 20-plus megawatts into that type of vacated capacity, i.e., they weren't the first customer in that suite in the first quarter of this year. And that is a rapidly accelerated pace relative to, call it, prior year velocity. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : Just two, if I could. First, on some of the strength in hyperscale, I'm just wondering, it's beyond just 1Q. Are you sort of sensing any pull forward of demand from customers given looming concerns around supply chain constraints? Or do you sense that the strength here is more sustainable? And then just to go back to Michael's question also on one of the slides, Slide 11, I think you outlined core FFO per share growth on a normalized sort of constant currency basis this year would be north of 7%. I know, Andy, I think in the past, you've talked about mid- to high single core FFO per share growth on a forward basis. Just wondering, all else equal, as we start thinking about 2023, without giving specific guidance, is that sort of 7-ish percent rate that's on the Slide 22, a good sort of framework or start point to think about as we think beyond this year? Corey Dyer : Matt, this is Corey. I'll take the first 2 questions, I think, that you had, one being around the supply chain impacts and then also the hyperscale demand. I'll take them in that order, if that helps you out. And as Andy mentioned kind of at the beginning of the commentary, our sales and marketing engine just continues to build up our demand and our pipeline growth, right? And I would tell you that the supply chain, inflation, energy costs has not really been a factor in that. Our customers really are thinking through what they do and how they source those materials so that they're setting up their commencement dates ahead of it with us. So they're just being really thoughtful about it and thinking through these concerns. And what I think it's done is actually had us create better dialogue with our customers to think through how we're going to solve this and create probably a little bit more demand for us as they think through it but it hasn't negatively impacted it at all. As far as the hyperscale demand, we're really still experiencing really strong demand from the hyperscalers across all regions, right? They work with us to help their speed to market. We're with them increasingly around their business impairs around this data opportunity the CSPs are helping all the enterprises with. We're seeing larger deal sizes at CSPs as they work to keep up with demand. So we have a really healthy pipeline for the remainder of the year. And I'd also say there's probably a dozen or so of these CSPs and more of them emerging in Asia and across the board. It's also helping us increase our demand on our pipeline for it. So really happy with both of those and where we're seeing the trajectory. Andy Power : And then, Matt, on your second question, I mean we just reported the first 1 quarter of 2022. So obviously, not prepared to put 2023 guidance out just yet. But obviously -- but you can see on a constant currency basis, we're now north of 7% on the bottom line core FFO per share that extraordinary FX headwinds this year, if you look back the last several years, you had, call it, currency fluctuations in the, call it, 2 to 5 or so percent. And this year, the year, call it, soon to be like 9% delta. The headwinds -- or could be a tailwind, usually we're in the 50 to 75 basis points range. And now we're, call it, north of 200 basis points of headwinds. I think -- look, the goal from the beginning of the year as well as last year is to continue to accelerate bottom line's earnings growth. Last year, we came out of the gate with guidance of 4%. We ended up with 5%. This year, we came out with guidance of 5% which we are affirming in this call, despite these FX headwinds as well despite a customer bankruptcy. And our goal is to kind of again keep consistently putting up mid- to high single digits bottom line growth. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Andy, I wondered if you could just talk about the balance sheet a little bit. You talked about bringing the pro forma leverage down to 5.9x. How are you thinking about, given the sort of interest rate environment, the uncertainty? Where do you want to have that over the next few years? And I think you still have guidance for dispositions during the year. Again, how are you thinking about both the sizing of dispositions and what vehicles you might use for that? Andy Power : Thanks, Simon. So first and foremost, better to be lucky than smart. We are out of the gates with a sizable EUR 750 million bond literally the first, I think, business day of 2022 and priced 10.5-year paper in the 1-plus percent, call it, category. So pleased with that. Followed that up with even more volatile start of the year, a Swiss bond offering which, again, both of those, I think, diversifying our source of capital, increasing our FX hedge, locking in long-duration debt at attractive cost of capital. We also increased our revolving credit facility by an incremental $750-ish million during the quarter, just a full start of liquidity given the broader uncertainty in backdrop. We still have not drawn down or close to $1 billion equity forward just yet. We look to close on Teraco in the next couple of months or so, or actually probably a month or 2, I guess. And then back half of the year in terms of capital sources on the leverage side to again keep us in line in terms of our targeted net debt to EBITDA. We will obviously evaluate equity as an alternative but right now at these current levels, I think the continued disposition of noncore assets as well as incremental contributions of core assets from our portfolio to digital core REIT in the back half of the year are going to be our primary funding mechanisms. And we made some great progress, obviously getting Digital Realty through its first earnings season and also working on identifying that next leg of assets to continue to grow and diversify and strengthen Digital Realty. Simon Flannery : Great. And how do you -- how are you seeing these sort of M&A multiples given the interest rate environment? Any change there? Greg Wright : Yes. Simon, it's Greg. Look, to date, I'd say the private market seems to be lagging the public markets a little bit and I don't think that's uncommon. I think the public markets usually lead. But look, I think if rates stay up over time, you should start to see multiples come down. But right now, we see a lot of stuff out there but it feels as though the private market multiples have been a little sticky high at this point. Operator : Our next question will come from Eric Rasmussen with Stifel. Erik Rasmussen : So we've heard some very large deals in the first quarter. What's changed in the market that would lead to these massive deals? And then maybe with that, how do you plan for this? Andy Power : Eric, I think -- I assume you're seeing large leases, large multiple megawatt leases. I mean -- I think the theme -- the growth in the sizing of customer requirements on the hyperscale front has been building for some time, not necessarily a completely overnight phenomenon. And I think you witnessed in the first quarter this year or the fourth quarter of last year, other quarters of last year and the year prior. I think you guys are seeing this continued cloud adoption broadly, continued opening of new regions, opening an offering of new services. And you're seeing this digital transformation wave in the cloud customers despite the volatility and the uncertainty of an economic backdrop or the war and the like leaning in and securing infrastructure to future-proof their runway for their end customers. So, it doesn't feel like the -- one record quarter after another is a little bit of an unusual outcome. But it doesn't feel like the pace of demand is really slowing on the hyperscale front. And I think what's also helped in that backdrop of this continuing steady demand, it's just become more challenging to be a provider. You have the inflationary pressures, you have supply chain challenges, you have labor challenges and you even have moratoriums in certain parts of the world see some demand. And I think going to the part of how do you get ahead of this is that you'd be in this business for the long run, with Digital Realty been in this business for almost 20 years. You build a scale and capital sources to support our customers through good times and bad. You make sure you have the runway to future-proof their growth. That's the acres and acres of often contiguous expansion capacity. You secure your supply chains so that you're on time and under budget, wherever possible and be that trusted infrastructure partner. I think those are the key ingredients to our recipe. Erik Rasmussen : Great. And then maybe just my second question. As it relates to the development pipeline which is very active, besides the chip shortages, what's happening on the construction side, whether it's getting the right materials or having the proper staffing, especially considering the demand backdrop and maybe even increased competition in some markets that you might be seeing. Chris Sharp : Yes. No. Thanks, Eric. This is Chris. Yes, it's something that we've been constantly looking at. And just to echo Andy's comments a little bit earlier, we've always looked at long-term engagements with our construction teams and with our suppliers. And so the continued development pipeline that we've been putting to market, it's really paid off, right, where we keep the same crews on the projects and we roll into new projects and just watching how that grows. I'd also say we have the gold standard in VMI, vendor-managed inventory, for building out a lot of this infrastructure. So even before some of the supply constraints hit us, we started ramping up the budgets for that. And I think one of the other great things with being with digital is we've been able to expand the program to be able to support our customer needs. And so now it's become a differentiator in the market where we're now able to provide customer -- some customer equipment to help them procure their infrastructure. And so it's just something that we've been able to plan ahead of and we're constantly looking at different routes to market with, particularly the chip shortages and things like that, looking at the secondary markets, where leveraging a lot of secondary equipment that's been refurbished and put a warranty against it. It's been able to allow a lot of customers to overcome some of those challenges. But it's something we're constantly watching and looking at and making sure that we have the best capabilities and, quite frankly, equipment infrastructure available to our customers and for our own builds on a global basis. So that's something that we're very proud about. Operator : Our next question will come from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Curious about your development pipeline. It looks like you're almost 60% pre-leased across the entire globe and over 80% in North America. So are you fairly comfortable with your inventory position today? Or if we do see a continuation of this large hyperscale demand, might you end up toward the higher end or even above the development CapEx guide you laid out? Andy Power : Thanks, Eric. I mean that is obviously a constantly evolving schedule where we're adding projects in terms of new starts and we're subtracting projects that are delivering and being commissioned for customers and opening at high levels of pre-leasing. It's a combination of offices or colocation product as well as our scale and hyperscale dedicated data halls. We're trying to always stay ahead of the game, focusing on the longest lead time parts of development. Obviously, land procurement, hence the acreage I mentioned previously, followed by shelves. And then Chris just touched on our, call it, overall infrastructure and build-outs. I don't -- I think when you look at the combination of our current stabilized portfolio that has availability that we're actively leasing into our shelves and their delivery schedules and as well as our land, I feel good. There's always a market or 2 that will be a little tighter than I would like but I feel I think probably more in terms of the hyperscale front that these larger deals, you're often engaging in contracting at very early stages of those projects. So you don't need to necessarily have a finished data hall in order to sell that capacity, hence having that land bank and shelves coming online are very good selling tools by themselves. Eric Luebchow : And just 1 follow-up on the renewal spreads on mark-to-market. Do you think we're at the point now where those should continue to only improve after this year? And how much of that might be due to just improving the broadly improving pricing environment or perhaps a kind of better mix of leases in the next couple of years, either more international, more enterprise and fewer above-market leases? Andy Power : Yes. So we've obviously been working through this for some time. I would say, over the last several quarters, the -- call it, the mix was certainly helping us as we've kind of chopped through some of our largest customers, major expirations, as we got through more of the North America and more -- onto more international mix, having the less than a megawatt more highly connected destinations, legacy interaction, Westin, Telx, etcetera, being more -- a bigger piece of the puzzle. And last year, we came in a little bit better than we had guidance but albeit negative. This year, we guided to flat which is a year-over-year sequential improvement. And I think what you're seeing in this quarter are a few things. On the one hand, I'm not -- I wouldn't say that I can rule out that we'll never have a negative cash mark-to-market on any given product for the next several quarters. I don't think we're at that level of positive yet. But you saw positive across the board in the plus less than a megawatt categories. It was -- in the less than a megawatt which is the largest piece of it, it was up versus the LTM, about 130 basis points, cut north of 2.5% which is a pretty sizable move. And we've guided now for the full portfolio for 2022, slightly positive. So again, not -- I can't tell you we're fully done with never having a negative cash mark-to-market but the trend is certainly playing out which I would say is a combination of mix and also the broader pricing ratch up where the pendulum of pricing is swinging slightly more and more back to Digital Realty. Operator : Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Unidentified Analyst : This is Rob [ph] on for Frank. Where did you guys end the quarter on a quote of varying heads? And have you seen any hiring issues in sales or across any other parts of the business to help maintain growth? Corey Dyer : We've got about 130 quota-bearing head. If you think about all the sellers we really have, there's more than that after you get to it because we've got a whole team of SAs and SEs, all of our management team. I'm here looking at it. So it puts us closer to, I'd say, effectively more like 200 when you get to that point. But yes, we're seeing it do really well and we're excited about the team and how they're performing and how they're engaging with our customers. I'm sorry, was there another follow up? Andy Power : I think the hiring and ability to hire for that opportunity. Corey Dyer : Yes. And so we've been able to hire. And we've -- I think when you look at salespeople and they think about where they're going to come and can we hire them, they look at where are you going to have the most prospects going forward. And the differentiated value that we have with our global platform -- and I would tell you that we're really kind of pulling away from the competition. There's probably 2 of us out there. So, if you're in the data center business or if you're in the internet -- networking business and you want to be successful as a salesperson, this is a great place to be, right? Team's making more money. We're being successful. And I think they look forward in that kind of standpoint. Sorry, I didn't understand the rest of the question but that's about where we are on it and really happy with it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from David Guarino with Green Street. David Guarino : Bill, maybe going back to that comment you made earlier, it was really helpful on Nova going up 6% on the rental rate. Did you clarify if that was on renewal or new leases? And assuming it is on new leasing, I just wanted to talk on that healthy pricing environment. Do you think it's just a temporary boost for the sector given we've got this lack of leasable capacity? Or would you say we've truly turned a corner and rental rates are going to start trending higher from here on out? Andy Power : David, maybe help just clarify numbers. That was not a cash mark-to-market. That was the like-for-like new rates. So showing progress in the overall market rates and trying to do it as best we could as apples-to-apples in terms of size of deal, all the nuances that go into the deal. I was little -- just down in the market a week ago. And that market is overall experience incredibly robust and continuous demand. And we've done quite well, I can tell you, more than our fair share in that market not just in the last quarter but over several quarters. And that, combined with just overall constraints on bringing on capacity in that market, running up on ability to get power, permitting and the like, I think it's all going to continue to trend in a more positive territory or in terms of healthier rates in that market. If you look at our just one last data point on that, our operating portfolio in that market is, call it, 91 something in the sub but that's missing some leases that have signed but not commenced. If you include that, we're like 94% leased on the operating portfolio. And then I think I have 16 out of 86 megawatts left in terms of -- that's not leased that's under construction. We're basically down to, I think, 1 or 2 more buildings in the legacy 3 digital DFT and lab campus and are already moving on to our, call it, Western lands or digital Dulles location for our next layer of growth. David Guarino : That's helpful. And I guess the kind of the gist of the question really is we've had these periods historically in the sector where demand goes lumpy for certain periods. And just kind of curious, if that happens again, if we kind of don't repeat this record new levels of industry-wide leasing activity, do you think we resume to downward pressure on asking rents, I guess? I just want to get your perspective on if this is a temporary phenomenon we're seeing this quarter and last quarter? Andy Power : It feels to me like the lumpiness has subsided. I mean you looked at our quarterly leasing stats for several quarters. It's just been more diverse and more consistent. And based on the last few quarters of demand kind of combined with the broader supply backdrop dynamic, it doesn't feel like there's a -- I feels like the rates are going to be nowhere near peak rates yet. So we got a long way to run back to peak rates but still, I think marching in a more positive trajectory for some time to come. Operator : Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is Alex [ph] on for Dave. Andy, maybe just my first one here. I think last quarter, you noted the Teraco acquisition was going to give around a partial year contribution of $100 million in revenues and $70 million in EBITDA. Just wanted to double-check to see if there are any updates there and just confirm that that's already baked in the guidance? And then secondly, I know we've kind of touched on global M&A before but just kind of thinking about the state of the market and any specific geographies of interest. Andy Power : On the Teraco, I don't think there's any updates. We're still in the same vicinity of closing time period and there's been no change to our underwriting numbers since we announced. I don't -- let us follow up online to triple-check confirm those numbers with you with your model just to make sure because I don't recall what I exactly said a call ago on those numbers in terms of a partial calendar year contribution. And then your second question, Alex, was that about leasing or M&A? I just want to make sure -- you said the geos. I just want to make sure... Unidentified Analyst : M&A. Greg Wright : Yes. Alex, it's Greg. Look, I think you asked what the state of the M&A, global M&A market is. And like, I would say, it remains robust right now. There's a lot of private capital chasing deals. We've read about them. You see deals still occurring. As I mentioned earlier, multiples are -- have been sticky high on these transactions. But with that said, there is a lot of private capital and I think you're starting to see these private investors, the infrastructure funds and the like and others starting to see the quality of the asset class, whether it's the credit readiness of the customer, the quality of the assets and the growth prospects of the business. It really feels like it's starting to become more of a core investment asset class relative to some others. There's actually been somewhat of a shift there. In terms of our strategy, our strategy, I would say, this quarter is probably best representative of how we're looking at it and where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. You heard Andy and Corey talked about supply proofing but we went into 2 new markets through land purchases, 1 in Chennai, 1 in Barcelona this quarter. And then we backfilled the supply proof markets in Zurich, in Paris, in Frankfurt and in Dublin. And if you look at all that together, you're talking about 385 megawatts of total developable capacity. So when we look at that and look at it on a risk-adjusted basis, we think that's the right place for us. But in terms of geographies, I mean, look, we're still looking to selectively backfill in certain areas of Eastern Europe. As we've said previously, we are still working to expand our footprint in APAC and selectively backfill in the Americas. So that's basically how we're thinking about it. Operator : Our next question will come from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : Just going back to the same-store NOI growth, it was down 3% in the quarter end. It sounds like the trends are supportive of improvement. But the full year guidance suggests that it kind of remains in this down 3% range for the remainder of the year. Is that just FX? Or is there something else at play? Andy Power : Well, obviously the FX has gone against our favor for the year but we've had some success in the first quarter relative to our budget a little bit on the OpEx side but we are absorbing a customer -- a bankruptcy which is going to be in your headwind to that. Hence, we're holding our guidance for same-store cash NOI for the year. Aryeh Klein : Got it. And maybe I missed it but the bankruptcy, is that in the FFO outlook? And what's the impact from that, if it is? Andy Power : Bankruptcy, aside from a, call it, noncore straight-line right add back that's not in core FFO, we basically already absorbed about almost $4 million of a hit for the first quarter due to, call it, pre-petition receivables which I mentioned earlier on the call. And then, we've made an assumption as to additional, call it, $6 million of headwind for the remainder of the year because quite honestly, we're kind of just handicapping the outcome of events because the customer is obviously going to go through the court process and either accept or reject leases. The last time this go around, I think almost all of the leases were accepted. I'm not sure or that will be the case this go around. And then there's the scenarios as to if a lease is rejected and their end customers could be essentially absorbed by Digital Realty. So $6 million of incremental and on top of the $4 million, taken in the first quarter is our essentially hit or adjustment due to the bankruptcy for the year. Operator : Our next question will come from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Irvin Liu : Just one for me. Maybe Andy can answer this. I wanted to ask about the FX spot rate movement. You mentioned that bonds denominated in local currencies act as a natural profit hedge. And we do see this reflected on Slide 11. There's a 3-point revenue headwind but only a 2.3-point FFO headwind. Historically, is there any way to think about how well local currency denominated bonds offset some of these FX headwinds for FFO? And would you consider any durative instruments looking ahead to help you smooth out some of these headwinds? Andy Power : Sure. Thanks, Irvin. So I mean -- and I'm sorry to play the record again because I wanted to touch on this and I think I hit it on one of the QA. If you look historically, the last 3 years, our business has been roughly 40% international. And prior to this year, the headwinds or tailwinds, because it doesn't always go against you or, call it, in the 50 to 75 basis points, call it, vicinity with much less volatility than we're seeing this year. Essentially, with these not -- by issuing non-U.S. dollar financings be it euro or Swiss francs or sterlings or our multicurrency revolver are going to natural lending sources, often the long durations and essentially creating asset liabilities through the bonds but also cash flow liabilities to offset the euros we received from revenue or the pounds we received from revenue. Given we invested development returns of 9 to 12 or so percent and the rates are so modest right now, there's a leakage. We've been migrating more and more of our debt to be non-U.S. dollars. I think 75% of it is non-U.S. dollars today because 100% of our equity is U.S. dollars and 100% of our common dividends are in U.S. dollars. So we have that natural match for our U.S. dollar hedge. I've always been a big fan of this approach because it allows to, call it, have multiple benefits to the strategy of tapping diverse capital sources at attractive rates and create a natural FX hedge. It obviously does not provide 100% P&L volatility elimination. We are continuing to become more international. We are continuing to, in smaller amounts, going to a slightly more volatile markets in terms of currencies, be it Latin America or Africa. So I would say we're not -- our ears are always open to good ideas and we'll continue to evolve our thinking if a time comes to look at incremental types of foreign currency derivatives to further eliminate any P&L volatility from the FX. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead. Bill Stein : Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. Our value proposition is clearly resonating with customers. We posted our second straight record bookings quarter with $167 million of annualized rent while attracting 128 new logos. Our sales momentum is exceedingly strong and the benefits of Platform Digital continue to grow. Digital Realty's operational excellence is second to none and customers are relying on us to solve their needs for data center solutions today while providing a clear path for their expanded needs tomorrow. Our customers trust us with their mission-critical application and digital delivers. We're continuing to extend our global platform. In early January, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Teraco to establish Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Africa by positioning ourselves at key points of interconnection and subsea cable landing locations. We are also expanding organically with over 300 megawatts of new capacity under development. We posted strong core FFO per share results exceeding consensus estimates despite foreign exchange and other headwinds against us. We maintained our core FFO per share guidance for the year and our constant currency core FFO per share forecast represents more than 7% year-over-year growth. Last but not least, we remain very adept at sourcing attractive capital, raising over $1 billion of European debt at a blended 1.3% coupon and weighted average term of 9 years while redeeming higher cost U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter. I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world turning. I hope you all are safe and healthy and we hope to see many of you again in NAREIT and other in-person events. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, the overarching trend of digital transformation remains a secular driver for our business, which was highlighted by yet another quarter of greater than $110 million of bookings and over a 100 new logos added, which was well diversified in terms of product [and GO]. Second, the improved re-leasing spreads we saw last quarter continued in 2Q, and we remain focused on offsetting the impacts of rising costs throughout our pipeline of new opportunity and development; third, our transformation into a leading global data center solution provider remains on track with our investment in Teraco expected to close within the next two weeks; and finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus for the quarter, though we tempered our expectations for the second half and full year 2022, principally due to continued FX headwinds as we reaffirmed our constant currency core FFO per share guidance for 2022. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein. Bill Stein : Thank you, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty is levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data. We have an unmatched global operating footprint along with a strong development pipeline continue to deepen and expand that footprint to meet our customers' growing needs. Those customers are a growing community of more than 4,000 organizations across the globe, including the world's largest cloud service providers, communication providers that enable the global transport of data, Global 2000 enterprises as well as many multinational and industry-leading companies. Our second quarter results were strong with $113 million of new bookings and core FFO per share of $1.72, a 12% increase over the second quarter of last year and a 3% sequential increase, despite stiff FX headwinds. The dialogue with our customers surrounding the evolving supply-demand dynamic and our compelling value proposition has started to translate with price increases driving positive cash renewals, supporting our push for appropriate rent escalators and helping to maintain stable development returns. Despite generally higher prices, demand for data center solutions remains strong around the world with notable productivity in each of our regions. EMEA was a standout this quarter with all 5 of our largest deals landing in the region as the world's leading cloud service providers continued to utilize our platform to expand their infrastructure and support their growing needs. Looking forward, our pipeline remains robust as enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture, while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world. Andy will provide more color on our results shortly. But first, I want to touch on the recent launch of ServiceFabric Connect, an open interconnection solution and orchestration platform designed to support the wider industry shift to a hybrid data-centric architecture. This product launch empowers our enterprise and service provider customers to connect to anyone, anywhere at any time through an open and neutral digital marketplace. ServiceFabric Connect is the first of several related interconnection-oriented products that we have on our roadmap and was launched with availability in over 30 markets around the world. We are excited to bring this product to life, and we look forward to delivering these enhanced connectivity benefits to our customers. Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform through a combination of organic new market entries that enhance our global productivity offerings as well as existing market expansions that are designed to meet our customers' longer-term capacity and connectivity solution requirements. Along these lines, in the second quarter, we acquired land in three European markets for ground-up development to support strong demand. In addition, we announced our entry into Israel with the formation of a joint venture with Mivne, a leading Israeli real estate group. Together, we plan to develop a data center campus in Petah Tikvah, the primary connectivity hub in Israel. Our presence in Israel will complement our facilities across the Mediterranean and will support the emergence of new connectivity routes that subsea cable operators are developing between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Finally, we have received the necessary regulatory approval in South Africa to close on the acquisition of Teraco, a leading colocation and interconnection provider in South Africa. We now expect to close the transaction within the next two weeks. Our active development pipeline remains robust and grew by more than 10% sequentially with 41 projects underway, supporting over 360 megawatts of IT capacity in 18 strategically important metros around the world. More than half of this capacity is already presold, reflecting strong customer demand. Given the dynamism of the current environment, we know how important it is to make sure that we are being appropriately compensated for the elevated risk throughout the capital markets and the broader economy. We have sought to mitigate these risks through our VMI program, appropriate pricing adjustments and CPI-based rent escalators that help insulate us from the impact of higher operating costs throughout the life of our customer contracts. Finally, as we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on opportunistically culling our portfolio. Since the end of 2019, we have monetized over $4 billion of assets through a combination of outright sales, joint ventures, and more recently, through the contributions to our Singaporean Capital Partner Digital Core REIT. We view these sales and contributions as an important source of capital raising as we continue to expand our diverse global portfolio and accelerate our growth. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to highlight an important update to our Board and then discuss the success we\u2019re having with other ESG initiatives shown on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. In June, Mary Hogan Preusse, a 30-year REIT industry veteran was named Chairman of the Board, succeeding Laurence Chapman. Mary has served on our Board since 2017 and has played a critical role in driving Digital Realty's expansion and innovation as we have pursued our transformation to being a global full spectrum data center provider. We are fortunate that Laurence will continue to serve on our Board of Directors to provide his deep well of experience, understanding and leadership. Mary's appointment aligns with Digital Realty's commitment to strong governance, our focus on sustainability and the aim to balance fresh thinking with experience and continuity. I look forward to working with Mary in her new role. We also continue to advance the ball towards our sustainability goals in the second quarter. In addition to publishing our fourth annual ESG report, we became the first data center operator to achieve the milestone of 1 gigawatt of sustainably certified data center capacity. We also further expanded our renewable portfolio in the U.S. by contracting for 158 megawatts of new solar energy before the recent run-up in power prices, supporting our data centers in California and Georgia. Globally, 119 of our data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andy Power : Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. As Bill noted, we signed total bookings of $113 million with a $12 million contribution from interconnection during the second quarter. New business was healthy across product types as sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 42% of the quarter's bookings, while deals larger than a megawatt accounted for 57% of this quarter's bookings. The weighted average lease term on new leases was more than 7 years. EMEA accounted for well over half of this quarter's new business as Frankfurt continued to set the pace in the region, while Paris was also a meaningful contributor. Leasing was also geographically broad based during the quarter with significant contributions from Northern Virginia, Athens, Zurich, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York, Dublin and Amsterdam. Reflecting the strength of demand from our customers, we grew the size of our development pipeline to more than 360 megawatts under construction as we started over 100 megawatts of new projects in EMEA and North America, including 35 megawatts in Frankfurt and 38 megawatts in Paris. Nearly 1/3 of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, reflecting the value customers realize from our global platform. North America was the most common export region with most of those exports landing in EMEA, followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America. During the second quarter, we added another 108 new customers, bringing the total to more than 1,000 new logos since closing the Interxion transaction a little over two years ago. We see a growing trend of multinational companies deploying and connecting large private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. In terms of specific customer wins during the quarter, a leading IT service provider has experienced the full range of benefits of PlatformDIGITAL from greater performance and scalability to cost savings. These customers expanded their capabilities across three metros in two geographic regions, emphasizing hybrid IT by integrating bare metal and cloud storage. Two leading Global 2000 financial services firms chose PlatformDIGITAL for multi-set deployments in multiple metros across North America and Asia Pacific. One of the world's leading video game developers is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to access our global footprint, scalability and low latency performance. A Global 2000 reinsurer is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL with full-spectrum benefits from the strong community to top cloud providers and robust security being key drivers. And a life sciences organization is switching to PlatformDIGITAL in two markets across North America to reduce network costs while implementing artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications. Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases, tapered $393 million by quarter end as record level of commenced leases outpaced new signings. A lag between signings and commencements moved up to 13 months due to one larger signing into a new campus development in Frankfurt. Excluding that lease, the sign of commencement period was more in line with our recent experience of about eight months. Moving on to Page 10. We signed $173 million of renewal leases during the second quarter at a positive 3.4% cash re-leasing spreads compared to 3.3% positive last quarter. Renewal rates were positive in each product segment and also in each of our three regions. The majority of total renewals were sub-1 megawatt deals, reflecting the higher unit price contracts that are characteristic of that segment. These renewals climbed by 3% during the second quarter. Among larger deals, rates increased by 1.1%. We are encouraged by the positive trajectory of renewal spreads as well as our constructive engagement with customers on the current inflationary environment and our highly compelling value proposition. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 60 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements from our record backlog. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base who continue to solve for complex IT infrastructure, connectivity and data integration challenges. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 5.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a 400 basis point FX headwind in the last leg of a previously discussed sizable churn event. Most of this space has already been re-leased and will more fully commence over the next several quarters, which should drive an improved trend in revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. 57% of our second quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars with 22% in euros, and 7% in Singapore dollars, 6% British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. We have also actively mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt or longer-term fixed-rate financing. Turning back to currency. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last several months, and FX represented a 400 basis point to 450 basis point drag on year-over-year growth in our second quarter reported results from a top to the bottom line, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 12. As we've highlighted in the past, currency fluctuations has more typically served as a 50 basis point to 100 basis point headwind or tailwind to earnings in periods of lower volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our $4 billion-plus development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations and our investment pipeline along with our capital funding and locally denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. Of course, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with the heightened FX volatility, we will continue to evaluate our hedging strategy on an ongoing basis. In terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share of $1.72 was 12% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% higher sequentially, despite increased FX headwinds. The outperformance versus our prior expectations for the quarter was principally a function of lower-than-expected OpEx spend and a short delay in the closing of the Teraco transaction. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiffer than expected FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. As you can see from the bridge chart on Page 13, we expect FFO will dip down a couple of pennies in the third quarter, principally due to FX, but also as a result of the delayed normalization of OpEx spend, near-term dilution from closing the Teraco transaction and higher interest rates. Accordingly, we have adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions that remain under pressure from foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.75 to $6.85, reflecting a $0.05 per share adjustment at the low and high end of the range. Importantly, we are reaffirming our constant currency core FFO per share range of $6.95 to $7.05 for 2022. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, we expect currency headwinds could represent a 300 basis point to 400 basis point drag on full year 2022 revenue and core FFO per share growth. Lastly, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 14. Our reported leverage ticked down to 6.2x as of June 30, while fixed charge coverage increased to 6.0x. Adjusting for the proceeds from the last September's forward equity offering, our pro forma leverage drops to 5.8x, while fixed charge coverage improved to 6.2x. We remain focused on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from the pack and enables us to prudently fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 15, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.2%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 15, we have modest near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered maturity schedule for the foreseeable future. Our balance sheet is poised to weather the storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : First of all, just curious on what your pipeline looks like in terms of hyperscale. I know you saw a tremendous amount of absorption in Q1. It was a little bit lighter, especially in the U.S. in Q2. Now any sense at all the large cloud operators are pulling back after a few record leasing quarters? Or is this just the natural ebbs and flows of the market maybe related to a slightly more limited inventory you had in some of your key markets? Corey Dyer : Yes. So Eric, this is Corey. Just responding to you. Thanks for the question. And I would tell you that our hyperscale demand and our bookings this quarter were really strong, especially across Europe. Really solid bookings across North America as well as Tokyo with hyperscale, and we haven't really seen a slowdown in it. Going forward, from our pipeline, our pipeline broadly is really strong. It's the highest we've ever had across all of our segments, including hyperscale. So we feel really good about where we are. They're continuing just to take advantage of the offering that we offer them. They're across -- they're with us across about 40 different markets, really utilizing us for the connectivity, the enterprise customers that we have and really taking advantage of our platform on an ongoing basis. So no real slowdown that I see so far. Andy? Andy Power : No... Corey Dyer : Sorry, Andy. Andy Power : Sorry, go ahead, please. Eric Luebchow : I was just going to ask a separate question. So something that we heard about recently were some challenges about power supply for new construction at Ashburn. Some news reports that has been severely restricted by the local utility. So I'm just wondering if that's having any impact at all in your ability to build new capacity, particularly at the Western Lands campus in Ashburn or if you feel relatively insulated based on perhaps precommitments for power generation. And then separately, I think we've heard some comments from Bill that maybe you're working with some hyperscalers at that campus to plan some deals. So perhaps, an update as to what the sales funnel looks like in Northern Virginia specifically. Andy Power : Sure, Eric. So the only thing I was going to add on, and sorry for interruption. Corey's first piece is that the -- if you look at the plus the megawatt signings were most of the hyperscale larger deals land. We did north of 50 megawatts. I think our largest deal is 10 megawatts. We had two around 5 each. So then you had, call it, 30 megawatts of, call it, 1 to 4 megawatts in size, including new landings and expansions from a diverse group of those hyperscalers. So that was the only data point I was going to add to that first question. On your second question, Eric, I would say, you definitely got the scoop in terms of something that's certainly very recently breaking. So I'll try to provide a little context and as well to answer your question. Dominion Energy, which is the primary power provider in that market, informed its major customers very recently regarding the call a potential pinch point in Eastern Loudoun County that could delay deliveries until 2026. So a little fair bit out there. The cause has been described to me as transmission, not generation, i.e. the pipes or the power line infrastructure, not the actual power. The power company did not give definitive answers to most of the relevant questions we and I would think you and others on this call would probably have, but they have been transparent about the potential issue, and they're working very diligently to finalize their assessment and then ultimately communicate their findings. What this means -- I mean while we're still obviously handicapping the potential outcomes, but net-net, if this is to come to fruition as we recently learned, it will obviously likely be a slowdown in delivery of new supply in what is our largest and the largest and most consistently in demand data center market in the world. So I see two possible outcomes there : one being called just a sense of greater pricing power and higher rates tied to the sharp reduction of near-term availability, which should be favorable to Digital given our standing in market; and then also likely to be potentially some winners and losers as it relates to the various developers, including Digital seeking to bring new inventory online in that market. We have -- you kind of go through the rundown of our footprint, call it, 40 megawatts available. You can see in our 500 megawatts of IT load operational as of 2Q. We also then have, call it, 50 megawatts was our last building on that legacy Loudoun campus. I think it's building all in the alphabet that I would say feels like on the lower risk of having an issue. But again, this is very new and subject to change. We have another 200 megawatts on our Manassas campus, which given its position in that market seems on the lower risk side. And then we do have, call it, based on a substation that's already built about 200 megawatts on that Digital Dallas aka Western Lands, call it 1 plus gigawatt site that is called. We got to figure out how that's going to play out in terms of delivery and time line, but I do like our odds, if any, given that we have a sitting substation already there. The steel has been erected, the capital is deployed. Net-net, given our activity in that market, only 24 megawatts of what I just mentioned other than the 40 available would deliver by the fourth quarter of '23, just normal timeline. So I don't see this as a huge impact to '23. And then last but not least, I mean, given other than the tighter market fundamentals, I mean I do like our odds here relative to the competitive set in North Virginia. I mean we're the largest provider of consistently operating with Dominion. We have substations and power infrastructure already built on our campuses, as I mentioned. And I think we are a very important player in that market to help the power company address this problem given our strategically important land parcels and easement. So sorry for the long-winded response, but I didn't feel that, that top would need some clarity given you've kind of just broke that news just yesterday, the day before. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : So first on pricing. It sounds like it's been an incrementally positive story just based on some of the recent commentary you've been hearing. So I'm just wondering if maybe you can elaborate on what you're seeing on the pricing front across regions. And then also on demand, I know -- I think Corey referenced very strong demand. I'm just wondering, in light of maybe some elevated concern around a potential macro downturn, any regions, any verticals where you may have seen or started to see any sort of moderation in terms of demand from your customers? Andy Power : Obviously, those things are linked, Matt. So maybe I'll have Corey speak to demand first, and then I can tackle the pricing topic. Corey Dyer : Yes, Matt, thanks. As far as demand, I mentioned hyperscaler demand earlier. Our demand across the board is really good. We've got it across all four -- all of our regions. I mentioned -- I think Andy mentioned in the prepared remarks, the demand across EMEA that was our largest landing spot for our business. Our pipeline is the highest pipeline I've ever had, and that's on top of a couple of years of huge growth in pipeline and in the business. So we feel really good about where the demand is and where the pipeline is. Enterprise customers are continuing to take advantage of PlatformDIGITAL, make use of the data gravity opportunity in front of them. And I feel like in a hybrid IT world, we're probably the best position to help them do that. And so we've seen our demand just grow across the board, enterprises across all regions and hyperscaler as well. If you look at the sub 1 megawatt, which is your colocation interconnection, that was our third highest quarter ever, right on the back of 2 of our highest quarters ever. So I feel really good about the demand. Andy Power : And then, Matt, on your second question as it relates to pricing, I mean I would say, the commentary is fairly consistent with what Bill and I shared at the NAREIT conference, call it, early June. 2022, on the backs of, call it, us executing on the business and strengthening our value proposition with pricing power accrued to for several years, 2022 has started off -- or the first half, it's certainly been a called pendulum shifting dynamic. The demand has remained robust. Our value proposition is certainly resonating with what you've seen in the results and the pace of inventories had a challenge keeping up with it. And -- but what I just relayed on Loudoun County is called just one of the examples, but there's been others throughout the year as well. And that has allowed us to essentially move our list rates up numerous times, starting at the very end of 2021 through 2022, executed at higher rates across both our larger footprint and small footprint. Push rates on our renewal contracts, which last quarter, we had positive cash mark-to-markets certainly inflection on our cash mark-to-markets. We raised our guidance for the full year, and we followed with a second quarter of cash mark-to-markets as well. And I would say, all these things kind of flow through the entire, call it, commercial engagement with the customers to escalators and other provisions. So pricing has been moving in our favor in the first half of 2022. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Michael Bilerman : Andy, I wanted to talk just a little bit about foreign exchange. As a U.S. dividend payer, obviously, you have to be mindful. And when I -- you're talking about obviously not repatriating a lot of income, not foreign income because you're reinvesting it. I guess just stepping back, how do you sort of think about being a U.S. dividend payer and being a global company with global flows? And you talked about other hedging techniques, and I want to know how much of that just simply borrowing more in foreign currency, putting more currency swap hedges in place versus thinking about other potential structures. And I recognize you did the REIT, but you did that with U.S. assets. I don't know if you're thinking about doing more localized. And so maybe if you can just expand a little bit more on that hedging comment. Andy Power : Sure. Thanks, Michael. So I mean -- and we touched a little bit on this in the script. We've followed this playbook that you've somewhat summarized to your -- I mean often when we go into more volatile parts of the world like Latin America, we do partnerships. So we're not -- our equity is not entirely at risk. We also -- I've put a disproportionate amount of our debt in non-U.S. dollar financings, hitting the Eurobond, Swiss bond, Sterling bond. We have now called close to $4 billion in multicurrency revolver commitments. And so given that -- with that mismatch, you said of having a U.S. stock price in U.S. listed or U.S. currency dividends put more and more, call it, accessing diverse sources of capital and creating natural FX hedges along the way. At the same time, given the rate of return that we're investing relative to at least in more recent history has been very low rates in a lot of these currencies. There has been called cash flow or CFFO leakage. The point I was trying to highlight in the script, and this year, the volatility is just off the charts. I mean the year ago, the parity with the dollar is the highest it's been in several years. And certainly, it's created a headwind to our P&L or core FFO per share. But those same euros that got deflated in our P&L in 2022. We're also going into the ground with Europe being our largest development as part of the portfolio with 221 of our megawatts under construction across the continent or in London. So that is typically in our playbook. We've not followed some others in terms of, call it, just P&L hedging, which is really transacting with foreign currency derivatives to call it take out volatility, and that's been what we've done to date. Now I've also said in the prepared remarks, we're becoming a much more global company. There's no question of that. Call it, 50-plus metros, 27 countries, six continents, and we're in a -- certainly, and not in a long time heightened volatility to currency situation. So I think we're always open to good new ideas and something we'll consider in terms of adding to that FX playbook with various types of derivatives. Am I going to go a lot the euro at this point right now? I'm not sure quite honestly. I mean there could be a chance where some of these non-U.S. currencies or countries start raising their rates, and you have some reversion on some of this at the same time. So -- but that's really been what the past practice is, and we're always looking at trying to figure out new ideas to continue to actively hedge the business and mitigate risk. Michael Bilerman : And then as a follow-up, as you think about the Singapore entity that you listed, and obviously, you put U.S. assets into a Singapore market, which at least driven that was what the market had sort of wanted. But is there an element that you look at that entity? Obvious, it's well off its IPO price. It has a cost of capital. It would need to transact on your U.S. assets at much higher valuations given how strong the U.S. dollar is. Does that -- so does that vehicle still work for you, number one? And then the second part of it is, would you consider vehicles that are local assets and local markets, which would accomplish -- you do it in private form, would you execute that in any public form as well? Andy Power : So the -- the DC REIT, Digital Core REIT, started out with the North America portfolio, but does have a global mandate. And really the selection of the initial assets was, we had the most to pick from in North America, given our history track record, stage of development of those assets. But we do very well expect to globalize it and diversify it with other types of assets in different parts of the world. The Singapore dollar is, I don't think it's 100% linked currency to the U.S. dollar, but there is, I believe, monetary policies or there is some governmental linkage where they try to track the U.S. dollar in terms of currency. So it's not usually a wildly divergent to the U.S. dollar type of currency. I mean, we view that vehicle as a, call it, the home for core assets with -- that are stabilized, fully operational, long-waited average lease terms, and again, will be a global basis. We also have ventures like Ascenty in Latin America, which today is held by our partners Brookfield or Mitsubishi or MC Digital Realty in Japan or our partners, Mitsubishi Corporation, that are certainly a private partner today, but those certainly could evolve into forms of public partnerships over time. So we're always looking at different ways to find the most appropriate both debt and equity capital, private and public, for partners to most efficiently and prudently scale and grow the platform. Operator : The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. David Barden : I guess a couple. The first would be, Bill, you've talked about how steady kind of mid-single-digit inflation would be a useful tool for the pricing equation for the data center industry. I think in the script, you talked about resetting pricing on a CPI basis. I'm wondering if this is really -- is it CPI based? Is it supply-demand based? If you could kind of talk a little bit about your pricing strategy big picture there. And then back to the launch of the service platform, I was wondering if you could kind of talk about any expectations that investors should have for that being a contributor to the business or KPIs that we should look for on a go-forward basis? Bill Stein : Sure. So just to be clear, the CPI-based returns are in the escalators. So we've gone from -- we're going from fixed annual increases to increases that are structured with the minimums with floors and then CPI Index increases above the floor and typically to some cap. So an example would be a 2% floor with a CPI-based increase above that to, say, 6% as a cap, and that's on an annual basis. And so we feel that, that provides some hedge for us for inflation. And then just keep in mind, relative to inflation that over 90% of our power costs are passed through, and that obviously, has been subject to a lot of inflationary pressure. In terms of the base rents, that's more a function of supply and demand in any given market. So -- and with supply chain challenges, I would say, supply is more challenged and demand continues at a very high pace. So that plus the increasing input costs on new builds not us so much because of our VMI program, but certainly, our competitors whether it's materials and/or labor. And our customers that are building their own are certainly experiencing these same pressures, it's pretty easy to justify higher base rates when you're talking to customers. Does that answer your question? Andy Power : And thanks, David, for the question around the ServiceFabric. Yes. So we're -- I've kind of talked about this before to provide a little bit of color and background. It's a purpose-built product, right? And it really enhances our customer experience where we're removing technical complexity. And so what that's going to translate to and what we're watching is driving more of that sub-1 megawatt deployments where enterprises are looking to leverage and deploy their hybrid IT or multi-cloud deployment into our facility. So you'll see a lot more of that driving into our portfolio. And also, I think we're going to see us continually extend the reach into deeper sets of assets within our facilities, set differently, both colo and scale, will start to get the true benefit of interconnection, which at the end of the day will allow us to drive more value and higher margins outside of that product. And so that's one of the things we've been tracking extensively. And that utilization, which is another key KPI for us is multi-site, right, where we're starting to sell a blended set of capabilities, both scale and colo all heavily interconnected because that's where the market is headed. And that's where we see a lot of these larger enterprises requiring multi-market access with a highly interconnected backbone with true SLAs, and that's what the ServiceFabric was able to deliver to market there. Operator : The next question comes Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Jon Atkin : Maybe just a follow-up to the topic raised two or three questions ago about asset recycling and the SREIT . They have their earnings call, I guess, 12 hours ago and specifically mentioned Chicago, Dallas, Frankfurt. So I wondered if there's anything you wanted to add to those comments around timing, and are we going to see all 3 or a subset of those all three or what's kind of the general cadence to suggest? So that's kind of maybe the follow-up. And then the question I had was about book-to-bill. It seems to have lengthened this quarter. That's kind of a choppy metric because I guess it depends on just the nature of the deals that you haven't designed in any given quarter, but it did lengthen noticeably anything to kind of call out there that might relate to the velocity of repeat demand that you might be seeing from the cloud providers or whether they might go through a digestion period. Appreciate Corey's comments about the pipeline being really strong, but the lengthening book-to-bill, is that something that's going to maybe shorten? Or how you see that trending? Andy Power : Jon, I'll take them in reverse because second one is pretty clean. The -- so there's one specific transaction that we've signed that into one of our newest Frankfurt campuses that -- I mean that we're just getting off that plot, getting off the ground on. So that was really what lengthened that out. If you exclude that 1 transaction that I think the book-to-bill is, call it, eight months. So called in-line with our prior track record. And then on your -- on the first question, I mean, definitely, very pleased that the Digital Core REIT team down the gates with -- I think its official first earnings call. Not -- I don't think they have a lot -- too much to report other than the biggest news being making progress. We are making progress collectively on not -- really beyond asset selection to diligence to transactional docs and have really circled assets in three markets as prime candidates to act on for its first life of acquisition growth. And as a reminder, that vehicle, we took public last December with a called underlevered balance sheet. So it has embedded debt capacity called approaching $200 million. So it's not reliant on the equity capital markets out of the gates, but we do hope the equity capital markets respond favorably and continue to support that and because we want to see that vehicle grow, we think that's a great partner vehicle for these core parts of our campuses that fit that vehicle's mandate. Jon Atkin : Slide 13, just looking at the FFO per share ramp and the seasonality through the year. And as we look at kind of -- you didn't put numbers on it, but the 3Q into 4Q ramp seems fairly modest compared to what you saw 1Q to 2Q as well as the NOI growth contribution in 2Q into the current quarter. So I'm just wondering, is there anything going on during the second half of the year that would moderate your sequential growth in the second half, specifically into the fourth quarter? And I read introduction to that slide or is there anything in particular that would cause the ramp to be so much less significant than what you've seen in the last couple of quarters? Andy Power : Jon, I think it really was just timing. We had a really large commencement quarter in 2Q, and in the back half, you do have a few things, call it, working against us, which are those orange bars. One is, we do -- some of our beat in the second quarter was delayed timing on OpEx spend, which we believe is going to get pushed to the back half of the year, not a new event at Digital. We do see a pickup in interest expense, which everyone can see. And then we are closing Teraco in the coming weeks. And then lastly, call it, 24-ish or 25-ish percent of our core FFO is from like the euro, the sterling, the yen. And on a quarter-over-quarter basis, you've seen degradation in those currencies about 5%, which is the FX headwinds. Hence, while we did change our as-reported guidance, we were able to maintain our constant currency guidance, which is about just north of 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Operator : The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : Maybe following up on the power issue out in Ashburn. What does this mean, I guess, for leasing? In that market, does it put it on a pause, I guess, in the near term? And I think Corey mentioned kind of the record pipeline that's out there. What would that look like in Nova? And then just curious, how much you have in the way of expiring leases in that market over the next 12 or 24 months? Bill Stein : Thanks, Aryeh. So I mean -- and then -- again, it's still subject to change because this is very new or late breaking, but it's going to paint a picture where we believe there's still going to be robust demand in a tightened or slowed supply environment. So -- and those economics mean rates typically rise and economics accrue to the providers. We -- I don't -- first and foremost, I don't see people leaving Ashburn for this delay. This isn't like a permanent feature of Ashburn, this is a, call it, bottleneck of a portion of Ashburn. And you've got an incredible amount of customers, infrastructures, network Ashburn grew to where it is for many reasons. And I don't see demand just running away from in the face of this. I think the available capacity is going to become more precious. Hence, that call it, 40 megawatts of operational that we have today is more precious. And if we're able to proceed and bringing on new capacity that I outlined, that becomes more precious. And if we look at our expirations, we've got about 18 or 17 megawatts respond in the back half of this year. Another 75 in '23. Another 58 in '24. Another 54 in '25, so call it north of 200 over the next through the end of '25, which is a normal amount of role for us, but Ashburn is our largest market. So we have a lot of microwatts rolling over the ensuing years. Aryeh Klein : Got it. I guess in light of what's happening, those re-leasing spreads or the pricing around that, you would anticipate maybe being higher than you might have thought a couple of weeks ago. Andy Power : Correct. Yes. I mean, I think asking rates on any available capacity in Ashburn, I mean when we got won of this, we went out to our entire field. The dynamics are shifting in Ashburn, and they could shift quite dramatically. So asking rates as well as negotiations on renewal contracts. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Just following up on the comments on the strong cloud demand. Can you just update us on what your cloud customers are saying in terms of their desire to work with you versus building themselves? Is there any change in that one way or the other or from one location to another? And then given some of the issues we're just talking about in Ashburn, obviously, power issues are even greater in Europe, and your -- you've just committed to some major new builds in markets like Paris and Frankfurt. What is on the ground there in terms of ensuring that you're going to have the availability of that power supply over the next several years for these and other expansions? Bill Stein : Simon, I'll speak to the self-build question. So frankly, we -- the pipe scalers have been building their own for a long time, I'd say, for the last 10 years. And they have pursued what we call a hybrid model. So they have self-build, and they have -- they lease from third parties. That -- how much they do at any given time varies, and they don't all do it at the same time. So party A might be doing 100% third-party leasing and no self-building while party B is relying mostly on self-build. In the next year, they could change it up. But I would say, in the current environment, so in the current environment meaning that an environment that's challenged by supply chain and inflation, I think we're seeing an increased reliance on third-party leasing, right? And that's because we are as good as anybody at managing in what is, I would characterize it as a more challenging environment. And do you want to handle the power question in Europe. Andy Power : Sure. So we have on-the-ground teams that speak the local language, worked in the municipalities, network to the business leaders. So in each of these jurisdictions that call it, you mentioned our top of list relationships to make sure that we're in constant communication. That doesn't mean something doesn't pop off like we're experiencing Ashburn episodically, but I would say, we have a very good hand on the pulse of what's going on there. I mean this -- we're supporting critical -- mission-critical infrastructure here for a host of applications that I would say, even in a rationing environment, we're very top of list in terms of access to resources, including power. And we're constantly monitoring the power sources or deliveries for new projects and preparing for even more draconian scenarios in terms of backup fuel sources that could play out given the fact that circumstances of what's going on in Eastern Europe. So -- and that's part of our business, and we have very high stakes customers that I view as partners kind of in line what Bill mentioned who are side-by-side with us on these issues, right? They're with us with, expressing the criticality of them getting live on certain dates. So I think that partnership is -- so we would mutually benefit in terms of being able to derisk our execution on their behalf. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Frank Louthan : What conversations have you had with folks kind of looking ahead to possibly shrinking economy and so forth? Are you seeing any proactive pull forward of digitization saving costs and so forth? And can you give us a little bit more color on sort of the verticals that you're seeing the strength in the bookings? Any shift there from your usual case characters, any new or different industries that you're seeing coming stronger. Andy Power : Thanks, Frank. Maybe I'll start it off, and then Corey can -- so we've -- I don't think we've seen to date economic softness in our demand. You heard from Corey's description on the forward pipeline and look at our results in terms of new bookings and new logo additions, and I think that's based into that we are really mission-critical priority. We're not a discretionary spend. We are -- we're facilitating performance enhancement. We're facilitating growth through digital transformation for our customers' businesses as well as efficiencies for our customers. So I think that's -- and we've also been through a few economic cycles as well, and the history would say that our trend is our friend on that topic. If you look at the sectors, I think some of the usual ones, in North America, we saw a good amount of financial services. Cybersecurity, in EMEA, we saw this quarter's media telecommunications, initiative cloud and Asia Pacific, similar to what we saw both America and EMEA. So pretty broad brush as well as call more general corporate enterprise across health care, manufacturing, retail, et cetera. So -- and I think that goes back to -- there's a common theme across almost all these industries about what our services are doing to enable their services. Corey Dyer : Yes, I would add to it, Frank, that we had 17 subsegments do more than $1 million in bookings this last quarter, which speaks to the breadth of the demand. We haven't seen a pullback. If you think about the secular trends around service providers driving revenue, enterprises saving money, adding features as far as efficiencies, taking advantage of a hybrid IT world that we're really well positioned for. We haven't seen that affect the demand in any way. Maybe pull forward a little bit, but I haven't seen it really affected because I've got a record pipeline in colo, record pipeline in interconnection, record pipeline in enterprise and just a record pipeline overall. So if there is an effect on inflation, then I would tell you that it's not enough that it keeps them from continuing to come to look to us to build out their infrastructure. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Nicholas Del Deo : First, on the -- looking at your expected returns in the development pipeline, pricing is up. It looks like returns are consistent, maybe falling a little bit, particularly in Europe. Is that a function of mix shift with more large deals in the pipeline or other factors at play there? Andy Power : Thanks, Nick. The -- I think the returns went down 30 basis points to 40 basis points from 10.4 to about 10, which is really a mix shift. We've added to the base some larger-scale projects that already have or will have some anchor leases that are -- we're certainly on the lower end of our return spectrum. But I would say, the pricing is robust, particularly in Europe, which is one of our tightest regions and has got a numerous markets where we're serving both large and small customers. So I would attribute that's pretty much sole that quarter-over-quarter mix shift. Nicholas Del Deo : Okay. Got it. And then maybe 1 more on the Ashburn power topic. I think you made a case that customers are not going to leave Ashburn because of this. If it does cause any customers to kind of reconsider their concentration in Ashburn and maybe you want to diversify a little bit, say, into adjacent markets like Richmond or Culpeper or Manassas. Do you think you can react quickly to capitalize on any sort of diversification trend? Bill Stein : So I'm not sure I think diversification trend would likely have been outside of like that Northern Virginia part of the world, quite honestly. And we've got shells in Atlanta, we've got capacity in the call it the suburbs of New York City and Chicago and Dallas. So there's -- I think you could see a spillover effect on a temporary basis to other parts of the United States. But I don't think you're going to see a running to other cities in Virginia, quite honestly. And I don't -- I mean, the -- this is locationally sensitive workloads, right? The infrastructure and networking has been in the ground and been built upon and grown upon for years and years in Ashburn. The clouds have architected their networks with on-ramp locations that are locationally sensitive availability zones that have radius restrictions. And I don't -- the fact that this is a slowing of the Ashburn, not a halting of the Ashburn or a pocket of Ashburn to me says, I don't think that you're going to really be able to move this tremendous center of gravity for the data centers worldwide. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. Bill Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter as outlined on the last page of our presentation. First, digital transformation remains an important secular driver of our business, which drove another strong quarter of bookings and new business additions to our global platform. The robust demand that we are seeing is reflected in our growing development pipeline. Second, we continue to press our advantage through tactical and organic new market entries as the additions of Israel and Barcelona this quarter will enhance our connectivity offering in the Mediterranean while our investment in a leading colocation and connectivity provider in South Africa is expected to close in short order. Third, we posted stronger-than-expected core FFO per share results, despite stiff FFX headwinds, and we maintained our constant currency core FFO per share forecast for the year, which represents more than 7% growth year-over-year. Last, we are very proud of our team's launch of ServiceFabric, an open and neutral digital marketplace, supporting our customers' digital transformation journey and enabling hybrid multi-cloud requirements. Before signing off, I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. I hope all of you will stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming events. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are CEO, Bill Stein; and President and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer, also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to GAAP net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. One important item to note this quarter, while Teraco's results are consolidated into our financial statements since closing on August 1, we have excluded the platform's contribution from leasing backlog and other portfolio statistics that will be cited on this call and within our third quarter earnings materials. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, we achieved another quarter of record bookings, led by robust demand within the greater than a megawatt segment. Second, the signs of improvement in our core portfolio continued to emerge in the quarter with 120 basis point sequential improvement and base data center revenues on a constant currency basis. Third, with the closing on our investment in Teraco, we cemented our position as a leading provider of colocation and connectivity in South Africa. And lastly, our management team guided by decades of experience remains focused on navigating the current environment and maximizing the opportunity that lies before us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein. Arthur Stein : Thank you, Jordan, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. The world has experienced significant change so far in 2022, and Digital Realty is adapting to that change. Our business continues to be levered to powerful long-term secular demand trends, broadly driven by ongoing digital transformation and the growth in IT and data as our record leasing results underscore. We also have an unmatched global operating footprint that is supported by a strong development pipeline that allows us to capture opportunities wherever they may emerge. As you all understand, global capital markets have become extraordinarily volatile and interest rates have risen sharply from historic lows to levels that we have not seen since 2008. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the euro to levels not seen in nearly 20 years. While you've had to look back over 30 years to find the last time the dollar was this elevated against the pound or the yen. This volatility is being driven by a number of factors from a global economy emerging from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine and of course, the heightened resolve of central bankers to tap down on elevated global inflation. And while the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and fortune can indeed favor the brave, experience has taught us that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And we feel that it is most prudent today to adapt to the current environment by : one, prioritizing and sharpening the lens through which we view new investments to ensure that we are focused on the most strategic transactions that offer the highest potential risk-adjusted returns; two, by pressing our newly gained advantage on pricing and improving our internal growth profile and the longer-term durability of our cash flows; and three, by enhancing liquidity to ensure that we have the capital to meet the commitments that we have made to our customers while maintaining a comfortable cushion. With over 300 data centers around the world and a revenue base of over $4.5 billion, Digital Realty remains focused on how to best position ourselves for the long run. Our third quarter results were strong with a record $176 million of new bookings, making the third time in the past 4 quarters that our bookings have exceeded $150 million. Core FFO per share was $1.67 despite stiff FX and interest rate headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we see evidence of the turn that is starting to take shape in our core portfolio.  Digital Realty's global platform enables us to capture demand wherever it emerges. North America was the standout this quarter with our largest deals landing in the region. Multinational companies are using platform digital to enable digital transformation across multiple regions and metros globally. A good example of this is a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit transaction signed with a top 5 financial services company that was inked in the quarter. Looking ahead, sales activity remains healthy as the secular trends driving data center demand remain in place. Enterprises continue their digital transformation with a growing preference for hybrid cloud architecture while cloud and connectivity providers continue to expand their infrastructure to better serve their customers around the world. But the world is changing. We are seeing sales cycle lengthen and global uncertainty extends decision times. Importantly, we are pushing prices higher to reflect tightening supply and rising costs. Admittedly, some of the deals this quarter have been in process for many months and do not fully reflect today's environment. Today, new leases are being priced to reflect current market conditions. And while this will likely be in an iterative process, we expect the strong secular trends driving demand toward third-party data centers to continue for years to come. Andy will provide further color on our results and our outlook shortly. During the third quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Teraco, a leading carrier and cloud-neutral data center and interconnection services provider in South Africa. Teraco is a gem. With 7 data centers across 3 metros and robust interconnectivity including more than 22,000 cross connects, 7 cloud on-ramps and direct access to 7 subsea cables with more on the way. Teraco co has plenty of room to expand and is expected to generate some of the best growth within our portfolio. Teraco uniquely enhances our position in EMEA, complementing our existing operations in Eastern Africa through iColo, Western Africa through Medallion and in Europe and the Mediterranean with Interxion, Altus IT, Lamda Helix and our newest JV with Mine in Israel. These are all highly connected assets that leverage subsea cable landing and brings the world closer together, linking Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Consistent with that strategy, we recently acquired land on the Greek island of Crete to create an interconnection hub in the Eastern Mediterranean to complement our existing hub in Marseille, along with developing hubs in Barcelona and Israel, which will feed additional traffic into Greece, the Balkans, Turkey and Northern Africa. We expect that this highly differentiated project will generate strong double-digit returns while enhancing the value of our existing facilities in the region. Moving to our dispositions in the quarter. We sold a noncore mixed-use data center property in Dallas for $206 million and reached an agreement with digital core REIT to sell a 25% interest in our Frankfurt data center campus for $140 million with an option to acquire up to 90% of the same campus plus a 90% share of 1 of our Dallas data centers in a larger transaction valued at approximately $750 million. Both transactions are subject to unitholder approval with a vote expected for November. Funding organic new market entry through the disposition of stabilized facilities is our preferred source of capital. It enables us to leverage platform digital to capitalize on value creation opportunities and harvest capital once those facilities have stabilized. We also favor joint ventures like the one in Israel, where we leverage the local knowledge and expertise of our partner and pair that with PlatformDIGITAL to expand our global footprint and to better serve our customers. Before turning it over to Andy, I'd like to update you on our ESG success shown on Page 3 of our earnings presentation. We were honored to be recognized by GRESB as the sector leader for technology and science category in the Americas for the second consecutive year, maintaining our 5-star rating from this leading investor-driven ESG benchmarking organization. We are proud of our ESG-related efforts. And while the awards and recognition are nice, we are focused on ESG because our customers demand it, and because quite simply, it is the right thing to do. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results. Andrew Power : Thank you, Bill. Turning to Page 5. As Bill noted, we signed record bookings of $176 million, with a $13 million contribution from interconnection during the third quarter, excluding the results from Teraco. The greater than a megawatt business in the Americas was the big driver of this quarter's record leasing at nearly $100 million signed. Sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for 24% of the record quarterly bookings while the shell portion of a large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal fell into our other category. Importantly, as we've discussed, we have meaningfully shifted our cadence toward further insulating our portfolio from the effects of inflation through the addition of CPI-based escalators into our new leases. While more than 95% of our portfolio includes rent escalation causes, less than 20% are specifically tied to CPI, while the balance are fixed. And our highest leasing volume quarter ever, we were able to achieve CPI-based escalators on 40% of the leases signed in the quarter, which demonstrates our resolve and our customers' acknowledgment of this important factor. The balance of our leases signed in 3Q include fixed rent escalators. Moving on to markets. In North America, Portland and Dallas were particularly strong with large deals landing in each of those metros, while demand in Northern Virginia also remained high. In EMEA, totals were consistent with expectations with particular strength in Paris. While San Paolo led in LatAm, and Osaka led the APAC region. These deals drove additional starts within our development pipeline, which grew to over 400 megawatts, but is also now more than 60% pre-leased mitigating much of the risk related to this capital spend and providing significant visibility into future revenue. As Bill touched on in his remarks, we signed 4 leases in the quarter with a large multinational financial services customer that has fully embarked upon its digital transformation journey. This large multi-site, multi-market build-to-suit transaction drove the upside in our greater than 1 megawatt North America leasing and also served to increase our development pipeline sequentially while reducing our anticipated yields. Importantly, this deal is structured as a yield on cost development supported by a long-term triple net lease to a strong investment-grade credit with fixed escalators, which serves to insulate Digital Realty from construction costs, and operating expense volatility. Excluding this transaction, our development life cycle average yield will be closer to the yield we presented last quarter. During the third quarter, we added another 103 new customers, continuing the 100-plus new logos we've added each quarter since the closing of the Interxion transaction 2.5 years ago. Key customer wins in the quarter include a Global 2000 luxury goods maker is expanding its capabilities on PlatformDIGITAL to add data exchange with its strategic cloud providers to its existing capabilities. A Global 2000 multinational technology manufacturer is expanding its hybrid IT capability in multiple metros across 2 global regions with PlatformDIGITAL. A Global 2000 retailer is rationalizing its data centers and joining Platform Digital as part of its hybrid IT architecture to have greater proximity to a key cloud service provider while enhancing both performance and ecosystem benefits. A Global 100 top insurance company is rationalizing its data centers and moving to PlatformDIGITAL to gain strong access to 2 leading cloud service providers. Landing with us as a new logo in 4Q '21, a Global 2000 U.S. energy provider expanded into 2 more metros with Digital Realty as it continues to rearchitect its network as part of a long-term hybrid IT transformation. And a Global 2000 aerospace and defense contractor is rationalizing its data center portfolio while supporting the re-architecture of its network and interconnecting with cloud providers on PlatformDIGITAL.  Turning to our backlog on Page 7. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases grew to $466 million by quarter end as our record signings were partially offset by $90 million of commencement. The lag between signings and commencements moved up to 17 months for the leases signed in the third quarter due to the large multisite enterprise build-to-suit deal discussed by Bill a moment ago. Excluding this deal, our sign to commence live was under 8 months, consistent with our historical average. Approximately 25% of our record backlog is slated to commence in the fourth quarter. While another 45% will commence in 2023, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halfs of next year. Moving on to Page 8. We signed $154 million of renewal leases during the third quarter that rolled down 0.5% on a cash basis. Renewal rates for 01-megawatt renewals were positive across each region and up 3.1% overall, demonstrating the criticality of these deployments and the differentiation of our facilities. This product segment has historically experienced steadily positive renewal rates and cash renewal rates have steadily increased throughout this year. After two consecutive 3-plus percent bumps in 1Q and 2Q, the cash mark-to-market was weighed down by the greater than 1 megawatt segment in the third quarter. Despite this result, we are confident in a slightly positive cash releasing spread for the full year 2022. Importantly, we are encouraged by the general trajectory of market rents across our product line. We expect that the dislocation and volatility of capital markets coupled with rising costs and the reduced availability of power in several markets, including the world's largest market, Loudon County, Virginia, is constraining the ability to bring on new data center capacity despite the secular demand for data center infrastructure. With regard to power delivery in Northern Virginia, we are continuing to work with the primary power provider to ensure appropriate allocations with an acute focus on capacity needed to support our customers in this market. We have an incredibly unique footprint in Loudon and a set of capabilities that we are working to tap into in order to take advantage of this backdrop of continuing tightening market fundamentals. In terms of operating performance, total portfolio occupancy rebounded by 80 basis points sequentially, driven by the strong commencements. These improvements in our occupancy come despite our active intention to grow our global colocation inventory in order to meet the growing demand of our expanding customer base. Same capital cash NOI growth fell 7.3% in the third quarter, negatively impacted by another 480 basis point FX headwind. This is disappointing on the surface but once the noise is removed, the improving operating picture that we have been painting starts to emerge. On a constant currency basis, data center operating revenue, rental revenue interconnection was actually up 10 basis points year-over-year and improved by 120 basis points sequentially, demonstrating the turn that has started to take hold in our core operations. The sequential step-up was supported by a 50 basis point occupancy improvement over the second quarter, along with the benefits of the positive releasing spreads we've seen year-to-date. Turning to our risk mitigation strategies on Page 9. 56% of our third quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 21% in euros, 6% in Singapore dollars, 5% in British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen over the last few months, negatively impacting same capital revenue growth by 530 basis points and NOI growth by 480 basis points year-over-year, as shown in our constant currency analysis on Page 10. This strong headwind contrasts with typical FX impacts of 50 to 100 basis points in either direction during the periods with more normal FX volatility. While the outsized depreciation of the euro this year has been a major driver of the headwinds for our P&L, it also represents the lion's share of our development pipeline. To be clear, we are operating and then investing locally rather than repatriating proceeds into U.S. dollars. Our operations, investment pipeline and funding in locally-denominated debt serve as a natural hedge. As we discussed on our call last quarter, given the growth of our global portfolio, along with heightened FX volatility, we took a closer look at our hedging strategy during the third quarter and executed additional swaps to mitigate our remaining FX exposure. In August, we executed a U.S. dollar to euro currency swap against an existing $1 billion tranche of 2027 notes outstanding. And in late September, alongside our USD 550 million bond, we swapped those borrowings in the euro and Japanese yen, which also reduced the effective interest rate on those 5-year notes to just 3% versus the 5.55% coupon achieved via the offering. In terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO per share of $1.67, which is 1% higher on a year-over-year basis and 3% lower sequentially due to the negative impact of FX, higher interest and operating expenses and the initial dilution we incurred from the closure of Teraco, which is consistent with the forecast we provided last quarter. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was 6% higher year-over-year but down $0.01 sequentially. The reported core FFO underperformance versus our prior expectation for the quarter was purely a function of greater-than-expected FX headwinds. Looking forward, we expect core FFO per share will remain under pressure from stiff FX headwinds given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, though this should be offset by core growth. As you can see from the bridge on Page 11, we expect FFO will remain flat sequentially in the fourth quarter as FX and interest expense headwinds are partly balanced by NOI growth. Accordingly, we've adjusted our underlying guidance assumptions to reflect the continued pressures of FX and interest rates. We are also updating our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2022 to $6.70 to $6.75, reflecting a $0.075 per share adjustment at the midpoint of the range. Importantly, due to the sharper-than-expected move in interest rates since our last call, we are reducing our constant currency core FFO per share range by $0.025 at the midpoint to a new range of $6.95 to $7 for 2022, which represents approximately 7% growth over 2021. We expect currency headwinds could represent a 400 to 500 basis point drag on full year 2020 revenue and core FFO per share growth. A review of our leverage is on Page 12. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.7x, while fixed charge coverage is at 5.5x. We drew $400 million down from last September's forward equity offering as part of our funding for Teraco. So pro forma for the remaining forward equity and adjusting for our full quarter's contribution from Teraco, our leverage ratio drops to 6.4x while pro forma fixed charge coverage is 5.7x. While leverage is above our historical average, we have bolstered our liquidity to ensure that we have the capital in hand to fund our committed development spend throughout the end of next year and maintain a comfortable cushion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised or received commitments for approximately $2 billion of debt capital at an effective blended average of just over 3%. These include more than $650 million of term loan commitments received subsequent to quarter end. With cash and forward equity outstanding totaling more than $700 million, we have increased our current available liquidity to approximately $3 billion. We expect to see leverage moderate back towards our longer-term target over time through a combination of noncore dispositions, joint ventures of core holdings, lease-up of available capacity and the retention of free cash flow. As Bill discussed, the current capital markets environment and increased cost of capital have led us to sharpen our lens and prioritize new investments to those that are the highest strategic merit and offer the best potential risk-adjusted returns. Our financial strategy includes a diverse menu of available capital options while minimizing the related cost of our liabilities. The execution against this financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital and enables us to fund our strategic objectives. As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is about 5.5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.4%. Approximately 3/4 of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. More than 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have no meaningful near-term debt maturities and a well-laddered debt maturity schedule. We repaid the remainder of our 2022 debt earlier this month and have only a small Swiss bond maturing in 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jon Atkin of RBC. Jonathan Atkin : I wondered if it's possible to kind of frame the magnitude and the timing of the CapEx associated with all the leasing that you did during the quarter. And then maybe to kind of bring it home to the $3 billion in liquidity that you talked about sources of funding that incremental CapEx. Andrew Power : Thanks, Jon. So if you look at our development life cycle, it kind of lays it out region by region, and it has called, let's say, starts with a, call it, just $3.8 billion of, call it, approved projects. And that includes all the leases signed during the last quarter as well as some projects that are not leased because it's only 60% pre-leased, roughly. If you kind of break that down over the next, call it, 5 quarters, you're spending about $2.7 billion of that. Again, that is not all contractual spend. Only a portion of that is tied to customer contracts. So if you exclude the, call it, assumptive or speculative spend, you call it closer to $2 billion. The $3 billion of liquidity I mentioned, that includes, call it, really 2 parts, $1.7 billion of cash and revolver capacity and then $1.2 billion of the undrawn equity forward and new U.S. dollar term loan commitments in hand. So that total just about $3 billion of contractual committed committee liquidity right now. That is everything we have at this minute. We're also continuing with our normal game plan of noncore dispositions, call it $1.5 billion over several quarters as well as joint ventures on core holdings. So we feel pretty good about being able to fund this attractive growth for our customers. Jonathan Atkin : And then secondly, on the 17 month metric that you mentioned in the earnings release and in the script about kind of essentially book-to-bill. And then putting that in the context of what Bill said about elongated sales cycles, how much of that is due to perhaps the lack of server availability on part of the customers or from your standpoint, delays in power procurement or ability to construct just given supply chain which is facing data center infrastructure? Andrew Power : I would parse those in 2 topics and, I'd say, coincidentally look like they're connected. What the long -- the extended book-to-bill really was our largest transaction was with a large multinational financial services customer. It's been in the works for -- really since the very beginning of this year. It's across 4 different locations. It's incredible. It's very flatter to be part of their digital transformation, which is really going to cloud in a hybrid IT fashion. And given those projects are literally at land stage, we're designing to their specifications. That is what's extending that out. And if you carve those 4 transactions with that customer out, you really had a normal book-to-bill cycle. I think I'll let Bill comment on what he referenced in terms of, call it, what we're seeing in terms of the business in terms of some elongated sales cycle though. Arthur Stein : It's a little bit elongated, Jon. But as Andy said, if you were to strip out the 4 build-to-suits that are in this quarter, the effect on the book-to-bill this quarter would be minimal. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Great. Have you guys increased pricing on cross-connects as well? And if so, what is sort of the -- how much have you raised that? And what percentage are on the new pricing? And then going forward, you're fairly creative as far as the getting the effective rate on your financing down close to 3%. Is that -- what sort of expectation do you have, what sort of financing you can get going forward? Do you think you can keep it around that level? Andrew Power : Thanks, Frank. Maybe Chris and I M&A cross-connect pricing and pricing dynamic overall. I would remind you, we are essentially have been putting together some critical puzzle pieces through our M&A and have been aligning our cross-connect pricing across various regions, including the latest and greatest addition to PlatformDIGITAL with Teraco, the leading platform across South Africa. So it's not necessarily a uniform step shift, but we have been investing in that platform, bringing more value to our customers and driving commensurate increases in prices. But Chris, anything you want to add on cross-connect prices or data points there? Christopher Sharp : Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Frank. A couple of points, right? We definitely take a customer-led approach on aligning value to the overall reach and overall offering they're able to provide them. I would echo Andy sentiment that like in the Westin Building, I think we've talked about it a couple of quarters ago, where we're driving that consistency of our overall interconnection products and capabilities in that market to really just delivering more value and you're going to start to see more revenue pick up in the next year on being able to uniformly bring that into the overall PlatformDIGITAL delivery capabilities. I'd say this next piece is more probably pointing to your question in EMEA, right, where we've been talking for some time now about increasing those prices and that's been performing great. And I think that's something that you'll continue to see growing, which is represented in the interconnection numbers that we put up this last quarter. So you'll see that performing I think, much better over the course of the next year here. Andrew Power : And just not to leave you without any numbers in terms of rate or growth increases. I mean the ranges are pretty wide, but it's anywhere from called low mid-single digits to some -- definitely some outliers that are in the teens at the very least. I think the overall pricing environment is probably even more relevant to the heart of your question, though. We are continuing to see improving pricing power across our platform, whether it's in our, let's call it, less than megawatt enterprise colocation footprint. We're, I'd say, call it, 10% to 15% sequential pricing changes in many markets and also seeing similar type of increases in the larger plus than a megawatt as well. In relation to your second question, I mean, big kudos to the Digital Realty Finance Capital Markets team, I mean, really call it staying nimble and acting fast in a volatile environment and really bringing together, call it, what is the $2 billion of capital in, call it, 60 days. We've also been tapping into call it incremental FX hedgings, given the more volatile FX world and a more global business. And we've been able to, call it, get our cost of capital, call it, roughly 3%. Let don't I'm not sure that's a permanent number where we go from here. We've had, call it, the most rapid increase in the U.S. Treasury in 40 years or Fed funds rates in 40 years. But we're definitely using all the tools in our toolkit to maximize those menu of options and drive down the cost of our capital. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Barden of Bank of America. David Barden : I guess first question would be, Andy, can you walk us through how this bubble of lease renewals in 2023 is going to work out? I guess, on supplement Page 23, 15% of annualized rent is coming due next year. You've had some success with positive lease renewing spreads year-to-date and be helpful to kind of get some comfort level there. And then I guess the follow-up would be, I think we were hoping to get some comfort on what your understanding with Dominion and Northern Virginia energy availability would be in the development pipeline on a go-forward basis? And if you could kind of share what your latest thinking is there. Andrew Power : Thanks, Dave. Maybe I'll take them in reverse order because I think the second question ties a little bit into your first question. So as a broader reminder, literally, I think it was 90 days ago to the day, we got the, call it, the newer news from Dominion on the pinch point in Eastern Loudon County on power deliveries. I can tell you we're a regular dialogue with the power company on a path forward. But I would say also that the essence of the initial messaging remains intact that there's just going to be significantly less power provided to ongoing development in this region until 2026. The feedback we've received is that 2026, which should be back to more normal practices. So this is not a permanent thing. It's due to transmission not generation, and that's what they've expressed to us. But between now and then, it's going to be less supply in the biggest highest -- consistently high demand market. What that means and what we're seeing, and I alluded to it earlier is that the pricing power pendulum is shifting back towards us. And it's nice to be I believe, the largest incumbent, we call it, 500 megawatts of in-place capacity and just under, I think, 200 call it, coming due contractually expiration wise in the next 3 years. The -- we -- when it comes to available capacity, we're -- we've sold quite well in that market. We probably in hindsight, I wish we didn't do so well, but who knew this was going to come. I don't think any market participants really expected this. We do -- ourselves are not completely bearing and we do have a 200-megawatt parcel in Manassas that is to date in unaffected zone that -- which is really nice to have in times like this. And while I cannot guarantee it right now, I think we're optimistic that the responsible parties in Loudon will work with Digital to deliver on behalf of those customers that have signed contracts to grow with us and are sitting in our backlog. Turning to your second question. The pricing power pendulum again, I think, is continuing to move in the favor of the providers given that demand has been robust for so long, and the outlook is looking to be -- continue to be such and the supply has just been absorbed. You pointed out the 15%, which is like less than a megawatt piece of our exploration schedule. I mean that's -- in times like these, when prices are moving your friend, it's nice to have more bites at the apple to continue to ensure commensurate value is generated for our contracts. So I feel that is usually our most network dense sticky portion that consistently on the front end of our exploration schedules. I feel pretty darn good about that in terms of not only retention but price action. And I think even the PC didn't mention in the larger the megawatt, I think that my commentary around Northern Virginia and other tightening markets, I think, will also continue this trend of more positive cash releasing spreads, which were positive in the first 2 quarters this year and remain positive on a full year basis for 2022. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Michael Rollins : So with some of the comments on demand but also a lengthening of the sales cycle, should investors look at Slide 5 a little differently in terms of the range of sales outcomes that you achieved over the last 6 to 8 quarters relative to what the next 6 quarters or 4 quarters might look like? And then secondly, just given some of the comments that you provided on currency and on interest rates. If everything stays where it is currently, can you share a sense of what the potential headwinds could be on 2023 financial performance, thinking of revenue and core FFO per share? Andrew Power : So we'll do a reverse and I'll hit the currency and interest rates and then we can talk to pitch over to Corey about, call it, expectations on signings for, call it, the next several quarters. The -- I mean, based on where we're seeing the currencies, I would say, especially precipitated by, I think, the activity in the sterling -- the British sterling pound over the last several, I still believe currencies will remain somewhat of a headwind in '23 relative to 2022. I don't think that's a permanent fixture. But based on the pace of, call it, governmental base rate increases and the currency differentials. So we haven't put that together nor the interest rate, call it, headwind. The interest rate one is -- excuse me, I should say, FX is going to be less of a headwind than my gut for 2023 than 2022. I mean we're just absorbing, call it, 400 basis points. So I would -- I don't have the exact number, but I don't see it being even half of that in the end of the day in the next year, unless you literally have the euro and the pound literally dropped another 30% over the next 12 months. Interest rates, we have called 80-plus percent of our debt is fixed rate. We obviously saw last quarter looking to access capital across various markets and various currencies that align with our asset and revenue base to essentially buck some of the interest rate trend. But I mean, I think a good proxy is if you look at, call it, the quantity of our floating rate debt and you apply what the expected software increases over the next 12 months, that's probably going to be a ballpark in terms of headwinds on a year-over-year basis, Mike. In terms of -- I'll turn it back to Corey to how we're thinking about the range of outcomes on new signings. Corey Dyer : Yes. So thanks, Mike, for the question, and Andy for the -- let me go second. The -- first off, I'll tell you that we don't forecast. I'm not going to try to play a game on what it's going to look like. But what I would tell you from a demand and a pipeline perspective, our multi-quarter pipeline is really robust, may not robust. I'll say resilient and very healthy. And that comes off of our quarter that was our top quarter ever. The demand is healthy across all regions. The one softness area would probably be in the small enterprises where they're having a little bit more -- I'd say they're more susceptible to the macro issues to the war in Europe. So all those different items. And so we saw those cycles lengthening, and that moderated some of our results in the somewhat megawatt. But broadly across the globe, we've got really strong hyperscale demand. We've got strong demand and increasing demand from, I'll call it, our large $1 billion-plus multinationals. Our channel business is going really well. We're seeing new logos uptick from that cohort as well as the possible demand from just new signings in that area. So positive from a broad space, it's resilient and really healthy after our best quarter ever. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Great. As we think about your -- the impact of inflation on your development costs next year and beyond, just I believe you have some VMI contracts renewing in early 2023 for your equipment spend. Maybe you could talk about what your expectations are there in terms of cost inflation on development as we enter the new year? And then second, as we think about the better pricing power and perhaps some constraints on new development in markets like Ashburn, are you in a position to perhaps have declining capital intensity in the next few years, which would kind of help reduce your needs for capital? Or how should we think about that dynamic as well? Andrew Power : Sure. Thanks, Eric. So the -- so we have numerous risk mitigations when it comes to our development and construction, which includes our vendor management inventory program, you mentioned other supplier contracts. At a more local level, bundling our projects with GCs and subcontractors. So when you put that all together in the current backdrop environment and we look at, call it, the next batch, which will be projects probably more back half of '23 into '24. On a fully -- including all baked into the whole basis of the project, we're still estimating that our costs are, call it, in the mid- to high single-digit-ish type of potential increase. Based on current outlook, and you touched a little bit on the supply/demand dynamic, we believe that the rate of rate growth will outpace that or at least hold firm that our yields will hang in there and not be degradated by that inflationary impact. And that's something we're working day in and day out to keep focused on and working with our great vendors around the world on. When it comes to pricing power, when it comes to capital intensity, I would just echo really what Bill said at the outset of this call that in the last several months, the world has become more volatile. The capital markets have become more challenged. The talk of a looming recession, the war in Eastern Europe has continued, and we're raising the bar at Digital when it comes to focus on our strategic priorities. And we obviously have an incredible pipeline of projects. We have probably one of the most distinguished land banks and runways for our customers. But I think there is a scenario very likely where we could spend a little bit less on speculative development. And because we're focused on projects that are delivering on those strategic priorities and delivering the highest risk-adjusted returns. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Andy, I wonder if you could talk about the M&A market a little bit, both in terms of your ability to sell your assets, given the sort of the derating of the public company multiples. Have you seen any change in the market on the private side and how will that affect your fundraising? And you've obviously bought Teraco. How are you thinking about acquisitions in terms of market expansions or expanding in existing markets over the next year or 2? Andrew Power : We didn't share much on Teraco and I'll start with that, and then we hand it to Greg to talk about both of your questions. Having spent some time down in region with the Teraco team, I think we're even more pleased with the incredible addition to our global platform, not only in terms of the most highly connected destinations across South Africa but we're a really fantastic team delivering on behalf of their customers, our customers and really growing that platform. I apologize, we did -- we obviously consolidated Teraco into our financials, but we did not roll them out into all the stats given we just closed and call it the middle of August. That's coming in a quarter's time. So please be patient with us on that. But I'll give it to Greg to maybe speak to take your questions. Gregory Wright : Yes. Thanks for the question, Simon. Look, I would say pricing on recent transactions in the private market have remained firm. We're fortunate to be in a sector that continues to experience growth and secular demand that really isn't common for other sectors, and we happen to have a product that's scarce in the market with growing demand. When you try to put some numbers to that, if you just look at the last 2 quarters in the second and third quarter, it's about $1.7 billion in transactions. And pricing has been very firm in terms of cap rate and per KW basis. So look, to date, look, the private capital, again, is looking to increase their exposure to the space where there's a limited amount of supply. So to date, it's remained firm. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : Just first on macro, and I think there may have been a question alluding to this before, but I just want to get a better sense whether you're seeing tightening financial conditions maybe starting to have an impact on your customers' propensity or willingness to invest further in Digital's transformation as they think about 2023, and whether it's varied across hyperscale enterprise or whether it's varied by geography? And then I have one housekeeping follow-up on Teraco, maybe, Andy, if you can talk about any incremental color you can give on expected contributions from Teraco perhaps in fourth quarter or maybe on a more annualized basis heading into next year? Andrew Power : So I'll handle the more mundane question on Teraco, and I'll pass it to Corey a little bit on buyer behavior in the current environment. So Teraco, I believe, did for just about 1.5 months, about $28 million of revenue, $16 million of EBITDA. It -- I would say it's signings, we're call it -- and again, do not include any of our numbers. We call it just don't know the 6 megawatts plus a decent chunk of connectivity. It does have a very sizable backlog. Bit added, I think, a sizable amount to our construction called almost $0.5 billion of construction in progress. And based on what we're seeing, they're working on right now, feeling very good about the growth of that platform. Corey, do you want to handle on, call it, buyer behavior in the current part? Corey Dyer : Matt, thank you very much for the question. I would tell you that the financial situation changes, pricing rates that we've risen have all affected, as I mentioned earlier, kind of small enterprises the most in first. We haven't seen an effect our larger enterprises, the multinational $1 billion-plus companies or our channel partners that are really our path towards the enterprise more broadly. So I think on that, it's been moderated a little bit in the small enterprise. When you look at the hyperscale, we continue to see strong demand on the hyperscale across all regions. I think we mentioned Portland was our largest this past quarter. Paris, with significant in EMEA. Osaka was significant in AP. And so we're seeing that across the board. We had large scale deals, as mentioned earlier, with an enterprise customer in Texas and Virginia. And so we're seeing larger scale deals. We're seeing it continue. Just a little bit of moderation, I think, in the small enterprises, but our pipeline is strong, resilient across all the different regions as well for you. So I think that hits everything you asked, Matt. Operator : The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : Bill, you mentioned sharpening the lens for new investments. Can you talk about, practically speaking, what changes there? And then, Andy, just on the minus 8.8% renewal spreads for larger deals. You mentioned that negotiations there began months ago. What would those rates kind of look like if they were done today? Arthur Stein : So sharpening the lens, I think practically, what you'll see is, over time, higher returns from the deals that we do and lower returning assets or investments dropping out of the mix. That's the practical implication. So obviously, it's more complicated than that because we look at risk-adjusted returns. We look at what return should be in any given market, what type of -- whether it's a build-to-suit or a speculative development, how much preleasing there is, whether there's any magnetic attributes to the customer. But in general, I think you'll see over time, higher yields. Andrew Power : And then, Aryeh, before I get to your question, I just want to apologize, I misspoke in answering Matt's question, we had 2 months, not 1.5 months of the Teraco. Those numbers I quoted you in our financials. So just want to clean that one up. So as I mentioned before, the cash mark to markets have been moving in our favor for, call it, since we turned into 2022. And I would say, been strengthening along the way, and you saw that in our numbers, and you saw that in our guidance. That being said, as I've said before, we're not going to be universally at this minute without any negative market across any different product in any given quarter. I think the driver of the negative $8.8 million actually was a data center -- a one-off data center we acquired a couple of years back in Chicago. That customer's contract was in place. It was above market at the time. The markets scribed not caught up to when it rolled. I think the more strategic and important story about that asset is that the -- we literally just greenlight the conversion of some of the shelf space into growing our colo footprint in the suburbs of Chicago, which has been a really great success more recently. To go on to your question on, call it, I think it's bigger deals, price action in just the past year, not our biggest deal that I mentioned, which is the called build-to-suit. But I think our second biggest deal, which was a sizable plus megawatt deal. That transaction in North America signed and caught almost 18% net effective rates higher than a similar size transaction did, call it, a year prior. And the remaining space in that actually facility is probably being marketed up another 10%, 15%. Now we have an in that remaining space. So you're seeing a quick reversal in some of these markets where, again, demand is continually is robust and diverse, and the supply is being windled down. Operator : The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. David Guarino : On the inclusion of the CPI linked to rent escalators, is that a trend you're seeing from hyperscale tenants? Or is that more heavily skewed towards the 0 to 1 megawatt bucket? And then the second question is, switching gears, just with the supply and power restrictions and a few of the top markets like Northern Virginia, do you think that's why you saw such strong demand in Dallas and Hillsboro this quarter? And are there any other spillover markets that you're seeing early signs of demand picking up that maybe they could have went to NOVA, if there was capacity there? Andrew Power : Thanks, David. So first off, CPI was a predominant term, I would say, mostly in our European footprint, even before inflation was such a buzzword. Hence -- and that's the majority of, call it, just under 20% of our in-place contracts that have CPI escalations. We've been, call it, in the face of the current environment, making this a priority in our customer discussions. And it's not -- we're seeking that on larger contracts as well as -- larger contracts as well as smaller contracts. I would tell you, on a smaller contract, that already likely had a shorter duration, i.e., 2 years, 3 years, it's probably a little bit less a priority because you get another bite at the apple depending on the market rates. But we're trying to push it into those contracts. But if you look at our signings, we had a record quarter, 176 and 40% had CPI escalation. Some of them had capped or, call it, 2% or 3% on the floor and call it, 5% or 6% on the cap. But we were able to include in a significant percentage of our greater than 1 megawatt signings this CPI escalation. And those look greater than 1 megawatt science are typically the longest conference call it, 10 years. Hence, where it's the most needed because we won't get another opportunity to reset to the appropriate market rates for a fair bit of time. When it goes to NOVA spillover Dallas, Portland, I don't think -- our activity -- I would not describe our activity as spillover activity. The Dallas activity, a good portion of that was this build-to-suit customer demand. That customer picked -- they wanted multiple cities, so they're always going to pick not just NOVA. And then the Portland demand was very, call it, locational sensitive. I do think you -- and this is a -- I mean you don't typically buy data centers like rushing to the grocery store and grab some of the shelf and run into the checkout. So in the last 90 days, when this NOVA power issues come on the scene, I think the spillover effects are still playing out as we speak. I would say we see more of the early interest of spillover effects to, call it, Atlanta where we have, call it, almost 30-megawatt shell capacity, Northern New Jersey, potentially Chicago. Dallas could be in the mix as well. But -- as well as -- I mean, nearby spillover tech in Manassas, we have 200 megawatts. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Elias of Cowen and Company. Michael Elias : Congrats on the leasing. Just two questions for me. First is, as you think of Northern Virginia and the power delays, you mentioned how the conversations are evolving with Dominion. But how are the conversations going with the customers themselves who pre-leased capacity. Is there any risk to those leases maybe being canceled or anything like that? And then second, your leverage is now running around 6.7x or 6.4x if we adjust for forward. Based on the conversations you've had with the rating agencies, what's the highest level of leverage that you can hold before you run the risk of maybe being downgraded or losing that investment-grade status? Andrew Power : Thanks, Michael. I think we saved the best for last. So happy to take through both these. So the -- I think the customers are obviously alarmed, right? Most of these customers probably never experienced anything like this. But at the same time, I think they're incredibly grateful that they're in our hands and not some upstart competitor. And I know I'm biased in saying that, but I really mean it when. We're the largest in the market with a diverse set of campuses, of, call it, 0.5 gig of IT load and a truly experienced team holding their hands through it. And I'll reiterate what I said before, while I cannot guarantee it right now, we are optimistic that the responsible parties in Loudon will work with Digital to deliver on behalf of all of these customers. As it relates to your second question, we are -- obviously, the leverage has ticked up a little bit here. We are -- this is not a new normal. This is not where we desire to be. We've had a lot of moving parts in our capital stack with asset sales, joint ventures, acquisition closings with partial periods. We still have, call it, $0.5 billion of equity forward, which we've not drawn down. And we see a path to return to target leverage through leasing up our vacant capacities. We had -- you saw the occupancy, which was a great stack, really moving the needle on a sequential basis. We are seeing a more friendly mark-to-market in our cash flows. And we're going to do what we've been doing for a long time, which is capital recycling and tapping into our private capital sources. We sold billions of dollars of noncore assets and joint ventures. And that's going to continue to be our playbook. And we think there's a great lineup of partners that want to work with us to call it, CR leverage to be a capital partner to Digital Realty. That will bring that leverage back down towards target levels. Operator : That ends our question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein, for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead. Arthur Stein : Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the third quarter, as outlined on the last page of our presentation. First, digital transformation remains an important secular driver of our business and drove record quarterly bookings. These additional commitments are reflected in our growing development pipeline and the high level of preleasing. Second, we continue to enhance our global platform with the closing of Teraco, giving Digital Realty the leading position in South Africa and a critical complement to our existing capabilities elsewhere in EMEA. Third, we continue to execute with improving results in our core data center business, though these improvements are masked by foreign exchange headwinds. Finally, the capital markets are very -- were very volatile in the third quarter, and we've taken action by adding significant liquidity to our balance sheet and prioritizing our new investments. Before signing off, I'd like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team here at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. I hope all of you will remain safe and healthy, and we look forward to seeing many of you at Nareit next month in San Francisco. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, Andrea and welcome everybody to Digital Realty\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on today\u2019s call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today\u2019s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter. First, the combination of strong demand and tightening levels of supply are translating into broad-based price improvements, which is reflected in the increased re-leasing spread expectations and the positive inflection in stabilized NOI growth that we are forecasting for 2023. Second, we remain focused on achieving the highest potential returns on investment and some progress on this front is evident in the sequential improvement in our development pipeline yields. And third, as most of you already know, we have made some changes to our management team since we last reported. Andy and Matt both have a long history with Digital and as expected, the transition has been seamless. But just as important, they also bring fresh perspective and energy to their new roles and the team remains excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. Andy Power : Thanks, Jordan and thanks to everyone for joining our call. While my voice is probably pretty familiar to most of you, this is my first earnings call as CEO of Digital Realty. I am honored to lead Digital Realty\u2019s incredible global team and I am optimistic and excited as ever about the opportunity that lies ahead. I want to thank both the Board for their confidence in me and the support that they provide in executing our strategy and thank Bill Stein, who I first met in 2004 as we worked together on Digital\u2019s IPO for his leadership over these many years. Finally, I want to thank the numerous customers, partners, team members and shareholders for the kind words of support and encouragement that I have received over the past 2 months. When I joined Digital in 2015, we are primarily a North American scale data center provider. Since then, we have evolved the company to be a global provider of the full spectrum of scale, co-location and interconnection solutions to better serve the growing needs of our 4,000 plus customers. Today, Digital is the global data center leader with an unmatched footprint of over 300 data centers in over 50 metro areas in 28 countries on 6 continents. Globally, our portfolio comprises of more than 2.3 gigawatts of IT load and we have another 400 plus megawatts under construction. I am extremely proud of the success that we\u2019ve had and the position that we are in. But now is not the time to rest on our laurels as the path that has brought us to where we are today will not get us to where we want to be. In that being, we have swiftly taken action on a few fronts. First, we quickly backfilled the role of CFO with my long-time finance partner, Matt Mercier. Matt has played a leadership role across Digital\u2019s global finance organization for well over a decade, including the successful integration of multiple platform acquisitions and the implementation of systems that will provide the foundation for our operations and evolving strategy. Second, we aligned and combined our strategy of business segments and investments team to assure that we have the right capabilities and are making the right investments in order to deliver the global meeting place for service providers and enterprises. Third, we moved to align all technology under our Chief Technology Officer, including our CISO and our recently appointed Chief Information Officer which will support the acceleration of our journey and identity as both a technology and a real estate company. Recent product launches, including service fabric, demonstrate the potential of bringing together innovation and technology to help drive our customers\u2019 growth. Lastly, we further streamlined our global operations capabilities to maximize the potential of Digital Realty\u2019s 300 plus data centers and our people under the trusted hand of a long-time digital leader with a track record of bringing global teams together. And here is what\u2019s next on the agenda in terms of the top strategic priorities. First, as depicted on Slide 3, we will demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition. Through the continued execution of our meeting place strategy by delivering sustainable connectivity-rich solutions to our enterprise and service provider customers, which will translate into better organic growth over the medium and long-term. Along these lines, yesterday, we announced a new AWS Direct Connect on-ramp at Digital Realty\u2019s Ashburn campus, landing one of the highest consumption markets and adding coast-to-coast U.S. coverage to our robust existing portfolio of AWS Direct Connect locations across EMEA. And earlier this month, we advanced our commitment to sustainability with a new 10-year power purchase agreement for 116 megawatts of renewable energy, supporting the construction of a new solar park in Germany. Second, we are integrating and innovating our capabilities across our entire unmatched global asset portfolio and have topped the largest open network platform in the world. Many of these integration and innovation efforts will benefit both our customers as they seek to deploy new and complex workloads on the leading data center platform and our own internal team, unifying our ability to deliver value to the market. Lastly, many of you are familiar with my many fishing poles in the water mantra. And in this vein, we plan to further diversify and bolster our sources of capital in order to support our customer\u2019s rapidly growing digital infrastructure needs, while improving capital efficiency and returns for Digital Realty investors. The opportunity before us is tremendous. We have all the key ingredients at our fingertips and a long runway for growth. When I assessed the digital infrastructure landscape today, including its fundamental prospects and then how Digital Realty is positioned within this sector, I\u2019d say the following. First, demand for our product remains quite strong and well supported by ongoing digital transformation, migration to the cloud, and the overall evolution towards centralized compute. As it goes, technology begets technology. And the growth in high-performance compute infrastructure has driven innovation that tends to spur the next wave of growth in technology that in many respects, advances productivity and hopefully, over time, driving improvement to the overall quality of our lives. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last decade continue, we may now be on the precipice of the next wave of demand that will drive our sector for the next decade. For years, we have referenced new technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning as potential drivers of demand, but there have been relatively few identifiable workloads over specific infrastructure requirements tied to those specific technologies. The launch of ChatGPT 3.0 is a seemingly important milestone. Microsoft\u2019s incorporation of ChatGPT into Bing last week, Google is coming with the launch of Bard and Baidu\u2019s Ernie Bot all suggest that we are on the forefront of the broader introduction of AI, which could spawn a wave of adoption and a proliferation of use cases and ultimately drive demand for compute infrastructure at scale. This is our domain expertise. We are in the very early days of this technology and its potential and have yet to see the effects of its introduction in the data center sector, but we are well positioned to support our customers and partners and we are working diligently to understand how their requirements will evolve and making sure to incorporate these into our latest designs. Importantly, as we experience with the cloud, the advent of new technology can play out over a very extended timeframe. We have built Digital Realty with these timeframes in mind and plan to be there to support our existing and growing customer base across the globe in the future. Let\u2019s move to the quarter. Our core FFO landed within the implied guidance range that we provided last quarter as the term that is taking shape in our core portfolio continued to gain momentum. Capping off another record year of bookings, new leases signed moderated from the record we achieved in the prior quarter, but remained quite strong and were highlighted by a nice rebound in our 0 to 1 megawatt segment and record interconnection bookings. Demand was geographically broad-based with strong contributions from APAC, the Americas and EMEA. This demonstrates the breadth and momentum that we are seeing in this business, which is a reflection of our ongoing effort to deliver the meeting place for our service provider and enterprise customers. During the fourth quarter, we added 106 new customers, continuing the streak of 100 plus new logos that we have added each quarter since closing the InterXion transaction nearly 3 years ago. One of our key wins during the fourth quarter was an expansion of our relationship with Avnet, a leading global technology distributor and solution provider and a member of the Fortune 500. Avnet Integrated has standardized on PlatformDIGITAL for an initial three market deployment in Northern Virginia, Dallas and Silicon Valley. This partnership enables high-performance, cost effective computing solutions that can be deployed quickly in Digital Realty facilities globally while mitigating risk and complexity. A major global automotive manufacturer deploying internationally chose PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging Digital Realty\u2019s unrivaled global footprint and ability to manage complex deployments. 4 of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, including 3 of the 10 largest in Europe selected PlatformDIGITAL seeking network-oriented solutions ranging from hybrid IT, trading and market data support to high-performance computing and more. A leading global asset manager and service provider leveraged Digital Realty\u2019s HPE GreenLake alliance to significantly reduce networking and IT infrastructure complexity. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased yet again in the fourth quarter in each of our business segments, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of price improvements in 2022. We also continue to add more CPI-based escalators with approximately 25% of the newly signed leases in the quarter containing inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. We also saw another quarter of positive leasing spreads on renewals in the fourth quarter, helping to support a positive inflection for the full year 2022. While we acknowledge that the turn was driven by the strength in the 0 to 1 megawatt renewals, we are beyond the point of excuses and call us and prefer to highlight the forest rather than the trees and point to the overall inflection in market rents and re-leasing spreads that took place in 2022 as a whole. We expect market conditions to remain supportive this year and our guidance reflects a further inflection in this positive trend as Matt will lay out in a few minutes. Speaking of better pricing, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our largest market in Northern Virginia. We have continued to work constructively with the power provider in this market and we are now pleased to be in a position to say that we fully expect to be able to deliver on the commitments that we have made to our customers within our development pipeline. So while conditions are far from business as usual in this market, we are encouraged by the progress made over the last 90 days and remain hopeful that we will continue to be able to work with a local utility provider to support the growing needs of our mutual customers. Moving on to our investment activity. During the fourth quarter, we sold a 25% interest in a data center in Frankfurt, Germany to digital core REIT. The facility was valued at nearly $500 million and the transaction generated about $150 million of proceeds for Digital Realty. We also acquired land in 5 different metros for future development, including 2 organic new market entries into Rome and Akra [ph]. Rome is one of the largest cities in Europe by population, but has been essentially ignored by international data center providers. We have acquired a parcel within 15 kilometers off the coast that will make it an ideal interconnection point for future subsea cables that land in Rome, thereby enhancing our position in the Mediterranean while serving as a connectivity hub in the middle of the country. Before turning it over to Matt, I\u2019d like to reiterate my focus on ESG and share some of our recent progress with you. We were recognized by a variety of organizations for our ESG success, including for the sixth consecutive year, Digital was recognized by NAREIT with the Leader in the Light Award for Data Center sustainability. Sustainalytics recently included Digital Realty in the 2023 top-rated ESG company list. Newsweek recently named Digital as one of America\u2019s most responsible companies for 2023 and once again, Digital is one of the JUST Capital\u2019s Most JUST Companies. In addition to these awards, given the importance of energy security, availability and sustainability, Digital remains keenly focused on supporting the development of renewable power projects. During 2022, we contracted for a total of 470 megawatts of renewable energy and in green access to the energy grid and we already added another 160 megawatts of solar power to our portfolio in 2023. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. Before I turn it over to our new CFO to review our financial results, let me introduce Matt Mercier to those of you who don\u2019t already know him. Matt joined Digital in 2006 and has been my right-hand man, helping me run Digital\u2019s finance team. Matt has been intimately involved in nearly every facet of finance at Digital from capital markets to M&A, FP&A, IR and all things global finance. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to our new CFO, Matt Mercier. Matt Mercier : Thank you, Andy. I am privileged to succeed Andy as CFO and humbled by the opportunity to lead an incredibly capable team. Over the years, I have had a chance to meet and spend time with many of you and I look forward to catching up with all of you over the course of the next several months at industry conferences and events that we are slated to attend. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $117 million of new leases in the fourth quarter, highlighted by strong rebound in our 0 to 1 megawatt segment and record interconnection signings, which accounted for 40% of total bookings. Demand was geographically diverse, particularly within the greater than a megawatt segment, which saw nearly even contributions across the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions. 9 of our 10 largest deals in the quarter landed outside of North America, with strong contributions from Japan, South Africa, Latin America and Europe, demonstrating the increasingly global nature of our footprint and customer base. At the other end of the scale, somewhat in contrast to the hesitation we noted on our last call, we saw a nice bounce back within our smallest customer segment under 500 kilowatts, which delivered the second best quarterly leasing volume of 2022 at the highest average rate seen all year. Geographically, our 0 to 1 megawatt deals play to our strengths in EMEA and the Americas with EMEA setting a quarterly record for 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings. Importantly, pricing on new leases signed increased for the fourth consecutive quarter in each of our 0 to 1 and greater than a megawatt segments, reflecting improving fundamentals and tightening conditions across our regions. In the fourth quarter, we experienced nearly 90% customer retention and a further reduction in churn to just 0.8%, marking the lowest level in nearly 3 years, as our customers\u2019 digital infrastructure requirements continue to increase, but the prospect of future availability is decreasing. Turning to our backlog. On Page 9, the current backlog of signed, but not yet commenced leases increased to a record $477 million at year end, principally due to the inclusion of Teraco as other signings were largely offset by commencements. The lag between signings and commencements moderated slightly in the quarter, but remained elevated relative to historical levels at nearly 15 months due to a few larger longer term leases that require build-outs. Approximately, 60% of our record backlog is slated to commence throughout this year, split fairly evenly throughout the first and second halves. Moving on to Page 10, we signed $195 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter with pricing increases of 0.8% on a cash basis. For the full year, we renewed nearly $700 million of existing business at a 1.8% increase on a cash basis, a touch better than our upwardly revised guidance of slightly positive for 2022. Renewal rates in the fourth quarter for 0 to 1 megawatt renewals remained strong across each of our three regions and were up 4.1% overall, the strongest quarterly increase since adding interaction. As Andy referenced, we did see a 3.6% decline on renewals in the greater than a megawatt category in the quarter, entirely due to a single lease at a single asset. However, we saw a better-than-anticipated improvement in market rents and an inflection in re-leasing spreads in 2022. More importantly, market conditions improved throughout the last year and our guidance for 2023 reflects this positive trend. Turning to our results. Digital Realty delivered operating and financial performance in the fourth quarter that was largely consistent with our expectations, highlighted by improving core operating performance, progress toward enhancing our returns on investment and increased liquidity. Let\u2019s jump into the metrics on Page 11. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter core FFO per share of $1.65, consistent with the low end of our implied guidance range for the fourth quarter and down 1% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, given a seasonal acceleration in operating expenses, a significant uptick in interest rates and a full quarter\u2019s dilution associated with the acquisition of Teraco on August 1. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was down 1% sequentially, but was up 2% year-over-year. For the full year 2022, we reported constant currency core FFO per share of $6.91, representing 6% growth over 2021. The improvement in operating performance is best gauged by our stabilized same capital portfolio, which was challenged in the first half of the year, but improved meaningfully in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter when stripping out the noise related to FX. Focusing on top line, data center revenue growth on a constant currency basis improved steadily throughout 2022 increasing by 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a 1.8% decline in the first quarter, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we flagged last quarter. The sequential step-up from 3Q to 4Q was largely driven by an 80 basis point improvement in occupancy as commencements outpace churn as well as the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads and growing interconnection revenues. Turning to our currency slide on Page 12. 56% of our fourth quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 20% in euros, 7% in British pounds, 6% in Singapore dollars and 2% in Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar reversed course from the strength we have seen throughout the first 9 months of the year, removing the headwind on reported sequential growth. Nevertheless, the dollar was meaningfully stronger than it was versus 2021, negatively impacting our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 500 basis points a piece. Turning to the balance sheet on Page 13. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 6.9x, while fixed charge coverage was at 4.9x. Given the sharp recovery in the euro and the pound in the fourth quarter and the convention of how leverage is calculated with the average exchange rate used for calculated adjusted EBITDA and the spot rate used to mark our debt at year-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was inflated by approximately 0.2 turns using the average exchange rate to mark our debt at year-end. Our leverage would be 6.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Since our last call, we drew the remaining $500 million outstanding from our 2021 forward equity offering and tapped our 5.55% 2028 notes for an additional $350 million to bring the total amount raised on that bond to $900 million. Since year-end, we also closed a $740 million 2-year term loan with a 1-year extension option. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that our investment grade credit ratings were affirmed with stable outlooks by all three rating agencies since our last call. While leverage is above our historical average and our long-term target, we have bolstered our liquidity, and we intend to reduce leverage towards our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 5 years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.7%. Approximately 86% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let\u2019s turn to our guidance on Page 14. We have provided an initial core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75, reflecting flat growth at the midpoint of the range. as the recovery in our stabilized portfolio is balanced by the impact of higher interest expense and capital recycling. Focusing in on the organic recovery we forecast for 2023, we expect Cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads to improve to greater than 3%, same capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and an 80 basis point uplift in total portfolio occupancy at the midpoint of our expected range by year-end. Importantly, as Andy referenced at the outset, one of our key priorities is to further diversify and bolster our capital sources, which is geared towards increasing our capital efficiency and investment returns while reducing leverage towards our long-term target. As reflected in this guidance, throughout 2023, we expect to recycle capital from a combination of non-core dispositions, joint ventures of core assets and joint ventures of scale development in select core markets. In addition, we expect to benefit from high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, the retention of free cash flow and the moderation of recent currency headwinds. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ari Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ari Klein : Thanks and congrats, Andy and Matt on the new role. Maybe just starting on the balance sheet, the $2 billion in asset sales and JV is targeted for the year. Can you give us some additional color on the split between the two, the types of assets, the timing and pricing is a pretty wide range? Anything you can add on that front? Andy Power : Thanks, Ari. This is Andy. Why don\u2019t I kick it off, and then I\u2019ll hand it to Greg on, call it, valuations and we will receive in a broader asset class. So it\u2019s $2 billion at the midpoint as our funding plan. As a reminder, this has been part of our playbook for several years. I think we\u2019ve either sold outright or joint venture close to $4 billion of assets over the last handful of years. The competition is really threefold : one called rounding therapies or completion of our non-core assets, disposition program; selling outright to joint ventures around our stabilized assets; and three, joint ventures around our development program. Rough ballpark on numbers, I would say, the non-core dispositions are probably in the 500-ish area and the other two buckets are taking up the majority of the $2 billion at the midpoint. Greg, do you want to come in on valuations and broader? Greg Wright : Yes. Thanks, Ari. Look, I think when you look at the \u2013 let\u2019s look at first at the stabilized JVs and the development JVs, I mean, clearly, we are seeing strong demand for those assets. The private markets have a strong bid for those assets given the quality of the assets, stability of the income stream, the creditworthiness of the customer base. And the fact, quite frankly, that\u2019s a hard asset class with strong secular demands we\u2019ve seen really a significant rotation in the data center space from private capital over the last couple of years. Not to mention strong improvement in pricing and lower vacancies in all of our major markets have really gotten investors\u2019 attention in terms of growth potential. So on that front we still think pricing has held in there. We\u2019ve seen some transactions in the market recently. There is been some smaller transactions. We\u2019re also aware of three sizable hyperscale platforms where that pricing is staying strong from what I understand. But what it tells us is that the sellers and their equity backers, who we think are sophisticated, are seeing strong value. So simply put money on the sideline is outweighing the investment opportunities. And then in terms of cap rates with respect to the non-core asset sales, I mean, clearly, they are going to be all over the place like we\u2019ve seen in the past. As you recall, over the last few years, we\u2019ve sold roughly $2 billion of these non-core assets. And at some point, we talked about having roughly $1.5 billion left. But look, I think, when you look at this, it\u2019s important to understand that many of these assets are at different stages. So cap rates will end up in a range, and you look at our range right now at 0% to 10%, and it clearly depends on specific conditions. For example, if we sell land, right, that\u2019s a zero cap rate. So there is a wide range and it depends on the asset. Ari Klein : Got it. And then just maybe a follow-up just on the leverage, if you do all this, where do you think that gets you to exiting 2023? Thanks. Matt Mercier : Yes. Ari, this is Matt. Thanks for the question. So look, I think with the way that we\u2019re looking at our plan this year, as Greg and Andy mentioned, in terms of $2 billion at the midpoint for asset sales and joint ventures, really being the bulk of funding for our \u2013 the development spend that we have left. And then if you look at \u2013 we\u2019re looking at 8% to 9% growth in our adjusted EBITDA, which I think will be a big part of our deleveraging plan also for this year. So without giving a specific number, I would say we\u2019re going to be well on our way to bringing leverage back down closer to 6x by the end of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch base just on the general demand environment. It\u2019s nice to see a pickup in kind of some of the enterprise colo bookings. Maybe you could talk about what you see in the hyperscale funnel. We obviously heard some a couple of hyperscalers talking about a bit of a slowing in revenue growth, but it seems like demand remains pretty robust, and maybe you could kind of touch on that for us? Andy Power : Corey, do you want to hit on the demand overall first? Corey Dyer : Yes. I\u2019ll hit the demand overall. Thanks, first of all, for the question, Eric. Look, demand remains as strong as ever, and we\u2019re more than happy with kind of what our pipeline looks like and whether or not we\u2019ve got enough to support our demand on the hyperscale end and actually I should just say thanks for the recognition on the improvement around enterprise and still 1 megawatt. But on the enterprise, we\u2019re still seeing some really strong demand across and across the globe, really the traditional large build, but also some other interconnection needs. These hyperscalers are starting to come up for their connectivity options. It\u2019s really the advantages that our portfolio plays out for them. We\u2019re seeing that continue to grow that demand from them, utilizing our platform as a meeting place as they need to enhance their connectivity requirement. And so you\u2019re seeing that across both places. And I would tell you that you also see the merits of our relationship around the opportunity to build up from the activity perspective for them. When you think through the cost and the difficulty getting power that we have right now, these hyperscalers and our relationship with them continue to evolve. I think improved and the value that we continue to bring to them will continue to drive demand for us and see the pipeline build across all of our regions, so really happy with where we are on that as well as the come back on the enterprise as well. Thanks a lot, Eric. Eric Luebchow : Great. And just one follow-up, I just wanted to touch base on the renewal spread that you guided to this year. Any kind of color you can provide on how those will shake out versus the greater than 1 megawatt versus the sub 1 megawatt category? And are there any markets I\u2019m big in Northern Virginia where supply is extremely limited, where you\u2019re really starting to see material rental improvements throughout the year? Thanks. Andy Power : Sure. I mean I think we\u2019ve seen this pendulum on pricing moving our favor now for several quarters. It started to move at the beginning of 2022, gain steam, became more broad-brushed and I think it was a combination of not only supply and demand, but our value proposition really resonating with our customer base. In a backdrop, we\u2019re quite honestly, it\u2019s never probably been harder if you bring on capacity, procure power as well as the asset plan. This is \u2013 we ended the year overall in positive territory. The less than 1 megawatt, which is becoming a much larger and larger portion of our revenue base obviously led the way. We had some positive quarters in greater than net. We had some slightly negative quarters. If you look at the greater than 1 megawatt, again, and I know we\u2019re really tied to making excuses. It takes one single deal just to pull it down, just call to 3% in that category when predominant deals are moving in positive territory. This year is the first called overall inflection to positive territory and cash mark-to-markets in several years, where we\u2019re guiding to for 2023 will be literally the best cash mark-to-market inflection in close to 10 years for our business, and it\u2019s obviously it\u2019s increasingly a dramatic amount. And I think all those things I just mentioned in terms of our value proposition as well as supply/demand moving in our favor. Ashburn is \u2013 or Northern Virginia, excuse me, is a prime example of it. This quarter, 170 million of gap, 50 almost 60 megawatts had almost nil Ashburn signings in it. And you could say last quarter did not have a super large amount either due to, call it, the tightness of that market, the coming or deliveries or bringing on more capacity. So we don\u2019t have a water statistical set of data to point to. But what we\u2019re seeing on the quotes going out, the interactions with new customers is that these rates are moving swiftly well past the hundreds into the much more firmer territory and still have ways to go in terms of runway. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jon Atkin : Thanks. So I was interested in just kind of big picture, your first conference call as CEO, any kind of principles to underscore things to contemplate and things to be putting into action around changes in overall operating practices, changes in product focus strategy. I think you already hit on capital allocation, but just any kind of big picture kind of items to call out? And then secondly, maybe for Matt, but as we look at the FFO per share guidance for the year, what are the sort of operating catalysts that you can identify that might get neutral to the upper end of that range? I think you talked about renewal spreads, but what\u2019s your cover over kind of hitting the midpoint or maybe at the midpoint based when you see your commencement pipeline just the overall pricing comes? Thanks. Andy Power : Thanks, John. I\u2019ll tackle the first one and then let Matt tell you how we\u2019re going to beat the guidance we just put out an hour ago in real time to that one. So I won\u2019t rehash it what was all throughout the script of what\u2019s taking place for the last 60 days. But I can tell you, in that time had \u2013 I was able to see all three of our regions a lot of time with customers, the team made it home for Valentine\u2019s Day preschool and be able to put some preliminary thoughts together on top priorities, which I outlined in the prepared remarks. But just to rehash them in a little bit greater detail. Obviously, first and foremost is demonstrably strengthening our customer value proposition. That is number one for an important reason. We\u2019ve obviously assembled in a playful collection of digital in assets over the last several years, both inorganically and organically with what we\u2019re doing in the likes of Rome, Barcelona, Israel, across Africa. Mexico City and even so harnessing the power of that platform is sort of the full customer spectrum with this diverse array of capabilities is going to be key. I firmly believe in delivering that to our customers with a global scale and consistency with true local expertise and really become that meeting place for both the enterprise and the service provider customers plus in 50 in growing metros north of 30 countries and 6 continents, all with the vein of accelerating our pricing power, internal and organic growth. Two, integrating and innovating is priority number two. We\u2019ve had years of M&A that is in the rearview mirror. Just quite frankly, I think all the critical puzzle pieces when it comes to what we do have been taken off the board and we got more than our fair share. We need to complete that integration work and complete our own digital transformation, making it easier and for internal and external customers and also continue advancing on our innovation, both on the connectivity as well as the physical infrastructure front. You\u2019ve seen at the likes of service fabric, which is just still in its infancy. And it\u2019s got many great growth states to come. You\u2019ll see that on the space and power front or things like Direct Connect, we landed in such a high consumption market with AWS just announced yesterday, along with pressing our sustainability leadership and making sure that we are lifting the bar for our industry and our asset class and doing what\u2019s right for our customers and the world we live in. All that is about \u2013 it\u2019s about elevating a data-driven approach to all facets of our business. Last but not least, again, diversify and bolster our capital sources. It\u2019s about completing the non-core dispose we\u2019ve talked about and then expanding our private capital partnership programs for both stabilized as well as development hyperscale assets with that in mind of enhancing capital efficiency, accelerating growth and returns to our digital shareholders. So that\u2019s the nuts and bolts of the 3-point plan, and I\u2019ll let Matt tackle your second question. Jon Atkin : Yes. Maybe just quickly just quick, yes, if I could just see in the direction. On the third-party funding of the development pipeline, what are \u2013 you have not done that to my recollection recently. And I am just interested, are there particular challenges around governance? Is it the economics? Is it finally the right partner or the right projects? What are some of the kind of factors that I think it\u2019s hard on that which you might need some sort of lower expense from JV through your development pipeline? Andy Power : I think you had six more questions in there, Jon. But the \u2013 as Greg touched on already, there is been a dramatic rotation of capital into digital infrastructure. And there is just not enough places to put it in terms of assets built or coming right now. And we\u2019re a great partner for that. We\u2019ve had a history of partnership. We\u2019ve done versions of this in parts of the world, be it Latin America or Africa and expanding that use of capital to \u2013 or call it, with traditional markets to accelerate our capital efficiency and tap into the resources of our platform and monetize these long runways of growth we have for the hyperscalers is really the playbook. So I don\u2019t think there is \u2013 we\u2019re all about trying to piece this together any simple fiduciary in mind playbook, limiting confident games. So we\u2019re going to be looking and already have been talking to partners that are like-minded in that approach long-term investors in the space that really appreciate the value we deliver for our customers day in and day out. Maybe Matt, do you want to quickly do Jon\u2019s question because I\u2019m sure we got a few of others as well. Matt Mercier : Yes. So, Jon, look, I think to be brief, we feel pretty good about the fundamentals of the business. I think that we have talked about, a number of us have talked about, pricing and demand feel good. And therefore, that leads us to have strong conviction on our same capital cash NOI growth and the associated mark-to-markets that are going to help drive that. And then on top of that, in terms of continuing to lease up our development pipeline, that goes back to, again, feeling strong about where we are in the demand cycle and our ability to capture that. So, what that leaves remaining, I would say is timing around when the dispositions and the joint venture capital come to close. And maybe last, I know we talked about FX a lot last year. Right now, we are assuming that FX is neither a headwind nor a tailwind, but that\u2019s also something we can\u2019t control that could have influenced next year based on where we are in the economy. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Elias of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. My first question for you is, I mean you have talked about establishing this global interconnection platform and you have taken steps to do that with Telx, InterXion and then also Telko [ph]. As we think about the next steps for you guys, what are the most meaningful steps you could take to accelerate your traction on the interconnection front, is it adding more cloud on ramps? Is it building platform capabilities, what is that? And then my second question for you would be, in the past, you talked about doing $1.5 billion of non-core asset dispositions over the coming quarters. And now it sounds like, we are at $500 million. Just wondering what changed in terms of your view on the dispositions, is it just timing, or was the cap rate environment not supportive of you getting the valuations that you want? Thank you. Andy Power : So, why don\u2019t we take in reverse, so Greg, why don\u2019t you hit on the program versus what gets done in calendar 2023. Greg Wright : Sure. Thanks Michael. I hope you are well. Look, I want to be clear. First of all, we talked about the $1.5 billion estimate of non-core assets previously. I hope we made it clear that\u2019s what was remaining. So, we sold $2 billion. And we said whether it was a quarter or two quarters ago that we had another $1.5 billion left. We didn\u2019t suggest that we were going to sell that all over the next several quarters, and we wouldn\u2019t suggest that. But instead, we said over time. So, as you look at that $1.5 billion and how it\u2019s going to start to run off, we earmarked roughly $500 million of that for \u201823. And if you look back at our level of activity, whether it was \u201822, \u201821, \u201820, there is obviously different volumes in those years. It\u2019s never perfect. Things roll over from 1 year to the next. Quite frankly, from my perspective, whether it\u2019s May or July, I don\u2019t think it really matters to say whether it\u2019s front half of the year or the back half of the year. But look, that has not changed. And again, just as our cap rate range this year is zero to 10%, it was the same last year, and the volumes haven\u2019t changed. So again, it\u2019s \u2013 I would say we are continuing to execute upon that program that we articulated to the market a couple of years ago. Actually, it\u2019s been 3-plus years ago now. And look, I would like to think we have done a pretty good job with it. So, that\u2019s it on that front. Andy Power : And then, Michael, on your second question, listen, I think I look at it as a coming together of numerous puzzle pieces here. One, we have been adding the critical locations the world that our customers need for a full platform solution, grow to north of 50 metropolitan areas, 30-plus countries across six continents. And really, I would say, demonstrably leading coverage in some of the hardest parts of the world with their irreplaceable platform capabilities. Two, adding to that legacy magnetic destinations or customers and next-generation versions of those magnets. And we have seen many of those press released across multiple categories Others have less no variety, but ensuring the broadest attractiveness for our customer base based on our curation of our meeting player community. Three, has been technology to bear. Internal technology I talked about. We have been eating our own cooking when it comes to digital transformation and tying this together for our internal team members, which ultimately provides better experiences for our customers and remove the friction in their procurement and their business. And lastly, external innovation, which we have been doing with the likes of evolving from Service Exchange to ServiceFabric tying together our connectivity platforms. And then harnessing all that in one platform offering essentially that has the best of both worlds, a global platform, $50-plus billion enterprise serving the largest customers to the most local customers and doing it that scale and expertise combined with true on-the-ground local experience. But Chris can maybe add on some of the technology elements as well. Chris Sharp : Yes. I appreciate it, Andy. And thank you, Michael, for the question. Yes, ServiceFabric, I mean it\u2019s something that we have talked about for some time now. It\u2019s a purpose-built product that enhances the customer experience. And we have been aligning with our customers to remove that complexity. And quite frankly, it facilitates an easier process of deployment for our customers. And just to underpin Andy\u2019s kind of position around the broader reach, I think one of the things that\u2019s also driving a lot of traction and value to both our enterprise and our hyperscale customers as an open ecosystem that really accelerates the growth of the enterprise and they can solve more use cases and more markets on PlatformDIGITAL. And I think that\u2019s the key element that we are highlighting. And quite frankly, you are starting to see even yesterday with the announcement of the on-ramp coming into Ashburn. That\u2019s one of the largest cloud operators aligning to one of the largest markets for Digital Realty today. And I think just to underpin a couple of metrics. That\u2019s 25 data centers with 500-plus megawatts. So, if you slow down and you think about that, the value that\u2019s going to be created and to be further created in that market is demonstrable. And so the underpinning of why we brought ServiceFabric to market where we have purpose-built software developers, really we are moving that complexity and the last piece is in investing in our customers. We don\u2019t want to compete with them. So, you will see the likes of a further set of press releases coming out with bare metals, security, it\u2019s the full culmination of what enterprises are looking to do on that hybrid IT enablement, which is core to a broad swath of customers that we are servicing today and quite frankly, that we will be servicing in the not-too-distant future. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. I just want to also extend my congratulations to Andy and Matt in the new roles. If I can ask two financial questions. And I am just looking at Slide 14 from the deck. So, the first question is if you look at the midpoint of revenue growth guidance for revenue and EBITDA, can you break out the organic portion of the growth relative on revenue, you will have energy and you will have acquisitions and divestitures kind of a mix of stuff as you have been recycling assets and investing in new ones? And then for EBITDA, just split between the organic and the M&A impact? And then the second question, as you look at the EBITDA growth and you look at the core FFO per share growth, what is holding back the piece parts holding back core FFO per share growth? And what are the opportunities for Digital Realty to unlock that in the future and get back to see a more consistent relationship of the EBITDA growth relative to what that core profit per share growth should do? Thanks. Matt Mercier : Sure, Mike. So, let\u2019s talk about revenue because I think that\u2019s the one that\u2019s got more \u2013 a little bit more to unpack in it for when you are looking year-over-year. So, I think as most of us know, power has been a big topic, and we expect to be \u2013 continue to be a topic. We are, like other operators seeing increases in power costs, particularly in EMEA. So, if you look at that growth, it\u2019s around 23% from 22%, the midpoint 23%, roughly 14% of that is tied to utility reimbursements correlated to higher expected power costs. And just a reminder, we expect the majority \u2013 I would say the majority of our contracts are full pass-through. And even those contracts that are not full pass-through, we have for the majority of those, we have the ability to pass on price increases, which we either have done or will do soon. So, we are not expecting any or very minimal bottom line impact to our results in \u201823 from higher power costs. So, that also \u2013 when you then net that down, you are talking about roughly speaking, 9% growth in our rental and interconnection revenue driven by the business, which also coincides with the growth in adjusted EBITDA that you will see there as you do \u2013 as you have done the math as well. In terms of then having that flow down to core FFO, look, I think part of that is what\u2019s in the plan this year is to set us up for being able to do that going forward, being able to continue to leverage the fundamentals that are continuing to improve and accrue to our favor as demonstrated by the growth of the stabilized portfolio, so that when we get our leverage down and balance sheet and a stronger position, we should be able to see that going forward in \u201824. Michael Rollins : And does that mean that the PowerCo deal, the recycling divestitures that you did, those are kind of a neutral impact on the revenue and EBITDA growth rates for 2023 over 2022? Matt Mercier : So, the \u2013 I guess I will answer that in terms of like we are \u2013 obviously, timing is a factor, but our \u2013 the disposition, call it, joint venture capital plan that we have laid out, the range takes into consideration those potential dispositions. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Andy and Matt congrats both on your new roles. I had a question about the supply chain. I was just wondering with supply chain constraints loosening, are you seeing maybe some of your larger customers moving slower or less actively engaged in procuring space they need maybe several years out giving shortening lead times. And then if I could just sneak in one more. I wanted to ask about the dividend. We are talking a lot about funding the business through divestitures and whatnot. I am just wondering how maybe Matt or even Andy, you are thinking about dividend per share, optimal payout levels. And is that even a lever you would be willing to consider to pull in order maybe to help fund the business and de-lever faster? Thanks. Andy Power : Thank you again. So, on supply chain, the \u2013 I would say there is a loosening, but I would say we are not back to normal. And the production slots that become available seem to get gobbled up quickly. So \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say that there has been a correlation between customer buying behaviors through to our supply chains. I mean quite frankly, which is a contributor to the pricing revival has been that the demand is remaining quite firm across the board for both enterprise and hyperscale business. And it\u2019s outpacing supply and supply is \u2013 I think that disconnect is in many money markets is going to continue for some time. You have got things like power shortages, you have got municipalities, you have got permitting, you got environmental impact. There is a whole host of reasons why it\u2019s a lot harder today to bring on capacity efficiently and effectively. I think we in our platform stand out above many, given our expertise, our time doing in business, our relationships, our consistency. But it\u2019s definitely helping on the overall pricing dynamic. And I don\u2019t think I have seen a correlation to customers feeling the luxury of time when they are buying and especially the larger customers, I wouldn\u2019t say are taking a wait and see due to that whatsoever. Matt, do you want to handle the dividend question? Matt Mercier : Sure. I mean look, ultimately, the dividend is a Board level decision. I would \u2013 what I would add on to that is that it\u2019s \u2013 in where we are, we would \u2013 our objective is to maximize our free cash flow available to us to fund the business. And then in relation to the dividend, we want to make sure that we are paying out 100% of our taxable income. We want to make sure that we have an appropriate payout ratio. And then on top of that, we need to consider some of the some of our plans, which include potential for dispositions that could generate capital gains that could also be part of that analysis. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. What, if you can \u2013 a couple of questions on Ashburn. If you could walk us through sort of the available power and kind of the assurance that you have that those big lots to be there when you need them? And then kind of a follow-up on that, are you seeing any changes in the buying patterns from your customers? Are they re-architecting deployments so that they can push more things outside of Ashburn to kind of avoid some of these issues in the future? Any of that kind of activity would be helpful. Andy Power : Sure. Thanks Frank. So, I mean Ashburn, I would say overall, the story remains the same of what transpired at the end of last summer. And the power \u2013 incremental power deliveries into the largest, most robust in the first market, quite frankly, in the world, is going to be restrained greatly for several years. Last quarter, I basically said I couldn\u2019t guarantee it, but I have confidence that we, working with the power providers will be able to deliver on our customer commitments, which represents the lion\u2019s share of just shy of 80 megawatts we have in our development cycle. Today, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we are good to go. We will be able to deliver for those customers, and there is no concerns about the power being available. What comes next is still to be determined. So IP, and again, similar solid answers I provide, I can\u2019t promise you this, I can\u2019t guarantee it. But I do have a strong amount of confidence that the tools in our tool kit at Digital Realty, given our experience in region, our critical and strategic landholdings, our breadth of infrastructure and our relationships will be able to be creative in terms of bringing on some incremental power deliveries in this bottleneck period. That is on top of what I would say is, obviously, Ashford is our largest market. I just looked at the 2023 expirations, while we are \u2013 we certainly have a higher retention, lower churn year expected relative to prior years. A large portion of our expected churn happens to be in Ashburn, which is a blessing given the ability to remarket that space at higher and better uses. So, all of these, but the Ashford story or saga continues, but broadly, it is greatly improving the pricing dynamic to a much more healthier environment for digital and other providers in the market. In terms of buying patterns, just tremendous amount of infrastructure across this part of Northern Virginia is not really shifting large-scale demand to other locations to any great stakes. So, folks are still clamoring for available capacity or staying where they are with us or in market, and we have not seen a title shift on this market and it will take a few years, but the Calgary is supposedly coming with new power brining project in the region from the South and the North. Frank Louthan : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. Andy Power : Thank you, Andrea. So, in my earlier remarks, I did mention something we didn\u2019t talk about on in the Q&A, but I do think this is an incremental tailwind of demand for our industry and Digital Realty as it relates to AI-related applications that we believe is on the precipice of driving an incremental wave of demand. As a result, I just recently asked ChatGPT, how AI would impact demand for data centers. Here is a summary of the response, and I quote, \u201cThe impact of artificial intelligence and the demand for data centers is likely to be significant in the coming years. As AI continues to gain traction and more and more businesses adopt AI-powered solutions, the demand for data storage and processing is expected to increase significantly. AI also has the potential to create new data-intensive applications such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and personalized medicine, further driving the demand for data centers. In short, the impact of AI on the demand for data centers is expected to be substantial and companies operating in this space are well positioned to benefit from this trend.\u201d Obviously, self-serving \u2013 but when you see some of the innovation that\u2019s playing out here and just the general media in the news, this AI trend has certainly come to fruition. And while this AI is certainly still in its development phase, we at Digital Realty, agree and excited \u2013 are excited by the forecast that ChatGPT just provided. In closing, Digital Realty had a strong 2022. We believe we are making the appropriate adjustments here and now in 2023 to position us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity that lies before us. I would like to thank all of our data team and exceptional team members of Digital Realty and everyone on this call for joining us today. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty\u2019s Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator. And welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty\u2019s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today\u2019s call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey Dyer are also on the call, and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today\u2019s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, our customer value proposition is resonating as we delivered yet another strong quarter of nearly $50 million of leasing in our zero to one plus interconnection segment, including our second strongest quarter of bookings in EMEA and record interconnection bookings, helping to push interconnection revenue over $100 million in the quarter for the first time. Second, the first quarter delivered on the inflection and fundamentals we have guided to for 2023 as demonstrated by 4.5% re-leasing spreads on renewals and a 3.4% increase in stabilized portfolio cash NOI growth. And, third, we remain confident in our funding plan for 2023. We are deeply engaged in the process with multiple institutional buyers, including new and existing partners and we\u2019ll update you on specifics once we finalize the transactions. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. Andy Power : Thanks, Jordan. Thanks to everyone for joining our call. Digital Realty remained focused on our customers and executing our strategic plan while delivering a strong first quarter despite global uncertainty. This included reaching another major milestone with our platform now supporting 5,000 customers worldwide. We posted strong sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, and remained focused on disciplined capital allocation, while benefiting from strong secular trends supporting the data center industry. Last quarter, I identified strengthening our customer value proposition as one of our key strategic priorities. Let me expand on this a bit. Digital Realty has been on a journey since 2015 when we acquired Telx to expand our product offering and global footprint in order to provide the full spectrum of data center solutions to our customers. At the time, we said that we were seeking to expand our product mix and presence in the attractive colocation and interconnection space. When we announced that deal, our annual colocation revenues were about $88 million, which is less than the bookings we posted in the last two quarters in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment. Since 2015, we\u2019ve expanded our colocation and connectivity capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, including the [indiscernible] portfolio, Interxion, the Westin Building, Altus IT, Lambda Helix, Medallion and Teraco. Today, our 0-1 megawatt segment revenues are well over $1 billion and represent 35% of total annualized rent, including a few colo and connectivity oriented organic new market additions that are currently underway and other important subsea cable landing station oriented to facilities, we expect to soon have a presence in more than 30 countries across six continents. Importantly, according to Cloudscene\u2019s H2, 2022 Data Center Ecosystem Leaderboard Results, which ranks operators based on their data center footprint and performance with a focus on service providers and cloud owners within their ecosystem, Digital Realty ranked in the top two slots within North America Europe and LATAM are taking the top spot in the Middle East and Africa region. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve also shed noncore assets, recycled capital out of stabilized core assets and created joint ventures with some of the leading institutions around the world to own, operate and develop data centers. Along the way, we\u2019ve added connectivity-related product capabilities, such as Service Exchange, Cloud Connect, and last summer, ServiceFabric, while targeting to the additions of cloud owners in our data centers around the world. These initiatives have meaningfully improved our customer value propositions and bolstered our results within the colo and connectivity segment. Since the end of 2015, our interconnection revenue has grown nearly 150%, while our colo and connectivity bookings have increased almost 400%. We now have 214,000 cross connects across our portfolio, an increase of over 250% over the same period. But there is more to do. Our vision is to serve our large and growing customer base that is focused on digital transformation and empowering their business through technological advancements at global scale today, tomorrow and for years to come. To do that, we serve as the meeting place offering the full spectrum of data center solutions globally, enabling our customers with a colo capacity and connectivity solutions needed to support their hybrid multi-cloud deployments and also providing line of sight to future availability of scale capacity and infrastructure advancements. Consistent with our strategic priority to strengthen our customer value proposition, we are pleased to announce the hiring of Steve Smith as Managing Director of our Americas region. Steve joins us following nearly eight years at CoreSite, where he most recently served as Chief Revenue Officer. Steve\u2019s experienced expertise within the colo and connectivity segment in the U.S. will be invaluable as we look to accelerate and enhance the offering in our largest market. We welcome Steve and the team, and look forward to an upcoming start in July. Let\u2019s move to our first quarter results. This quarter marks an important inflection in the fundamental recovery we have been anticipating in our core portfolio, as re-leasing spreads were positive across all products and in all regions, and scheduled price escalations translated into a positive inflection in our stabilized same capital portfolio growth year-over-year. New leasing during the quarter was $83 million, led by a strong 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, representing 57% of total signings, helped by the best quarter of interconnection science in company history. We continue to over-index towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with over 40% of the new signed leases in the quarter containing inflation length increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. During the first quarter, churn remained low at 1.1%, and we added 122 new customers, continuing with the strength of 100 plus new logos that we\u2019ve added each quarter since closing the Interxion transaction. Our key wins included a Global 500 pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services company, who are exiting their legacy data centers and expanding on platform digital to ensure European data governance and compliance; a Global 2000 insurance provider, doing a campus migration from a competing provider. A key differentiator for this new customer was improved resilience over the incumbent provider, together with robust multi-cloud connectivity and expansion capabilities. One of the largest public power companies in the U.S. and a new logo for Digital Realty is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to modernize its infrastructure with network and control hubs. This company is modernizing its infrastructure to embrace AI, improve analytics, and provide data to its B2B customers. One of the largest financial services firms is building a new trading platform with Digital Realty, driving an entirely new ecosystem to capture global trading as it happens. Their requirements include low latency and high performance. One of the largest global retailers also joined PlatformDIGITAL to support its local business presence, diversified transit nodes and rearchitect their network topology. Moving over to the power transmission issue in our largest market, Northern Virginia. We\u2019ve continued to work constructively with the power divider in this market. And last quarter, we were pleased to be able to confirm the commitments that we have made to our customers. While the overarching conditions in this market have changed, we continue to work in partnership with the local providers to maximize potential availability within our 500-plus megawatt footprint. And we remain cautiously optimistic that we uniquely will be able to provide growth capacity for our customers in this market through new development and select churn opportunities. For now, Ashburn remains highly constrained and pricing is reflecting the decreased availability of data center capacity. Moving on to our investment activity. During the first quarter, we acquired a 3-acre parcel land in Osaka, Japan, through our MC Digital Realty joint venture to support future development. We also monetized the 10% interest in the data center in Ashburn, Virginia, in the quarter alongside our joint venture partner. While the transaction was driven by our partner and is not a meaningful component of our capital recycling plan for 2023, it did indeed demonstrate the appetite for well-located data centers and strong valuations. This asset was sold at a valuation of nearly $17 million per megawatt which represents a substantial premium to our development cost today for new data centers in this market and significant value creation. Given the ongoing process that we are undertaking to bolster our capital sources and increase the efficiency of our balance sheet, we remain confident in the institutional appetite to invest in data centers. Notably, over the course of the last few weeks, we have seen the announcement of the sale of a European hyperscale data center platform to a well-known global institutional investor on multiples that are consistent with where similar platforms have traded over the last few years. And we have witnessed the recapitalization of another data center platform by other institutional investors. We know that investors are eager to hear updates on our progress, and we will provide those once we have a transaction to announce. Since our IPO in 2004, concerns have been periodically raised about various potential risks to data centers, including technology, customers, demand, supply and obsolescence. This is somewhat par for the course for a relatively nascent and growing asset class. Over the last year or so, we have witnessed the latest misinformation campaign cast upon the data center sector by those interested in seeing the price of our stock goes down. I\u2019d like to clarify a few important points. First, we operate a global portfolio of carrier-neutral and cloud-neutral data centers to facilitate communication and the exchange of information and data among and between enterprises, service providers and individuals all over the world. While we are focused on building what we call the meeting place for service providers and enterprise customers who are in pursuit of hybrid multi-cloud end-state IT architectures. We are also facilitating the connectivity and communities of interest supporting latency-sensitive applications and platforms. These are things that cannot happen in a stand-alone on-prem data center and aren\u2019t serviceable by a single cloud service provider. Second, in contrast to the narrative that hyperscalers have forced prices lower, after a few years of negative same-store growth, the tide is turned. As the supply of data center capacity in the low-cost abundant capital environment that exists for much [indiscernible] 10 years, has slowed meaningfully now that rates are higher and capital is more precious. With continued robust demand, strong net absorption has driven vacancy lower, which has been supportive of data center rents. Accordingly, our releasing spreads have inflected positively as have our same capital core growth metrics. Our team delivered on our objectives in the first quarter, and we reiterate the recoveries we anticipate for these metrics for 2023. Lastly, despite claims almost a year ago that hyperscalers would soon resource their data center requirements, 2022 was a record leasing year for Digital Realty, partly driven by demand from hyperscale customers. We believe the demand from these and other customers within our pipeline, driven by digital transformation and soon artificial intelligence remains robust. Data center support the growth and evolution of technology that is improving our standard of living, productivity and the overall quality of our lives. We have now witnessed a meaningful and sustained pullback in demand in the nearly 20 years that we\u2019ve been in business, and we are not seeing a pullback today. While an economic recession could slow capital spending, third-party data centers also benefit from the trend towards outsourcing. Customers often make the decision to lease rather than build on the availability of capital titans [ph]. We saw the same thing during the great financial crisis. For many of our customers, data centers can also help drive revenue growth will facilitate lower costs or even enhance overall productivity. We are optimistic that our business will remain resilient in 2023 and for years to come. Before turning it over to Matt, I\u2019d like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the first quarter, a leading ESG ratings provider included Digital Realty in their 2023 top-rated ESG company list, noting that we are in the top 6.5% of companies in the U.S. and Canada region. In addition, Digital Realty continues its efforts to incorporate renewable energy resources. We were named by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as one of the EPA\u2019s Top 25 Green Power Partners. We furthered our commitment to sustainability by signing a 10-year power purchase agreement for 116-megawatt share of a new solar project in Germany to increase our total solar and wind power under contract to over 1 gigawatt of renewable capacity. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced additional renewable to support our portfolio in Australia, while our business in Japan also announced renewable procurement for a portion of its portfolio. We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Matt Mercier : Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a total of $83 million of new leases in the first quarter, highlighted by a second consecutive quarterly record in interconnection signings and continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category, particularly in EMEA, which nearly matched the record level from last quarter. 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection accounted for a robust 57% of total bookings. Our greater than a megawatt bookings moderated to $35 million in the quarter. Though this activity was broadly dispersed throughout our global portfolio with leases signed in Toronto, the U.S., Mexico, Europe and South Africa, but nothing in Northern Virginia. These deals can be lumpy and the downtick in the greater than a megawatt leasing follows a record year in 2022, in which we signed more than $370 million and 288 megawatts of new leases. Importantly, our demand funnel remains quite strong as a number of our highly strategic customers remain actively engaged and are seeking to add capacity across our global portfolio. Of course, as we have discussed on the last few calls our largest scale market, Northern Virginia, is experiencing capacity constraints as a result of the power transmission issues that emerged last summer. Over the course of the last three years, including the second half of 2022 we signed approximately $20 million per quarter of new leases in Northern Virginia, versus $2.5 million of new leases signed in this market in 1Q 2023. As I\u2019ll expand on in a moment, we expect the ballast to lower new lease volume to show up in better pricing including renewal spreads. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog signed but not yet commenced leases was $434 million at quarter end, as commencements were once again well over $100 million, partly balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $200-plus million of commencements in 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted throughout the balance of the year. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 16 months, principally due to a few larger long-term leases that require buildouts. During the first quarter, we signed $155 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 4.5% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing quarter since the early days of the pandemic. The strength was shared across both products and also across our three regions. So we\u2019re off to a good start relative to our full year 2023 guidance. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued accelerating up 4.6% in the first quarter on $118 million of volume, nearly 400 basis points faster than it was in the final quarter of 2021, but also more than 100 basis points better than full year 2022. Greater than a megawatt renewals were similarly strong in the first quarter, as cash re-leasing spreads increased by 4.4% on $30 million of renewals. We were also pleased to see 100% of the leases signed in the quarter roll up in this category, and we remain optimistic about the potential for the rest of this year. Turning to our operating results. Our performance in the first quarter was a bit better than our expectations, highlighted by the continued improvement in our core operating performance, higher development returns and a record quarter in interconnection revenue. In terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.66 per share, $0.01 better versus prior quarter and a $0.01 light relative to last year. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the first quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 19% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As discussed on the last call, this revenue growth is somewhat distorted due to the significant increases in utility costs and reimbursements as the impact of last year\u2019s energy price increases went into full effect in January. As most of you understand, the large majority of energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, while reimbursements remained a relatively consistent percentage of utility expenses at 92%. Due to a decline in spot energy prices between the fourth and first quarters, our top line revenue including utility reimbursements from our customers was more than $40 million below our original forecast, but this was directly mirrored by lower-than-expected utility expenses, since these expenses are directly borne by our customers. Interconnection revenue was up 5% sequentially, reflecting the ongoing improvement in our core operating performance. Other than utilities, expenses were well contained as NOI margins, excluding utilities, remained steady, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On our last two calls, we\u2019ve highlighted the improvement in operating performance that started to emerge with our stabilized same capital portfolio, but was largely masked by FX headwinds. These positive trends strengthened further in the first quarter despite continued year-over-year currency headwinds. Same-capital cash NOI grew 3.4% in the first quarter compared to 1Q 2022, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we have been discussing. The step-up was driven by a 90 basis point improvement in same-store occupancy as commencements outpace churn, upside from annual rent escalators and the benefit of positive re-leasing spreads. Turning to our currency slide, 51% of our first quarter operating revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars, with 25% in euros, 6% in British pounds, 5% in Singapore dollars, 3% in South African rand and 2% in each of the Brazilian real and Japanese yen. The weakening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter provided a slight sequential tailwind, but the dollar\u2019s strength through much of 2022 resulted in a continued headwind to year-over-year results. As a result, the dollar strength negatively impacted our reported revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth by about 300 basis points apiece on a year-over-year basis, whereas core FFO per share saw just under 200 basis points headwind. Turning to the balance sheet. Our reported leverage ratio at quarter end was 7.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.4 times. In January, we completed a $740 million two year term loan with an initial maturity date at March 31, 2025, plus a one year extension option and an effective rate of 5.6%. Leverage remains above our historical average and our long-term target, and we intend to reduce our leverage toward our long-term target over the course of 2023. Our plan hasn\u2019t changed. We are in active discussions on our asset sale and joint venture plans and remain confident in our ability to execute on these plans over the course of the year so that our leverage moves back towards the six times area by year-end. Our weighted average debt maturity is at five years, and our weighted average coupon is 2.8%. Approximately 82% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Over 80% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing in 2023, together with a well-laddered maturity schedule. Lastly, let\u2019s turn to our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 of $6.65 to $6.75. And our first quarter results were consistent with this range. We are also affirming our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion [ph] at the midpoint as the downward adjustment in our overall revenue guidance is purely due to lower utility expenses driven by lower spot electricity rates that are passed on directly to our customers. We are also modestly tweaking our year to U.S. dollar exchange rate expectations for the year to reflect the relative appreciation of the euro year-to-date. We also made meaningful progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, providing strong support to the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads over 3%, same-capital cash NOI growth of 3% to 4% and year-end portfolio occupancy between 85% and 86%. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we remain confident in our funding plan for the year. So we have reiterated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital. We have tweaked our debt financing cost expectation to be consistent with the move in rate seen since the banking sector fall out last month, which will be largely mitigated by the upside we saw versus our core FFO expectation the first quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to drill into the greater than 1-megawatt leasing a bit. Obviously, that\u2019s been a bit below history in Q1, and you called out Ashburn as a driver of that. I guess, just thinking about some of the other drivers there, maybe can you expand upon the degree to which that was the result of making conscious decisions to maybe dial back a bit given the change in the cost of capital versus market conditions or other factors? Andy Power : Hey, thanks Nick. So I\u2019ll kick it off and I\u2019ll hand it to Corey. I would say there\u2019s no conscious decisions in dialing back or waving off business necessarily. You could see from our development life cycle, we\u2019ve continued to raise the bar on our most strategic projects and fine-tuned capital allocations. The \u2013 I\u2019d say it was a bit \u2013 it was a little bit lower than prior run rates. But if you look at the prior year, which was a record and had a record quarter in there in the third quarter, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I think I won\u2019t over-index to anything other than call it the typical lumpiness you may have in that category. It was healthy in terms of pricing. I don\u2019t think we had a single deal pricing below $100 per kilowatt. But Corey, do you want to expand? Corey Dyer : Yes, I would tell you that \u2013 thanks, Nick. Nothing\u2019s fundamentally really changed our relationship or our position with these hyperscalers in the greater than 1 megawatt category. Coming off, as Andy mentioned, I think, Matt, maybe did in the prepared remarks a record year, and so I\u2019d tell you, this is probably just a one-quarter timing issue, our hyperscale demand remains really healthy and varies a little bit by customer, but it\u2019s broad-based across the globe. Keep in mind, we didn\u2019t do Ashburn deals on that this last quarter. And I\u2019d say that they\u2019re going through some digestion of their demand signals and maybe a little bit more scrutiny with the macro environment but really confident in the macro demand, our relationships to execute. And keep in mind; we had our highest and our largest connectivity quarter with the hyperscalers this last quarter. And so I just say that one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend. I\u2019d suggest you look at the multi-quarter trends as well as they expand in new markets, new products like the advent of AI and their edge nodes that we\u2019re winning and just new deployments across the globe. We\u2019re in a really good position with them from a pipeline perspective and demand. Thanks, Nick. Nick Del Deo : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. And I guess, more generally, obviously, the price environment is pretty favorable for you right now. I guess, I\u2019m interested in your thoughts on how you\u2019re balancing between raising prices on new space and renewal deals where market conditions allow it versus kind of thinking holistically about your relationships with your top 10 or 15 or 20 customers you do business with globally, and trying not to alienate them or put the relationships. Andy Power : Yes, Nick. So \u2013 I mean, we all \u2013 we\u2019re always trying to take a holistic approach to these relationships. And as you see from our top customer list, our largest customers can be with 20, 30, 40, 50 different locations. At the same time, the pricing is dynamic to overall supply/demand dynamics. And as inventory in various markets become more and more precious, we\u2019ve seen that pendulum pricing move in our favor. We try to be straight shooters with the customer. We try to bring all the \u2013 everything to the table in a holistic fashion. We\u2019ve done this before in terms of bringing renewals and new business, expansions, all-in-one holistic approach. And I think this is not new. These are \u2013 these big hyperscale customers are seeing cost of doing business going up. Many of them self build themselves and see inflation in construction costs or labor. So I think the understanding that the pricing dynamic is shifting a little bit towards the providers is playing out in a natural fashion. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. So on Corey\u2019s response about kind of the leasing volumes telling us to look at kind of the prior multi-quarter trend, curious about interconnection and the trends going forward given kind of the strength there. And any kind of mix shift that you could kind of point to there may be more how you\u2019re targeting your customers is a lot of that coming from existing logos or deserting your sales format to focus on interconnect-rich opportunities? And then, secondly, I guess, on the competitive front, given so many privately-backed companies that are deploying a lot of capital into the sector. Does that affect your hyperscale sales pipeline at all? Andy Power : Sure. Thanks, Jon. On the first question, make Sharp and I\u2019ll tag team that. I mean \u2013 I think I look at a few things. One, it\u2019s a holistic approach to these customers. There\u2019s a lot of good results in this quarter, whether it\u2019s the new logos, inflecting up 15% quarter-over-quarter, which was a high for several quarters, whether it was the overall interconnection plus less than a megawatt signings, the regional contributions, including a standout interconnection quarter. And I\u2019d also mention that this is a building momentum. It\u2019s been building over time for several quarters now. I think it\u2019s the power of the platform coming together, servicing our customers across 50-plus metros on six continents. It\u2019s the great work Corey team has done with the go-to-market. And I still would say that we got even further progress and even better results to deliver over time. This particular quarter did have I\u2019d say, a lumpier win, let\u2019s call it, put it into the number one category interaction interconnection signings. So I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s necessarily repeatable next quarter with another record. But some of the work that we\u2019re doing with service providers, I think Chris can touch on, I think it\u2019s going to continue to build that momentum. But Chris, pick it up from that, please? Chris Sharp : Yes. Appreciate it, Andy. And thanks for the question, Jon. A couple of dynamics here where I think we\u2019ve led by our core existing products. And I think your direct question to, is it new logos or its existing, it\u2019s both, right? I really want to emphasize the fact that the physical cross connects reaching 214,000 and growing, it\u2019s something that we constantly have looked at and Andy referenced this earlier, growing the platform, right, investing and making sure that customers know how to access one another to get further value out of the deployment is absolutely important to us. And so just really watching how that evolves over time. And with the advent of the ServiceFabric and bringing that to market and what that\u2019s being able to do for our customers, we\u2019re just starting to see \u2013 it\u2019s early innings, but future growth on virtual, right, where it\u2019s going to be married to where now they\u2019re going to be able to access multiple destinations in a more simplistic fashion, because of that product being purpose built in the way that we brought it to market, it really removes a lot of the technical complexity that has precluded other customers from getting the full value out of the deployment. But one of the things I\u2019m just very pleased about is this customer-led and balanced approach that we\u2019ve been doing on even new markets inside of Europe. We\u2019ve talked about in the past where just bringing the value or the pricing closer to parity in some of these markets \u2013 we see really strong growth within Germany and France, where making sure that we\u2019re delivering those capabilities to those customers in all these critical markets around the globe. And I would just say lastly, I\u2019m pleased with the fact that Digital has been able to provide one of the greatest quarters of interconnection signings in the company\u2019s history, and that\u2019s just really representative of the value we\u2019re bringing to the customers. Andy Power : And then, Jon, just around your second question about call it competition from private back, one, that\u2019s not a new phenomenon. We\u2019ve been competing against private players for some time now and the ones that have been taken private they\u2019ve been private for, call it, multiple years for some of them. I think what\u2019s changed is the ability to deliver this business for our customers has just gotten harder and harder, and at a global scale. And whether it\u2019s power, constraints, staffing, supply chains \u2013 and certainly, cost and access to capital has certainly not been a friend of some of our competitors. And I think our largest customers in the hyperscale arena turn to us given our permanence in our space. We\u2019re not here, gone tomorrow, we\u2019ve invested for the long run, we\u2019re future-proofing that growth, we\u2019re constantly building for that growth with our suppliers and I think all those things probably make it leave a little bit more advantageous versus some of those private bank names in an environment like today. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jon Petersen : Great. Thank you. I was hoping if we could talk about the leverage target. You guys reiterated getting down to six times leverage, and I know you\u2019re working through these various transactions. But I guess if you complete the $2 billion of transactions. I, mean, does that get you to six times? Like, can you just give us the moving pieces on getting to that target? Matt Mercier : Yes, thanks. So I mean, the simple answer is, yes. So our capital plan, I think, as we laid out last quarter, and it really hasn\u2019t changed coming into this quarter, is based on, call it, $2-plus billion of capital recycling from our joint venture opportunities as well as the potential for noncore dispositions. And as that capital comes in as well as our expected growth in EBITDA this year, which is a little shy of 10%, we believe that by the end of the year, largely those two items will get us back towards that six times area this year. Jon Petersen : Okay, great. And then if I could just ask on development. I\u2019m curious, given the shift in cost of capital, like what\u2019s the minimum development yield? Or maybe you just talk broadly about how much those requirements for you guys have moved in the last year or so? Like, what does it take for you guys to start a development today in terms of return expectations? Andy Power : Thanks, Jon. I mean, we do an incredibly granular market-by-market assessment here. So, it really depends on the market and the relative risk fee rates and risk premiums. I would just by and large, and this is not something that just showed up in our approach this quarter, three quarters ago almost, we basically took a posture that we need to raise the bar on capital allocation and prioritize our most strategic projects, call it, highest return, not only highest return, but also projects to generate the high long-term growth as well. So I don\u2019t have a single number answer to get \u2013 to give you there, but I think you will see that come through our development returns at table as those numbers are inching into higher territory, and I can tell you more strategic long-term growth projects. Jon Petersen : Great. Thank you. Andy Power : Okay. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good afternoon. I wanted to go back to the capital recycling topic. And just when we look at the guidance page, there is a wide range of outcomes. And what would be a good outcome for Digital in terms of the yield? And what would the scenario be in which you may just decide there is alternative forms of capital that are better than recycling? And then just a second topic but related, if I could take a step back. As I think about the comments you\u2019ve made about considering both stabilized assets and development for monetization, just curious if there is a more profound change in the business strategy and financial model that investors should be mindful of in terms of how this business, over the next couple of years, might look different in terms of the quantum of investment in a given year and the level of financial performance that you\u2019re driving off of those investments, just following on the comments you just made. Thanks. Andy Power : So Mike, a good outcome is we essentially get the, call it, $2 billion of funding completed and the range is wide, but the majority of that capital, the range is not that wide. The wide range is due to some of the noncore asset sales as well as the development, which is, call it, 25% of the $2 billion, right? But if you look at the majority, the 75%, which is stabilized joint ventures or development, development, those were zero yielding projects. On stabilized joint ventures, I think, the cap rates are in the low single-digit type category based on what we\u2019re seeing called six-ish type territory. And I think that\u2019s based on not what we see externally by third-party transactions. What we\u2019ve seen on recent transactions with partners that we can recapitalize with our portfolio and through our progress on these capital recycling and joint venture efforts. Holistically, more longer term here, we are looking to become more balance sheet efficient. What\u2019s not new is, call it, finishing out the noncore dispose, what\u2019s not new is joint venturing majority states in stabilized hyperscale-oriented projects that have lower long-term growth rates due to the credit quality and size of the customers, be it through rent bumps or pricing power. What is new is sharing a piece of both of our North America and EMEA development as it relates to hyperscale projects. And we\u2019re doing that with a view that these projects keep getting larger, and larger and larger. That non-income producing drag it remains a headwind, even though it is a significant long-term value creation. And we believe there is ample partners to work with us on those projects which will ultimately make our balance sheet more efficient and more rapidly accelerate revenue and EBITDA drop into our bottom line. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Great, thanks for taking the questions here. I guess first, just to double-click on what you said about balance sheet efficiency. As it relates to the development JV, aside from recouping the previously spent CapEx, is the intention of that JV to structurally reduce the on-balance sheet CapEx for digital? Or is the intention to keep CapEx more or less the same while being able to increase the set of opportunities you can pursue? And then I have a follow-up. Andy Power : The simple answer, Michael, is we\u2019re looking to partner around large-scale development projects where there will be incremental spend that we and our partner will jointly fund over time. So that it will \u2013 we\u2019re looking for \u2013 these are large projects, large swaths of acreage, large quantities and megawatts. Hence, the quality of capital or spend is not the entirety or near the entirety of where the project ultimately will be over time. So they would fund alongside us through the coming quarters. Michael Elias : Okay. Maybe just to shift gears a little bit. Earlier on the call today, you\u2019re really emphasizing the steps you\u2019ve made on the colo/enterprise side. Today, you also announced the appointment of Steve Smith. Clearly a focus on accelerating colo and connectivity, I mean, my question for you would be, as we consider the path ahead, what are the changes that you feel need to be made internally in order for you to really accelerate on that, call it, 0 to 1 megawatt side? Thanks. Andy Power : So Michael, I mean, again, I think this ties back to the first three strategic priorities I laid out in the prior call about really strengthening \u2013 demonstrably strengthening our customer value proposition. We took advantage of this call to remind folks that this is not something we started with me becoming the CEO four months ago. This is something that\u2019s been in the works for roughly eight years through both inorganic and organic measures, putting together critical puzzle pieces, expanding across the globe in terms of where the customers need our capacity, adding connectivity hubs and innovating and bringing more to our customers, adding \u2013 we\u2019ve changed up our go-to-market motion over time. What we go from here is, again, accelerating from that success. A piece of that \u2013 delighted to have Steve Smith on board to lead our essentially newly created Americas region. Steve comes with a tremendous background of really driving the \u2013 one of the only U.S.-only focused interconnection and colo platforms in a prior \u2013 previously a very formidable competitor. And I think he\u2019s going to be very added to that our team, our leadership table. The incremental things that we\u2019re doing in terms of continuing to innovate and bring more value to our customers. Chris touched upon ServiceFabric, which I still would characterize as just out of the bar in terms of where we\u2019re going in terms of bringing more partners onto that platform, and drilling more value to our customers. We are \u2013 there\u2019s a whole host of things that I\u2019d say we\u2019re doing behind the scenes to continue to accelerate our growth. And I think the fruits of our labor are continuing to build each and every quarter in terms of success. So I think there\u2019s multiple angles that we are moving towards in that endeavor to be one of a very short list of global interconnection colo providers. And I think the industry demands and the broader competitive backdrop are also our wins at our sales. Corey Dyer : And then Andy, just one thing to add from a go-to-market perspective. We\u2019ve had a ton of success around the channel. We\u2019re continuing to grow the channel. I think this last quarter, 38% of our new logos were from the channel. Prior years, it was 31%. We\u2019re continuing to build on that success. We see the channel as being a huge advocate and a partner through their lens with all the enterprises. So we\u2019re going to see that continue to build. So we\u2019re doing a lot of functional and strategic operational items that we need to do. We\u2019re also continuing to tweak and evolve our go-to-market, we think it\u2019s going to continue to add value. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. On the re-leasing spreads, thinking about greater than a megawatt in particular, but kind of with all of them, is there anything you see coming up in the year that could possibly push those spreads back negative by any large renegotiations? And then what is sort of the longer-term outlook with the bookings down a little bit, but pricing doing better, what sort of yield are we looking at going forward per se, you\u2019ve got in the last couple of years when the bookings were higher? Andy Power : I\u2019ll let Matt, take it off in re-leasing spreads and we can tag some longer term outlook pieces. Matt Mercier : Yes. So thanks, Frank. I think, one, first, I\u2019d reiterate, we\u2019re obviously off to a great start here with positive re-leasing spreads, again, not only across all product types, but across all regions. I will say, we\u2019re \u2013 we feel confident that this positive pricing environment that we\u2019re in is sustainable and it\u2019s here to stay. I\u2019m not going to necessarily speak about every single quarter. But again, I\u2019d come back and reiterate that we\u2019re off to a great start. We see \u2013 and we see that come for full year that we expect to be positive for the full year, not only in the 0 to 1 megawatt category but also in the greater than a megawatt category, which I think is, again, something we haven\u2019t seen in a few years. And reflects the positive environment and turn in fundamentals that we\u2019re seeing not only from that, but then down into our stabilized portfolio as well. Andy Power : Frank, do you want \u2013 do you mind repeating that second part of your question just to make sure we hear it correctly? Frank Louthan : Yes. I mean, leasings are down a little bit, obviously better pricing. What does the yield look like now per se, the last couple of years ago when bookings were higher and so forth? And how long do you think this is sustainable? What sort of yields are you seeing coming in now even though the absolute bookings are a little bit lower? Andy Power : Yes. Frank, I\u2019d direct you to our development table to follow, see the progression of yields. There\u2019s \u2013 I would say the yields are improving in our favor. The pricing dynamic is outpacing the inflationary pressures. It\u2019s not an overnight phenomenon, but we are moving into a better territory. I mean, you can look at episodic things like Ashburn, Virginia, where quite frankly, the rates have pretty much doubled in a pretty short time from deals in the, call it, low $70s to now call it, market rates of, call it, $140, and that\u2019s flowing to the bottom line and enhancing those deals dramatically. So I think that table is a work in progress in our sub because it\u2019s got a lot of pre-leasing, some of which was signed prior to some of this price progression. But as we continue to add more projects to that, that they are not pre-leased or we fill out the leasing on the available capacity, I think there\u2019s ability to raise those yields. And I would also say the North America piece of that has a large project in it that is an open book build-to-suit to a very highly rated financial institution on a triple net lease basis. So it\u2019s an apple to the oranges there in a good way. It\u2019s been dramatically derisked in terms of its build and in terms of its ongoing revenue and EBITDA stream at the same time, lowering our Americas yields. Frank Louthan : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead. David Guarino : Andy, in the press release, you were quoted as saying that you\u2019re seeing broad-based demand and reduced data center availability. I was just wondering, why do you think that isn\u2019t translating into outsized growth in rental rates like we\u2019ve seen across other commercial real estate sectors like industrial or self-storage? And it definitely feels like the pendulum has firmly swung back to landlords, but data center rents just aren\u2019t rising like we\u2019ve seen elsewhere. Andy Power : I would say, I mean, it\u2019s a new phenomenon in terms of recent history of the data centers, which is still, I\u2019d call a nascent asset class, but we are seeing it. If you look at, call it, our less than a megawatt signings, either the Americas region or EMEA region where there\u2019s critical consistent massive new signings, the rates have been up, call it, four quarters in a row. And that example I gave you, in Ashburn, Virginia, from rates going from $70 plus E [ph] to $140 plus E. That is quite a run. And I know I\u2019m picking out one particular market there, an example, but it is the largest and most diverse market out there, our largest market as well. And it\u2019s flanks the East Coast with a power constraint problem, but the West Coast is having the same low with Santa Clara now having power constraints to likely outpace when power comes online in Virginia. And I think this phenomenon is going to continue in other parts of the world, not just the U.S. And I think you\u2019re going to continue to see those rates move more and more favor. David, I know you\u2019re a student of the traditional real estate asset classes. I mean, it was a good 20 years where industrial had no rate growth before it\u2019s had the renaissance that\u2019s been experienced in the last few years. And I\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s going to happen to data centers, but it feels like we\u2019re teeing ourselves up way for a healthier pricing environment for the incumbents. David Guarino : That\u2019s encouraging to hear. And then maybe kind of sticking with that theme, you said we\u2019ve been hearing some similar chatter also about difficulty securing power in some other markets. I\u2019ve heard Chicago come on the radar and possibly even Hillsboro now. So given just \u2013 it feels like these are popping up everywhere across the industry, what do you think that means for your pace of new leasing activity going forward? I mean, are the things we saw in the years past probably unlikely to happen just given the power constraints? Andy Power : Yes, if you look at our financials, we\u2019ve got a sizable amount of contiguous land capacity and available power that\u2019s committed to us outside of these, call it, zones of disruption. But longer term, eventually we will exhaust that and you could have that phenomenon. At the same time, when you\u2019re doing business at twice the rates, you have to sell half the kilowatts in certain markets. So, I\u2019m not sure that the top-line pacing on our new signings will be all that disrupted near term based on what we have in this table in terms of capabilities and estimated power. But I agree with you this assessment and it\u2019s going to continue. The other thing I\u2019d emphasize is, we\u2019re actively managing our platform and our capabilities, and we\u2019re essentially always looking to reproductize for higher, better use when applicable. So if we have churn, which this is not a totally static business, it provides opportunity to release that capacity at higher rate opportunities and often higher better uses towards some granular enterprise colocation oriented customers. And on a big company like digital, you probably don\u2019t see that. It\u2019s not top of the waves, but that\u2019s happening in terms of how we manage our footprint. David Guarino : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just two, if I could. First, on the capital recycling, not to beat a dead horse, but you did talk about being deeply engaged in the process. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any more color you can share on the progress made thus far across the different buckets that you\u2019ve laid out? And then maybe switching gears. On AI, I mean, we\u2019ve heard so much about this over the last several months. I\u2019m just wondering how the increased focus on AI impacted your customer leasing plans and your conversations with them as they think about deployment plans over the next year? Thanks. Andy Power : Thanks, Matt. I\u2019m going to have Greg tackle the first one and then Sharp and I can both tackle the second one. Greg Wright : Thanks, Matt. Look, I\u2019d say, look, with respect to our capital initiatives, I\u2019d say we\u2019re still on track with the plan we outlined in our earnings call in early February. But you should recall that was the $500 million of the noncore dispositions, call it, roughly $750 million from core JVs and $750 from million development JVs. And I would characterize it without saying too much, is that we\u2019re making good progress in these transactions. And we\u2019ve received significant interest from multiple institutional partners, whether it\u2019s sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure funds, PE, real estate funds, pension funds, insurance companies and the like. So the way I\u2019d characterize it is we\u2019re executing on plan. And we feel good about where we are into these processes. Andy Power : And turning to your second question \u2013 just one quick thing for I turn over to Chris GBT [ph] to give his view on AI. The \u2013 I think a misnomer here is that, in my opinion, that everyone thinks every data center is going to turn into one that\u2019s going to be supporting artificial intelligence. The use cases, the applications, the workloads that exist today are still going to be thriving within the global data center footprint and digital. Yes, we have many data centers that lend themselves towards supporting the increasing power densities and cooling environments that will be required, and we\u2019re doing a lot of that as we speak. But I look at more \u2013 the bigger picture around AI is that this is an incremental major wave of long-term demand that will certainly need to have proximity to the major data that sits today. And the first two waves of demand of moving from on-prem locations to hybrid locations and the second wave of multi-cloud haven\u2019t even hit the shore yet while this next wave of demand, it is falling behind it. But Chris, why don\u2019t you speak a little your view on AI? Chris Sharp : Yes. No, absolutely. I appreciate the question. A couple of pieces. Just to reiterate what Andy said, the existing cloud infrastructure we have today, AI is cloud adjacent because of a lot of the applications, it\u2019s empowering and the way the customers are bringing it to market it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been watching for many, many years. And I think one of the pieces I always try to emphasize is that a lot of the R&D from the hyperscalers and from the technological providers has been happening within digital, which has allowed us to evolve our infrastructure with this demand. And I would reiterate also that there are pockets of AI that we\u2019re able to support rather efficiently. And I think this is something that\u2019s unique to Digital\u2019s designs and the R&D work that we\u2019ve been doing with some of the cooling technologies. It\u2019s really important for us to continue to support the broader spectrum of the customer requirements, so not only their traditional type of digital transformation, but we are seeing more and more customers show up with AI specific requirements and association with that digital transformation. And then the last one is, really emphasizing that to the customer base to design early and understand the implications of not only the power, but the interconnectivity. And just to circle back to why we believe the value of from Digital is differentiated is the ability to interconnect in an open fashion with the right partners in a very simplistic manner is what\u2019s making a lot of these AI deployments successful. And so that\u2019s the core of how we continue to focus on AI and bringing that to market in a very repeatable fashion. And so you\u2019ll see some recent sales tools we\u2019ll start talking about publicly to visualize how you tie together this infrastructure on a global basis. So very exciting about this additive demand coming to market, and you\u2019ll see more and more of the use cases and case studies coming out on the success that our customers are having within Platform Digital. Operator : The last question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Hey. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. I wanted to touch base on Ashburn, it sounds like the transmission line has been approved to be in service by late 2025 year at Digital Dallas. So when do you think you might be able to start additional development in that market? And do you think you\u2019re seeing any spillover impacts in terms of other markets or submarkets where you\u2019re seeing additional activity levels because of the tightness in Ashburn? And I guess just related to that on the pricing front, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing rents as high as $140. I think a lot of your rents in Ashburn are rolling at $80 or $90. So just wondering if you have any color on what you\u2019ve seen on the re-leasing spreads across that market and what you expect going forward? Thank you. Andy Power : Thanks Eric. And we touched a little bit on this in the prepared remarks. The good news is that the powers that be in the region are sorting out ways to bring incremental power to the region by 2026. I think the \u2013 from there, I think you\u2019ll see a much more rational providing power to that market. And I do think it\u2019s going to move ourselves to be our history and track record of working in that region is going to keep us top of queue when power becomes more freely. Between now and then we \u2013 last quarter, had a good fortune having worked with the local providers to be able to deliver on all of our customer commitments, which is fantastic. We do believe that we will be able to bring on incremental growth capacity in this market between now and 2026 through called some development as well as some churn. We are working through all the resources we have in terms of excess power at sites, customers that may not be using their suites and be able to go to spare some capacity. So I don\u2019t have a fine point of the quantity, but I don\u2019t believe our shelves at Digital will be bearing, and we will be able to support our customers. Certainly our colocation customers and some of our hyperscale customers we\u2019ll be able to grow with Digital in Ashburn in the coming years. And then as we get a finer point on the quantities probably in lockstep with leasing in that capacity, we\u2019ll certainly be happy to share. In terms of spillover effect, the spillover is real. Manassas, I think is front center of a spillover market to the Loudoun County pinch point. I would say that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the greatest spillover effect. But there\u2019s always potential some of the non-Northern Virginia markets will continue to but at auction. But I don\u2019t think \u2013 I don\u2019t see anyone packing their wagons and leaving Ashburn due to this. I think the momentum has been building for years, and it\u2019s called out escape velocity in terms of its criticality to the data center industry and its customers. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead. Andy Power : Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty is off to a strong start to the year. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with customers which was confirmed by our record interconnection signings, continued strength in the 0-1 megawatt category and strong new logo additions. We expect that our operating momentum will continue through the year and the steps we are taking will further accelerate our progress. We also remain confident in our funding plan, and I look forward to updating you with further developments on this front at the appropriate time. We are very excited to bring together our customers and partners on May 24th and 25th at our Marketplace Live 2023 event. The theme this year is the crossroads of the digital world, the data meeting place. The entire digital realty community from around the world will come together virtually to network, gain inspiration and bring their digital strategies to life. Please join us, you can register at marketplacelive.com. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today and say a special thank you to our hard working and exceptional team and Digital Realty to help keep the digital world running. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now all disconnect.",

During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question, plus a follow-up, and we'll aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today\u2019s call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate. We delivered yet another strong quarter of leasing in our zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment and saw a healthy rebound in greater than a megawatt leasing. And second, this past quarter confirmed the continued inflection of fundamentals we have been speaking about for much of the past year, supported by a strong pricing environment. Releasing spreads were the strongest in three years and stabilized same cash NOI grew by 5.6% marking the second consecutive quarter with positive growth and the best growth in almost nine years. And third, we bolstered our total liquidity, which now stands at more than $4 billion and further diversified our capital sources and reduced our leverage well off of peak levels through more than $2 billion of dispositions and JVs and over $1 billion of equity issued under our ATM. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. Andrew Power : Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Against the backdrop of an extraordinarily dynamic first half of the year, we have remained focused on advancing our strategic priorities and delivering on behalf of our 5,000 plus customers. Digital Realty made strong progress in the second quarter with improved operational results, progress on our funding plan and increased liquidity, continued organizational improvements, an increasing recognition of the critical role that data centers will play in support of both digital transformation and artificial intelligence. We posted sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CFFO per share, while improving development returns, bolstering liquidity and delevering the balance sheet. During the quarter, we made progress on each of the three key strategic priorities that I laid out earlier this year. First, we strengthened our customer value proposition by enhancing our communities of interest with more connectivity options, posting record double digit interconnection revenue growth and the second highest quarter of new logo additions in company history. Second, we innovated and integrated, delivering enhancements designed to support high performance compute, including AI by enabling data centers to support liquid cooling solutions, while also broadening our existing partnership with NVIDIA with the certification of our first DGx H100 ready data center and integrating with additional organizational enhancements design, deliver a consistent structure and experience, while leveraging data to improve our effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we access diverse capital sources during the quarter including the sale of a non-core asset in Texas at an attractive 4.4% cap rate and equity raised under our ATM. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we formed a stabilized hyperscale data center joint venture with a new private capital partner that acquired an interest in two facilities in Chicago. And today, we announced a similar joint venture transaction alongside a second new private capital partner for three stabilized hyperscale data centers in Northern Virginia. Just a little more than halfway through the year, we are now well ahead of the midpoint of our original funding plan for 2023 and we remain focused on putting Digital Realty's balance sheet into position to support the growing opportunity that lies ahead. The current state of the data center infrastructure landscape is very healthy. There is widespread demand for our data center capacity across various regions and products. However, there is limited new supply due to decreased power availability and tight financial conditions. The global expansion of Cloud Computing paired with continuous digital transformation of enterprises underscores the escalating importance of both data and AI in shaping demand. Presently, we are collaborating with numerous clients on AI focused requests for proposals and implementations. The initial surge is anticipated in power intensive training applications followed by a rise in inferencing applications including access to private data sets, which are expected to necessitate enhanced performance and reduce latency. Additionally, the integral nature of these models is necessitating larger capacity blocks which align seamlessly with our extensive product suite. As the global meeting place for data exchange and a full spectrum provider of data center solutions, Digital Realty stands at a strategic vantage point. This allows us to cater to the needs of enterprises, facilitating their efficient integration of AI applications within their digital transformation journeys. In the second quarter, we unveiled Data Gravity Index 2.0, which represents our extended commitment to data science. This tool is designed to access the effects of enterprise data generation and consumption in both public clouds and private data centers, offering enterprises a framework to manage and drive insights from their data. Moreover, our innovative approaches in Data Gravity and comprehensive data center architecture were recognized as we secured a patent for these. Our patent further offers enterprises a roadmap to ensure their architectures remain relevant in the future. The evidence is clear, we have shifted from a physical economy to a digital economy, which now is entering a new form, the data economy. Our research shows that the surge in server demand can be attributed to the rising needs of both public and private cloud infrastructure, further augmented by AI training and inference processes. At the same time, demand for storage devices is poised to grow due to data regulation. Let's move to our second quarter results. This quarter continued the inflection in the fundamental recovery we've been highlighting in our core portfolio over the past several quarters. Our pipeline remains strong during the quarter, helping to drive a sequential rebound in leasing volume but also supporting strong pricing with releasing spreads positive again across all product types and in all regions. New leasing during the quarter was $114 million with continued strength in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection leasing, which represented 43% of total signings. Greater than a megawatt increased by over 60% sequentially, led by one of our strongest quarters ever in EMEA. Strong demand trends and reduced availability along with growing recognition of our value proposition continue to be supportive of pricing, and are enhancing our expected returns. In the second quarter, we saw releasing spreads climbed to nearly 7% on a cash basis, helping to drive the best same capital cash NOI growth that we've seen since I joined Digital Realty in 2015. During the second quarter, churn remained low at 1.5% and we added 133 new customers, our second best quarter ever and a nice continuation of the 100 plus new logo streak we have going. This is a strong validation of the stability of enterprise IT spend and digital transformation that we are seeing and of the value that customers recognize in platform digital. Our key wins included an innovative sustainability oriented infrastructure provider that tasked into stranded energy to support module edge compute sites chose Digital Realty for AI applications, utilizing Platform Digital's network control and data hub solutions. Data intensive workloads are being deployed on Platform Digital by a major US federal agency to reduce costs and improve sustainability, while interconnecting with their key ecosystem partners. A leading European bank chose Platform Digital to help simplify and secure their hybrid IT strategy in compliance with data sovereignty regulations, while leveraging the available cloud connectivity. A Fortune 500 quick serve restaurant chain is updating their internal infrastructure on Platform Digital to improve reliability and security, support existing systems and connect with [P Cloud] (ph) to support the strong growth of their e-commerce business. A global 2000 Pharmaceuticals sourcing and distribution services company is expanding to a new [indiscernible] Platform Digital to ensure global data governance compliance. And a global 2000 Auto Manufacture chose Platform Digital to upgrade their network architecture in Central Europe by adding key points of presence for the largest and most important production centers. Moving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. In the years since we learned that the power constraints in this market will continue to work constructively with the power provider to confirm the commitments that we've made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. Over the course of last several months with the support of our local utility partners, we've been able to identify nearly 100 megawatts of incremental billable capacity that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 40 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on almost another 60 megawatts. In addition to this Ashburn focus capacity, we've made meaningful progress on our 192 megawatt development site in Manassas which is now nearly in position to begin development. We are optimistic about the near term potential to offer this availability to our customers. Moving on to our investment activity. As we outlined in February, 2023 was poised to be an active year for our investments team and some of the fruit of their labor has been harvested since our last call. During the second quarter, we acquired the land and shell associated with the previously leased data center in Amsterdam, where we previously held a lease hold interest for $18 million. In a separate future proofing transaction, we purchased additional land adjacent to our highly connected Schiphol campus in Amsterdam, which could support another 40 megawatts of potential IT load providing ample runway for both enterprise and service provider growth. We also closed on first non-core disposition of the year in mid-May at a 4.4% cap rate resulting in $150 million of net proceeds to Digital Realty. This facility was previously leased as a power to shell and was sold to one of its primary occupants. In July, we saw a significant acceleration in our capital recycling initiatives, closing on two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in Chicago and Ashburn. These deals were executed at just over 6% cash cap rate on average and raised more than $2 billion of net proceeds for Digital Realty. These transactions are an important validation of our current strategy as we remain focused on delivering shareholder value through the development of new data centers at double digit unlevered returns and the monetization of stabilized hyperscale assets at a premium. But equally as important, we've substantially bolstered and diversified our sources of private capital so that we can execute on the opportunity that lies ahead without being overly reliant on any individual avenue of capital while also increasing the efficiency of our balance sheet. While we've had remarkable traction on these transactions and all due credit goes to Greg Wright, his top-notch team and the rest of our platform for executing through a tumultuous capital markets environment, we are not resting on our laurels. We are well ahead of our plan on our stabilized hyper sale joint venture plan, but we see ample demand for the hyperscale development joint venture bucket that we have previously discussed and we'll provide updates as appropriate. Before moving on, I'm also delighted to welcome [indiscernible] Reliance Industries Company as our newest partner to our joint venture in India. The expanded partnership builds on the strong foundation laid by [BAM] (ph) Digital Realty, through the addition of Jio's massive digital connectivity ecosystem and strong enterprise relationships with 80% of large private enterprises in India. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the quarter. During the second quarter, we issued our fifth annual ESG report outlining our initiatives for 2022. The report highlights the progress we have made toward our science-based targets, commitment to reduce our global carbon emission by 68% by 2030. We've enabled our success by contracting for renewable energy wherever possible so that we have 1 gigawatt of solar and wind energy under contract in the US. This has enabled us to match 126 of our data centers with 100% renewable energy. In the second quarter, we also received a certificate of adherence from the climate neutral data center pack. As a founding member of the pack, Digital Realty worked with independent auditors to certify that we are on track to meet the overarching goal of the pack for the industry to become climate neutral by 2030. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment, while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Matthew Mercier : Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second quarter results. We signed $114 million of new leases in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment in each region. We leased approximately $50 million in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 43% of total bookings and becoming a larger part of our overall bookings since last year. . Interconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million, concluding a record 12-month period. Zero to one megawatt bookings, excluding interconnection, were among our strongest ever at $37 million. Digital Realty has come a long way over the past four years, more than tripling our bookings in the zero to one megawatt plus interconnection segment through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. These results demonstrate that our full spectrum strategy is working. Greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $61 million in the quarter, a meaningful bounce back from last quarter's timing-oriented pause. EMEA was the standout, including strong contributions from Johannesburg, Paris and [indiscernible] while we also saw notable strength in Northern Virginia and Tokyo. We also continue to overindex towards CPI-based escalators within our new leases with 35% of the newly signed leases in the quarter contained inflation-linked increases with fixed rate escalators on the balance. Pricing has improved in many markets. With our largest market, Northern Virginia, seen nearly a doubling of rates over the past year in response to supply constraints. Illustrating the changing tide in Ashburn, during the quarter, we opportunistically took back 8 megawatts of lease capacity from an existing customer and released it to another customer at a substantial premium. The original lease was signed in the first quarter of last year. Accordingly, our new leasing for the quarter only represents the uplift in rent achieved versus the prior lease rather than the full annualized value of the new lease. While we have previously tempered enthusiasm around the potential mark-to-market opportunity in Northern Virginia, we are encouraged by this recent transaction and our increased development potential and growing colocation and connectivity offering in this market. Aside from the shift seen in Northern Virginia, we have also seen an improvement in rates across the Americas as well as in EMEA and APAC. Looking forward, our demand funnel remains healthy with strength across product types and geographies. We expect ongoing and newly approved development capacity to be an important contributor to our growth through next year. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases was $437 million at quarter end as commencements were once again well over $100 million, balanced by new leasing. We expect the remaining $150 million of commencements in the second half of 2023 to be somewhat evenly weighted between the third and fourth quarters. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter was 11 months as certain hyperscale customers await build-out completions. During the second quarter, we signed $211 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 6.9% on a cash basis, our strongest renewal pricing in three years. This strength was shared across both product segments and across our three regions, continuing the broad-based improvement we saw last quarter with renewal rates trending over 5% during the first half combined, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to better reflect the success year-to-date in today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the zero to one megawatt category continued to climb for the sixth consecutive quarter to an increase of 4.8% in the second quarter on $133 million of volume. Greater than 1 megawatt renewals were even stronger in the second quarter as cash releasing spreads increased by considerable 8.7% on $73 million of renewals, the largest increase within this category since the third quarter of 2019. Turning to our operating results. Our operating and financial performance in the second quarter was a bit better than our expectations highlighted by many of the same factors we highlighted last quarter. The continued improvement in our core operating performance, another record quarter of interconnection revenue and well-controlled expenses. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.68 per share, 2% better versus the prior quarter and consensus expectations. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.69 per share relative to the $1.72 we reported in the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 20% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year revenue growth was impacted by both the inclusion of Teraco this year and the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe over the past 12 months. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to our customers. Excluding utility reimbursements, total revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Critically, our rental revenues in the second quarter included a $25 million onetime write-off of noncash straight-line rent and the $6 million bad debt reserve related to a tenant that declared bankruptcy during the quarter. We also wrote off $3 million of noncash straight line rent related to the re-leasing opportunity we executed in Northern Virginia. These write-offs of noncash straight-line rent of approximately $28 million combined are excluded from core FFO per share. Interconnection revenue was at a record level in the quarter, increasing by 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 8% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Bookings were higher in all three regions and ServiceFabric activations doubled in the quarter. Other than utility costs, expenses were well contained as rental property operating expenses and insurance were both flat sequentially, resulting in adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the second quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 5.6% and 1.7% sequentially. This marked the strongest year-over-year growth in our same capital pool since 2014, demonstrating the turn and fundamentals that we have been highlighting. The improvement was driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy as commencements outpace churn with upside from rent escalators and stronger-than-expected releasing spreads. While we're very encouraged by the improvement we've seen to date in this metric and the trend does indeed appear to be our friend, our enthusiasm for the second half of 2023 is tempered by the uncertainty related to a recent customer bankruptcy filing. We expect to know more about the potential impact by the time we report third quarter results. Turning to the balance sheet. As Andy outlined in his remarks, as of this week, we are meaningfully ahead of the funding plan that we laid out for you in February. We have already closed an approximately $2.2 billion of asset sales and stabilized joint ventures and expect to make additional progress on development joint ventures in the second half of this year. Specifically, earlier in July, we closed on the sale of a 65% interest in two stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Chicago campus, raising $743 million of gross proceeds. And as announced this afternoon, we sold an 80% interest in three stabilized hyperscale data centers on our Ashburn campus, raising another $1.3 billion of gross proceeds. Including proceeds from the sale of the noncore asset in Texas, we announced last month, we've raised over $2 billion in capital at a blended average cap rate of just over 6% so far this year. In addition to this capital recycling activity, during the second quarter we raised $1.1 billion of proceeds from the sale of 11 million shares of equity under our ATM. Included in this total was approximately 3.5 million shares or $335 million that was structured as forward equity issuance. These shares were settled earlier this week. Our reported leverage ratio at the quarter end was 6.8 times, while fixed charge coverage was 4.2 times. Pro forma for the JV transactions and the settlement of the forward equity outstanding at quarter end leverage was 6.3 times, putting us on track toward our near 6 time target by year-end. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly five years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.7%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform. Approximately 83% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have minimal near-term debt maturities with only $100 million maturing during the rest of this year and a well-laddered maturity schedule throughout the out years. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are affirming our full year revenue guidance range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.7 billion at the midpoint as the recent acceleration in capital recycling has been balanced by better-than-expected releasing spreads and same capital cash NOI. We are, however, adjusting our core FFO and constant currency core FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year 2023 by $0.10 per share to a new range of [6.55 to 6.65] (ph) to reflect the following : $0.03 per share tied to the acceleration of our funding plan, including greater-than-expected stabilized joint venture sales and over $1 billion of equity issuance. $0.05 to $0.07 per share for the write-off of unpaid rent and additional near-term uncertainty related to recent customer bankruptcy and about $0.01 per share of lower noncash straight-line rent tied to the opportunistic termination and releasing in Northern Virginia. Given the continued progress on the turn in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads moving up to greater than 4% and greater than 8%, respectively. An increase in our same capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 4% to 5% despite the potential impact of the customer bankruptcy this quarter, partly balanced by a reduction in our year-end portfolio occupancy assumption to 84% to 85%, largely reflecting the greater than anticipated sales of stabilized hyperscale assets into joint ventures. Given the better-than-expected execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions in JV capital. We now expect total disposition in JV capital raised to fall within the range of our current $2.2 billion, up to $3 billion. We've also reduced the amount of long-term debt financing needed to support our full year funding plan, given the nearly $4 billion of liquidity currently available as a result of asset sales, JVs and ATM equity raised. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Unidentified Participant : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You have [Alex Waters] (ph) on for Dave. Congrats on the new JV deal. Just wanted to know if you could walk us through kind of what line of sight you have for the development JV pipeline. And then looking into 2024, can you speak to how comfortable you are with the funding pipeline? And then secondly, on the core business, you've had strong releasing spreads on the greater than 1 megawatt side. Just curious on what your expectations are for this bucket heading into the second half of the year and into 2024. Thanks. Andrew Power : Hey thanks, Alex. Appreciate the kind words. I'm going to turn it to Greg to call speak to where we're going next in terms of capital raising on development JVs, maybe tie in what's happened back half of this year into 2024. And I can pick up on the core portfolio. Gregory Wright : Sounds good. Thanks, Alex. Look, with respect to the development JV guidance, we're still comfortable with our full year development JV guidance that we provided previously. That's roughly [750] (ph), give or take. And that's obviously the plug, if you will, between the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion last time, which now becomes $2.2 billion to $3 billion. Look, we remain engaged on these transactions over the second half of the year. And what we're seeing out there just as with the stabilized joint ventures, there's strong demand for the development joint ventures, particularly given that these JVs offer the highest returns and they have a lot of moving parts, though. So given the strategic considerations here, these tend to take a little longer. So, I'd say we remain optimistic and on track for those. With that, I'll turn it back over to Matt and Andy. Andrew Power : Thanks, Alex. I think for your second question was about, call it, the core operating results we saw in the quarter year-to-date and how -- what we see in the back of the year, if I'm correct. We're certainly pleased on multiple fronts on the value proposition and pricing power coming through. We saw that in our new lease signings and ROIs as well as our cash mark-to-market and which flow through to our same-store growth. We had a quite strong quarter on those stats, and you saw that we updated our guidance for the full year. So as of right now, we think that these trends on the cash mark-to-markets and pricing power will continue into the back half of 2023. Matthew Mercier : Yeah, I might just add that, again this quarter we saw all of our greater than megawatt renewals were in positive territory, and that includes across all regions as well. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jon Petersen : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Good job on the execution on the JV deal. I wanted to ask about the 8 megawatts where you had an uplift in rents. I know you talked about it, but I'm sorry, can you maybe break down like what kind of drove your ability to push those rents higher? And if you were to take that out, what were the rents per kilowatt hour in the greater than 1 megawatts in America? Andrew Power : Thanks, John. So, I'll walk through the dynamics, I'll let Matt quote that -- the actual rate on the new deal to give you a sense of the market. I mean this is obviously a market that is very tight on supply and we we\u2019ve been working with our installed customer base, if anyone had capacity that was idle or they didn't see -- have near-term need for. So hence, we were able to take back capacity from a customer since we let them out of a contract and that contract was signed, call it, a year ago at a much lower rate. And we were able to help a different customer that had immediate needs and we're able to sign that at a much higher rate. But Matt, why don't you walk through the stats? Matthew Mercier : Yes, sure. So just to be clear, the deal that you're -- that we're talking about here is not included in our renewal stats. What we are doing is showing just the net incremental revenue that we expect to recognize within our signing stats. And you'll see that more clearly when you look at Page 8 of our supplemental, in particular, in North America, the greater than a megawatt, you're going to see a deal -- you're going to see the 300 KW rate, and that's because we're only showing the incremental revenue and not the associated megawatts attached to it. If you put that deal in at, call it, 100%, you got 300 KW that would come down to 148KW. But again, it was a substantial uplift from the in-place lease. It was over 50% higher than what we had currently. Jon Petersen : I'm sorry, that's 148 KW on the 8-megawatt deal or 148KW excluding the 8-megawatt deal? Matthew Mercier : Including, that would be our blended rate, if you look at Page 8 in our supplemental versus the 300KW, okay. Jon Petersen : Okay. Okay. And then just one follow-up, just to stick with NOVA. So, with the power constraints there as long as nothing has changed, it seems like nothing new could really come online until 2026. Are you already seeing leasing demand for people that are wanting to sign leases and commit that far in advance? Andrew Power : So, John, the NOVA market, the facts, I would say, remain the same in terms of transmission lines and arrival of utility power, which has really created an environment of demand well outpacing supply. We are, I'd say, less right now focused on signings that don't commence until 2026 based on the uncertainty of when in 2026 exactly that power rise. And quite honestly, making sure that we're maximizing the opportunity at hand for us. That market has seen dramatic price improvement. We've signed deals in the larger categories, call it, 140 or north of that per kilowatt. Again, that market was in the 70s, not so long ago. And the good news, as we reported, given our breadth and history in that market, we've been able to work with our utility provider and really cobble together incremental growth capacity for our customers across our campuses. If you add them all up, prior to the 2026 arrival, call it, by 2025, if not sooner, you're approaching, call it, 100 megawatts of growth capacity in Ashburn, which is in addition to our growth capacity that we have in Manassas. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Great, thanks for taking the question guys. To start, in recent months we've seen the volume and size of deals increase. And to that point, there are many requirements on the market right now that are over 100 megawatts. As you considered the strategy moving forward, is it your intention to compete for these deals? And if so, are you willing to pursue these deals with or without a development JV lined up with the understanding that these projects will drive long-term shareholder value? And then I have a follow-up. Andrew Power : So, I can tell you, we didn't sign any 100 megawatt deals in this quarter. We are certainly around some of these opportunities. We're very focused on, call it, maximizing our footprint for its highest and best use in helping our customers the best way we can. Some of those deals obviously have led itself towards the AI domain for trading models, the need that large scales of contiguous capacity. I can tell you look at our footprint. We have extensive locations around the globe that we can help those types of customers. We are -- we've made great progress both in our capital sources, as you saw just in literally the month of July, really got back into firmer footing to support our customers' growth. Adding to that a development partner, I think we'll put even more fuel on fire to support that growth. So, I think when it comes to bigger and bigger deals, we got to make sure that they land in the right locations for Digital Realty and make sure we're maximizing the opportunity in terms of our -- what I call is really precious capacity in our land bank, in our sales and in our inventory runway. Michael Elias : Great. And then just to piggyback on that point about maximizing the opportunity. If I go back to the third quarter of 2022, you guys were clear that you were sharpening the lens to which you looked at investments with the intention of driving higher risk-adjusted return. As we think about hyperscale deals in which you would lease an entire into a single hyperscaler on a turnkey basis. Could you give us a framework for thinking about what the appropriate spread between your unlevered development yield and your cost of capital should be to make it worth it to lease it to the hyperscaler? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Michael. I think Jordan is -- can see the future because, we thought he was going to ask this question. But honestly, we haven't been thinking about that because we've been raising the bar and demand has been outpacing the supply where anything that even kind of feels skinny or close to not just reaching our cost of capital is not made it on to where we're investing our dollars. And you can see that in our development life cycle where you have the whole schedule of the 377 plus megawatts underway, north of 10% ROI. That includes the Americas region, North America that, call it, 9% and still weighted down by projects that were, call it, open book yield on cost projects, almost legacy in vain that is weighting down those averages. I can tell you these opportunities we're seeing even for larger capacity blocks in these tight markets, be it Northern Virginia, be it Singapore, be it Frankfurt or elsewhere, we're certainly into the double digits unlevered ROIs, which I think that well exceeds the risk-adjusted of deploying capital and it really is coming down more to supply/demand dynamics than just, call it, premiums. And I think if you look at the great work our investments team did on transacting on some of these JVs and the new partners we brought in the fold and called the six-ish cap area I think you're seeing a lot of value creation in our model. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. A couple of questions. I wondered what -- how to kind of think -- you said you're not going to issue any more debt this year. But given some of the other moving parts around possible asset sales and so forth, are there any more of those to come? And how can we think about the leverage trajectory of getting perhaps into the high fives or whatnot? And then secondly, I was curious just about India. Is your partner contributing any assets prospectively going forward? Thanks. Andrew Power : Matt can speak to the funding in our sources and uses in the guidance and leverage, and then Chris and I can [indiscernible] the India piece? Matthew Mercier : Yes, so thanks Jon. There's a couple of aspects here, I think, are important. One to reiterate, as of today, we've got $4 billion of liquidity, thanks to the execution of the broader team. If you look at where our funding needs are going forward, this year based on looking at our life cycle, what's remaining to be spent, our guidance in terms of what's left to be spent, we're talking about somewhere in the [1.2 to 1.3] (ph) left to spend this year. So that gives us a pretty significant runway into 2024 to be able to fund the continued growth and opportunities that we see going forward. On top of that, as we also noted, we're not stopping in terms of the execution on asset sales as well as the potential that we're continuing to seek for development joint venture partners that will give us an even broader access to capital and be able to help us to fund not only some of that capital need into 2024, but also potentially this year as well, which rounds out into your question on leverage. We've made considerable progress again on that front as well. As I noted in the prepared remarks, you look at us on a pro forma basis, we're at 6.3% now. So made considerable progress on that. You layer on top of that our expected view of continuing to grow our EBITDA as we've left that guidance line unchanged, again, as well as continue to seek development joint venture partners that will continue to help us on that deleveraging process. So, we feel pretty good about progress to date on both liquidity and leverage. And I'll turn it over to Greg on the India JV topic. Gregory Wright : Just on India, just -- I mean, I think it\u2019s less about the assets. It's more -- obviously, they're going to be share in development opportunities in a huge market with a lot of growth, but it's really about a great, fantastic new partner to the partnership. And maybe Chris can touch on Jio and what we think they bring to the table here. Christopher Sharp : Absolutely. I appreciate the conversation, Jon. So, it's a culmination of expertise, right, where Brookfield brings local investing expertise digital really, we bring the data center expertise to that market. But I think what really Jio brings is that local operating expertise and maybe many of you already know, but Jio is one of the largest mobile media platforms throughout India. And I think their extensive reach and ability to interconnect critical enterprises or other destinations is something that's going to allow us not to deliver a like-for-like product. And I think Greg and I have been talking about this for many years and looking at the fact that we wanted to be able to differentiate our ability to be successful within India. And so that partnership with Reliance and Jio has really elevated our ability to service the broader enterprise customer base, which, quite frankly, is unique in the -- it's a lot of our large hyperscale customers as well. So the amalgamation of that trio coming to market is something that we're excited about. We're still in early innings. So, you'll see it evolve over time, but pretty excited about the opportunity in India. Jonathan Atkin : If I could quickly add on interconnect trends and anything to expect going forward in terms of just the trajectory, any particular reason why it might see pressure because of grooming or acceleration because of new use cases and is AI play a role at all in the interconnect at this point? Thanks. Andrew Power : Sure. Appreciate it, Jon. Just to further jump into that. Yes, interconnection, I think, is something that's evolving rather quickly. I think artificial intelligence is definitely evolving, and it's in its early stages to date. I think where we've been watching and what I think has shown through and we referenced in the prepared remarks is the fact that it's the highest five year growth, two straight quarters surpassing $100 million. I think that's very unique to us and the platform that we represent in the market. I would also say that some of the activities that we've been doing around ServiceFabric, which quite frankly, is tailored to streamlining the technical kind of barriers that have been placed upon the customers to access all of these destinations where data resides, which at the core of artificial intelligence, where I think your question is at, you have to have access to data. And so, being able to be a part of one of the largest open platforms that quite frankly, allows customers to access these data oceans of both public and private deployments. I think the platform is starting to pay off. And I would say that, again, early innings with AI, but we're very excited about what that demand is going to represent inside of our portfolio. And as we evolved and we're stable stay of what we did in the foundation of cloud, you'll see us be able to be at a steady state with a lot of these customers evolving AI as well. Operator : The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead. David Guarino : Thanks. So looking at your development tables, you guys are developing assets at 10% stabilized yields and feels like if that stays, you can sell assets at fixed cap rates. That's a pretty healthy spread on the development profit margin. So, I guess I was just wondering, since you've already hit your initial disposition target that range you set out why do you see the need to do more JV development at this point? Why not just look to sell more stabilized assets? Gregory Wright : David, it's Greg here. Look, I think when you take a look -- as we laid out, and Andy laid out at the beginning of the year, the reason for finding these development partners is, look, when you look at this opportunity in the hyperscale business today, it goes well beyond our balance sheet even at $55 billion. So when you look at that, what it tells you is you got to have third-party capital to meet the customers' needs within -- throughout the globe for that business. So as we sit here today, even though we have, as you said, we've exceeded our guidance on what we were going to do. [indiscernible] look at this strategically go forward, and we think that's the best way to fund that business to create value for our shareholders. So that's why we're going to continue to fund it through development. And we think that's the most prudent way to move forward with it. David Guarino : Okay. And then maybe switching topics on the tenant bankruptcy, Matt, you were talking about, which I think is a former public data center company. Can you walk us through what eventually happens to that space? Are you guys just waiting now to renegotiate with the tenants? And I guess, how soon if that's not the case, can you start releasing that space? Andrew Power : David, just to add on to the last question, and I could [indiscernible] the second part of your question. The -- I think there's been -- our balance sheet today has, call it, north of 3 gigawatts of growth capacity around the world. And we see that expanding and having the balance sheet to be help funded alongside some great partners is another part of becoming more efficient and more quickly driving returns and results to our bottom lines. In a market and an opportunity backdrop that keeps getting bigger, it was large to begin with, cloud computing accelerated that with hyperscale demand. And AI is just an incremental lift to this wave of demand. Hence, we believe the best way to tackle this opportunity and support our customers while driving results to the bottom line is in partnerships on the capital front. When it comes to the customer bankruptcy, obviously, this customer is in the middle of bankruptcies so can't share too much. The typical playbook is the creditors essentially have to run a process for the assets or the business. And as part of that, make decisions on either accepting or rejecting leases. We have not, to date, had any leases rejected so far. While they have rejected other providers or landlord leases, I don't think you can assume that every one of our leases despite that fact will be accepted. But from a strategic lens, this is why years ago we increased our capabilities and be able to expand in the colocation interconnection offering and support end customers. So when -- if and when we sell to customers would have issues, we can essentially step in and support the end customers and have adequate financial outcomes and the [indiscernible] capabilities. So that there's a little bit of wait and see as this customer works its way through bankruptcy, and I think we'll have more to report by the third quarter call. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups. So first, as you're looking at the portfolio, what's the value of data center assets that you own that could be considered for future joint ventures? So what's left in terms of opportunity for recycling? And then also, can you just provide us an update on how you're doing and the opportunities to improve, whether it's overall occupancy or same capital occupancy within the portfolio? Thanks. Andrew Power : Sure. I mean hyperscale is still a large piece of our business in terms of our installed base and certainly a lot of what's going into our current development pipeline as it stands. I think in conjunction with the creation of Digital Core REIT, we came to an estimation of, call it, $15 billion of value as a round ballpark in terms of things that would fit the bill essentially -- similar to the transactions we just announced in the month of July, fully stabilized, hyperscale-oriented long-weighted average lease length. Honestly, core assets parts of our campus, but the slowest organic growers of our portfolio. Less interconnection-rich, less customer rich. I think the more recent portfolios. We've sold, call it, 10 plus or minus customers in them. We're supporting 5,000 customers here in Digital Realty. So we still think that there's an opportunity to continue to build on these partnerships like the great partnerships we just announced. And essentially, be able to maintain 100% ownership of the highest growing pieces of our puzzle. When it comes to the same-store growth, Matt, why don't you pick that up in terms of the levers that we've been pushing hard to drive that? Matthew Mercier : Yes. So I call out a couple of things. So first, I mean, we have been making what, I would say, is good to great progress so far. If you look at it versus last year, were up 80 basis points on our stabilized pool. We're going to continue, we think, to improve that over the course of this year into next year. And that's going to be a mix of essentially twofold, spaces where we believe that there's opportunity for larger customers. We're going to continue to target that given density requirements and the growing need for capacity across a global portfolio that we have, we're going to find opportunities to fill that in. But I think part of it and part of why it takes -- it's going to take a little bit more time to continue to improve the overall occupancy is that we're also looking where we can convert some of that space that we do have in the productized co-lo lease that over time because we see the growing need for enterprise demand and where we want to be able to capitalize that which is a higher return and a market that we want to be able to penetrate and grow even further from where we are today. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. Can you comment on the situation in Singapore, I guess, with the government allowing a few new players coming in. How do you think that affects the pricing there? And then looking at the capital recycling, kind of where do you go from here? I know you are continuing to look at other diversification strategies. Is this kind of sort of finish this out? Or what are some other areas of capital sources that you can look at to reach that goal? Thanks. Andrew Power : So on the first one on Singapore, I mean, I think what you're seeing is, supply still to get metered out at very small and rational clips. When after the years of no supply, the big unveiling is literally four different players getting 20-megawatt increments is relatively modest. I mean our latest data center build in that market was, I think, almost double that size of a need. So -- and this is not only happening with Singapore. You're seeing power constraints, be it from transmission or generation, moratoriums, broader [indiscernible], environmental concerns, just ratcheting and making the supply constraints to be more rational. That's why we're quite pleased that we have on our balance sheet, a long runway of growth for our customers with our campuses across 50-plus metros on six continents and the supply chain to support their growth. And this is all against a backdrop where the demand is outpacing the supply. Greg, do you want to reiterate where we go next on the capital recycling? Gregory Wright : Yes. Thanks. Look, I think as we said, we're going to continue to focus our efforts on the remainder of this year on our development joint ventures we talked about. But to answer your question specifically, you asked about other sources of capital, we're -- how we think about it. Look, I think as a whole, we've done a pretty good job so far. As we said, we have the dedicated core REIT in Singapore. So that's a public vehicle. We've obviously just announced two transactions what we would characterize as distinguished blue chip investment partners in both GI and TPG. And look, we continue to see strong interest across the board, so not just [indiscernible], but we see infrastructure funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies and the like. So we're seeing a broad-based demand here, looking at transactions, both stabilized core assets and development assets. So look, we're bullish on that. And when we look at that again, we think that's the prudent way to fund our growth going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So Andy, I think you've talked about getting down to 5.5 times leverage longer term. So maybe you could just walk through the path to get there beyond this year. And how much incremental capital recycling or JVs or other forms of capital you think you might need if you look past this year? And is the goal here to ultimately becoming more self-funding so that you can share more of the economics yourself instead of using development partners? Michael Elias : Yes. So this is Matt. I'll take that. I mean we do have -- our longer-term plan is to get down closer to 5.5 times. Again, I think we've done a considerable amount of work. We said this year, we'd look to be closer to that 6 times. You look at us based on what we've achieved and executed so far with the $2 billion from the joint ventures that we've done on stabilized assets, the billion we've raised in equity so far to date, which has come in. We're at pro forma at 6.3%. And we see the path going forward to getting back even further down as we have backlog and continue to execute on leasing that comes online, our EBITDA continues to grow, and we execute on these development joint ventures. We believe those are going to be two of the major components, which are going to help us get down to that 5.5 times target as we start to look through 2024. But we're not in a position at this point in time to give 2024 guidance yet, but I think those are the 2 main levers that we're going to be looking at to continue to drive our -- and improve our balance sheet and our leverage position. Eric Luebchow : Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. I think you still had some noncore portfolios out in the market today. And I guess given how successful you've been with capital recycling so far, is that kind of becoming less of a priority as you look forward? Or do you still plan to transact on some of those markets that are out there today? Gregory Wright : Look, Eric, we -- as you said, we've been fortunate we've had good demand and good execution this year. And look, we're already -- we're 30% of the way through, and we have other transactions we're working on. But as we always said in the past, the good news for us is these noncore assets are all a very, very, very small piece of our portfolio. So we have the benefit of being disciplined and making sure we get, we think is fair value. So we're going to continue with that approach like we have historically and continue to pursue them. But again, we're seeing demand for those assets as well. So we'll continue to work on it, and we'll continue to post you as we have things to talk about. Operator : The next question comes from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thank you for the question. I have one and a follow-up. So within your improved bookings this quarter, are you able to call out whether there was any sort of contribution from AI or any AI-related deployments from our customers? Andrew Power : Hi, Irvin, that's a great question. I'm going to turn it over to our CRO, who really grabbed the baton and ran through the finish line strong, Colin McLean, to talk to what we saw on the AI front and maybe just give a little bit more color on the quarter in terms of bookings and new customers. Colin McLean : Yes. Thanks, Andy. Appreciate the question, Irvin. Yes, certainly, AI is becoming a growing part of our conversation in pipeline overall. Just to revert back a bit on the overall pipeline dynamics we're seeing, I would say, describe it overall, the pipeline is strong, healthy and diverse across the board, particularly strong in the zero to one megawatt side and growing part of that AI is definitely a part of not just the hyperscale piece of the business, but also the zero to one megawatt, and we've had some strong contributions on that front. So overall, we really feel like both the results in the pipeline itself, the demand to be a testimony and validation really of our pivot to serving the entirety of the client needs, network, enterprise and hyperscalers. So I would say both on the AI front and frankly, the cloud and hybrid IT, we're seeing some really growing success and growing conversations with clients. So we remain optimistic and serving both the pervasive needs of clients as well as AI. And I think that's going to be a growing part of our portfolio as we move forward. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thank you for the color there. So my second question is on the strong pricing that you saw over the past two quarters. Can you just share with us how pricing trended quarter-to-quarter and the overall linearity of pricing trends now that we're one month into Q3? Andrew Power : The -- I would, Irvin [indiscernible] continuation of the commentary that we've been saying now for several quarters and that the pendulum on supply-demand fundamentals has been, call it, winded our back and growing. Our value proposition with our customers has been more and more well received. That's from our installed base who's been growing with us. Majority of our signings were from the existing customer base. That's also from -- I think it was our second highest new logo quarter of 133 new logos or new customers. And that has been broad-based, as Matt mentioned, across regions and product types. In the less than a megawatt category, it's been more steady [indiscernible] but obviously inflecting, call it, like-for-like increases. And on the greater than megawatt, it's been a little bit more volatile but in a positive fashion. As demand has remained intact, if not further increased and precious large capacity blocks have become fewer far between and the future of that supply bottlenecks really changing course does not seem to be near term whatsoever. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Andrew Power : Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty had a strong second quarter. Our results demonstrate that our meeting place value proposition is resonating with customers. Just since our last call, we raised over $3 billion of new capital, positioning the company for the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We posted strong organic operating results with the results confirming the continued inflection in our core data center business. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and recognize our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And we'll aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate. Leasing was strong across both our primary product category with record overall bookings in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, and an acceleration in our greater than megawatt segment. Second, we saw a further continuation of the improvements in our fundamental metrics. Strong demand and tight supply remains supportive of pricing, and this is evident in our results. Same capital cash NOI growth was the best in more than a decade at 9.4%, while cash releasing spreads eclipsed 7% in the quarter, which caused us to raise full year guidance for these metrics for the second consecutive quarter. Third, we continue to diversify and bolster our balance sheet with almost $4 billion of capital raised to date, including two hyperscale core joint ventures announced in July, and another almost $200 million of noncore sales, bringing total dispositions to $2.5 billion year-to-date. The capital that we've raised this year has enabled us to increase our liquidity and delever while expanding our investment in development that we expect to generate double-digit unlevered returns. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. Andrew Power : Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The third quarter marks nine months since being appointed to my current role as CEO, and this marks the fourth official earnings call. While there has been about as much volatility in a single year as I can recall from my 20-plus-year career, it has been a privilege and an honor to have the opportunity to visit and work with and to watch my Digital Realty colleagues across the globe execute on behalf of our customers and stakeholders during these extraordinary times. At the outset of this year, I highlighted three key priorities for our company. While we've got two months left in the year, I am very excited about our progress to date and look forward to finishing strong. As you recall, our key strategic priorities are : first, to demonstrably strengthen our customer value proposition, which means that we are adding connectivity-rich solutions and scale capacity to drive our global meeting place strategy. We are executing this through the addition and launch of new on-ramps, the expansion of our colo capacity end markets and also by providing visibility into longer-term hyperscale capacity in our largest core markets. We are making strides and our customers are recognizing this by landing and expanding their IT infrastructure within our facilities. For example, over the past few months, we've added on ramps from a number of the largest cloud service providers, including AWS and Oracle. Our second priority is to integrate and innovate. For the first time, we created an Americas region and formally organized the company into three regions to improve overall management and accountability. In addition, we moved global operations under an experienced Digital Realty leader, bringing the standardization and consistency across our global platform. We also reorganized all things technology under our CTO organization. Consistent with our aim to bring innovation to our customers end market, in the third quarter, we announced the launch of our first Nvidia DGX H100-Ready data center in Osaka, Japan. We also rolled out our new high-density colo offering across 28 global metros to support high-performance compute infrastructure, addressing data and AI-related growth challenges. We are also partnering with other leaders around the world to enhance our open platform. In this vein, we recently added BT and Lumin to our Service Fabric platform, which connects our data centers globally extending the reach of our customers and partners. And we made some nice progress on the sustainability front in the quarter, which I'll circle back to in a moment. Finally, we set out to bolster and diversify our capital sources. And to date, we've reduced leverage by 0.8 turns of EBITDA from the 1Q peak and increased liquidity to $3-plus billion, including $1 billion of cash on hand. We executed on our funding plan that included the completion of two stabilized hyperscale JVs this quarter, tapping into some of the deepest pools of private capital, and we remain confident in our ability to add to this progress with development JVs in the near future. If we deliver on our key strategic priorities, we expect that this will translate into better long-term sustainable growth for our customers, team members and in turn, our shareholders. Digital Realty continues to make progress in the third quarter with further improvement in our operational results highlighted by 9-plus percent same capital cash NOI growth strong leasing results with record 0 to 1-megawatt signings, the highest greater than megawatt pricing since 2016, record leasing in APAC with broad strength in the Americas, and record interconnection revenue with the strongest growth since 2018. The momentum across the data center infrastructure landscape is strong. Demand for our data center capacity remains broad-based both geographically and by product, as reflected in our leasing results. New supply in our top markets remains constrained and is likely to remain so due to limited availability of power, growing supply chain challenges and tighter financial conditions. While the demand drivers we have enjoyed for the last several years, including cloud, digital transformation and hybrid IT remain largely intact, AI applications have added a meaningful new layer, which is just beginning to materialize in our leasing results this quarter, and we are ready for it. When Chris first started speaking publicly about AI and high-performance compute at our Investor Day in December 2017, we are already in the process of architecting and designing our facilities to support the evolving densities and our most innovative and leading-edge customers. While there are multiple high-density workloads running in our portfolio since at least that time, in the last quarter alone we were able to accommodate a handful of high-density compute deployments from one of our service provider customers in a 10-plus year old data center in one of our smallest markets. And we are currently supporting one of our customers' AI infrastructure deployments that will incorporate 32,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This doesn't mean that Digital Realty will be chasing large AI deployments far and wide, as we will continue to assess the longer-term opportunity set of remotely located single-tenant non-differentiated data centers. But it does mean that there has been an increase in demand for our highly connected campuses in core markets. We're being thoughtful in how we approach these opportunities. As we consider leasing our capacity, I expect that we will seek to support our long-term engaged partners that have become embedded within our meeting place community that value our strategic locations and the connectivity across platform digital. At the same time, in certain markets, we will selectively support customers that have a differentiated product offering as we've always been at the forefront supporting leading technology companies as they push their infrastructure capabilities. Let's move to our third quarter results. This quarter continued to demonstrate the fundamental recovery that we've been highlighting throughout this year. Leasing activity was strong and broad-based across product types and reflected the pricing recovery we have seen throughout our portfolio. While we routinely lead with our headline leasing figures, it is important to point out the record posted in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment in the quarter, which increased by more than 9% sequentially and nearly 28% over the prior year period. Total new leasing during the quarter was $152 million with record 0-1 megawatt signings representing just over one-third of total signings. Greater than a megawatt science moved higher for the second consecutive quarter led by the Americas region, while our team also put up a record quarter in APAC. Pricing remains firm with notable highs achieved across the greater than one megawatt segment with strength in the 0-1 megawatt category. Growing recognition of our value proposition, including our comprehensive product offering, along with strong demand trends and reduced availability are supportive of pricing and are helping to drive better core growth and higher returns on investment. In the third quarter, we saw re-leasing spreads climbed to 7.4% on a cash basis contributing to the strongest same capital cash NOI growth in more than a decade. During the third quarter, churn remained low at 1.1% and we added 117 new customers extending our string of 100-plus new logos per quarter to 3.5 years. Another strong validation of the value that enterprise customers around the world recognize in platform digital. Our focus on deepening the value of our campus has resulted in enhanced cloud access for Digital Realty. Recently, 4 out of 5 top B2B cloud providers complete multisite on-ramp and edge expansions to serve data-intensive workloads on two continents via Platform Digital. In addition, AWS announced a direct connect location in Seoul, the first carrier-neutral facility in the market, while we announced the Oracle FastConnect availability in Madrid to their EU sovereign cloud. Other key wins during the quarter included a speech-to-text AI provider completed their second HD colo deployment in six months on Platform Digital, multiple new logos in the health care vertical in the quarter, two Global 2000 health care companies deployed on Platform Digital, one supportive data-intensive AI workloads and the other implementing a 2-site data compliance solution. An international Tier 1 telco added a multi-metro expansion across two continents of Platform Digital to support their retail enterprise customers. A Global 2000 Bank is implementing multi-site, multi-region network hub deployments now totaling 15 metros and a Global 2000 insurance company is expanding a distributed data hub on Platform Digital to support M&A data compliance. Moving over to our largest market, Northern Virginia. More than a year since we learned the power constraints in this market, we have continued to work constructively with the power providers to confirm the commitments that we made to our customers and to provide growth capacity for our customers through new development and select churn opportunities. As discussed on our last earnings call, we identified almost 100 megawatts of development capacity in Loudoun County that we expect to be able to bring to market prior to 2026. This includes 56 megawatts of available capacity underway within the current development pipeline and the potential to move forward on another 40 megawatts. In addition to this Ashburn-focused capacity, we continue to advance the ball on our 192-megawatt development in site in Manassas, and we are now officially underway and will soon be patent ready to support construction of the first of two buildings on the site in early 2024. We are very excited to be able to offer this availability to our customers. Moving on to our investment activity. Digital Realty investment team has already had an extraordinarily productive year, including the $2.3 billion of JVs and noncore asset sales completed in the third quarter. Within the noncore bucket, we sold two facilities during the quarter, including one in the U.K. and the other in Chantilly, Virginia, totaling almost $200 million, including the $150 million noncore disposition in Texas that we completed last quarter, we're tracking well towards our $500 million target for the noncore asset sales in 2023. We closed two separate stabilized hyperscale joint ventures in July with the contribution of two assets in Chicago and three in Northern Virginia, raising $2.1 billion of proceeds. We've also made substantial progress on the third bucket of our funding plan, the development joint ventures, and we expect to have more to say about this in the fourth quarter. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the third quarter. We've continued to make progress on our water conservation initiatives, including a water saving initiative for cooling towers and our SIN10 facility in Singapore. The project won the inaugural Green Innovations, Water Solutions Award at the Singapore Environment Council's Environmental Achievement Awards. The project is expected to save over 1.2 million liters of water each month and improved water usage efficiency by 15%. The solution has now been evaluated for wider rollout across our portfolio. In the third quarter, we also announced that we are ranked in the top 10 on a U.S. EPA's National Top 100 list of the large green power users from the Green Power partnership. The company also ranked seventh on the EPA's list across technology and telecommunication providers. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Matthew Mercier : Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed a total of $152 million of new leases in the third quarter with broad-based strength across each of our two primary product groups and geographic strength in the Americas and APAC. We leased a record $54 million in the 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection category, accounting for 35% of total bookings. This product segment remains a consistent and steady source of growth as we continue to execute on our global meeting place strategy. Interconnection bookings were strong once again at over $12 million as we added another 2,000 cross connects in the quarter, finishing with 218,000 total cross-connects, greater than a megawatt bookings totaled $97 million in the quarter with outsized contributions from Portland and Hong Kong. This was our highest greater than a megawatt signings quarter since we discussed sharpening the lens with regard to capital allocation decisions one year ago. Our greater focus and increased threshold have resulted in higher average returns in the greater than a megawatt category as implied by the growing expected stabilized returns in the Americas that we present on the development life cycle schedule in our supplemental. Pricing continues to improve across most markets globally with outsized pricing power experienced within the greater than the megawatt segment, which saw pricing on signed leases at the highest level since the first half of 2016. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases increased to a new record of $482 million at quarter end. As commencements of $110 million were more than offset by elevated new leasing volume in the quarter. We expect nearly 15% of the backlog to commence in the fourth quarter with a little over 50% commencing throughout 2024. The lag between signings and commencements in the quarter ticked up to 12 months, driven by new development and build-outs to support larger scale leases. During the third quarter, we signed $156 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 7.4% on a cash basis, the strongest re-leasing spreads achieved since 2015. While renewal pricing was strong across product segments and across our three regions, the overall result was upwardly skewed by a single transaction within our other category. Excluding this outlier, renewal, releasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 4.5% on a cash basis and 6.4% on a GAAP basis. We feel that this is a more representative picture of the renewal spreads that we are seeing throughout the portfolio, which is consistent with the broad-based improvement we've seen throughout this year. With renewal rates trending higher over the first 9 months of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for renewal spreads to reflect the success year-to-date and today's improved fundamental environment. Renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt category continued their steady climb with 4.4% growth on a cash basis in the third quarter on $125 million of volume. Greater than a megawatt renewals continued to post strong results, with cash renewals higher by 5.6%, albeit on lighter volume of $19 million in the third quarter. In terms of earnings growth, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.62 per share, broadly consistent with consensus expectations, but down $0.06 per share versus the second quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the asset sales and the equity raised in the quarter and the redeployment of capital into accelerated and increased development. On a constant currency basis, core FFO was $1.60 per share relative to the $1.67 we reported in the third quarter of 2022. Total revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially despite the impact of the more than $2 billion of asset sales completed early in the quarter as the benefits of improved pricing are starting to take hold. Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth also continues to be impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Most of these energy costs are directly passed through to customers. Excluding the impact of utility and other reimbursements, total revenue was up 13% year-over-year. Interconnection revenue of $107 million marked another quarterly record and was 12% higher than the year ago period. Excluding Teraco, interconnection revenue was up 11% year-over-year, the highest interconnection growth since 2018 and reflects the ongoing organic strength in our core footprint. Quarter-over-quarter interconnection revenue was up almost 3% and as 2,000 new cross connects were added, increasing the total global installed base to 218,000. Moving over to the expense side, utilities were seasonally high given the warmer summer months and off an already elevated 2023 base. Rental property operating expenses remained essentially flat for the second consecutive quarter, partly reflecting the benefit of the removal of expenses related to the dispositions and joint ventures. However, on the noncontrollable expense front, property taxes spiked higher quarter-over-quarter to $72 million, driven by an elevated reassessment on some of our properties in Chicago. While these expenses will be largely passed on to our underlying customers, it will also be disputed over the coming years. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. One nonrecurring item worth noting in the quarter was the $113 million noncash impairment charge related to the lower value of our holdings in digital core REIT stock. The Singapore REIT IPO-ed in December 2021 at $0.88 per share, but was valued at $0.53 per share at the end of September, driving the noncash adjustment in our carrying value of the investment. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the third quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.4% but moderating by 1.5% sequentially due to the expected increase in utility bleed during the seasonally warmer months. Even on a constant currency basis, year-over-year cash NOI growth was strong at 6.6%. These results demonstrate the strongest period of organic growth in our same capital pool since 2014, and extends the turning fundamentals that we have been highlighting throughout this year. Turning to the balance sheet. We meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet during the third quarter, driven by the success that we've had on our funding plan. This progress continues today, and as a result, we have raised our full year capital raising target for the second consecutive quarter. In the third quarter, we generated over $2.6 billion proceeds from JV closings, noncore asset sales and settlement of the equity forward. Roughly $1 billion was redeployed into our development program and a little over $500 million was used to repay higher cost USD borrowings on our credit facility. The remaining amount was kept in cash, earning interest at a rate in excess of the remaining borrowings under our credit facility. As a result, at quarter end, we had over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage fell to 6.3x net debt to EBITDA, down from 6.8x at the end of the second quarter and we are now within spitting distance of our near 6x leverage goal that we set out to achieve by year-end. Since the end of the quarter, we paid off CHF 100 million notes that matured in October and are confident in our ability to execute on additional asset sales and development joint ventures that are left in our upwardly revised funding plan. Moving to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Lastly, let's turn to our guidance. We are tightening our core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2023 by $0.03 at the high and low ends to a new range of $6.58 to $6.62 per share, maintaining the midpoint of $6.60 per share. We are also tightening the range for full year adjusted EBITDA, affirming our full year guidance midpoint of $2.7 billion. Our full year revenue guidance range is being adjusted down by about 1% at the midpoint to a new range of $5.475 billion to $5.525 billion to reflect the impact of lower pass-through oriented tenant utility reimbursements given the moderation in electricity pricing in EMEA. Importantly, you'll recall that last quarter's core FFO per share guidance reflected a $0.05 to $0.07 per share impact from a bankrupt customer, including $0.02 that was realized in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we received all of the rent due from this customer across our portfolio, but we did incur a $0.01 write-off related to unpaid utility expenses and we expect that we could see up to another $0.02 of dilution related to this customer in the fourth quarter. In addition, we could see up to $0.01 of drag related to the carryforward of increased Chicago property tax assessment and $0.01 of drag related to the acceleration and increase of development spend as we capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing in front of us. With the continued improvement in our fundamentals during the quarter, we are also updating the organic operating metrics supporting our full year guidance, including cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads of over 5%, up from 4%. Same capital cash NOI growth of 6% to 7%, representing a 200 basis points increase versus prior guidance and a reduction in year-end portfolio occupancy to between 83% and 84%, reflecting the delayed timing of the sale of a vacant nondata center asset in our portfolio. Given the successful leasing executed in the third quarter and the increased level of demand embedded within our pipeline, we are increasing our full year development spend guidance to $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for 2023, representing the $400 million increase at the midpoint. Similarly, reflecting the continued execution on our funding plan to date, we have also updated our guidance for dispositions and JV capital to $2.7 million to $3.2 billion, representing a $350 million increase at the midpoint, which is in line with the increase in our expected development spend for this year. While development has been an important driver of our growth for the last decade, in the short term, we are experiencing the headwinds from the sharp regime change in interest rates. This year, we've sold assets at 6 caps, and new borrowings on our liner at similar levels, whereas GAAP requires us to capitalize interest at our weighted average borrowing cost of less than 3%. In other words, increasing our development spend today, to capitalize on the growing opportunities we are seeing is dilutive to near-term earnings. These projects underway are completed at incrementally higher yields and the relatively low rate of capitalized interest burns off, we expect development completions will become increasingly accretive to core FFO per share. The good news is that fundamentals are helping to mitigate a portion of this dilution. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thanks. So I was interested in the development JVs that you alluded to. It sounds like there's something relatively imminent or maybe a couple of transactions. Can you point to the leverage reduction benefit that we should expect? And then related to that, give us a sense of the tailwinds and the headwinds that might affect core FFO per share for next year? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks Jon. Why don't you let Greg touch on his activity, it's been the tip of the spear on our development JVs, which unfortunately, we couldn't time not just one but two announcements like last quarter, but we haven't been idle and they're making some great progress. But Greg, why don't you give us a color? Gregory Wright : Yes. Thanks, Jon. Look, I think as Andy mentioned, look, last quarter, which we already announced, we were - we had our two stabilized joint ventures with TPG in Northern Virginia and obviously, GI and Chicago, which generated about $2.2 billion of proceeds. And we -- what we found in that process was demand was very robust to invest in data center assets in the private market, and the same holds true. We're continuing to see even more demand for stabilized assets. And I would go as far as to say it's even greater investor demand, when you look at the development potential development JVs. All I can tell you is we're working hard, and we hope we have something here in relatively short order to report. But right now, no more guidance than that. Other than that, demand remains strong, and we remain encouraged. Operator : The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I want to follow-up a little bit on the second part of Jonathan's question, which was thinking about 2024. When we began 2023, we were looking at same-store cash NOI growth in the mid-3s and now it's pushing towards 7%. We're talking about a decade level improvements in interconnection and sub-megawatt leasing and greater than one megawatt leasing. Andy, you frequently talked over the year about how re-leasing and greater than one megawatt, you couldn't confidently say would be greater than zero and here we are. And then we've lapped the first year of the Teraco acquisition, which was supposed to be dilutive in year one, neutral in year two, accretive in year three. So outside of some accounting issues, it kind of feels like all the needles are pointing up into 2024. And before I get too excited, tell me where I'm wrong? Andrew Power : Thanks, David. We appreciate the kudos there. Before I hand off to Matt to give you a 2024 guidance on this call, which I can tell you we weren't prepared for. I'll just chime in with just some color. So you're right, with the - the trend has been our friend on multiple fronts. And I think we tried to signal this at the outset of the year, and we were a bit of a show-me story, but we saw our value proposition resonating. We saw the pricing environment firming and continue that momentum, whether it's asking rates, ROIs on our development pipeline at cash mark-to-market in both product sets, and I would say that environment is continuing. But before Matt take the air out of the balloon with no early guidance, I mean there are obviously headwinds that Matt can talk to that we're still working through. But Matt, why don't you give some of your thoughts? Matthew Mercier : Yes, sure. Thanks, David. I mean I think we - and we kind of talked about this a little bit towards the end of my prepared remarks, but I think, as we've been - one, we've been pretty clear about a desire to deleverage, which we've made substantial progress on. We started the year close to $7 billion, we're at $6.3 billion. We're making progress on that like, I stated at the start of the year. And we're doing that through level of capital recycling asset sales that are going to have an impact not only on this year, but we'll have some follow-through into next year. And we're doing it at a time also where we're looking to take advantage of what we see is a great opportunity in the market, where supply-demand fundamentals are about as strong as they've been. And we see opportunities to deploy capital, but that capital is coming at a higher cost today than it was. And therefore, it's dilutive near term, until that capacity comes online. And we think it's the prudent thing to do, but that's part of the dynamic that we're dealing with. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Right. Thanks for taking my questions. First, could you help us think about the sources of funding? And really what I mean by that is you raised equity at $97 a share, but you didn't raise equity when your stock was at $130. Presumably, the cost of that equity would have been lower than selling assets at, call it, a 9% cap rate. Just wondering how you're thinking about the use of equity as you march towards that, call it, 5.5 times leverage target next year? And then I have a follow-up? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Michael. So Jordan's got us playing by new rules to make sure everyone get at least one question on the call. So, we've got one question, but we'll try to get you on the next round for your follow-up. I think our actions are speaking louder than our words hopefully here, whereby we had tremendous success in the first half of the year or dribbling into the month of July on both non-core dispose followed by major hyperscale stabilized assets. And the fact that we haven't moved forward with any additional equity issuance of common stock, I think this speaks to our conviction on the next leg of private capital raisings with the development joint venture or joint ventures being the next leg of the stool. So - and I think those are things that will - are strategic and different for our company in relative to prior experience. Where we're going to share the non-cash flow period of these projects that are large, massive capital-intensive and long-term projects and allow some of these great fundamentals we've seen flow through to the bottom line. That doesn't mean we're 100% averse to ever issuing equity at the right time in the right quorum at the right price. But I think we believe we've got some incremental milestones or wins to put on the board here that are in the not-so-distant future, before we be ready. And this is on the back of tremendous progress. We've taken the balance sheet down, what 0.8 turns of EBITDA, literally in two quarters worth of reporting. So - and so I'm pleased with the progress, and I would say that we have more good news to come. Before - one last thing. I want to hand over to Greg because you made a comment on the non-core dispos, just - I think that we should clarify what that really means to us. Gregory Wright : Yes. Thanks, Andy. Hi Michael, Look, I don't think it's right to say a 9% - you're selling an asset at a 9% cap rate versus what your implied multiple is on your company. In our minds, from a capital allocation perspective, those are two very different things. One is the assets we sold, they're noncore assets, right? One's in Watford, ones in Chantilly. Anyhow what does that mean to us? I mean these are non-campus assets with limited connectivity, right? And when you look at Chantilly, Wilson Nova, it's neither of the major markets of Loudon and Manassas, right? And so when you look at these assets, they're older, they're stand-alone assets. Now this is a very, very small portion of our business. But we call these assets out. So I don't think we can sit here and assess a cap rate on one or two non-core assets versus selling equity in the business. These are assets that are not part of our core business going forward and non-strategic to us, that's a very different analysis. So, I would just caution folks to say, Hey, here's a couple of assets that were non-core that were signed as a nine, therefore, that's not the right cost of capital play or the right capital allocation, because I think it is. Operator : The next question comes from David Guarino of Green Street. Please go ahead. David Guarino : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On Page 9 of your presentation you put out today, it feels like those new leasing bars, they just keep reaching to the sky. You think there's a sustainable pace of activity for Digital Realty and maybe even broadly, is it a sustainable pace for the industry as a whole? Or is there a risk maybe that the dirty word digestion phase starts to come back into our vocabulary again? Andrew Power : Hi, thanks, David. So I mean, what's great about this quarter is not just the size of that bar, but just what really went into it. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we usually call it historically led off with the top line number, but I think it was even more important to start with a tremendous foundation. Less than a megawatt interconnection signing it was a granular of quantity of customers, broad-based across the regions, including interconnection was at a record. It was up dramatically, not just year-over-year, close to 28%, but 9% quarter-over-quarter and that is that flywheel success that we've been investing in and starting to see more and more harvesting the fruits of our labor. On the bigger portion of that, it was not one single deal, is our largest deal not even a third of the total signings. It was broad-based across the geos as well. And these are playing to a continuation of demand trends that have been here for a little while, but certainly not exhausted. When you look at the pace of how fast the cloud is growing, digital transformation, hybrid IT. You look at our new logo contribution largely enterprise base 117 from around the globe and artificial intelligence, which is something we've had a hand in supporting for many years in high-performance compute power densities. That is just starting to blossom in our numbers. And I think that is just an incremental tailwind of demand where it doesn't feel like the digestion period is anywhere near coming to the amount of capacity demands we're seeing for the industry overall. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Thanks for the questions. So I wanted to touch on kind of your outlook for renewal spreads, which have been pretty strong the last couple of quarters. So, if I look at your expiration schedule, it looks like your in-place rents really start to look even more attractive the further out you look. So maybe you can talk about kind of the near-term outlook. Is it going to be a little more subdued as you work through some of these higher in-place rents? And then maybe are there any of your larger footprint contracts that have any contractual terms that may limit your ability to push rents as high as you would like? Thank you. Matthew Mercier : Sure. Thanks. So I think, first off, I think as a note, we feel pretty confident about the pricing environment right now and - that I think we demonstrated that with the continued increase in releasing spreads that we put into our guidance, where we said greater than 5%. And we've had - we called out some items this year that have been, we'll call it, slight outliers, but we'll - we still see a strong pricing environment that were. And we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter where, we expect positive renewal spreads across all of our product types. I think going into next year, again, not giving guidance, what I would say is come back to the environment that we're in. I mean, there's nothing that suggests that pricing won't continue to be robust and strong across all of our major markets, where things might be different. Again, that you were alluding to is the basis against which those strong pricings are compared against. We are not seeing the same, I still expect that we'll have positive renewal spreads next year, but we'll be able to provide more granularity in terms of the level that, that is once we give guidance next quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. So when you guys are having conversations with a customer that's primarily looking at an AI deal when you win an AI deal, what is it that they're coming to you for versus maybe some of the less expensive campuses kind of the middle of nowhere that we've heard about and that sort of thing. So how are you winning in AI? And what is it they're looking to get from digital versus some of your peers or some of the private players? Andrew Power : Hi, thanks Frank. I'm going to toss just a column in a second. But I just - there's many shapes and forms of AI, and I reiterate, this is still early innings of what's going to be a vast build-out of required infrastructure. So our intersection of supporting AI is called in the single megawatt or two for enterprise adjacent to the existing workloads expansion into multiple - many, many megawatts of contiguous capacity and everything in between. And we're in a world right now where it's about large language model training, obviously, the inference - the dawn of inference and the implications will hopefully point to incremental location latency-sensitive needs. The private consumption of AI or the public consumption - consumer consumption as well outweighing the enterprise, that's going to change. So I think this is - this demand case, I think, is going to grow and change and it feels like come in our favor. But Colin, why don't you speak to some of your experience front line with the customers? Colin McLean : Sure. Thanks, Andy. Frank. I appreciate the question. I would just amplify what Andy is saying is the demand principles are not monolithic. I mean you're talking about a wide gamut of requirements across the customer platform, which really plays well to our broad-based portfolio. So I think we do as good a job as any to support broad-based requirements and Catechist's capacity. But also having mixed dynamic requirements in terms of densities. And so what we try to do is to map that right customer to right market to right workload. And again, across 300-plus data centers, I think we can serve that pretty well. We also feel pretty strongly that core market orientation, i.e., proximity to eyeballs and GDP is still going to remain a core requirement for much of this AI workload. So, we feel like that maps really well to our course of assets across the globe. Operator : The next question comes from Irvin Liu of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thank you for the question. So Greg mentioned the strength in demand for both stabilized and development JVs, but in light of a more volatile rate environment, especially in recent weeks, have you sensed any meaningful shifts in the appetite for JVs when you're discussing with potential partners? Jordan Sadler : Greg, has your phone been ringing any louder? Gregory Wright : I mean no. Look, it's a good question, but the answer is no. Remember, when investors are out there making investments in different sectors, right? Everything is on a relative basis. And I think when investors look at data centers today, and they look at the quality of the facility, the quality of the customer base, the term of the lease, the strong organic growth in the business today. It's the best place for them to invest. In fact, I would argue that over time, you're going to continue to see data centers becoming more mainstream investing rather than a niche play investing when you look at the level of demand out there, whether it's through pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and the like. So no, I mean, it's also an interesting as there's pockets of capital that are driven - we'll do this unlevered. So they're willing to be patient and wait for leverage and wait for rates to come back down. And I think that also, to your point, Ivan, and I think that's what I mentioned earlier, there's even an outsized demand on the development side. I think the fact that we're in a higher rate environment is driving more demand, if you will, towards development. So - but no, we have not. In fact, I would go the other way. I would say that we've seen an acceleration in the demand for development JVs. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. When you take the demand that you're seeing, the backlog and the target for the development joint ventures, can you give us a bit of a preview on the range of development capital that digital will place on balance sheet in 2024? Andrew Power : Thanks Michael. So I mean - this isn't new news. And I think I framed this at some of the investor meetings we've had through the fall or even on back to NAREIT. Listen, we are a large - the largest global player in the space here and we are taking a strategic change to how we're funding the business was one of my three top priorities. And what we're not going to do is tie ourselves to a partner for all time and reduce our flexibility. But we're going to be looking at targeted large-scale projects. These are projects that are supporting will support customers, we believe in their growth campuses multiple megawatts. So not non-core at all like things that we would invest 100% if we weren't looking to change our funding strategy to drive more bottom line growth. And I think you can think the concentration of those type of projects to-date are mostly in North America and Europe. Given our business is already in a shared in a venture in Latin America and was a little bit smaller in APAC. And I think it's going to be very targeted trying to find the right capital source that is like-minded in terms of their vision for the asset class and looking for a partner that wants to really invest alongside we think is the best-in-class in this industry. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on cash flow. So the accounts receivable looks like it increased another $167 million sequentially, and it's been a drag of over $400 million year-to-date. Just wondering if there's any color you can share on what's driving this? And then maybe how to think about the prospects for any sort of reversal in upcoming quarters? Thanks. Matthew Mercier : Yes. Thanks, Matt. This is Matt as well. So yes, we've had what - I think the important points that I'd call out here are two things. One, the majority of the increase that we've seen over the last couple of quarters in our accounts receivable has been tied to actually VAT receivables as a result of the increased construction that we've had, particularly over internationally in EMEA. When you look at our trade payables, which are really only actually roughly half or a little over half of that balance, we have increased trade payables over the period, but it's also been fairly much in line with our increase in revenue as well. And we've actually been able to bring down our amount of trade payables in the last couple of quarters as well. But again, it doesn't appear that way when the total receivables balance has increased. But again, I think the two sailing points are only - roughly only half of our - that balance is tied to what I call trade receivables, which are actual rent and other billings that are sent to customers. A good chunk is related to VAT receivables tied to our construction, which has been the part that's been growing more substantially, which also has, a liability offset as well. Operator : The next question comes from Ari Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ari Klein : Thanks. Maybe following up on the JV question. Fundamentals are really strong. It feels like you believe there's a lot of runway there. Obviously, there are funding considerations. But have you rethought perhaps pursuing a JV versus going at it on your own and essentially keeping the upside to yourself? Andrew Power : Hi, thanks Ari. So I don't - I think consistent with what I just shared reiterated on this call, we believe that this opportunity when it comes to our space, digital transformation, cloud computing, hybrid IT and now the advent of artificial intelligence really coming to fruition is so large, long-term, capital-intensive that really tapping into both private and public capital in different measures is the right way to maximize value for our shareholders. And we are certainly experiencing an inflection in our operating fundamentals that has built upon good results throughout the year. We've been doing a tremendous amount of deleveraging this year. We'll be, call it, rounding third base on the deleveraging next year, getting back to the targets Matt's laid out. And we also have headwinds when it comes to, call it, some - a modest amount of debt coming due in terms of refinancing. But we view that the development joint venture remains to be the right move to drive more to the bottom line. And again, as I said in a question or two ago, we are not tying ourselves to this strategy and partner for all time, right? This has allowed us to accelerate those earnings and then have be able to throttle the levers here as to how much we share in terms of development joint ventures with partners down the road. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Thanks a lot. Good evening. If I could just check in on the development CapEx point. Again, you raised the guidance $400 million at the midpoint for this year. We've obviously just got a couple of months left here. Could you just go through a little bit what we're seeing that increase being spent on? Is that higher cost per megawatt coming through on some of your existing projects you're pulling stuff forward from - next year, what else might be contributing to the increase? Thanks. Andrew Power : It's not budget overruns or anything like that, it is called conviction in the demand landscape. And I mean we can - Matt can run through it. But I think the biggest piece is Northern Virginia, which goes back to our success in freeing up, call it, 100-plus megawatts in the Loudoun County pinch point and now activating that. But Matt, anything else I'm missing there? Matthew Mercier : No. I think, Andy, you hit it. I mean the majority of our development pipeline increased the call roughly 60 megawatts. We had 100 megawatts of new starts vast majority of that was in North America and in Northern Virginia specifically. If you look at our supplemental quarter-over-quarter, our cost per megawatt, I think broadly globally has been roughly flat. So it's just a view of new development starts looking to get those completed as quickly as possible. So, if we can deliver on time for our customers and take advantage of the market that we're in. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Andy, you've talked about being more disciplined about returns and the sort of deals you accept. Do you feel like you're successfully winning your targeted share of higher value or more strategic deals at your desired returns for each product? And kind of along those lines, do you feel like customers' perceptions of what you have to offer and where you add value is consistent with how you're trying to reposition the company's assets? Andrew Power : Hi. Thanks, Nick. So, I could tell you just yesterday, my team and I were on a called recurring check in with one of our top cloud customers. And that dialogue was multifaceted. It was obviously concentrated on how we can support their growth in their availability zones, how we can commence faster. There's operational elements, it ranges across all the theaters and it also had how we can drive greater consumption to their cloud. And their services from our 5,000 existing customers from the 100 plus we added this quarter and the next quarter, how we're integrating them onto our service fabric natively. And so, I think we are - and I think you're seeing those results paying dividends in that customer appreciation. And you're seeing that in the litany of, call it, magnetic destinations, be it the on-ramps we announced around the world as well as the pickup in the demand that we characterize as less than megawatt interconnection accelerating. So, I do see a connection there. I think we've delivered a tremendous amount of value to our customers, improving their top line and their bottom lines in a safe, secure fashion. And when obviously, I think some of your question was dovetailed also to some of the larger customers, I think that we're just being transparent and honest with these customers that we're really trying to build a durable business to stand the test of time. And that doesn't mean we try to win 100% of a hyperscales market share, but if we're in 50 metropolitan areas, there's probably 25 or 30 where we have something that they really need, and we can really help them like no other. And that's through our supply chain, our large campuses that future-proof their growth, operational excellence and other value adds and just being a one-stop shop for all their needs. So, I think that's a long, long-winded answer to yes. Operator : The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just getting back to the development JV. This is obviously the missing piece in the capital recycling efforts. But - and I saw that you raised the disposition guidance for the year. Is $750 still a good range for this? And I guess, from your commentary, it seems like there's more than one deal that this can represent? Gregory Wright : Hi Eric, this is Greg. The answer is yes, $750 is still a good deal. And yes, we are working on more than one. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Great. So I wanted to ask about the unlevered return environment, particularly for hyperscale. I think earlier in the call, you mentioned something to the effect of double-digit unlevered yields. When you're thinking about doing some of these larger footprint deals with your top customers, just curious where you're seeing those deals clear? And as part of that, where do you think that this could evolve to over, call it, the next year? Thanks. Andrew Power : Thanks, Michael. So I think, I'd point you to our development schedule, which has now been in the double-digits category across the board for the whole portfolio, including an increase in, call it, 65 megawatts quarter-over-quarter. North America, where, I would say, is the current home to the largest deals is in double-digit by itself and has moved up dramatically. I don't - when we look at the risk award, there's obviously episodic scenarios where returns for big deals with hyperscalers couldn't go higher. But I think that the - once you kind of ascend into the double-digits, given the current state of, call it, cost of capital in general, I think you're in the proverbial end zone in terms of creating value on many ways. So I wouldn't bank on incremental stair stiffs of shifts beyond that. But I think, we're in a time in the world where the demand remains robust and diverse, outpacing supply. That dynamic does not feel to be abating. And I think we've got a great hand to support tremendous customers' growth around the globe and create a lot of value for a lot of stakeholders. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Please go ahead. Andrew Power : Thank you, Andrea. Digital Realty had a strong third quarter. Our results demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating with our customers. We posted another quarter of strengthening organic operating results with record 0-1 megawatt bookings, strong re-leasing spreads and our best same-capital cash and ROI growth in over a decade. During the first nine months of the year, we've raised over $3.5 billion of new capital, enabling us to meaningfully delever while reinvesting to support our customers' growing needs, and we are not done yet. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and express my personal gratitude to our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty to keep the digital world spinning. We look forward to updating you on our progress and meeting with many of you at NAREIT in L.A. in a few weeks. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

During today's presentation, all parties will be placed in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Callers will be limited to one question and we will aim to conclude at the bottom of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to Digital Realty's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will also contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our fourth quarter and our full year. First, we are seeing a robust wave of demand across our platform, and we are optimistic about our ability to execute. Leasing in the quarter was healthy, highlighted by strong volume in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, record pricing in the greater than megawatt category and the second highest quarter ever of new logos added. Second, our fundamental metrics capped off the year on a high note with the strongest cash re-leasing spreads and same capital cash NOI growth we've seen in years as our unique and differentiated value proposition continued to resonate. And lastly, in the fourth quarter alone, we announced nearly $8 billion of new development joint ventures and completed over $1 billion of equity issuance under our ATM bringing total capital sources raised during the year to more than $12 billion and reducing pro forma leverage below our year-end 2023 target. The execution on our funding and capital plan in 2023 has positioned Digital Realty to be able to support our customers' data center infrastructure needs as the next generation technology unfolds. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. Andrew Power : Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. 2023 was a milestone year for Digital Realty, as we made strong progress toward our strategic objectives despite significant volatility in financial conditions and broader uncertainty around the world. For me, 2023 will be revered as the year of AI's arrival to the data center forefront, ushering in an unprecedented new wave of data center demand, driving a step function of change across the industry's landscape. The year that Digital Realty enhanced its customer value proposition by adding connectivity-rich solutions while also scaling our capacity for hyperscale and AI workloads. We expanded our footprint with new connectivity-oriented locations around the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Enhanced our joint venture in India with the addition of Reliance Jio and increased the number of direct access points on our campuses to the leading cloud and service providers. We accelerated the growth of service fabric with more than 70 discrete services added to the platform and over 100 unique services available by year-end and enhance its capabilities with new composes like service directory. We also added 9,000 new cross connects in the year, indicative of our growing connected data communities. 2023 was a year that we integrated and innovated at a faster pace than ever before. We strengthened our leadership team and aligned our platform to three regions to be consistently structured around the world. We adapted our product portfolio to meet market demand, evolving our offering to efficiently support next-generation chips like the NVIDIA H-100 in numerous data centers. Our high-density colo capability deployed across 32 markets spending all three regions is equipped to handle three times the H-100 requirements. And we continue to add green energy solutions to power many of these power dense applications. Like our large solar PPA in Germany and our agreement supporting 100% renewable power in Texas, San Francisco, New Jersey and Sydney. And 2023 was the year that Digital Realty took decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet by developing a portfolio of private capital partnerships and vehicles that diversified our capital sources while enabling us to support our customers' fast-growing requirements. And we did all of that while continuing to provide the operational excellence that is expected of a global data center leader and that our customers rightfully demand. On this call a year ago, I outlined a plan to bolster and diversify our capital sources. Our goals were to reduce our leverage towards six times by the end of the year. Increase our liquidity to fund our development program and diversify our capital sources to limit our reliance on the capital markets, increasing our ability to meet the accelerating demand for data center capacity and to enhance our returns on invested capital. We outperformed on each of these goals, sourcing over $12 billion of new capital and commitments for new investment and debt repayment, reducing pro forma leverage to just 5.8 times when adjusted for transactions that have been announced or closed since year-end. We also ended the year with five new JV partners and expanded some of our existing relationships. To round out the year, we announced three significant transactions in the fourth quarter, including two development joint ventures and the successful resolution to our relationship with Cyxtera, we also raised $1.2 billion of equity under our ATM since the end of September. I will quickly run through the highlights of these transactions. In early January, Greg completed his famed Triple Lindy with the Cyxtera transaction by selling $275 million of assets to Brookfield along with the purchase of Cyxtera's leasehold positions in Singapore and Frankfurt for $55 million, yielding net cash of $220 million to Digital Realty. In addition, Brookfield assumed three existing leases and amended three others in our portfolio to accelerate their expiration to the end of September 2024. Finally, Digital Realty obtained and exercised an option to purchase a Cyxtera data center and the Slough Trading Estate adding one of London's highly sought-after submarkets to Platform Digital's connectivity and enterprise colo offering. This transaction remains subject to customer closing conditions and is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter. In November, Realty Income purchased an 80% interest in 400 million data centers that are under development and leased to an investment-grade financial services company. The tenant has the option to expand the facility up to an estimated potential cost of $800 million. We received $200 million upon closing and reduced our funding obligations for the remainder of this project to just 20% of the total capital, enabling us to reinvest the capital in higher-return projects. Finally, the $7 billion development joint venture with Blackstone is our largest and most forward-looking transaction and accelerates the monetization of nearly 20% of our three-plus gigawatt land bank. This JV involves the sale of an 80% interest in nearly 500 megawatts of capacity across four campuses in Paris, Frankfurt and Northern Virginia and enables us to better support our hyperscale customers' needs. Approximately 20% of ventures total potential data center capacity is expected to be delivered through 2025. We will retain a 20% interest in the developments and earn fees for developing, leasing, operating and managing these facilities. All told, in 2023, we announced or completed joint ventures and asset sales driving leverage down roughly 1.3 turns from the first quarter peak accelerating our ability to deliver needed capacity to our customers and enhancing our returns on invested capital. I would also be remiss if I did not mention Digital Core REIT's successful $120 million follow-on equity offering last week which will support the REIT's planned acquisition of an incremental 24.9% interest in our jointly owned asset in Frankfurt for $125 million. Let's shift to a brief recap of our results and offer some insights into the trends we are seeing across our business. I'm pleased with our results for 2023, which helped to lay the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth in earnings and free cash flow that should take shape as we head into 2025. Our fourth quarter results were broadly consistent with the first three quarters of 2023 with continued strength in our operating performance KPIs and an incremental improvement in our financial position as we continue to execute on our value proposition with the goal to support the increased demand for data center capacity. Leasing remained healthy, especially in our targeted 0 to 1 plus interconnection segment with 134 new logos, bringing our total new logos for 2023 to a new annual record of more than 500. Renewal spreads were strong for the fifth consecutive quarter, remaining positive across product types and regions. Same capital cash NOI growth continue to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business with 9.9% year-over-year growth in the quarter. And churn remained low and well controlled at 1%, while occupancy was impacted by the delivery of significant vacant development capacity. The combination of cloud and AI is driving unprecedented demand for scale and hyperscale capacity alongside the steady enterprise and connectivity-oriented demand we're experiencing within our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Supply constraints driven by limited availability of power and global supply chain delays have continued to drive the pricing pendulum in our favor or our growing value proposition is increasing interest in our existing inventory and the new development that we have underway. Ongoing conversations with customers pretend a significant potential acceleration of leasing and development and we believe we are well positioned. The demand seems to be spilling across most markets, particularly for larger capacity blocks, though there are a few pockets of strength worth noting, including Northern Virginia, Santa Clara, New Jersey, Paris, Frankfurt, Singapore and Seoul. Our new capacity is concentrated in core markets aligned with our global meeting place strategy. While the scale of data center infrastructure opportunities has increased alongside AI's arrival, we remain disciplined and thoughtful prioritizing locations that enhance Platform Digital connectivity and our connected campus communities. During the fourth quarter, Digital demonstrated the benefits of collaborating with our partners with the signing of an Oracle Cloud infrastructure dedicated region deployment by a financial services customer, showcasing the potential of the collaboration between Oracle and Digital Realty to fulfill enterprise customers' hybrid cloud requirements. Other customers are recognizing the growing value of Platform Digital's broad and open structure. An AI service provider leveraged Platform Digital's pre-provisioned high-density colo offering to improve their time to market in order to extend our North America and AI cloud offering that provides managed AI as a service for a global manufacturing client. A global service provider and partner targeting enterprises and customers added more connectivity for their hybrid offerings on Platform Digital, enabling them to upgrade their IT environments to a consumption-based IT infrastructure and managed services model. A Global 2000 leader in material sciences for industrial and scientific applications needed a data center provider with global interconnectivity and access to cloud providers in Seoul and shows Platform Digital to enable them to deploy and interconnect a private AI node. A Global 50 financial services company is migrating from an on-prem data center to Platform Digital and utilizing service fabric to improve sustainability, resiliency, scalability, security and carrier diversity. And a leading Global 2000 consumer goods manufacturer grew their presence on Platform Digital by adding two additional metros to support their IT workloads and cloud connectivity. Moving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. We have over 100 megawatts available for lease today in Loudon County and nearly 200 megawatts of capacity available for lease in Manassas. We are currently in active negotiations with a handful of customers for substantially all of our capacity in Loudon, though in contrast with the rumor mill, nothing has been finalized just yet. Beyond this capacity, we have another 900 megawatts of buildable capacity at DigitalDose, which we are cautiously optimistic will gain access to power in 2026 and beyond. We also expect to benefit from the active and ongoing management of our existing 500-megawatt portfolio in this market over time. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the fourth quarter. We continue to be recognized for our strong ESG performance in the fourth quarter and in 2024. We placed second on Sustainability Magazine's List of top 10 sustainable data center providers. We improved to number eight on the US EPA's Green Power partnership National Top 100 for renewable energy use and we were named as a top rated regional performer in North America by a leading global ESG ratings provider. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn over the call to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Matthew Mercier : Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our fourth quarter results. We signed a total of $110 million of new leases in the fourth quarter with $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, led by strength in the EMEA region. Interconnection bookings rebounded sequentially to $13.5 million, and we finished the year with 220,000 cross-connects despite continued network grooming. Turning to our backlog slide. The current backlog of signed by [Technical Difficulty] commenced leases increased to a new record of $495 million at quarter end as new leasing outran $84 million of commencements in the quarter. We expect commencements to pick up as nearly two-thirds of the backlog is scheduled to commence in 2024, with the majority coming in the second half of the year. During the fourth quarter, we signed $210 million of renewal leases with pricing increases of 8.2% on a cash basis, setting the high watermark for the year, though this was skewed over 100 basis points by shorter-term renewals in one market. For the full year, cash renewal spreads were up 6.8% and or 5.5% when normalizing for short-term extensions. Re-leasing spreads were positive across product, market and region in 2023, setting the foundation for an acceleration in long-term sustainable growth. In 2024, we expect the pricing environment to remain firm and renewal spreads to remain positive, principally reflecting the near 80% weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter Core FFO of $1.63 per share and $6.59 for the full year within our guidance range. Earnings reflect the continued strong organic results, together with the impact from capital recycling, deleveraging and increased development spending throughout the year, as discussed on our third quarter call. Total revenue was up 11% year-over-year despite the incremental drag from the stabilized JV contributions and the noncore asset sales that closed in the third quarter. As we also noted last quarter, year-over-year revenue growth continued to be positively impacted by the significant volatility in utility costs and reimbursements, particularly in Europe. Energy dynamics proved to be a tailwind for our results in 2023. Assuming more normalized energy prices, we expect the related upside impact will moderate in 2024. Interconnection revenue was $106 million, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued unit growth and price increases. Moving over to the expense side. Utilities were 5% lower sequentially, reflecting the joint venture contributions over the summer, combined with seasonal impacts. Operating expenses increased due to seasonally elevated maintenance spending in the fourth quarter. Property taxes fell back toward normalized levels, reflecting the onetime property tax reassessment experienced in the third quarter. Net of this movement, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year. Improvement in our stabilized same capital operating performance continued in the fourth quarter with a year-over-year cash NOI up a strong 9.9% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, results were also strong with cash NOI growth of 7.5% and 6.5% on a constant currency basis. Focusing on investment activity, we spent $3 billion on development in 2023, net of the proceeds received from our first development JV closing in November, and we delivered over 230 megawatts of new capacity across the globe. Turning to the balance sheet. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet since the end of the third quarter. With the sale of $1.2 billion of equity through the ATM at an average price of $133 per share, achieving our goal of lowering our leverage towards six times and finishing the year at 6.2 times. After year-end, we made further progress on the balance sheet with the closings of the Cyxtera transactions in the first phase of the Blackstone joint venture. GI Partners also exercised their option and closed on an additional 15% share of the two stabilized assets in our Chicago JV, bringing their stake to 80%. Pro forma for these activities, year-end leverage was 5.8 times. S&P recognized our progress in December and upgraded our outlook. Early in the fourth quarter, we paid off our $100 million Swiss Franc notes and closed the Realty Income joint venture, which generated $200 million of gross proceeds and reduced our CapEx commitments for the remainder of the project's development. We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with over $1.6 billion at year-end as we continue to prioritize liquidity and to support ongoing development spend. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is nearly 4.5 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-US dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 85% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have less than $1 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and beyond that, our maturities remained well laddered through 2032. I'll finish with guidance. We are providing an initial Core FFO per share guidance range for the full year 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75. Reflecting the underlying growth of our business, offset by the impact of the deleveraging activities we completed or announced in 2023. As a reminder, over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects deliver. For 2024, we expect total revenue to grow by 2% and adjusted EBITDA to grow by 4% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. When normalizing this growth for the impact of capital recycling, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA are anticipated to grow by 7% and 10%, respectively, in 2024. We expect both our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads, along with same capital cash NOI growth to remain solidly positive. While occupancy is expected to improve steadily throughout the year as our record backlog commences and available capacity is leased. Specifically, cash re-leasing spreads are expected to increase by 4% to 6% in 2024. Same capital cash NOI is expected to grow by 2% to 3%, and given the tougher base year comparison versus last year's 7.5% growth and our expectations for FX and energy pricing in our colo segment. Total portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 100 to 200 basis points by the end of 2024 while total occupancy slipped to 81.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was predominantly driven by the delivery of substantial vacant development capacity that is slated to be occupied as same capital occupancy was stable quarter-over-quarter. We also expect to continue to recycle capital in 2024 with noncore asset sales and stabilized joint ventures raising $1.25 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range. Nearly one-third of this activity was completed in early January, while the balance should close throughout this year. Along with cash on hand and retained cash flow from operations, this capital is expected to be the primary funding source of our $2 billion to $2.5 billion net development CapEx program for 2024. To be clear, this approximately 25% reduction in development spend year-over-year represents Digital Realty's share of CapEx spend. The total development spend on these projects will be higher when including our partners pro rata share. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, in terms of, you were just describing the shift in same capital cash NOI growth from 7.5% to 2% to 3%. Can you unpack more of what you're seeing in '24 relative to '23? And how pricing kind of comes into the expectation for 2024? Andrew Power : Thanks, Mike. So we'll try to weave that into one answer, so trying to stick to one question and get through the whole roster and maybe loop back. But I'll turn it to Matt to give you the bridge on a same-store basis. Matthew Mercier : Sure. Thanks, Mike. So a couple of things that I would call out. First, in terms of, call it, the re-leasing spreads and their influence. First off, I think as we know, not all of our leases roll within the calendar year. So we roll roughly, call it, 20% to 25% of our portfolio in the year. And of that, 80% is in the 0 to 1 megawatt category, which is influenced by inflation or CPI, which we've seen come down over the course of the year, and therefore, part of the mark-to-market pricing within that segment. Then when you flip over the other 20%, which is in the greater than a megawatt category, we're seeing in '24 expiring rents that are higher than what we saw in '23, which creates a tougher comp in terms of the role despite strong market rents and overall growth. So that's on the spread side. The other part that I would call out is in '23, we saw benefits or tailwinds from FX as well as power pricing, which we're not seeing in '24, and lastly, in '24, we are expecting higher property tax expense. So putting all those together kind of is why you're seeing sort of the still positive, but not as positive as '23 results for same-store portfolio in '24. Operator : The next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe first, last night, we heard from one of your peers that the higher power prices in 2023 have created some sort of lagged crowding out effect in terms of budgeting and decision-making. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about that, kind of something like maybe you're hearing or seeing some of that in your colo business, but it wasn't crystal. And then just as a follow-up, if I could. Matt, can you break down that $1.25 billion in kind of -- or the rest of the $1.25 billion that's closing this year? What is -- how is it all breakdown and the cadence of that? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Dave. This is Andy. I don't think we're experiencing the same exact dynamics on power as what you heard last night, quite honestly. I think what Matt, you just heard from Matt is the comps on a growth basis in the same-store pool are not as -- we benefited in '23 from power, and we're not going to have that kind of benefit repeat itself in 2024, assume it and I think this all is going to be washed out once we say by the '25, assuming we don't go back into this another, call it, very volatile power environment. So it's almost one-time in nature. I don't I don't believe that is impacted buyer behavior. And I don't believe we're suffering or benefiting depending on the period to the same degree of what was described. Maybe that's due to the market mix, overall business mix in our hedging strategy, which are not identical. I can tell you from a business standpoint, and you can see this in the results, we capped off a very strong year, let's call it, focused on the enterprise colo connectivity segment. Record overall new logos, North of 500. Strong quarters of new signings. You had a very strong interconnection quarter, both in new signings and also a flow through the P&L, which has been accelerating and net absorption certainly in that category that was strong in the fourth quarter and through the year. So I don't see the power flowing through. I know we're trying to get to one question per se and then rotate back well moved there, Greg, why don't you just touch on the components of the $1.25 billion in our guidance for data? Gregory Wright : Sure. Thanks, Andy. Hey, David. How are you? Look, I think, again, there's two components there. It's really -- it's a stabilized joint ventures, and it's our sort of noncore asset disposition. And when you look at that, call it, $1.250 billion or a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, call it, I think it's important to note that over one-third of that has already been announced and is either closed or is pending close. So obviously we feel good about that number. And it's clearly much less in the context of last year. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So Andy, we're in the middle of one of the strongest hyperscale demand environment that we've seen in recent history. I was wondering, can you talk about the go-forward demand pipeline and the relative strength of the pipeline versus last year. And as part of that, can you talk about the opportunity set for the pricing for new leasing, specifically, is -- do you see there being a governor on pricing given the supply-demand backdrop that we're seeing? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Michael. So I would say on a year-over-year basis, we are -- the dynamics has changed tremendously on so many fronts. Overall, the pipeline for hyperscale has continued to grow to new heights. I view the AI demand is a new wave of demand, incremental call enterprise, hybrid IT is certainly an incremental to hyperscale cloud compute. And this has all played out in the backdrop of tightening supply-demand dynamics that has called -- as we've described, over several quarters now, moved the pendulum on pricing more and more in the favor of providers like Digital Realty. Is there a ceiling? Listen, I think we've seen rates run tremendously. We just, this quarter, reported in that segment North of a megawatt, call it, our highest GAAP rate ever at $145 million we are continuing to see -- it's almost like some of these customers who are often on calendar fiscal years, just like Digital Realty, wrapped up one budget cycle and got a budget refresh and came back in 2024 with the incremental appetite for demand. These customers are seeking some of the same things. When we intersect with that demand is in our large-scale hyperscale campuses that are in our major markets and especially with larger capacity blocks that have contiguous capacity or the most sought after. And those rates continue to run in terms of what we've signed and where we put up quotes and I think we're very well positioned. If you look at our footprint, you can see a lot of it on development capacity life cycle, which is just a portion of what we activate in Northern Virginia right now, but some of the other major markets as well to capture a good -- more than our fair share of that demand. And lastly, I think there's a -- I think there's a broader acknowledgment whether it is hyperscale compute or AI workloads that these customers our time to market, many of them are trying to land precious GPUs that are just enormous business opportunities for these customers. And our rent even historically, but certainly today, plays a very small economic piece in that equation relative to their ability to launch their services and be first to market many times. Operator : The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Yeah, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where we might end the year kind of in terms of leverage, where do some of the outcomes there and the role of ATM issuances, equity issuance is as part of that? Thanks. Matthew Mercier : Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So look, I think, you've seen the results of the work we've done in '23, where we talked about getting down to the six times area. And the execution that not only Greg's team on did with the transaction that we closed, but also sales on the ATM that we did early in the year and then more recently, getting to that point and actually breaking through that when you look at it on a pro forma basis, we're at 5.8 times. And we -- and so we continue to want to get down towards that 5.5 times area, which is the same messaging we've had since the start of '23, and we've executed on that path. And we think that the plan that we've laid out here in terms of our guidance will enable us to get us there where we're continuing some level of capital recycling given the broad and diverse sources of capital that we've got available to us. And that's the plan we're going to continue to go down in terms of marching towards that 5.5% area, which is a smaller task than what we did in '23. Operator : The next question comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thank you for the question. I'll stick to one. Andy, you mentioned demand for large blocks of capacity in several key markets such as Nova and Silicon Valley among some of the other major markets. At an aggregate level, I think, overall supply remains very low in some of these markets. But specifically for you, has lower available capacity been a gating factor for your greater than one megawatt signings performance? Andrew Power : Thanks, Irvin. We certainly have a really great opportunity to intersect with these large capacity block needs of our customers, be it for AI or hyperscale. It is, I would say, maybe potentially unparalleled in what we can offer in Northern Virginia today in terms of available capacity in a market that's shut down in terms of new power until 2026. But the list goes beyond that, whether it's Dallas, Santa Clara, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Seoul or parts of Japan, not to mention some of our joint ventures in Latin America and South Africa. We've taken our approach quite honestly where many of these capacity blocks for ourselves and many providers were at the early stages of development. They were at land, went pad-ready. Shelves are coming online and just the first suites were coming online. And throughout 2023, we took a more, call it, approach whereby we didn't go run after the first deal out of the gate for some of these customers because we knew we weren't losing a revenue opportunity because the capacity wasn't even being able to be moved into or at least commenced. And in hindsight, that's proven fortuitous because as the year has played out, and certainly as 2024 has gotten off out of those gates, we've continue to see what we're offering is becoming much more and more attractive to an even broader and diverse set of customers. So I don't think we'll be able to be late too long in 2024. We obviously now have some capacity blocks that are actually live and we can commence rent on. So we do have some urgency to get that going. But I think our patients and prudence here and approach allowed us to prove right. sometimes better to be lucky than smart. If I would have known Ashford would have run out of power years ago, I would have -- we wouldn't have sold all that capacity we had to release at the time. But this time, we -- the luck was our side. Operator : The next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead. David Guarino : Thanks. Hey, Andy, on your comments, at least how I heard on a potentially very high ceiling for rental rates. As I kind of take that into consideration and look across the lease expiration table in the greater than one megawatt category it appears you guys have a pretty favorable mark-to-market rent opportunity over the next few years. Am I fair to make that assumption? Or is there a chance that some of your leases might have clauses that could limit how much you're able to participate in the upside? Andrew Power : Thanks, David. So the -- I think you heard me loud and clear on where rates have come from and where they've gone and where they're likely to continue to move and some of these markets haven't even hit peak historical rates, if you look at the whole span of data center capacity. So I don't think we're at a rent bubble or near that necessarily and it's been on the back of real constraints and build costs that have inflated and issues. So they are -- I believe these rental moves are justified. I think you will continue to see the cash mark-to-markets flow through in our favor. We did call out in -- throughout last year and in the script for this quarter that we had some episodic short-term renewals inflated our cash mark-to-market, but we think being, call it, 4% to 6% in that category overall is pretty in our favor. And to your question on the bigger deals where you're going to have these potential roll-ups, yes, we do have subsections of our contracts that have clauses that are certainly in the favor of our customer. When the market was quite the opposite of what it was today and it was filling baking capacity, we certainly had to succumb to some of those clauses that our customers. But they all often are very narrowly defined in terms of fixed duration of renewal time period and other bells and whistles. And when a customer, which they often do wants to negotiate outside of that box that opens up the contract renegotiations. And we try to collaborate with our customers to come into a mutually agreeable outcome. So that's a long-winded way of saying, I don't think we'll be able to roll every one of those, call it, sub 100-plus megawatts directly up to the 140 or 150 or 160 or whatever we're going in the market. But I think we'll -- I do think there is going to be a positive mark-to-market in that category for some years to come. Operator : The next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ari Klein : Thanks. Andy, there's a lot of moving parts that are impacting the 2024 guidance that I think Matt mentioned 10% EBITDA growth normalized for the deleveraging activity I guess as you move past some of the headwinds creating dilution, and as you noted, it seems like pricing and mark-to-market tailwinds should be here for a while. What kind of growth do you think you can deliver beyond 2024 on the bottom line from a longer-term standpoint? Andrew Power : Matt, do you want to start us off on that one? Matthew Mercier : Sure. Yes. So a couple of things. So Ari, thanks as we did mention, on a normalized basis in '24 or a lot of -- for the transactional activity that hit in '23 and some -- and what we expect in '24. I do want to reiterate, we're looking at normalized growth at 7% on revenue and 10% on EBITDA as you noted. And so '24 is seeing the impact from the timing of those transactions and close where in '23, there in the second half of the year, and '24, we're expecting them, as Greg noted earlier, where we've already got a decent portion of that under contract, those are closed in the first part of '24. So creating some of that impacting on '24 bottom line. And we did all that at the same time, again, just as a reminder, that we're delevering over a turn. If you look through all that, what we would expect is that we look at it in sort of two buckets in terms of cost of growth algorithm. First one being, we would expect on our stabilized same-store pool to have seen growth in that 3% to 4% area. On top of that, looking at our development pipeline, the favorable pricing, better yields and as those start to deliver in '24 and '25, we would expect to see another 1% to 2% on top of that too. Together, that gets us to kind of the mid- to high single digits that we should expect to see in '25 and beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank, your line is open. Frank Louthan : Sorry about that. I heard from several of your peers and some equipment companies and so forth about some macro issues that they're seeing with elongated sales cycles and squeezing some IT budgets. You mentioned some cross-connect grooming you've seen. Are you seeing anything like that from your enterprise business or elsewhere from any sort of macro pressures in part of your business? Andrew Power : Thanks, Frank. I want to have Colin tackle what we're seeing in the, I'll call it, enterprise sales cycle. Colin McLean : Yes. Thanks, Frank, for the question. Appreciate it. As Andy highlighted, the pipeline across the board is robust and that's both above and below one megawatt. And we certainly see our customers engaging consistently with this related to growing their platform globally. So that $53 million back-to-back strong quarters, I think the testimony to how we're supporting their needs pretty well. In fact, 1,000-plus companies landed with us in Q4, which, again, I think it's a strong growth testimony. In terms of time to close overall, I think we had highlighted previously a couple of hiccups, maybe early in the year, Q1, Q2 in terms of expanded time to close. We haven't really seen that, honestly to date. It's really flattened out. And so I really think it's a by-product of us engaging showing up differently. The new logo engagement, I think, overall has been particularly strong we did 134 new logos last quarter. So on the enterprise side, on the whole, I think we've seen pretty strong interest pipeline and then execution on the whole. Christopher Sharp : Right. And one thing I'd like to spread a bit more detail on the equipment. With the offering that we launched last year around the high-density colo in anticipation of a lot of private AI type of deployment coming to market. A part of that program is not only that the 32 markets and three regions being able to do 70 kilowatts a rack. What we're really doing is pre-buying a lot of the technology to support that power density to allow our customers to deploy in a very timely fashion, but also expedites a bit of that higher end kind of new AI capability coming to market. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey, thank you for taking the question. Financial question. So with leverage now back under six turns on a pro forma basis, how do you now think about the dividend and potential forward growth relative to incremental investments in the business and/or potential M&A? Thanks. Andrew Power : Thanks, Matt. So multi fast, I'm going to hand to Matt to explain how the dividend call works in terms of taxable income and distribution and why the dividend is set where it is set. Because I think the topic of M&A, I mean, you could look at the linear press releases or just recent events we've done in just the last several months through resolving our relationship to Cyxtera to growing our platform in India with the addition of Reliance Jio. We also just had a big announcement with the leader in the GPU space recently to disposing of some noncore assets, JVs stabilized assets and adding strategically to our landholdings across key markets. So we've been incredibly active on pieces of that. I think the broader context of M&A, I think the most critical puzzle pieces have kind of been picked over. And most of our activity from here are really, call it, extending our strategic advantages and bolt-on in nature to what we have. I don't see any like key gems out there that would be really additive to our global platform at peak. Matt, why don't you hit on the dividend, Matt, if you want that. Matthew Mercier : Sure. I mean, similar to what we've talked about in '23, I mean, there's two major components in terms of the dividend and related to taxable income. There's our ordinary income that we get from operations, and then there's also the income that's generated from transactions and the related gains that we have from executing those, which we had a sizable amount of the '23. Now we're looking at less transaction size in '24, but as you saw in the guidance, you talked about $1 billion to $1.5 billion. So we expect that there'll still be related income from that, and we still have cash flow even after dividend and we think we'll be able to support where we are. And ultimately, our goal and target is that we grow the dividend as AFFO and as our cash flow grows, which we expect we'll start to see over the long term related to the growth algorithm that I talked about earlier. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery : Great. Thanks very much. Good evening. I wanted to just talk about the mix between the 0 to 1 and the greater than 1 megawatt. It looks like you had almost 50% coming from 0 to 1 plus interconnection. That's been gradually rising over the last few quarters. So how do we think about this going forward? Your focus on -- should that mix trend higher than the 50-50? Or is it going to be jumping around as it has done in the past? Thanks. Andrew Power : Thanks, Simon. So one of our top, top, top priorities is to continue to focus on delivering acceleration in that 0 to 1 megawatt interconnection cohort, enterprise connectivity in order to customers, the most granular and the largest volume of over 5,000 customers as well as our new logos. So by and large, the more quarters where that represents a larger and increasing piece of the mix and continues to accelerate like it has done recently, that is filling our existing baking capacity. It's wins at our highest rates, it's multi-market, multi-geo enterprise customers and is the place where we believe we can deliver the greatest value to our customers, most consistently and long-term and durable there will be episodic quarters where that will be a lower percentage. But that's likely enough because we've filtered our execution. That's likely because we also are supporting some of the largest hyperscalers around the world. We're bringing our capacity in over half of our 50-plus metropolitan areas, places where we can really add value to those customers where they've already landed their compute or AZs where they want to grow at our continuous capacity with operational excellence, where we have that long runway of growth that they can get from no one else. And those are we quarters where we saw larger lumpier deals, obviously, into those capacity blocks. So we think both of these are large addressable markets where we have a distinct value proposition and a competitive moat that we'll continue to focus on executing each and every day. Operator : The next question comes from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead. Erik Rasmussen : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on AI. It seems most of the demand in the early stages is expected to come from training versus inferencing. But we heard from Microsoft on their earnings call, and they said that most of the AI strength that they were seeing for Azure was, in fact, from inferencing workloads. Are you seeing the same as it relates to sort of the demand patterns from your customers? And then maybe any way to quantify how much AI has contributed or the size of the opportunity. Thanks. Andrew Power : Thanks, Erik. Let me just touch on this a little bit and then hand it to Chris to walk you through chapter and verse. I look at where our heritage is as a company, this AI opportunity is tremendously in our wheelhouse. We came with this from a hyperscale piece of the business and build the colo connectivity capabilities organically and inorganically. We are often taking larger halls that are at higher power densities and using our engineering prowess to work for enterprise customers and pushing their boundaries on power densities. I can tell you, AI workloads were at digital before I joined over nine years ago. We've done retrofits on existing deployments just to fit up for customers needing AI just this year. At the end of last year, I was to one of our Paris facilities. We're one of our partner customers have fitted out of liquid cooling for a multinational financial services company, live environments which meant that they had to get going on that years ago to be live at the end of last year. So this is right in our wheelhouse, and we've been winning in that category in the last year in the, call it, several hundred kilowatt domain to the 30-plus megawatt piece of this, and you've seen some testimonials on that. Chris, why don't you give a little bit of color as to some of the verticals we've been winning and where do you see this going as well? Christopher Sharp : Yes. It's a great question and appreciate it, Eric. I think there's a couple of dynamics that you touched on. The training to inference. That's something that we've been watching for some time. And we're selective with some of the training environments just because we're looking for a long-term durable workload being deployed into the asset. And so a lot of the customers we see today are actually doing training or inference inside of their training just because of sheer availability of the GPUs and time to market, but we definitely see the long tail of that value happening in inference and then also kind of another section of private AI and so we're seeing customers come to market with these types of requirements where Andy alluded to this at a high level coming from our heritage of scale and then being able to evolve and support a colo type of capability, if you will, allows us to support a higher power density need with our versatile designs. And so being highly focused on that with a lot of the hyperscale customers and being foundational for their cloud services has been top of mind. And then I think another element that may be overlooked is a lot of this inference is embedded in a lot of our top customers today as capabilities. So when you read about, and I think you referenced Microsoft and the work that they've been doing with CoPilot, a lot of that AI is embedded in enhancing their current product capabilities. And so we're constantly watching how that evolves, but being proximate to the AI being proximate to the existing infrastructure and workload is absolutely something that we're very excited about because that inference benefits from the data oceans that exist within Digital Realty, their current infrastructure and how all that culminates together. So it's something you'll see play out over this year. I think we just had a really good case study with KakaoBank where that's highlighted private AI deployment where they're able to generate and do a little bit of R&D around new product offerings for a financial vertical. So these are the things you're going to see play out in 2024 that we're very excited about. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nick Del Deo : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on the assumptions you're making about the broader lease environment and the pricing environment to get to the 4% to 6% range for cash renewal spreads. Are you just basically taking current prices as a given? Or are you kind of assuming further increases or other changes? And can you share anything about how the expected renewal spreads look for zero to one versus greater one categories? Thanks. Andrew Power : Sure, Matt. Why don't you take that? Matthew Mercier : Yes. So thanks, Nick. With regard to -- I think I'll go back to some of the comments I had, I think, from one of the first questions. So with regard to 0 to 1 megawatt, that's on both the escalation and renewals tend to be influenced by inflation where CPI is coming in. So that's going to be spread across the leases that are rolling, whether they be in North America versus EMEA. And those have come down since last year and more in that 3% to 4%, 3% to 4% range. And now on the greater than 1 megawatt, as I mentioned, we're assuming, call it, current market pricing and that's more heavily influenced by where the expiring rates are versus that. So that's within the greater than the megawatt segment, which we're assuming still positive and resulting in the 4% to 6% total that we've guided towards. Operator : The next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brandon Nispel : Hey, thanks. Just a quick question. I think in the guidance for development capital, this is the first time it's actually been guided to net of capital contributions. Can you maybe talk about what your total capital outlay will look like in '24 versus '23 on a like-for-like basis? Thanks. Matthew Mercier : Sure. Yes. So I mean, obviously, the net is given the development joint ventures that we've established over '23 and that will also close that are under contract in throughout '24 in particular with the one we announced with Blackstone. Phase I is already closed and Phase II is later in the year. And if you're looking at it from a gross basis in comparison, we're expecting in '24 on a gross basis, we'd be spending north of $3.5 billion in terms of total CapEx and it would be -- which would be roughly 15% higher than the amount that we spent in 2023. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Andrew Power : Thank you, Betsy. Digital Realty capped off a transformative 2023 with a strong fourth quarter that was highlighted by three key elements. First, we sourced over $12 billion of new capital and commitments from an array of hyperscale private capital partners, deleveraging our balance sheet and positioning the company for the future. Second, we posted another quarter of improving organic operating results with the best same-capital cash NOI growth in nearly a decade, and we are just on the cusp of the AI wave of demand. Third, we continue to grow our footprint and capacity around the world with record deliveries in 2023 to meet the accelerating needs of our growing customer base. These customers look to us to help enable their IT solutions, whether that is AI, cloud or even enterprises along their digital transformation journeys, our value proposition is resonating, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today with a special thank you to our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keeps the digital world turning. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Digital Realty's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer; Colin McLean are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our first quarter. First, our customer value proposition continues to resonate as reflected by an AI-driven acceleration in leasing activity that drove our overall leasing volume to a new record. First quarter leasing was more than 40% above our prior record, principally driven by an improvement in pricing. Second, our fundamental strength picked up where 2023 left off with record cash re-leasing spreads and strong, stabilized same-capital cash NOI growth of 4.7%, reflecting continued strength in data center fundamentals combined with the benefit of the improvements that we have made to our portfolio over the past year. And third, we've made meaningful progress on our 2024 funding plan [ already ], with just over $1 billion of fresh capital raised from asset sales and joint ventures to date, putting us above the low end of our guidance range for 2024, just 1/3 of the way through the year. As a result of our efforts, reported leverage fell from 6.2x at year-end to 6.1x at March 31 and remains at 5.8x on a pro forma basis, reflecting completed and announced transactions. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. Andrew Power : Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Following the successful course we set in 2023, Digital Realty experienced accelerating momentum in the first quarter of 2024, headlined by a collection of multifaceted AI opportunities that drove a number of new leasing records as demand for our capacity in core markets remains elevated while visibility surrounding competitive new supply remains cloudy. At Digital, we continue to focus on our strategic priorities and on delivering on behalf of our expanding list of 5,000-plus customers across our 50-plus markets in 25-plus countries on 6 continents. During the first quarter, we posted record leasing results surpassing our prior record by more than 40% and exceeding our leasing results for all of 2019 in just this 1 quarter. We also delivered strong operating results as evidenced by healthy stabilized same-capital growth and the highest re-leasing spreads in the company history. We continue to innovate and integrate a further expansion of ServiceFabric through the launch of our Service Directory marketplace, which has seen the addition of over 90 members offering more than 150 services, including secure and direct connections to over 225 global cloud on ramps, creating a vibrant community for [ seamless ], interconnection and collaboration. And just last week, we launched Private AI Exchange powered by ServiceFabric, which enables enterprise data to be at the center of an AI architecture, directly adjacent and interconnected with AI capabilities. This architecture are leading the data [ crafted ] barriers that emerge as data is generated and exchange with multiple applications across end-to-end AI-enabled digital workflows. We also continued down the path of bolstering our balance sheet and diversifying our capital sources with the expansion of one of our stabilized hyperscale joint ventures and the addition of a new hyperscale development JV, together with our first transaction with our perpetual capital partner, Digital Core REIT and well over the year. These transactions help to fund development pipeline capacity that our customers are seeking while reducing our overall leverage. Operating and financial results in the first quarter were encouraging. We posted sequential growth in our core data center revenues while growing adjusted EBITDA and core FFO per share. Development returns also continued to improve and we further enhanced the product mix of our portfolio while maintaining strong liquidity and lower leverage. Bookings and renewal results were even better with a number of metrics reaching new records, reflecting a strong demand environment and limited new capacity. Total bookings were $252 million, well ahead of our prior quarterly record of $176 million, reflecting the impact from the acceleration of AI and the improved pricing environment. Importantly, when comparing this quarter's leasing to the prior record set in 3Q 2022, we leased an incremental 10% of IT load capacity while REITs in a greater than 1 megawatt segment for approximately 60% higher than those achieved 18 months prior. Perhaps have been overshadowed by these record-setting results was another strong quarter in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment, which delivered a third straight quarter of over $50 million. Demand for connectivity-oriented capacity remains healthy and pricing remains firm. Our mark-to-market renewal spreads were up by 11.8%, aided by a record 18.5% increase in our greater than 1 megawatt category. Churn remained low and well controlled at 1.7% for the quarter. Same capital cash NOI growth also remained healthy, growing by 4.7% year-over-year in the quarter. And marking our fifth consecutive quarter of positive same capital growth. A year ago, data center demand was strong, driven by the growth of cloud and digital transformation while supply was tightening in power transmission constraints, supply chain delays and other factors. Since then, AI has become a significant driver of demand as hyperscalers race to develop, deploy and implement the technology while enterprise begins to explore the potential of this wave of technological evolution. McKinsey recently forecasted data center demand growth at a double-digit CAGR through 2030. This growing secular demand is broad and deep and both enterprises and service providers need a significant new data center capacity to accommodate their expanding needs, fueled by trends such as enterprise AI adoption, AI as a service, IoT and the relentless growth in data creation. Reflecting these trends, I want to highlight 2 highly strategic AI signs that came to fruition during the quarter. First, we were selected to host one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in one of our data centers in Copenhagen in a collaboration spearheaded on the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark where researchers from Denmark's public and private sectors, access to a cutting-edge NVIDIA-powered AI supercomputer in addition to NVIDIA's software platforms, training and expertise. Second, Digital Realty further strengthened its collaboration with Oracle to accelerate the growth and adoption of AI among enterprises, aiming to develop hybrid integrated solutions that address data gravity challenges, expedite time to market for enterprise deploying next-generation AI services and unlock data and AI-based business outcomes. Oracle will deploy critical GPU-based infrastructure with Digital Realty that leverages PlatformDIGITAL's open, purpose-built global data center solution and caters to enterprise and AI customers critical NVIDIA and AMD deployments among others. Our 0 to1 plus interconnection customers also continue to recognize our demonstrable strength and value proposition whether that related to power dense applications, a network of globally-connected data centers or other critical infrastructure requirements. During the first quarter, we added over 128 new logos. Our wins included a leading Fortune 500 AI component maker, is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL to a new EMEA market to support their streaming service capabilities. A global cloud computing and content distribution provider are leveraging the leading connectivity proposition of PlatformDIGITAL in Mombasa to support their global edge pop expansion project. A global 120 manufacturing company is building an AI HPC environment in Frankfurt to support its autonomous vehicle project. A leading French cloud service provider is deploying on PlatformDIGITAL to build out its edge cloud offering across the globe to support their enterprise customers' hybrid infrastructure by delivering low latency performance while retaining mobile data residency. Fortune 500 technology distributor in [indiscernible], IT service provider chose PlatformDIGITAL and Phoenix to support data exchange and interconnect with key partners. And a Fortune 500 health benefits provider has expanded into 2 additional North America metros to take advantage of cloud and network [indiscernible] available on PlatformDIGITAL. Moving over to a quick update on our largest market, Northern Virginia. During the first quarter, we leased approximately 80 megawatts of capacity in a supply-constrained quarter in Eastern Loudoun County. Demand for our capacity remains strong. And while hyperscale leasing is typically lumpy, we continue to see healthy traction on the remaining capacity, and we are focused on helping our customers and partners source the incremental data center infrastructure that they require. During the first quarter, we worked with Dominion Energy to help address the transmission [ model ] at Ashburn by providing them with a easement to land a southern line at the Mars substation that they plan to construct on a quarter parcel, along 450-acre Digital Dallas campus. We remain cautiously optimistic about getting access to additional power with Dominion's current forecast for completion of the Southern Line transmission project by late 2025. Today, we have roughly 80 megawatts of remaining capacity available for lease within our first building on our Digital Dallas campus in Loudoun known as Building 7. And we have almost 200 megawatts available for development for our [ regular ] campus in Manassas, which was contributed to our JV with last [indiscernible] in the first quarter. As a reminder, Manassas is currently outside of the constrained area and [indiscernible] is accessible there. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the first quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress and be recognized for our strong ESG performance in 2024. We went live with a switch to 100% renewable energy supplies for our Texas, New Jersey, and Sydney data center portfolios, benefiting 30 sites and addressing more than 10% of our mobile electricity footprint. We are recognized by the EPA as Energy Star Partner of the Year with sustained excellence for the fourth year, and we added a new green building certification at our MRS 4 development at Marseille, France. We also announced a partnership with a leading global energy solution provider to use our UPS systems to support Ireland's transition to renewable energy. And we've announced a significant expansion of our use of HVO diesel, a cleaner fuel made from waste, cooking oils and fats to power our backup generators. This will up our use of HVO to 20 global sites and 15% of our global portfolio by IT capacity. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Matthew Mercier : Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our first quarter results. We signed a record $252 million of new leases in the first quarter, led by $175 million of greater than a megawatt leasing in the Americas and another $53 million of 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection leasing, with interconnection bookings remaining firm at $13 million. Turning to our backlog. Given the record leasing, the backlog of signed but not yet commenced leases swelled to a new record of $541 million at quarter end, with new leasing outstripping a record $156 million of commencements during the quarter. Looking ahead, more than half of the record backlog is slated to commence during the remainder of 2024, indicating that commencements are likely to remain elevated. During the first quarter, we signed a record $248 million of renewal leases at a record increase of 11.8% on a cash basis. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions, with particular strength in the Americas. Re-leasing spreads have been increasing steadily for well over a year now, and while we expect that they will remain very healthy, they're likely to moderate in this quarter's record given the significant weighting of lease expirations in the 0 to 1-megawatt segment for the remainder of the year. In addition, we think it is important to consider a normalized view of the headline renewal spreads as 2 separate items skew our reported spreads higher in the first quarter. First, there was a notable outlier in the other category that should not be considered recurring or repeatable and removing this transaction would reduce our overall reported spreads by 250 basis points to 9.3% for the quarter. Second, there was a significant early renewal transaction in our greater than 1 megawatt segment that was part of a large package deal as we work to support this customer's broader data center capacity needs in one of our tightest markets. While this transaction enabled us to opportunistically pull forward some of our below-market expirations from the outer years, our forward year lease expiration schedule remains dominated by our 0 to 1 megawatt segment, which tends to experience spreads in the low to mid-single digits, akin to what we saw in the first quarter. Excluding both the outlier transaction and the packaged deal renewal, re-leasing spreads in the quarter would have been up 3.4% on a cash basis. We feel that this is a more predictable aspect of our portfolio, that we will continue to see opportunities and may periodically be able to capture the growing mark-to-market opportunity in our greater than 1 megawatt portfolio. In terms of earnings growth, we reported first quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting strong organic operating results, partly balanced by dilution associated with the stabilized asset sales and JV contributions completed early in the year and the ongoing deleveraging of our balance sheet. And normalizing for the sale or JV of $3 billion of stabilized assets completed since the beginning of last year, total revenue growth was 7% year-over-year in the first quarter due to the benefit of improved leasing spreads, along with favorable new leasing. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements as electricity rates fell sharply in EMEA year-over-year. Normalized adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue growth and modest increase in operating expenses. As Andy noted earlier, stabilized same-capital operating performance saw continued strength in the first quarter, with year-over-year cash NOI up 4.7% driven by 4% growth in rental plus interconnection revenues and further supported by expense control. Moving on to our investment activity. We spent $550 million on consolidated development for the first quarter, plus another $23 million for our share of managed unconsolidated JV spending while delivering 32 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers. It's worth mentioning, the approximate $300 million of sequential decline in our development spending this quarter which highlights the effects of the contributions of our 3 development JVs. However, seasonal and other timing-related factors also contributed to less CapEx spending in the first quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the first quarter with the closing of previously disclosed transactions, including the Cyxtera transaction, the first phase of the Blackstone hyperscale development JV and the sale of an additional 50% share of the 2 stabilized hyperscale assets in our Chicago JV to GI Partners. During the quarter, we also completed a hyperscale development JV with Mitsubishi for 2 assets in the Dallas Metro. In terms of new news, we also sold a piece of land in Sydney, Australia for $65 million, and we provided an easement to Dominion Energy to build the Mars substation on our Digital Dulles campus for $92 million, which all contributed to a reduction in our reported leverage to 6.1x at the end of the first quarter versus 6.2x at the end of 2023. Then in April, we continue to recycle capital by selling 75% of CH2, the third and final stabilized hyperscale facility on our Elk Grove campus at a 6.5 cap rate to GI Partners, raising nearly $400 million. And we sold to Digital Core REIT, an additional 24.9% interest in our Frankfurt site where Digital Core REIT previously owned 25%, raising another $129 million. In addition, we used some of our cash on hand to pay off the $600 million of maturing euro notes. After adjusting for these transactions, along with the anticipated closing of Phase 2 of the Blackstone transaction later this year, pro forma leverage is 5.8x. We continue to keep significant cash on the balance sheet with approximately $1.2 billion on hand and over $3 billion of total liquidity at March 31 to support ongoing investment opportunities. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over 4 years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 97% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, after paying off the [ earnouts ] in April, we have $316 million of debt maturing through year-end 2024. Beyond that, our maturities remained well [ levered ] through 2032. I'll finish with guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year 2024 of between $6.60 and $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued improvement we are seeing in our core business. Positive underlying operating trends are partly balanced by potential acceleration in development spending and additional capital recycling, as we move our leverage down towards the long-term target and position the company for the accelerating opportunity in front of us. We are maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, so we are notching up our cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads along with our same capital cash NOI growth expectations, reflecting better-than-expected execution on the leasing front in the first quarter, and the strength in fundamental conditions that we continue to see across our portfolio. Specifically, cash re-leasing spreads are now expected to increase 5% to 7% in 2024, up 100 basis points at the midpoint from the prior 4% to 6% range. And same-capital cash NOI is now expected to increase by 2.5% to 3.5%, up 50 basis points from the 2% to 3% range we provided in February. Highlighted in our investor presentations, excluding the nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds that we have previously discussed, our same-capital cash NOI growth for 2024 would be 4.5% to 5.5%. While these improvements and stronger core FFO per share realized in the first quarter bode well for the balance of the year, there are a few mitigating factors to consider as you're refining your models. First, we will see a modest drag on the $500-plus million of capital recycling completed in April. Second, we are only 1/3 of the way into the year, and there is still significant potential for both development spend and asset sales guidance to reach the high end of their guidance ranges. In addition, it is worth pointing out that the interest rate outlook and curve have changed considerably since we provided guidance and remains another source of uncertainty for the balance of this year. Just one final reminder and update. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we expect that our $6 billion development pipeline will become increasingly accretive as higher-yielding projects are completed and stabilized. The expected yield on our stabilized pipeline ticked up another 20 basis points sequentially, reflecting the addition of higher-yielding projects and the completion or contribution to joint ventures of lower-yielding projects. To help provide increased transparency around this important and evolving aspect of our company, we have enhanced our development life cycle schedule on Page 25 of our supplemental to : one, reflect our proportionate share of total data center development, including our unconsolidated joint ventures; and two, to provide increased disclosure around our available developable capacity in terms of [ IQ logo ]. We hope you find this helpful. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, could you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Jonathan Petersen : Great. I guess I could start with -- actually, let me start on the leasing side. So the -- I was curious how much of the leasing that was done this quarter was inside of some of the joint ventures, like maybe the Blackstone joint venture, that you did.  And in terms of the yield on development in Northern Virginia -- or North America, I noticed that was up 200 basis points to 12.3% as your expected yield from last quarter. I guess, is that kind of a good number to think about of what new developments you're signing today are as kind of in the 12-plus percent range. Andrew Power : So John, thanks for the question. So I'd say the lion's share of high, high percentage was not done into any of the JVs. I don't have the exact stat given we have now numerous strategic capital partners across our hyperscale platform, be it stabilized JVs. But I'm very confident that none of the leasing we reported in this quarter went into the deal you identified with Blackstone. We are seeing great traction on those projects. But this quarter, none of that lease went inside. On your second question in terms of improvement in ROIs, in particular in North America, I would say we've definitely moved the needle quite dramatically on that category from some of our build-to-suit projects that we'll call closer to 7% that we joint ventured to now north of 12% ROIs. And we're still working through projects that are obviously weighing that down a little bit, and we have projects that are entering that schedule on the higher side as well given the rapid improvement in the rate environment. Operator : And our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Jonathan Atkin : So you mentioned rate environment and maybe continuing on that theme a little bit in terms of pricing. As we think about next year's core FFO per share growth rate, you gave a little bit of commentary on that in the last call. And any updated thoughts in terms of what we should be considering around puts and takes as that number potentially goes higher, whether it's execution of leases or pricing or renewals or whatnot? Andrew Power : Thanks, Jon. Maybe I'll speak to market rates and where we are able to execute on new leases signed and also renewals first and then hand it over to Matt in terms of FFO trajectory into next year.  As you saw from our results, we're obviously benefiting from overall supply/demand dynamic with robust demand trends be it enterprise digital transformation, cloud computing and now AI on top of that, that's playing out in our 0 to 1-megawatt category as well as our greater than megawatt category. And that's all having a backdrop of supply constraints from numerous sources. And we were able to continue to push rate both on the existing contracts that were coming up for renewal as well as on new contracts to higher and higher levels. That is, obviously, you see in the leasing results and believe that trend is going to remain intact for some time.  Matt, why don't you speak to the FFO trajectory, please? Matthew Mercier : Sure. Thanks, Jon. So what I would say is I think we're -- based on our first quarter results, we -- our optimism is improved -- has improved in terms of our -- what we expect to see and what we talked about last quarter in terms of improving growth as we look to 2025.  And a big part of that, I would say, is driven by the successful leasing execution that we saw this quarter, $250 million and the shorter signed commence lag, which is at 7 months, it really sets us up for accelerating revenue and therefore, bottom line growth as we exit this year and into next year. But from boiling all that down, I would say that the growth algorithm is generally similar to what I discussed last quarter, which is we'd expect to see, call it, plus 4% related to our stabilized same-store portfolio. On top of that, you'd add another, call it, 2-plus percent as we deliver developments into our operating portfolio at yields that are continuing to improve. There'll be some offset, call it, in the 1% area, given higher rates and the debt refinancing that we have over the next couple of years. And I think that kind of sets us up for mid-single-digit and greater growth going forward. Operator : And our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Eric Luebchow : I wanted to dive into Northern Virginia a little bit. Can you maybe just provide an update on the timing of the Dominion transmission upgrades and when you think you can get even more capacity into that market? And then on rental rates in Northern Virginia, I think that probably had a big influence on the 170-plus you reported in North America. Could you just talk about where you're seeing rental rates in that very supply-constrained market and what that kind of -- how that influences your yields, your underwriting and your development table? Andrew Power : Sure. Thanks, Eric. So Northern Virginia, obviously, has been a highly dynamic market for some time here. We were very pleased to come together and support our partner at Dominion with a very strategic easement to be the landing of the Mars substation, which we are -- it is our understanding, they are on track to be delivering power and bring power back online by the beginning of 2026 from that southern line. So there's not been a divergence in terms of timing what that was previously expressed to us.  We definitely benefited from the increase in rates in that market. Our largest signing was in that market as well as a few other decent-sized signings, although we also had some very great signings in the London market, and north of a megawatt signings also in Copenhagen. So they were not the only contributors in the plus the megawatt category. The rates, I would say, the market rates in general are call it, continue to improve in that market and as the precious capacity becomes more and more finite, as you saw on that slide, we now have -- are turning our attention to really 80 megawatts remaining at Digital Dallas as well as the Manassas campus, which is not impacted by the power delays. And I'd say rates in both Manassas and Loudoun County are converging right at this moment, call it in the 165, call it to almost 180 type area on a market basis. That'd be the cash rate, not a GAAP rate that we report. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Barden with Bank of America. David Barden : I guess if I could just explore, Andy, the commentary around how AI is contributing already to your business. A lot of the retail data center-centric companies have kind of said that's not really a thing for them yet. So could you kind of elaborate a little bit on within that greater than 1 megawatt category, how much of that is the hyperscale? Is it really hyperscale? Or is it these maybe more bespoke Copenhagen Nordisk Foundation engines that are coming online? And what do these builds look like, in what way are they different than maybe what you've been doing historically? And how is that informing how your development is evolving? Andrew Power : Sure. Thanks, David. So let me just give you the tops of the ways then I'm going to turn it to Chris on how we're tapping our infrastructure capabilities to really excel in this category.  Obviously, the data points are smaller in the more enterprise-oriented wins, but they are there. We, I would say, call it, less than 0.5 megawatt supported through a partner, a global manufacturing company, on its AI journey in Europe. You noted the slightly larger than that, but still not -- certainly not hyperscale. The great win we had with Novo Nordisk supporting them in their NVIDIA-backed chips with a real landmark win with a supercomputer in their market.  And then for some time, we've seen the emergence of the hyperscalers with larger capacity block needs. And the largest of our wins in the quarter, I would characterize as an AI win as well. And all in all, it's probably close to 50% of this quarter's signs, which is up relative to prior quarters. And I think there's a lot about what our platform offers that really allows us to capture this demand, maybe even earlier in the an evolution of AI than some others, but Chris can speak to that as well. Chris Sharp : Yes. No, I appreciate it, David. This is Chris Sharp. And so a couple of comments. I think you're thinking about it correctly in that there's 2 lenses, right? There's kind of that hyperscale lens that has AI built within it. And then there's this other pocket that we kind of look at that's definitely emerging with private AI. And so these are these larger deployments that we're seeing come out from multiple types of enterprises.  And I think it's important to understand from a design perspective, it kind of starts with a little bit broader in how we master plan our campuses. And so I think the work that we've been doing around building out substations and doing a long-term plan within the market has allowed us to then bring a very large capacity block design to market, which is very modular. And I think in that modularity, it's something that we continue to ideate with our customers to be able to support the varying power densities.  And I think we talked last call about HD colo and being able to do what we're very proud about wit  70 kilowatts, but then you'll see us start to evolve over the next quarter here, the ability to even support 150 kilowatts. And so being able to support these densities, which is representative of the AI workload is absolutely paramount to our modular designs and be able to do that very efficiently.  And then I think the last piece is the heritage. The heritage of the team on a global basis, being able to really meet and ideate with these customer bases is what's really building a distinct differentiator for us to not only capture that hyperscale AI, which we see growing and burgeoning, which you see in the prepared remarks with Oracle and some of those customers.  But then I think directly to your point, David, these smaller, if you will, from a hyperscale perspective, private AI around Novo Nordisk Foundation and just we really are at the cusp of a lot of this AI demand coming into the PlatformDIGITAL globally. Operator : And our next question today comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Jyhhaw Liu : Maybe to piggyback on the prior question related to retail and enterprise. Do you see potential for AI tailwinds to perhaps drive meaningful acceleration to your 0 to 1 megawatt segment, similar to what you saw in the greater than 1 megawatt segment this quarter just as AI workloads begin to evolve towards private AI and inferencing? Andrew Power : Sure, Irvin. So I mean, the here and now I think AI is having a numerous positive implications for the sector. And I'll have Chris speak into what's next because I don't think we're really at what's next, be it inference, private data sets, enterprise consumption. But the here and now you have a backdrop of big existing customers with desires to have immediate [ see ] around the capacity.  There's still -- we're winning that in our core markets where we see robust and diverse demand. We are not falling. We're chasing this demand into unproven locations. We're intersecting it, we're supporting availability zones or on ramps, where there's network density and not in unproven markets.  You're also seeing new players pop up that obviously are not front of queue for those larger capacity blocks who are going to try to get their hands on what we have and are often able to fit in some of the more challenging places in our portfolio to sell, but they're going to take it because they have urgency around their business models and bringing their AI models on. That's the right now, the last quarter, the next quarter, but there's more to come here in this AI story. And I'll let Chris expand upon it in terms of the next chapter. Chris Sharp : Yes. Thanks, Irvin. Absolutely. And I think one of the things that we really have thought about for some time now is the data is at the core of a lot of these AI kind of capabilities coming to market. So being to able place that algorithm right next to the data in that market, I think is everything that we've been looking at and doing that algorithm in proximity to the data is absolutely paramount for a lot of these kind of 0 to 1 megawatt offerings. And so what we've been thinking about with HD colo and why I talk about on a rack by rack basis, is allowing our customers to leverage a lot of their existing kind of inventory and architecture to bring AI in proximity to that capability. And I think that's where, even recently, we talked about private AI exchange, that's really focused on removing that technical barrier. So customers can get the right state-of-the-art infrastructure, be it NVIDIA, be it AMD and being able to support those power densities in an existing environment. So we do see the future of that coming to market in that fashion.  I will tell you that -- you brought up inference. Inference is being done within training today just because of time to market, but we do see inference picking up and being a longer-term demand cycle over the years, which I think PlatformDIGITAL is well positioned to continue to support. Operator : Our next question today comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Richard Choe : You noted a pull forward of leases in Northern Virginia. Do you have other -- are you having other conversations? And should we expect to see more of those? Andrew Power : Thanks, Richard. Maybe I'll hand it to Colin here in a second to talk about the broader backdrop for both the enterprise and also the hyperscale AI side. But I wouldn't call our Northern Virginia activity as a pull forward. As you could see, they're signed to commence time, materially step down, there is urgency around the capacity blocks. We still have significant runway of precious capacity in the Northern Virginia market between now and 2026 that our numerous customers have desires for and we're in various stages of negotiation.  And it's not just in Northern Virginia story. We have the similar types of opportunities in other parts of the North America portfolio, be it Santa Clara, Dallas, New Jersey. And we'll also have the equivalent in the major flat markets in Europe, and in parts of Asia Pacific. So -- and I think this trend is going to continue for some time. Now again, you can't predict some of these large capacity blocks executing on consecutive quarters necessarily but I believe it's going to continue. But Colin, why don't you speak a little bit about the pipeline we see on both sides? Colin McLean : Thanks, Andy. Appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, overall, I would say our pipeline kind of reflects some of the same characteristics or bookings this quarter. So pretty AI heavy, as Andy highlighted, of 50% of our bookings this quarter were AI. I would say our pipeline is representative of that. But honestly, it's a pretty diverse characterization overall between enterprise, namely hybrid, IT, cloud compute and then AI. So I think it's a pretty robust platform across the globe, and you saw that in some of our bookings, in particular, London really jumped up this quarter. If you look at the sub-1-megawatt, and really what's going on in the digital transformation story, the explosion of data and really the IT spend, you're seeing a pretty pervasive enterprise activation going on where that is really taking place really across the globe in a big way. That's, in our view, enabled by channel, which this quarter, we had about 22% of our business go through channel, which was, I think, substantive. And those channel partners are really helping us tap into new logos, which you might have seen was 128 this quarter, which I think was fourth highest on record. So I think that's substantial.  So overall, I'm pretty pleased with the balance we're seeing across the portfolio and the pipeline and hope to see that continue in the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Michael Rollins : Just curious if you take a step back, where does the overall mark-to-market it for the portfolio and the anticipated duration over which you could achieve that if pricing were to stay at current levels? Andrew Power : I think you asked the overall mark-to-market on the portfolio, Mike? Michael Rollins : Yes. Andrew Power : So as I think  you can get the -- obviously, you look at the in-place rates even pro forma for our recent positive cash mark-to-market on our schedule. I think that question provide more focus on the greater than megawatt category, which we've seen the greatest resurgence or uptick that it does tick down, call it lower for the next few years, call it down to the 130s and then it even hits 100 upon exploration as the low watermark in a few years' time.  And I just commented on the Northern Virginia rates, if they call it, 155 to 180. Not all markets are at Northern Virginia. There are some markets that are ahead of Northern Virginia. But it does feel like big deals are gravitating towards that mid-100s type area pretty quickly and universally and it does not seem like that trend is taking any cessation or pause. Operator : And our next question today comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Frank Louthan : Great. And kind of to that point, when you're looking at new investment and expansion, how much are you focused on retail colo expansion versus wholesale? And what's kind of pushing you in one direction or the other? Gregory Wright : Frank, it's Greg right here. Look, I think consistent with past practice, we continue to play across the product spectrum, and it's going to vary by market, right? I mean, as we've mentioned, we're using our third-party capital model to continue to support our hyperscale customers and grow that element of the business. As you know, demand for that business is projected to increase 2.7x between now and 2030.  And then when you look over at the colocation in the enterprise segment of the product spectrum, that's still supposed to grow. It's still a very large market. People forget about how large that market is, and the solid growth in that market, too, is still like 2.3x. So I mean, we're not sitting here today saying, hey, it's a zero-sum game. We're only going to do enterprise/colo versus hyperscale. It's going to vary by market and what our customer needs are. But we're actually pretty bullish and optimistic on both right now in terms of underlying fundamentals and potential for rent growth. Operator : And our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Simon Flannery : Great. Great to see the leasing in Loudoun County. It looks like the Americas was about 80% of your leasing. Could you just talk a little bit about Europe and Asia Pac? It seems like AI is sort of starting off in the U.S. You talked about Copenhagen as well. But just help us think about broadening this out beyond the kind of key U.S. markets. And then, Matt, on the leverage. Could you just update us on getting -- once you get to the 5.8, what's the plan from there? Andrew Power : Thanks, Simon. So I'll do the quick non-U.S. world tour. You're correct, Americas had put up some record results in contribution, and that was not just in the greater than megawatt category. It was also a major contributor in our less than megawatt category, which is great to see.  Outside the U.S., starting in EMEA on the 0 to 1 megawatt category, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London shined. And on the greater than 1 megawatt category, which Colin, I think touched on, London turned out to be a big contributor this quarter, which has not been for a while, which is also great to see. We saw a fair bit of importing business into Europe from outside of Europe, on both sides and firm pricing.  In APAC, while this particular quarter, we did not have a significant contribution from the greater than megawatt category, we did have strong results both in pricing and volume on the 0 to 1 megawatt category with Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul leading the way. And I would just say that the greater than megawatt category is just the fact that there's just fewer markets in APAC that we're landing big deals into so it's not as consistent of every single quarter being a major contributor. But all in all, I agree with your sentiment that AI is certainly landed on the U.S. shores sooner than the rest of the globe, and I think it has a great propensity to likely globalize as did cloud. Matthew Mercier : Yes. Makes sense. So on the leverage front, I mean, just to take a little step back. I mean, hopefully, as you've seen, we've made some considerable progress. You go back a year ago, we were at a little over 7x. We're now at a reported 6.1x, so a full turn of leverage that we've taken out in the last year, thanks to all the work and execution that the broader team has done.  We continue that. As Greg is seeing, even subsequent to the quarter, we brought in another $500 million of proceeds from some additional JV activities as well as transaction within our Digital Core REIT showing the diversity of capital sources we have. We're going to continue to see as a result of the strong operating fundamentals, continue to increase our overall EBITDA and we're now sitting at approximately $3 billion of liquidity. So we're well on our way, and we feel confident about being able to achieve our goal of getting down to 5.5x leverage this year. And I think we've done a lion's share of the work. So we'll continue to execute and feel pretty good about it. Operator : And our next question today comes from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Aryeh Klein : I guess one of your larger customers is at risk of a potential ban in the U.S. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you perceive the risks around that? And maybe the potential mark-to-market opportunity if it came to that. Andrew Power : Thanks, Aryeh. So on all scenarios, we don't want to speak to confidential customer information whatsoever. Obviously, anyone who's picked up a newspaper can refer to the scenario you're talking about. 2 comments : first one, which is just from the cheap seats, I would -- my personal opinion is not to jump up to any draconian conclusions on outcomes just yet. There's a lot of innings left in that game and a lot of outcomes that could happen. So I won't jump to a doomsday scenario for Digital, depending on what plays out in ensuing months.  And even under that scenario, I would group them among all of our hyperscale customers that have maximized the pricing curve when markets were less softer and have contracts that are, like all our hyperscale customers, some of the best contracts on the books in terms of markup opportunities, certainly, on the south of 100 side rather than the north of 100 side, by and large. So if the doomsday draconian scenario was to play out, which I'm discounting, we would have some churn to refill, but probably couldn't come at a better time with a better mark-to-market opportunity for the company. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Niknam : Just bigger picture question. With pricing seeing the type of growth it's seeing, supply chain constraints that I think largely plagued the industry a couple of years back are now largely resolved. Can you help us frame what you're seeing in terms of new hyperscale builds that are in-sourced relative to outsourced to partners like yourself? And I guess, more importantly, how Digital can enhance the utility it offers its larger customers in what's looking like a firmer pricing backdrop that's likely to persist for some time. Andrew Power : Matt, so I would not characterize the world of supply constraints or just hindrances to supply as being in the rearview mirror in general. And maybe we're not talking about the proverbial waiting for your refrigerators COVID supply chain equivalent. But the friction to supply, whether it is power transmission, power generation, supply chains on data center components or just positions in queue for production or components for substations, broader sustainability concerns, nimbyism in general, that friction is existing, and it's happening in a backdrop where I think we can add more and more value to our customers than probably ever before.  And even despite historical preferences or to often do it yourself, I think by and large, the customer base is seeing having the benefit of global outsourced trusted partner with 20 years of experience operationally, delivery-wise, and really turn in to Digital in their times of need and really at a time or it could be continuing of urgency around those capacity blocks. And that's certainly been highlighted in the Northern Virginia market, but I think that's a broader Americas phenomenon and a growing global phenomena. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Michael Elias : Congrats, guys, on a record leasing quarter. Just a quick one for me. I know it's been a while since you guys have done an acquisition. Maybe for Andy or Greg, curious how you're thinking about the potential for M&A, particularly given where your stock is trading right now? Andrew Power : Going to Greg on that one, Michael. Thank you for the compliment. Gregory Wright : Yes. Thanks, Michael. Look, I think right now, our appetite for acquisitions, unless they're smaller tuck-in strategic acquisitions. Michael, I think we've discussed this before. It's not that great right now.  When we look across most markets, we think we already have the footprint and the product and the team to continue to drive our business and succeed. And as you know, most of our legacy M&A activity was either gaining access to markets, to product or to teams in select markets where we didn't have a real presence. We don't have nearly as much of that today, particularly when you look across the Americas and EMEA.  Over time, would we continue to look in markets through APAC to potentially grow, yes, but there's not a lot of those platforms, if you will, for example, there's not the logical interaction sitting in APAC for us to try to do a strategic transaction. So while you never say never, I think we look at things today. And Matt and Andy and the team laid out where we are in our development yields and the like. And you look at this on a risk-adjusted basis. And we still prefer right now, at least given current conditions, to buy land and build organically. And we think that's a better risk-adjusted return than what multiples would imply in the M&A market. So I don't think you're going to see a lot. But again, you never say never. Operator : And our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Nicholas Del Deo : Andy, earlier you said that you're not going to chase demand into unproven markets, which you're seeing a fair bit of demand today. I guess what sort of thresholds would those markets have to cross before they might become interesting in your eyes, especially if power constraints in key markets remain exceedingly tight or even get worse? Or are they like so far down the list of priorities that we really shouldn't be thinking about them? Andrew Power : Thanks, Nick. So I think if you look at our strategy, we're focused on supporting workloads, be it enterprise, digital transformation or hybrid or hyperscale cloud or AI in markets with robust and diverse demand and supporting applications with latency and locational sensitivity.  The cloud has been around for a long time and did not put [ AZs ] as in every single NFL city in America or it's equivalents around the globe. They picked locations where GDP, population, infrastructure and data are essentially there, which I think lends itself to greater longevity and sustainable growth in our asset class and our strategy and our business.  Now there's markets that have been added to that list over time. They didn't get -- put chiseled in stone and put away on a shelf years and years ago. But -- so I think new markets for us would have to give us the similar conviction we have, invest in our core markets to want us to go there. So that could happen. That certainly could happen in a rapidly changing world, with power becoming such a precious resource as well as other precious resources. But anything we're thinking about is investing in -- we're not in this [ risk trade ], we're investing in this for the long term, for long-term sustainable growth.  And we're fortunate, if you can look at our newly tweaked and disclosure on our development cycle, we've got north of 3 gigawatts of growth in land capacity or shell capacity in those core markets. So we've got a lot of runway to harvest that demand before even feeling the urgency to chase into less proven markets. Operator : And our final question today comes from Erik Rasmussen at Stifel. Erik Rasmussen : Obviously, North America is very strong, greater than 1 megawatt. And I think based on your commentary, a lot of that was AI driven. And then also, it seems like it's going to -- AI will sort of follow a similar pattern as we saw with cloud. So would you expect -- I mean I wouldn't expect similar levels of quarterly leasing, but would you expect sort of a similar outperformance throughout the year in North America, especially the greater than 1 megawatt based on sort of the other regions? Just want to get a sense of sort of how the year could be shaping up in terms of the bookings. Andrew Power : Thanks, Erik. So just more on the tactical on the quarterly bookings. I mean, we're out of the gates here with a great start on both the less-than-megawatt category, call it north of 50 for several consecutive quarters now. I think 2 in a row, north of 53, great new logos contribution and obviously, an overall record which we discussed. By and large, I wouldn't say usually another record follows the prior record on the one hand. But on the other, we're certainly in a different territory right now in terms of demand. We have the large capacity blocks that are deeply sought after. We have a team focused on executing, and we got 3 more at bats in 2024 to put those results up.  Bigger backdrop. If you look back at cloud globalizing, it's one of those things that the famous quote \"It happened slowly and then it happened really fast.\" I can remember years of the thesis being it's going to globalize forever and ever, and then it really took off. So I'm not -- I wouldn't -- I couldn't pound the table and say 2024 year is the year that AI globalizes like cloud. But signs do point that it should follow a similar trend over time. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead. Andrew Power : Thank you all for dialing in. We really appreciate it. Digital Realty had a strong first quarter with record leasing results that reflected the growing impact of AI on our business. Fundamental strength continued through the first quarter with healthy same-capital organic growth and robust re-leasing spreads.  We've continued to innovate with the expansion of ServiceFabric, new products like our Private AI Exchange, along with modular designs to accommodate increasingly power dense workloads.  Finally, we've closed a number of transactions already this year bringing in additional private capital and enhancing our ability to deliver new capacity to meet our customers' growing needs. We are excited about this quarter's results and look ahead with continued optimism. The 3 key demand drivers, AI, cloud and enterprise digital transformation are showing no signs of letting up, and we are well positioned with over 300 data centers across the key markets around the world.  I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world running. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This conference has now concluded, and we thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful afternoon.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Digital Realty Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jordan Sadler. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Digital Realty's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information, reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our second quarter. First, we continue to execute within a very favorable demand environment with $164 million of new leasing executed in the quarter, again marking one of the top quarters in our history, which together with last quarter's record leasing drove a record first half of the year. Second, our operating momentum continued through the second quarter as a record level of commencements translated into meaningful improvement in both total and same capital occupancy, while cash releasing spreads remained firmly positive and continued growth in cross connects drove interconnection revenue to a new record in the quarter. And third, through capital recycling and demand-driven equity issuance in the quarter, we reduced our leverage to 5.3 times at quarter end, below our long-term target level, helping to position Digital Realty for the opportunity that we continue to see in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. Andrew Power : Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. The momentum we experienced in the first quarter continued in the second quarter. In the first half of 2024, our new leasing was up over 100% from the activity we saw in the first half of 2023, with a strong and steady contribution from our 0-1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Demand for data center capacity remains as strong as we've ever seen, especially for larger capacity blocks in our core markets. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this favorable demand environment given our track record of execution across six continents, a robust land bank and shell capacity that could support 3 gigawatts plus of incremental development, reduced leverage, and our growing and diverse array of capital partners. During the second quarter, we remain focused on our key priorities. We signed $164 million of new leasing in the second quarter, which excluded another $16 million of bookings within one of our newest hyperscale private capital ventures. While bookings integrated a megawatt category were once again the primary driver, there was no contribution from our largest hyperscale market, Northern Virginia, as Dallas led the way in the second quarter. Importantly, we posted one of our strongest quarters ever in the 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment with record new logos and near-record bookings in each of the 0 to 1 megawatt and interconnection categories. This leasing strength is a positive reflection of the value that our 5,000 and growing base of customers realize from our full spectrum product strategy. We also delivered strong operating results with 13% data center revenue growth year-over-year pro forma for the capital recycling activity completed over the last year. In addition, we have enjoyed healthy growth in recurring fee income associated with our new hyperscale ventures. In the first half, fee income was up 26% over the first half of 2023, primarily reflecting the formation of almost $10 billion of institutional private capital ventures over the last year. And we would expect this line item to continue to gather momentum. With the record commencements in the second quarter and the healthy backlog of favorably priced leases ready to commence in the second half, we are well positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Subsequent to quarter end, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe through our entrance into the sought submarket of London. With the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus, which we expect to be highly complementary to our existing co-location capabilities in the City and the Docklands. The new campus supports an existing community of more than 150 customers, utilizing over 2,000 cross-connects. Consistent with our key priorities, we continue to innovate and integrate as we unveiled our HD Colo 2.0 offering in the second quarter with advanced high-density deployment support for liquid-to-chip cooling across 170 of our data centers globally. In addition, just last week, we announced the deployment of a new Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute Cloud On-Ramp at our Dallas campus, along with the launch of the new Azure Express Route Metro Service in the Amsterdam and Zurich market. We also bolstered our balance sheet and significantly diversified our capital sources, availing Digital Realty of more than $10 billion of private capital over the past year through our new hyperscale ventures and non-core dispositions. During the quarter, we expanded our existing Chicago Hyperscale venture with the sale of a 75% interest in CH2, the remaining stabilized data center on our Elk Grove campus. We also sold an additional 24.9% interest in a data center in Frankfurt to Digital Core REIT, increasing their total position in the campus to just under 15%. These two transactions together raised over $0.5 billion. Finally, we raised approximately $2 billion of equities since our last earnings call, including the $1.7 billion fallout offering in early May and proceeds raised under our ATM. These transactions together with the others of the past year have positioned our balance sheet to capitalize on this unique environment and construct the capacity that our customers demand. Artificial intelligence innovation is reshaping the global data center landscape. As new applications are developed and proliferate across industries and around the world, AI is driving the incremental wave of demand for robust computing infrastructure. According to Gartner, global spending on public cloud services is projected to grow over 20% to reach $675 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow another 22% in 2025 with AI-related workloads driving a significant portion of this growth. Digital transformation, cloud, and AI are fueling demand for data center capacity worldwide. Traditional data centers were already being pushed to their limits on demand for cloud and digital transformation. Whereas demand for AI-oriented data center infrastructure is being accommodated in upgraded suites in our existing facilities and in newly built facilities. These AI workloads are taking place on specialized hardware with massive parallel processing capabilities and lighting fast data transfer speeds. Fortunately, Digital Realty's modular data center design can accommodate these evolving requirements. The growth in demand is global. We're seeing strong demand across our North American metros first, but it is spread and beyond with interest in locations like London, Amsterdam, and Paris in EMEA, and Singapore and Tokyo in APAC. Our global footprint is well-suited to capture this growing demand, whether it'd be for major cloud service providers adding to an availability zone, a major enterprise digitizing their business processes, or an AI model being trained or be it or put into production. However, this exponential growth in data center demand is not without its challenges. The environmental impact of these energy-intensive facilities is growing alongside the scaling of user requirements. According to the IEA, data centers consumed almost 2% of global electricity in 2022, a figure that could double by 2026, absent significant efficiency improvements. I will touch on Digital Realty's latest sustainability highlights in a moment. As we look to the future, the interplay between AI advancements and data center evolution will continue to shape the global technology landscape. IDC predicts that by 2027, worldwide spending on digital transformation will reach nearly $4 trillion, driven by AI, further accelerating the demand for data center infrastructure. We believe that the providers who can officially scale their capacity while addressing sustainability concerns will be best positioned to benefit from these three key drivers, digital transformation, cloud, and AI in the years to come. Customers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty can bring to their applications around the world. During the second quarter, we added 148 new logos, marking a new quarterly record. A growing number of these new logos are being sourced by our partners who have officially expanded our sales team to reach into enterprises and around the world. The wins this quarter include Global 2000 advanced engineering and research enterprise developing a private AI Sandbox on PlatformDIGITAL to enable experimentation and development by federal agencies and brought to us by one of our large connectivity partners, Lumen Technologies. Another partner bought a new logo that is an AI-enabled SaaS provider repatriating all public cloud to save costs and enable growth. That same partner was also assisting two large financial institutions to increase their capacity on PlatformDIGITAL in APAC and North America. And yet another example of our growing partnerships, an AI SaaS provider and recognized leader in natural language speech synthesis is growing their commitment to PlatformDIGITAL with an expansion of current AI workloads where proximity is the driving requirement. A Global 2000 manufacturer is rearchitecting their network on PlatformDIGITAL with a regional hub to improve efficiency, lower their network costs, and implement controls while eliminating the capital cost of maintaining their own facilities. And two leading financial services firms are both leveraging PlatformDIGITAL to extend their respective virtual desktop infrastructure environments to improve performance and user experience across their North American and EMEA employee base. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our ESG progress during the second quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress on ESG performance. We were recognized by TIME and Statista as one of the world's most sustainable companies of 2024. We also released our Annual ESG Report in June, highlighting our ongoing efforts to develop and operate responsibly. As described in our ESG report, we further increased our renewable energy supplies with 152 data centers now matched with 100% renewable energy. We improved water efficiency and expanded the use of recycled water, which accounted for 43% of our total water consumption last year. We also launched a new supplier engagement program to drive sustainability and decarbonization through our supply chain. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Matthew Mercier : Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our second-quarter results. We signed $164 million of new leases in the second quarter with two-thirds of that falling into the greater than megawatt category, the majority of which landed in the Americas, with healthy contributions from both EMEA and APAC. Not to be overlooked, however, was the $40 million of 0 to 1 megawatt leasing and a standout $14 million of interconnection bookings. Our fourth consecutive quarter exceeding $50 million in our 0 to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment. Turning to our backlog, we commenced a record $176 million of new leases this quarter, which was largely balanced by the strong second-quarter leasing. As such, the $527 million backlog of signed and not yet commenced leases moderated by only 2% from last quarter's peak and remains robust at more than 9% of our total revenue guidance for the full year 2024. Looking ahead, we have over $175 million scheduled to commence through the remainder of this year with over $230 million already scheduled to commence next year. During the second quarter, we signed $215 million of renewal leases at a 4% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date renewal spreads to 8.2%. Re-leasing spreads were once again positive across products and regions. Last quarter, we noted that the underlying renewal spread after stripping out two outliers was 3.4%. Our cash renewal spreads in the 0 to 1 megawatt segment were up 3.8% in the second quarter, while the greater than 1 megawatt segment was up 3.9%. As a reminder, the 0 to 1 megawatt segment is the primary driver of our overall re-leasing spreads, given the heavier weighting of lease expirations in this category, which are typically shorter-term leases with inflationary or better escalators. 0 to 1 megawatt deals renew reliably and predictably, making them track closer to market over time, thereby reducing the outsized movements that can come with larger or longer-term lease renewals. On the greater than 1 megawatt side, renewals reflected the strong pricing environment with leases renewed at $159 per kilowatt compared to the $133 per kilowatt achieved on greater than 1 megawatt renewals last quarter. The key difference between the quarters was the rate on the expiring leases. This quarter, leases in this segment expired at $153 per kW, while last quarter's leases expired at an average of $112 per kilowatt. For the quarter, churn remained low and well-controlled at 1.6% and our largest termination was immediately backfilled at an improved rate. In terms of earnings growth, we reported second quarter core FFO of $1.65 per share, reflecting continued healthy organic operating results, partly balanced by the impact of the meaningful deleveraging and capital-raising activity executed over the course of the last year. Revenue growth in the quarter was tempered by the decline in utility expense reimbursements, a comparison that is likely to persist throughout this year, given the decline in electricity rates in EMEA year-over-year, along with the impact of substantial capital recycling activity. Despite the deleveraging headwinds, rental revenue plus interconnection revenues were up 5% on a combined basis year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 5% year-over-year through the first half and remains well on track to meet our 2024 guidance. Pro forma for the capital recycling completed since last July, rental plus interconnection revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew by 13% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, in the second quarter. Stabilized same capital operating performance saw continued growth in the second quarter with year-over-year cash NOI up 2% as 3.6% growth in data center revenue was offset by a catch-up in rental property operating costs, which were flat last quarter. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI has increased by 3.5%. And as we have previously highlighted, same capital NOI growth is expected to be impacted by nearly 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity, we spent $532 million on consolidated development in the second quarter, plus another $90 million for our share of unconsolidated JV spending. We delivered 72 megawatts of new capacity across the globe for our customers in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with 71 megawatts of new starts. The blended average yield on our overall development pipeline moderated 20 basis points sequentially to 10.4% as a result of a market mix-shift of completions and starts in North America during the quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent a bit over $1 billion in development CapEx, tracking closely towards our full-year guidance. As the second half should see a ramp from newly commenced projects along with the typical seasonal uplift. Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet in the second quarter with the closing of the two transactions in April that we disclosed during last quarter's earnings report and was referenced earlier by Andy. Together, these two transactions raised just over $500 million of gross proceeds. Additionally, since our last earnings report, we sold 14.7 million shares, including a 12.1 million share follow-on offering in early May and incremental ATM issuance raising $2 billion of net proceeds while using cash-on-hand to pay off a \u20ac600 million bond that matured in April and a GBP250 million that matured last Friday. At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $4 billion of total liquidity and our net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 5.3 times, which is below our long-term target. Moving on to our debt profile, our weighted average debt maturity is over four years and our weighted average interest rate is 2.9%. Approximately 84% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 86% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, after paying off the euro notes in April and Sterling notes last week, we have zero remaining debt maturities through year-end. Beyond that, our maturities remain well laddered through 2032. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are maintaining our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 of $6.60 to $6.75 per share, reflecting the continued strength in our core business, partly balanced by the front-half weighted capital recycling and funding activity, which helped to reduce our reported leverage by a full turn to better position the company to fund development in 2024 and beyond. We are also maintaining our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges for 2024, as well as the operating, investing, and financing expectations that we previously provided. Looking forward to the balance of 2024, core FFO per share remains poised to increase in the second half as the backlog commences and the impact of prior deleveraging moderates. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Choe : Hi. I wanted to ask about the long-term pipeline, you're seeing for the -- over 1 megawatt category. I think there is some concerns that right now we might be in a kind of pull-forward or kind of elevated cycle. And just wanted to get your sense of how far out this pipeline of deals that you're looking at in the current environment could last. Thank you. Andrew Power : Hi. Thanks, Richard. So I would say in the greater than 1-megawatt category, we're seeing a continuation of the trends we've been playing out for the last several quarters. The biggest customers are desiring, one, contiguous capacity blocks that are very large; two, they want them right now or as soon as possible; and three, the desire of fungible markets, i.e., markets where they can service certainly GenAI workloads, trading ultimately inference, but also if they miss the measure, they can support their cloud computing needs as well. So we have not seen a -- the ease in terms of the demand for those attributes in the market. Operator : The next question comes from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Irvin. Irvin Liu : Sorry, I was muted. So I wanted to double-click on renewal rates. So, I guess, a couple of items stood out. One, in the Americas, the $146 per kilowatt monthly rate and for the greater than 1 megawatt segment, that marked a sequential decline. Similarly, you know we've seen rates on new leases decline sequentially as well. So can you help us understand what's driving the sequential declines versus a quarter ago? Was this step-down mostly a function of markets and mix or were there other sort of industry dynamics that we should be thinking about? Andrew Power : Hi, thanks, Irvin. So I think the one big deal or the one market you were pointing to is just the North America greater than 1 megawatt. Now just a mix of composition of deals. This quarter, in particular, Dallas market really led the way. It's had outside strength and this is actually a quarter where we didn't actually have any signings into our Northern Virginia market, which was not a lack of demand for that market, and we still have some great options for customers available at large capacity blocks in two parts of that market, but we just didn't penned anything in this particular quarter. So if you look more broadly, I think almost all the other, call it regions in both segments had an uptick in rates and that's always on apples-to-apples that the mix in the region could be different metros like that one example I just gave you, but that would be only outlier is the one that I just discussed. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks and good afternoon. Curious if you could talk about some of the ideas that you shared in the past around working on ways to participate in private capital recycling, whether it's trying to establish mechanisms to be able to react to when some of your private capital partners are going to hit their kind of maturity dates of those investments, what to do with those as well as maybe other opportunities in the category where there is private investments in other data center assets? Andrew Power : Thanks, Michael. Maybe I'll kick it off and then Greg can expand upon this. So this topic is not new. I think we have embarked on this journey at least 18 -- or at least a year and a half ago and made great progress, call it accumulating north of $10 billion or call it hyperscale private ventures with numerous parties. You've seen that few places, which we called out in the prepared remarks, we've seen our fee revenue having a step up of a recurring revenue basis in the P&L. Two, you've seen that in the balance sheet. Those private capital initiatives have obviously certainly moved our balance sheet from a defensive posture to an offensive posture and allow us to now pull forward some of these great projects in our land bank that's north of 3 gigawatts of runway of growth for our customers. And maybe I'll ask Greg just to give you a slightest preview of what's next in that evolution when it comes to our private strategic product accounting initiatives. Gregory Wright : Yes. Thanks, Andy. Thanks for the question, Michael. I think the first thing I would say is consistent with as Andy said, we laid out a year ago, January. We're going to continue to bolster and diversify these private capital sources and that's just what we're doing. And as he said, we did a lot of transactions over the last 18 months. We're continuing to evolve that strategy. And when we have something to report, we will. I think it's important to note that the importance of that capital because if you take a look at the demand profile for the business right now, the hyperscale business in and of itself between now and 2030 is expected to grow almost three times and that includes AI hyperscale and non-AI hyperscale. So look, we think that the strategy that Andy laid out and that we embarked upon was the right strategy, but we're not done yet. And as we said, it's continuing to evolve. And when we have something to report on that front, we'll tell you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Yes, good afternoon. I wonder about kind of the speed at which you can kind of deliver on your new starts that you've commenced recently, supply chain, access to energy, access to heavy equipment, and so forth. Any kind of color there? Andrew Power : Thanks, Jon. So I mean, we are -- if you almost think it was like a continuous conveyor belt of trying to deliver timely product for end customers' needs, that's certainly playing out in our enterprise colocation markets model. And now apply more than ever on the larger capacity blocks. This quarter and -- this quarter the book to sign a commencement was elongated out to about 20-ish months. That was based on one particular customer that we serviced and they had a very locational sensitive need than a radius restriction. And the only thing where we had in that radius was the land state. Luckily, it was on a cadence where we own the land and we were ready to get moving on. So that obviously elongated to be called delivery timeline for that particular signing. We excluded that, where we were basically call signing commencing like 4.5 type months. So we're continuously obviously delivering capacity and adding new capacity, whether it's from land to sell active suites and making sure we're maintaining our production slots and vendor relationships from that time of delivery in our 50 plus metros around the world. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan Petersen : Okay. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk about some of the larger greater than 1 megawatt lease expirations that are coming up in the coming quarters. How many of those have fixed renewal options and how much can be mark-to-market rents? And if I can sneak in a follow-up question, I think there is a $168 million impairment in the income statement. Just curious what that is really into. Matthew Mercier : Yes. Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So in terms of lease expirations, so what I'd say is less than half of our or greater than 1 megawatt leases have options with total fixed increases on them. But I would call that significantly less than that are typically renewed pursuant to those options. And that's generally for a few reasons. One, our customers must provide us notice of renewal within the proper period and that doesn't always happen to -- renewals must come in essence without any changes. So if there's any additional space, term, anything changes that opens up the contract. I think as we've talked about in the past and third, some of those customers also end up churning. So that all gives us an ability to be able to bring those contracts to market for the majority of what ends up rolling within a given period. On your second point on impairment, yes, we did have -- we did have impairment associated with a few of our non-core assets, which are part of our disposition plans and those are all located in the secondary market. We -- and I'd also put that in context to the fact that we've generated, call it, close to I think over $1.3 billion of gains from the capital recycling efforts that we've done over the last year. Operator : Your next question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ari Klein : Thank you. I guess, just the comments on the pipeline coming off two very strong quarters of leasing and with the development pipeline, 66% leased, including 80% in the Americas. How should we expect CapEx to trend from here? And then what's your appetite to add new domestic markets given what seems like a broadening of demand? Andrew Power : Hi, thanks, Ari. Why don't I first let Colin just speak to the pipeline overall and then we can kind of talk about a little bit development side of that as well as new markets? Colin McLean : Yes. Thanks, Ari. I appreciate the question. Andy highlighted strong performance over 1-megawatt -- pipeline overall for 1-megawatt trends to -- is trending positively below 1 megawatt, which we deem as important as heading in the right direction as well, record pipeline driven from digital transformation, cloud, and AI. And you saw that trending positively in our results, both directly and indirectly. Indirect execution has picked up the last quarter and we're now 23% of our pipeline being indirect, which we think is a positive sign on value proposition there. One of the things that Andy highlighted is the key value of metros. With the demand cycle, we're seeing enterprises and hyperscalers like zero value of proximity and the metro play that we have in key metros across the globe being particularly important. Finally, the ability both for enterprise and hyperscalers to grow in scale and capacity is of keen value really across the spectrum of low and above 1 megawatt. Andrew Power : Then Ari, on the second part of your question, I would say, we remain very focused on our core markets, north of 50 of them around the world, nearly 30 countries on six continents. Those markets we continuously see robust and diverse customer demand. I'm talking cloud commute from the numerous CSPs, enterprise, hybrid, IT, and service providers in markets where we see really long-term barriers. And to be speaking to our actions on those, a sizable piece of our activation in shells moving from our 3-plus gigawatt land bank into shells and ultimately to be delivered in suites is all in those same core markets. Operator : The next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hi guys. Thanks a lot. So I guess, two, if I could. Andy, I guess last quarter you talked about how 50% of these record bookings were -- or roughly 50% were AI-related. It obviously stepped down sequentially. But to your point about the lengthening of the delivery period, it seems like there is still some very large customers in what was the new leasing number this quarter. Could you kind of revisit on an apples-on-apples basis, how 2Q unfolded versus 1Q from an AI versus non-AI type of new leasing pattern? And how do we think about this? Is there going to be a seasonality to this sort of thing? That would be kind of my first question. And then the second question is, I was just going back to 2019, you guys generated $6.65 of core FFO, which is kind of what you're guiding to for 2024. And I know that you've laid out a hope that there will be growth -- more meaningful growth in the forward-looking periods. Also, you said that your balance sheet is now less in a defensive and more in an offensive position. And historically, when you've been offensive, it's meant dilution to secure future growth opportunities. So I was wondering if you could kind of, Andy, revisit the bull case for growth to take all these great things that are happening with the top line and turn them into bottom line growth? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Dave. So obviously posted apples-to-apples from a 50% contribution last quarter to this quarter is probably closer a quarter of our science. We would say, we really pin on AI use cases. But I would caveat that in a few ways. One, that's in a quarter that's not our record quarter, but I think the top four quarter overall signings, great contribution of both 0 to 1 and plus 1 megawatt, as well as a near record in interconnection signings. And that means we're still winning with the traditional demand drivers of digital transformation, cloud computing, and the like, that though that demand is not nearly exhausted shelf or played out. I would also say that there was certainly a deal that I didn't count in the category of AI that is certainly pushing the envelope on power density and post-ink drawing, already thinking about evolving that capacity block or signed with them in towards what will ultimately be supporting AI down the road is my guess, which I think speaks to the modularity of design and how we're able to scale infrastructure to the demands of our customers as they needed. The second part of your question, let -- first off, I don't want to confuse the word offense with M&A. I think we've not done any real M&A or external growth for several years now. You can maybe save the resolution of the Cyxtera relationship, but that was I think making lemonade out of lemons more than anything. And when I use the word offense, I mean, that's converting this 3 plus gigawatt land bank, which we've assembled over the years, i.e., we didn't just go buy that yesterday and turning that into a great product for our customers to land and expand in -- at great returns on our investment. And you've been seeing that play out now with our ROIs and development schedule, crescendoing into the double-digits. You've seen that in the pricing power and you've seen our value proposition really resonate in all of our customer segments across our core markets. And lastly, our eye is on the price of accelerating the bottom line. That's where we reoriented our strategy 18 months ago about our value proposition, integrated, innovating, bolstering, diversifying our capital sources. And all those things were about, call it making sure we're driving per share -- FFO per share growth that's accelerating and it's going to be continuously compounding for years to come. So there is been no divergence in that conviction of what comes next for the rest of 2024 and what we've said about 2025, next year. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions. So Andy, could you maybe comment on what type of market rent growth you're seeing right now in some of your key metros on an apples-to-apples basis relative to last year and whether that continues to evolve as this year has progressed? And then as you look out into the future, do you see an opportunity for market rent growth to continue to outstrip your development costs and we can see the kind of 10% to 12% development yields you have in your pipeline move even higher? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Eric. I mean, I would outcast that market rent growth is continuing to move in our favor. You've seen two elements happening, the most precious capacity blocks in the key markets like in Northern Virginia continue to set new records in terms of rates. And you've also seen a catch-up phenomenon where other markets in North America or outside of the U.S. are catching up a fair bit in terms of their trajectory of growth. Listen, I look at this, you've got these waves of demand being cloud computing and digital transformation, hybrid IT, and now AI that are just getting going in some of these. They're large and dynamic and it's happening in a supply constraint backdrop from numerous avenues of supply constraint. And those elements are ultimately resulting in the increases in rate that we've been able to execute on for several quarters and I believe will be three quarters in common. And I also believe they will likely outstrip the -- whatever inflationary cost we see in terms of build costs and at least maintain these ROIs, if not continue to notch it up slightly higher. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Schneider : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. On the topic of power constraints and supply environment you see relative to transmission. With the time horizon, let's say, 12 to 18 months, do you think the outlook for power availability is getting more constrained, less constrained, or staying about the same relative to new projects you have either under development or contemplating? Andrew Power : Jim, I think that there is a few phenomenons happening. One, we're getting closer, I mean, some of these constraints popped up now a years in a rearview mirror. And we're obviously inching our way close to destinations of resolutions, be it in Northern Virginia, which I think 2026 is supposedly above or within like in Santa Clara and there is other non-U.S. markets as well. At the same time as we approach the power constraints, there is obviously a good potential that the delivery dates may not deliver on time. These are multifaceted projects that require easement, substations, construction projects. At the same time, the demand didn't standstill while the power was constrained. The second phenomenon I think they're seeing is -- this is becoming a more pervasive topic. It was very focused on one cloud center of the universe market with Northern Virginia and we're hearing more and more about other markets. And lastly, I wouldn't pin it just on power. Yes, the power has got broader generation issues in the economy that we're trying to green. It's got transmission issues that navigate municipalities and substation deliveries and transmission lines cutting through the backyards of folks that rather not have them there. But there are also other elements of sustainability concerns, moratoriums in certain parts of the world. And so I think that this is a multifaceted supply constraint, which I would also mention that even if it does get fixed, has a propensity that could -- history could repeat itself here. So I think this is going to make our value proposition with what we deliver to our customers even more compelling and valuable at the end of the day. Operator : The next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Hi, good afternoon or evening. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just a bigger picture, you've talked about leasing spreads in greater than 1 megawatt improving over time given the differential of what's expiring versus, I guess, market, but you also referenced market rent growth improving quite a bit. So with that and just some recent comments from hyperscalers, just talking about the risk of oversupply or just too much CapEx. Can you sort of just frame the near-term opportunity set in the greater than 1 megawatt from -- maybe bookings, but more so pricing standpoint versus the puts and takes over time just from a demand-supply? I'm just wondering, is there a risk that you see the spreads theoretically improve, but there is a lot of supply coming down the pipe? Andrew Power : I'll take the -- mainly the second -- first and second part of your question, I'll ask Matt to comment on our outlook on leasing spreads and really kind of talk about the stairstep in our exploration schedule, which does -- call it, become even more attractive in its coming years. But I think from -- the heart of your second question is the broader AI theme question you're hearing more on -- in the mainstream media over AI overdone, this is a bubble, what could come next? I think some of that is not unnecessarily 100% germane to what we're seeing. And the reason I say that is in our business, when it comes to AI, we are signing long-term contracts, I'm talking 15 years with some of the largest, most established technology companies ever. Two, and I mentioned before, we're doing that, we're not chasing this out to unproven territories. We're focused on core markets with robust and diverse customer demand where traditional use cases, be it cloud commuting from numerous CSPs, enterprise, hybrid IT, and service provider demand are continuing to grow over time, and even if the AI has peaks and valleys. And we're doing it in markets that we believe are real term -- real long-term supply constraints. And lastly, all this is happening probably in the most supply-constrained moment in the last 20 years of data centers. So I don't -- I'm not sure or convinced that even if AI takes a breather on its long-term innovation trajectory. I think that volatility -- we are somewhat insulated in our sector from that volatility based on how we're pursuing it. But Matt, why don't you hit on the question? Matthew Mercier : Sure. So what I look, what I call it is -- if you look at the greater than 1-megawatt leases that are expiring, call it the next 18 months, the rate -- average rate on that in the 140 to 145 area. But then it steps down pretty gradually to as low as 111 by the time you get to 2029. So I think you're going to see a continued positive trajectory on our leasing spreads, not only in the greater than 1-megawatt category, but I think also across all the categories. So I think you'd also recall within our 0 to 1 spreads have been positive. I think throughout our history, those are typically more regular steady inflationary type increases or better. So I think this puts us in a -- I think in a good position considering where market rates are, where some of the supply constraints are to where we'll see market rates now continue to remain positive and grow and continue to accrue benefits to our releasing spreads as we go through time. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. So in talking before, you mentioned you're prioritizing retail Colo over hyperscale. How should we think about that practically and kind of track that? Is that part of the reason the sub of megawatt bookings have remained a little bit elevated? How should we think about that trend going forward? Andrew Power : Colin, why don't you -- I think that's a great question because we are obviously spending a lot of time on the bigger deals right now. But Colin, why don't you walk-through on the highlights of the quarter? Colin McLean : Sure. Frank, thanks for the question. I'm not sure I'd use the word prioritize. We definitely want to emphasize a full platform to have an offering set. So as highlighted in Andy's opening remarks, performance in Q2 was particularly strong 0 to 1, fourth consecutive quarter over $50 million, which I think was -- which is in also the third highest ever from 0 to 1. We think this consistency is really driven from our ability to serve the full spectrum of requirements for our enterprisers and service providers across the Global 5000 focus of customer set. New logos are also pretty strong as well, most solid ever in terms of 148% with 40% of that coming from the indirect side. Channel also which I highlighted earlier was a particularly strong point with over 20% booking contribution from the indirect side overall. So we view this segment as continuing on our value proposition out to our client set. And a lot of the drivers Andy talked about around digital transformation, cloud, and AI are also playing out in 0-1 segment across enterprises and service providers. And Andy highlighted a couple of those key wins on opening remarks, namely Fortune 5,000 clients, excuse me, offering their virtual desktop requirements and the global manufacturing win we had on the enterprise side. I also want to highlight the particular highlight of the Microsoft ExpressRoute launch into Dallas, which we feel like is a presumably strong representation of our platform. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Great. Thanks for taking the questions guys. Andy, in the past, you've talked about CapEx being an accordion that you expand and contract to the end of solving for consistent bottom line growth. So as I'm thinking about it, given the leasing success that you've had over the last two quarters and also as part of that like the market opportunity in both hyperscale and enterprise. Is now the time to be expanding that Accordion and really hitting the gap on CapEx? And if so, I just want to be clear, what is the explicit FFO per share that you can grow -- that you guys are solving for as part of that algorithm? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Michael. So the -- just to clarify, I would say, CapEx is the core and I think it's how we funded, which I think the same concept you're outlining in your question. The CapEx intensity is being pulled forward, right? We talked about this of greenlining more shell capacity, ultimately suites in a super highly leased -- pre-leased development pipeline at very attractive returns. So we're seeing the CapEx intensity increase. We're intersecting at great rates, great returns for our business for good -- and supporting great customers in numerous markets. And we've now positioned ourselves in a balance sheet position of greater strength, not only just from our leverage standpoint but from our liquidity and our diverse sources of capital. And what we're trying to do is essentially use the levers of using our public capital and our private capital to get back to, call it mid-single digits, call it floor to our growth next year and then it's further acceleration on top of that. And do that in a consistent year -- method of compounding that growth for numerous years to come. So it's really those levers of using public and private capital to drive that bottom line to new levels and on a consistent framework. Operator : The next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead. David Guarino : Thanks. I appreciate the industry statistics you guys included in your investor presentation. And I wanted to ask specifically about the declining global vacancy you highlighted, which it's around 6%. But when I look at your stabilized portfolio, the vacancy level is about three times higher than that. So I guess, first, why is it so much higher? And then second, given the record demand we're seeing across the industry, how long do you think it's going to take before digital's portfolio resembles more like the industry is? Andrew Power : I think Dave - you got to remember that our portfolio is not all -- just call it hyperscale. And the hyperscale portion of this business can literally be 100% leased in many buildings or markets, right? And my gut is that chart, which I think data center walk, which they're doing the best they can, is very much about more of a hyperscale lens. I was actually pretty pleased on the occupancy front. We're up 100 basis points in the same-store occupancy quarter-over-quarter and we have a big same-store pool. It's not mountain. We're also actively taking it one step backwards sometimes on occupancy to take two, three, four steps forward when vacant -- when suites come back and scale and we convert those to Colo and really support our customers' Colo growth as well. So this was the year we said that with occupancy, we're going to be moving the needle and we have been moving the needle. We got more to do in that arena. So I think we'll be seeing -- see it move up. And if you look at, you can also look to get a number of apples-to-apples. If you look at their occupancy, we show by markets. There are certain markets of way less than 60% vacancy that are just very much heavily weighted towards our hyperscale business. They just have a much, much smaller a footprint like Northern Virginia, where if you parse through it, especially on a megawatt basis. I wish, I had that type of vacancy to sell right now and we just don't. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me on. I had two follow-ups. First, on the Colo side, so you cited the record new logo is 148 this quarter. I'm just wondering from a macro perspective, any change in terms of macro impacts across different customer sizes within that sub 1 megawatt base? And then secondly, you talked about leverage getting back under 5.5 turns, the prospect of improving bottom line growth from next year. How do you think about the dividend and the potential for forward growth in the dividend relative to some potential incremental investments in the business? Thanks. Andrew Power : Matt, why don't you hit the dividend question first and Colin, and I can hit a little bit on what we're seeing in the enterprise demand piece of the puzzle? Matthew Mercier : Yes, sure. So thanks, Matt. So in terms of the dividend, look I think it's back to kind of what we've said historically. I think we've got a unique opportunity here to take advantage of what we see as a tremendous growth opportunity throughout our global portfolio and one of the easiest and cheapest forms of capital within that is internally generated funds. And so we continue to look to try to maximize our cash flow as part of our funding strategy on that front. And on top of that, we're also -- I think as we've also mentioned throughout this call, we're keenly focused on growing the bottom line and accelerating that growth in outer years. So as we grow the bottom line, which is going to benefit and accrue benefits to not only core FFO but then on to AFFO, we then look to keep our dividend growth in line with that bottom line per share growth as well. Colin McLean : Great. On the new logo question, a couple of trends just maybe to highlight in that question. So first, we really believe it's in the hybrid world. So we're seeing that continued trend in the new logo base, hybrid work, cloud, data that our new logo requirements really are served well across our global platform. Number two is the mix of that 148 was very much split between commercial and Global 5000 accounts. So we're seeing continued interest in the platform across the larger customers who buy with more frequency in the smaller area of the spectrum. Not sure that we can necessarily point to a growing density in that particular base of clients yet or capacity. But I can tell you this particular base of clients sees real value, as I mentioned in our global platform, which really serves well across their requirements. Andrew Power : And just one, Chris, why don't you just chime in on the early reads on the HD Colo 2.0, with some of the -- I would say an uptick in the enterprise segment? Christopher Sharp : No, so I think I agree with you, Andy, on the macro trend of what we're doing with HD Colo is just really aligning the right capability to cool some of these higher-power density requirements coming into the market. And so we see a lot of the capabilities that we brought in across the 170 facilities. We can execute these higher-density solutions in 12 weeks or less. And I think what's interesting about that is the capacity blocks are getting larger, but like the capabilities that customers are trying to bring to market are definitely challenging for a lot of your traditional Colo offerings where we've really started to see that come to market about six to seven months ago. And so we've been able to pre-procure a lot of these capabilities to get ahead of that challenge. But just kind of current rack densities in the market today are 6 to 8 kilowatts. And I think one of the things I think you're really hitting on is like what are some of these new requirements coming in. And so healthcare, we're seeing 10 kilowatts of rack. I mean, gaming, we're seeing 15 kilowatts of rack this last quarter. And then some of the AI software capabilities, 40 kilowatts. But at the end of the day, we can meet a customer requirement of 150 kilowatts. So we have a lot of runway with that. And to put a little context to it, in the most recent state-of-the-art NVIDIA GB200, we can support that requirement in an under 12-week fashion with our current HD Colo offering. So definitely seeing a lot of growth in that market. Operator : Your next question comes from Anthony Hau with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Anthony Hau : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed that the weighted average commencement period for new leases are 20 months away. I'm assuming most of these leases are probably for 2026 deliveries, but are customers looking to sign leases for 2027? If they are, what type of customers are looking to pick up space thus far out? Andrew Power : Thanks. So I mean customers are -- especially when it comes to larger capacity blocks, they're really trying to future proof and that's where our 3 gigawatts of growth comes in handy. So they certainly -- the nearest-term deliveries are precious, but I think in the years ahead. Now that particular example, as I mentioned, the 20 months was elongated because that customer -- one particular customer had very much their eyesight on a particular market and then various restrictions about where they could grow and where we can support that growth, we are literally their capacity. So that we were able to do deliver as fast as we could, but it certainly elongated. Look, excluding that one outlier, we're close to 4.5 months. And I think you'll -- I wouldn't count on those outliers consistently popping up, they'll be more sporadic. Operator : The next question comes from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Brandon Nispel : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Question for Matt. Can you talk about not updating the guidance at all? Maybe there is some moving pieces from FX and the recent acquisition that you call out. Just as I was looking at it, if you look at the first half of the year and annualize it, revenue really need to accelerate while adjusted EBITDA would need to be backwards, actually to hit the midpoint of your guide. So I guess, the question is, is the EBITDA FFO guidance is conservative? Are there some uncertainty in terms of timing of commencements, unusual expenses? Hoping you could just unpack that for us. Thanks. Matthew Mercier : Sure. I don't -- look there's a -- I would, again, I'd probably focus kind of on the bottom line. If you look at -- if you look at where we are halfway through the year, we're a little less than halfway through the midpoint of our core FFO guidance. And we talked about -- we expected this quarter would be -- would have a little bit of pressure because of the capital recycling efforts that where we've concluded with closing CH2 and having the related income from that come out this quarter. And so look what we're going to see is in the second half, growth we're expecting to improve and accelerate as the backlog of deals and signings come online. And as we expect -- as we haven't changed the guidance, we've obviously given a wide range. But if you look at -- I think where we are this year and the expectations for accelerating in the back half, which I think will set us up very nicely for 2025. We feel pretty good about the midpoint of guidance and being able to achieve that. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd like to now turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power, for closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead. Andrew Power : Thank you. Digital Realty posted another strong quarter in 2Q with record leasing in the first half, demonstrating how Digital Realty is positioned to support the elevated level of demand we continue to see for data center infrastructure. Fundamental strength continued through the second quarter with robust leasing volume, healthy pricing, and record commencements poised to drive an acceleration in bottom line growth. We continue to innovate and integrate with the rollout of HD Colo 2.0 and the addition of new cloud on-ramps to PlatformDIGITAL in the quarter. Then we have repositioned the balance sheet by recycling capital out of stabilized assets, diversifying our capital sources, and reducing our leverage. All of this was done with an eye towards improving our growth profile while supporting our customers' growing needs. We are excited about this quarter's results and remain optimistic about the outlook for data center demand and our position in the market. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today and would like to thank our dedicated and exceptional team at Digital Realty, who keep the digital world turning. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

During today\u2019s presentation, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jordan Sadler, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of Public and Private Investor Relations. Jordan, please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to Digital Realty's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are President and CEO, Andy Power; and CFO, Matt Mercier; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Colin McLean are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. Management will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions on today's call. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me offer a few key takeaways from our third quarter. First, new leasing volume of $521 million at our share, shattered our prior record and even our own expectations for the realm of possibility in a quarter. In fact, 3Q leasing was more than a full year's growth by previous standards as activity in the quarter exceeded the leasing completed in all of 2023, pushing our backlog of signed, but not commenced leases up to nearly $860 million. While greater than 1 megawatt leasing was the primary driver over 0 megawatt to 1 megawatt plus interconnection segment also posted record bookings in the quarter. Second, strong fundamentals translated into improved pricing for data center capacity, and this was evident across both new and renewed leases with record rates on new greater than 1 megawatt leases, 4% escalators on the majority of new leases and a record 15% uplift in cash renewal spreads in the quarter. And third, our development pipeline increased by nearly 50% sequentially to 644 megawatts under construction and is now 74% pre-leased at a 12% average expected yield as a result of successful leasing of shell and land capacity in North America. These results continue to move Digital Realty closer to management's objective to improve longer-term sustainable growth. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Andy Power. Andrew Power : Thanks, Jordan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. I don't often start this way, but this quarter was certainly one for the record books. As Jordan noted, we posted record results across a broad array of metrics. These results are the product of Digital Realty's team capitalizing on a favorable demand backdrop, but are also a testament to our efforts to enhance our value proposition and to drive long-term sustainable growth. Demand for data center capacity remains strong, both for larger capacity blocks in our core markets and to support continued growth in both cloud and digital transformation. We are well positioned to take advantage of this favorable environment, given our full spectrum strategy, our global footprint across six continents and a robust land bank that can support 3 plus gigawatts of incremental development, together with an investment grade balance sheet that is complemented by a diverse group of capital partners and the expertise to put it all together and operate these facilities on behalf of the world's leading technology companies and enterprises. Highlights for the third quarter were abundant and include $521 million of new leases signed at Digital Realty share, more than double our prior record in the first quarter of this year. Greater than 1 megawatt bookings in North America led the way, driven by large hyperscale deals in Manassas, Ashburn and Chicago. New leasing volume in this segment was up more than 75% from the 1Q record, while pricing moved up nearly 30%. Included in our greater than 1 megawatt signings was a large lease in our hyperscale development venture in Manassas. Like, all of our JVs, we report these leasing results at our share or 20% in this case. The total leasing into our facilities at 100% share was in excess of $700 million in the third quarter, demonstrating the significant appetite for data center capacity. Given the size of those numbers, it might be easy to overlook a very strategic and important milestone with a sizable record quarter in our 0-1 plus interconnection business, which saw more than $66 million of new bookings, topping our prior record in this product category by over 20%, with particular strength in small deals under 0.5 megawatt, which accounted for 80% of our 0-1 megawatt leasing. Not to be forgotten, new interconnection bookings also hit a record in the quarter. We view these bookings very favorably as it further validates our full spectrum product strategy and provides us with growing momentum in a segment with durable pricing power and steadily increasing customer demand. Our strength in this category was also characterized by a record 149 new logos for the quarter. PlatformDIGITAL offers our customers the convenience and simplicity to manage their global data center needs and is reflected by record export activity in the third quarter, which were 50% plus higher year-over-year with Americas to EMEA exports leading the way, followed by APAC into the Americas. With a record $859 million backlog of favorably priced leases, largely commencing over the next two years, we are positioned for accelerating top line and bottom line growth. In support of our customers' growing requirements, and all of the new leasing accomplished in the quarter, we also substantially scaled our development pipeline in the third quarter, increasing the capacity underway by almost 50% to 644 megawatts under construction today. And we maintained another 3 gigawatts of buildable IT load capacity in land and shell condition. As we noted last quarter, we also strengthened our value proposition in Europe with the acquisition of a densely connected enterprise data center campus in Slough. During the quarter, we also continued to bolster our balance sheet and diversify our capital sources through a combination of favorable debt and ATM issuances. Matt will provide more details on these activities in a few minutes. Over the past few weeks, we've seen several examples of the lengths that some hyperscalers will go to reserve enough power for their fast growing compute requirements. We've seen a deal to reactivate 3 mile Island, another hyperscaler partnering with an existing utility to develop small modular reactors and the third executing power purchase agreements to purchase nuclear energy for multiple SMRs that have yet to be built. These agreements are similar, in that they are seeking long-term carbon-free energy solutions to help power growing data center portfolios and speak to the longer-term demand outlook for data center capacity. Yet each of these plants is still years away from beginning to generate power, underscoring the value of lower capacity blocks today and perhaps for the next several years. And sourcing available power is just one piece of the data center infrastructure puzzle. Supply chain management, construction management and operating expertise are all challenges that customers rely on Digital Realty to solve, and they are clearly a critical aspect of the overall value proposition that we bring to the table. While the large hyperscale deals get plenty of focus, customers and partners are recognizing the value that Digital Realty's meeting place can bring to their private cloud and hybrid IT applications around the world. We continue to see a meaningful share of our 0-1 megawatt wins influenced by our partners, expanding our reach into more enterprises around the world. Our wins this quarter include a Global 2000 telecom provider who partners with one of our largest customers choosing PlatformDIGITAL to deploy a distributed cloud solution to alleviate geographic data gravity challenges. A leading health care provider and a new logo for Digital Realty, which also came to us from a partner, modernizing its infrastructure to take advantage of the cloud connectivity available on PlatformDIGITAL, while maintaining data compliance for personal health information privacy. Another new logo, an international financial institution critical to global financial and monetary policy, chose PlatformDIGITAL to secure their cloud requirements while maintaining global access. A Global 2000 technology company is expanding their presence on PlatformDIGITAL in support of its autonomous driving solution. A top 20 Japanese electronics and semiconductor manufacturer is joining PlatformDIGITAL through another partner as part of an integrated tech-refresh initiative where robust connectivity was a critical differentiator. And a global cloud optimization provider is deploying additional capacity on PlatformDIGITAL across two continents to support their expanding enterprise customer base, who require access to rich and scalable connectivity solutions. Before turning it over to Matt, I'd like to touch on our global ESG progress during the third quarter. We continue to lead the industry in green building IT capacity, the 178 megawatts certified in the last 12 months, while our Swiss team achieved the first ever Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association Gold Plus certification for our data centers in Zurich. Digital Realty also continued to be recognized for ESG leadership, including Broad Group's Datacloud Global works 2024 for AI data center on the year, The Tech Capitals, Digital Infrastructure Action Global Award 2024 and Frost & Sullivan recognized our Japanese joint venture, MC Digital Realty with the 2024 Japan Data Center Services Company of the Year Award. Moving to Green Finance, where Digital continues to be a leader in the data center industry. During the quarter, we issued EUR850 million green bond, adding to Digital's long history of support for linking its debt to sustainable projects. Additionally, we maintained a sustainability linked pricing component on our new credit facility, further demonstrating the company's commitment to ESG. We remain committed to minimizing Digital Realty's impact on the environment, while delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO, Matt Mercier. Matthew Mercier : Thank you, Andy. Let me jump right into our third quarter results. We signed $521 million of new leases in the third quarter, of which $450 million fell into the greater than 1 megawatt category and was heavily weighted toward the Americas. We also signed $50 million of 0-1 megawatt leases and $16 million of interconnection bookings. Each of these figures were new records for Digital Realty. Importantly, more than 75% of the dollar volume of leases signed include annual rent escalators of 4% or greater, which bolsters the growth profile associated with our portfolio of long-term hyperscale leases. Our backlog at Digital Realty share increased by more than 60% sequentially to $859 million at the end of September, as new leasing dramatically outpaced $180 million of record commencements in the quarter. To offer some perspective, the backlog now represents 20% of this quarter's annualized data center revenues and we expect more than 85% of these leases to commence by the end of 2026. Looking ahead a $100 million of the backlog is scheduled to commence by the end of this year, with another $350 million scheduled to commence next year, and over $300 million already slated to commence in 2026, setting us up for accelerating multiyear growth. During the third quarter, we signed $258 million of renewal leases at a 15.2% increase on a cash basis, driving year-to-date cash renewal spreads to 10.5%. Similar to the first quarter, these robust releasing spreads were driven by a package deal that pulled forward a sizable renewal that was not scheduled to expire for several more years. Excluding this package deal, overall renewal spreads were still a healthy 5.8%, which is more consistent with the 5% to 7% guidance we previously provided for 2024. While the package deals demonstrate the levers available to capitalize on the current pricing environment and also reflect our customers' views of the overall market, they are less predictable in nature. Breaking down renewals by product category, cash renewal spreads in the 0-1 megawatt segment were up a healthy 4.5% in the third quarter, while releasing spreads in the greater than 1 megawatt segment were up by over 30%. Excluding the package deal greater than 1 megawatt renewals were still up 8.6%. For the quarter, churn remained low and well controlled at 1.5%. In terms of earnings, we reported third quarter core FFO of $1.67 per share, reflecting continued healthy growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Data center revenue grew by 7.5% year-over-year as the combination of improved renewal spreads, rent escalators and year-to-date commencements more than offset the drag associated with \u2013 the more than $2.5 billion of capital recycling activity since the middle of 2023. Pro forma for the transaction activity data center revenues were up 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 11% year-over-year, principally due to a near 200 basis point improvement in margin from the flow-through of higher data center and interconnection revenues with improved pricing. Same capital NOI growth increased by 0.8% year-over-year in the third quarter, as 2.5% growth in data center revenue was offset by higher property operating costs and roughly 200 basis points of bad debt reserves in the quarter. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI has increased by 2.6%, which continues to be negatively impacted by about 200 basis points of power margin headwinds year-over-year, given the elevated utility prices in EMEA in 2023. Moving on to our investment activity. We spent $651 million on consolidated development in the third quarter. Gross development spend at 100% share was $855 million in the quarter. Given the strong demand for data center capacity, we doubled our development underway in the Americas and added more projects in EMEA for an almost 50% increase in our pipeline, ending the quarter with 644 megawatts under construction. More specifically, we delivered just 36 megawatts of new capacity in the quarter, while we backfilled the pipeline with another 244 megawatts of new starts at 100% share. The overall pipeline is now 74% preleased, up from 66% at the end of 2Q, with an average expected yield of 12%. Almost all the development underway in the Americas is preleased with an expected stabilized yield of 13.6%. Some development capacity remains in both EMEA and APAC, with both currently expecting stabilized yields over 10%. Over the first-nine months of the year, we spent $2.4 billion in development CapEx at 100% share, which has been balanced by nearly $900 million of partner contributions, keeping us on track and well within the range of our original full year spending expectations. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet in the third quarter, with over $800 million of equity raised on the ATM. On the debt side, we paid off $250 million gilts in July and added an EUR850 million green bond in September. We also upsized and extended our credit facilities to $4.5 billion in September. At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $5 billion of total liquidity, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.4 times. Moving on to our debt profile. Our weighted average debt maturity is over four years, and our weighted average interest rate is 2.8%. Approximately 85% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and our FX hedging strategy. Approximately 89% of our net debt is fixed rate and 96% of our debt is unsecured, providing ample flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, we have no remaining debt maturities until early 2025, and the maturities remained well laddered through 2033. Let me conclude with our guidance. We are raising our core FFO guidance range for the full year of 2024 to $6.65 to $6.75 per share, increasing the low end of the range by $0.05 per share and maintaining the high end. The increase in our guide at the midpoint of the range reflects the strength in our year-to-date leasing and commencements and the benefit of stronger than expected renewal pricing, partly balanced by the impact of customer bankruptcies in the second half of this year and balance sheet positioning to capitalize on the robust opportunity we are seeing. We are also adjusting our total revenue guidance to reflect the impact of lower utility expense reimbursements and are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect better than expected leasing volumes and higher pricing. Accordingly, we are also adjusting the following operating assumptions. Reflecting our success on cash renewals to date, we are increasing the full year range to 8% to 10% from 5% to 7%. We are also tightening full year same-store guidance to a range of 2.75% to 3.25%. In terms of investing expectations for 2024, we tightened the range of our net share development spend to $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion and maintained our recurring maintenance CapEx ranges. Lastly, on financing, the EUR850 million bond raise was completed slightly ahead of previous expectations, but was mitigated by higher short-term rates than we anticipated at the beginning of this year. Looking to the fourth quarter, Core FFO per share remains poised to increase as the momentum from strong year-to-date leasing increasingly contributes to bottom line results. Looking out in 2025 and beyond, Digital Realty's growth remains poised to accelerate for 2024 levels as the fundamental environment for data centers remain strong, and our robust backlog commences. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A session? Operator : We will now open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Rollins : Thanks, and good afternoon. When we were together last in September, and you mentioned there could be another record before the end of the year, this was bigger. So congrats to you and the team on this. Maybe the first question with respect to that is, how much of the demand is at a risk of maybe pulling forward what the natural opportunity for Digital Realty is? And for the capacity that's in the pipeline, but not in development today, how much of that is power ready that's ready to sell into the market? Thanks. Andrew Power : And thanks, Mike. Really appreciate it. So going to your question, obviously, a quarter of this magnitude, any one of those sizable deals that slipped the quarter were really change the density of where our fourth quarter looks like. So I won't say there was zero pull forward. But at the same time, we are far from anywhere near selling that. Some of our largest signs during the quarter, selling the capacity blocks that are literally adjacent the most identically sized capacity blocks with nearing power deliveries in the very same markets we highlighted Manassas and Ashburn being one and two, and Chicago being three in terms of our top signings. Those specific markets, going to your second question, they are not ready -- the available capacity in those specific locations that comes next or not necessarily powered today, but those deliveries are approaching rapidly. And we have those in many markets, be it Dallas, Santa Clara in the U.S., EMEA, we have Frankfurt Paris, Amsterdam, Seoul, South Korea, as well as similar in South Africa and South America. And those all aggregate to north of 3 gigawatts of capacity, including Shell capacity that we can activate quickly. So \u2013 and last but not least, we also \u2013 as you saw in some of the release, we\u2019ve not been sitting idle. We\u2019ve made some very attractive additions including a parcel that will be adjacent to our Richardson campus in Dallas, I think approaches 80 megawatts of growth capacity and more to come. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call this as a massive pull forward. Quite frankly, the scaling of demand we\u2019re seeing to take place here, I think, is just overall restrained from numerous factors. Operator : The next question is from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan Petersen : Great. Thanks. Really impressive quarter, good job guys. I wanted to ask, so clearly, given the size of these leases, it seems like we're probably talking about AI use cases and some of the latest GPU technology out there. So maybe can you give us some more color on some of the design changes that are required to meet these power densities? And then also, the rental rates were looked really impressive. But I'm kind of curious if the build cost side of it is also higher on some of the leases that you signed this quarter? Andrew Power : Thanks, Jon. Really a massive team effort from obviously the leadership team on the call with the Florida\u2019s Digital Realty efforts globally to contribute to this type of quarter. Going to the second, then I'll hand it over to Chris and Colin to have an egg, the AI use cases and contributions from AI. Yes. We've seen some inflationary trends and build costs, bringing more higher power densities has been part of our heritage and that requires incremental CapEx spend. But the size of that as a percentage of the build is in the, call it, closer to single-digit percentile increases relative to what you've seen now in the rental rate movements that have well outpaced those inflationary elements. But maybe, Colin, can you just give us a little color on the composition from AI and then Chris can chime in on the -- what we're doing on the tech infrastructure front? Colin McLean : Sure. Thanks, Andy. Yeah, Contribution was significant about 50% of our overall bookings came from AI. The larger tranche capacity, which obviously our heritage comes well supported from, it is a real value in these use cases. These large capacity blocks are in high demand across our core markets. And so clients are certainly looking to take advantage of that. I would also say, it's a growing part of our less than 1 megawatt framework, Chris and team have rolled out a substantial program in HD Colo, which you can probably highlight in just a moment that really fits in the sweet spot of where we're taking our platform on the whole, so Chris? Christopher Sharp : Yeah. No, I appreciate it. And I appreciate the question. This is something that we've been contemplating for many years. So we've seen a lot of the cloud infrastructure densifying, but then as artificial intelligence has come to market, just working on the data center design, and we've talked about this about modularity and the modularity around cooling and being able to maximize the utilization of air, and I think a lot of understand that liquid is coming into play, which is a core component that we've always anticipated and how we can retrofit in an efficient fashion to bring that liquid in to meet this demand on a case-by-case basis. And so I think that's one of the critical elements that we've always watched in the market. I think the other thing is the capacity block. Just the sheer sizes that you just heard Andy walk you through that\u2019s also very aligned to what a lot of the AI use cases are looking for. And I think one of the things we're always watching is how inference comes into play. And part of the data center design is also the interconnectivity of that. And so how we allow those different types of AI environments, be it inference, be it different types of recursive models, where how this advanced solutions are coming to market, that's core to what we've been watching and understanding at a very granular level. And then to Colin's point, I think it's important for us to understand how that gets fitted out within the data center. So we've launched an offering called HD Colo a while back. And I think what's interesting about what we're able to do with HD Colo across 30 markets, 30 metros, 170 facilities within 12 weeks, we're able to build in a capability that takes you to 150 kilowatts a rack. And what\u2019s important about that to put a little context on it, is that supports three NVIDIA H100 systems with them a single rack. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s really \u2013 we\u2019re seeing in a lot of the form factors coming to market. And I think the state of the play today is the latest GB200s from NVIDIA as well. We\u2019re constantly staying aligned to how we can support a lot of that infrastructure coming to market. Operator : The next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Okay, that's a great quarter. But Andy, I guess a couple of questions, if I could. So this quarter was so strong in the wake of a record quarter in 1Q, a far from record quarter in 2Q, it kind of, I think, scrambles people's expectations about how we think about what's the new normal and when we were talking about the first half, we were saying, well, it was a record first half. And the average of the first half was about $200 million in new bookings. And now we got this crazy number in the third quarter. Just could you level set people now that we've kind of run the bell about what is the new normal for this? And then the second question was just related to, I think what we just heard, which was that like the first quarter, record quarter, which was 50% AI bookings, the third quarter, a record quarter is also 50% AI bookings which suggests that we're having record everything else to? And could you speak to what is driving that? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, David. So maybe I'll try to tackle in reverse. I think it's very important what you just highlight there we're estimating based on numerous data points we have in terms of infrastructure, customer references, applications, estimation of AI today, that could be changing down the road. These customers, as you can see from our lease terms starting 10, 15 year contracts, and we have the ability to retrofit our infrastructure along the way. But I think it's important that the core demand fundamentals that preexisted before Gen AI came on the scene are still massive and growing, be it digital transformation for enterprise and hybrid IT and cloud computing. I'm hoping to get a lot more questions on the highlight of $66 million in 0-1 megawatt interconnection. That's up 20% over our prior record nearly 150 new logos this has not just been about just big large capacity blocks. This is what we've been spending many years in making -- and certainly, our execution has been growing and the fall through on that category has been a major contributor and more to come on that front. Going back to your definition of the new normal. A couple of data points that we highlighted two quarters ago that I think are important. First quarter record was based on 10% more megawatts and 60% higher prices. This quarter record is on top of that, 70% more volume, again, on 30% higher prices versus the prior record we just said. So these -- both levers, the volume and the price are contributing to this growth algorithm. When I look at it, I think there's two important other takeaways. We're not going to be able to put up a record quarter like this in Q4, especially in a quarter with so many holidays approaching us. There's no question like that. But if you look at our inventory blocks, we do have a runway to repeat this record down the road. There's no question. I don't think we top ticked for Digital in any regard, that\u2019s one thing. Two, a lot of these signings are really, call it, turning into long-term contracts with great escalations that are going to commence in late 2025 and 2026 and really hopefully translating into long-term sustainable growth that flows from the top line down to the bottom line. That\u2019s another big piece of the composition. And lastly, I try not to focus necessarily on just the fluctuations in the signings. But let\u2019s look at our backlog. After a record commencement quarter \u2013 during the quarter, we\u2019re in a record backlog that represents, call it, 20% of our revenue base today. And that record backlog not necessarily maybe next quarter, but I think that record backlog has a lot of potential to keep growing and derisking our revenue run rate for years to come. Operator : Next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jonathan Atkin : Thank you. So just given the strong backlog and inventory blocks that you've talked about, just wondering, if you could talk about the implications for future CapEx levels given all the demand and delivery ahead as well as balance sheet leverage goals. Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Jon. I'm going to pass it over to Matt to walk you through those elements. Matthew Mercier : Sure. Thanks, Jon. So look, I think in terms of CapEx, we're sitting here today, our CapEx for '24. We narrowed it down. We're still within the range. I think for '25, as we look forward, I mean, we'll obviously give more specific guidance as we get to the fourth quarter, but just considering where we are in terms of the megawatts under construction, I don't suspect that it will be lower than what we're seeing for '24 and again, we'll give more as we look ahead towards guidance at the start of the year. But I think probably somewhat more important and going to your second point, from a balance sheet perspective, we're sitting here today, given all the things we've done to put the balance sheet back in place where we're already at our leverage targets. We've got $5 billion of liquidity and ultimately, we've -- I think we've got ahead of, and we've -- our plan, we prudently funded, I think, 325 with a view that we'll be able to stay within those leverage targets as well. Operator : The next question is from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Richard Choe : Hi. I wanted to follow up on these large package deals. You've done two of them now. How many more are out there that can be done? And is that driving the 4% escalation in the large deals or is 4% kind of something that you're looking at for all deals that are being done? Andrew Power : Thanks, Richard. So taking the escalation first. We have, for some time now been looking to push on all the levers on our business, and it's whether it's rates, returns, duration of contracts. And that was, I think -- I believe we were a leader when CPI (ph) was escalating to kind of bring more CPI clauses into our contracts and our escalations, and especially the larger contracts, even moving up and up for some time now. Obviously, when you have core handful of larger deals, having the higher escalation certainly helps the weighting along the way. And going to your prior question on packaged deals. Listen, this is very episodic. I think the good news is, even if you take off our largest mark-to-markets, we're still at cash mark-to-market like close to about 6%, 7% on the high end of our guidance on the cash mark-to-market. So one specific deal that you referred to done really underlying deals were also great renewals as well. In terms of more, this is again, it\u2019s a product of having a large installed customer base, which you can see from our top customer role, having customers in 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 locations around the world to help them. And in times like today, we\u2019re seeing some customers having real business needs and urgency around their requirements and being able to come a table with a holistic solution to help them that brings kind of these packages to the table. So again, I can\u2019t promise them in any given year or any given quarter, but I think it speaks to breadth of relationships and using all the tools in our toolkit to maximize our growth formula. Operator : The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Eric Luebchow : Great. Appreciate you taking the question. So just curious, I know you have about 3 gigawatts of land in Shell that haven't been developed yet. But given the size and the speed of the deals that you're leasing up now, how are you thinking about maintaining that runway either from new land in existing markets, potentially new markets, where you could extend your reach even further? And then separately, you touched on it a little bit on Northern Virginia. I think we've seen some reports here as long as a seven year wait time for power in parts of that footprint. I think you said, you still have some capacity blocks in Manassas and in Ashburn. So maybe just an update on power delivery within your footprint would be helpful. Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Eric. I'll take the second part first and then hand it over to Greg to speak to what he's been spending a lot of time on this year. In Northern Virginia, I highlighted those are two major -- those markets were two of our largest capacity signings went into and in those markets, we have adjacent buildings literally identical sizes. So almost 100-megawatt IT load in both our Digital Dallas and then a similar one in Manassas. And they're coming on in short order not necessarily call it, early 2025. But one of the two, I think, can be brought into late 2025, potentially certainly 2026. And thereafter, we've got another 230-ish in the next series of buildings, where actually the power will be delivered with more substation and it's really called substation components on our end that will push those deliveries, call it closer to 2027. So that starts tipping away and call it getting when you add that all up closer to, call it, 400 to 450 of Digital Dallas and rounding up 200 megawatts in total of Manassas, which leaves us another 0.5 gigawatt at least at Digital Dallas another couple -- we've got another 100 megawatts not in Digital Dallas, in Northern Virginia. So long runway of growth and I would say, capacity blocks as their deliveries keep getting near and year and time goes by, it just keeps getting more and more precious. Greg, why don't you speak to a little bit of what we've been doing on the -- adding to that on the other end of our supply chain? Gregory Wright : Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Thanks for the question, Eric. Eric, I think the first thing to highlight is Andy's point about our buildable capacity on balance sheet. So, clearly, within existing markets, we have over 3 gigawatts of buildable capacity. So I think when you think about the context of where new growth is going to come from, that's pretty sizable. I think there's probably very few that have that kind of pipeline, that we can bring to service in a relatively short period of time. So look, I guess I would summarize is, we're buying land primarily in our existing markets. buying land, purchasing power and the like, and really across the globe, whether it\u2019s North America, South America, Europe, particularly in the flat markets, Africa, particularly South Africa, Johannesburg and Cape Town and then throughout the major markets in APAC. So, that strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We still think that\u2019s the best risk-adjusted return on our capital. And with that said, we\u2019re selectively looking at new markets, but that will not be the primary driver of our growth on the development front. Operator : The next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Louthan : Great. Thank you. So you've talked to us earlier about looking at some markets where you've seen a lot of data center demand popping up and the long-term visibility is a little bit less clear, and you're kind of avoiding some of those as you're looking at some of these larger deployments. Are you still holding to that? And how should we think about that? And then how are you set up for funding for these developments and thoughts on capital for the next 12 months? Thanks. Andrew Power : Thanks, Frank. So -- and I think this dovetails well with Greg's answer. What we're doing is continuing to focus on markets that we believe a robust and diverse demand. That is, call it, enterprise digital transformation, hybrid IT demand, service provider, data cloud demand as well as various stages of AI demand. We believe that certainly exist and has for some time in our, call it, 50 metropolitan areas where we're operating today, call it, runway in addition to operating capacity growth 3 plus gigawatts. And we are -- I think that dovetail Greg's point, we're expanding into markets where we're operating today, but maybe now at a bigger scale, a bigger presence, i.e., markets we're looking at where we are the major player in the connectivity hubs, or have a strong enterprise hand but a much smaller scale or hyperscale plan and looking at those as adding to our footprint in those markets. What we're not doing, which I think is even more relevant, is chasing demand for demand stake to market that we just don't believe are there for the long term. I'm not suggesting data centers and demand won't be in some of those markets, and there'll be opportunities for one-off builds and contracts with customers. But we've been a company now for just reaching our 20 years as a public company. We've been through cycles before. And we're looking to generate long-term sustainable growth. And within a key element when it comes to that is having a robust and diverse customer demand. So when renewals do come, you can maintain your pricing power and generate that sustainable growth. Operator : The next question is from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thank you for the question and congrats on the strong bookings. You indicated that you were positioned for acceleration multiple times in your prepared remarks. And if I recall correctly, you previously also said that 2025 growth should be somewhere closer to mid-single digits. But is it safe to assume that based on where your commencement schedule looks like today, there is potential for upside versus this growth expectation? And if so, how should we be thinking about your medium growth -- medium-term growth algorithm? Andrew Power : Thanks, Irvin. I'll ask Matt to unpack the 2025 and the financial algorithm from there. Matthew Mercier : Yeah. Thanks, Irvin. I feel like I think I lost the back because I thought for sure the growth question will come before the first 15 minutes. So -- but thanks. So look, I think I think a few things, I've been pretty consistent, I think, all year in terms of our mid-single digit growth for '25 and setting that as a foundation and keep in mind, that's in spite of doing, call it, 1.5 turns of deleveraging over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months. We continue to focus on our objective to improve the company's long-term sustainable growth profile. You've seen that in the results we put up. Some of those things accrue to the bottom line a little faster than the others. Obviously, our renewal spreads in the 0-1 comes in the financials a little bit sooner. The greater than 1 megawatt takes a little bit longer, and you see most of that in terms of our backlog, which is already at $350 million for next year. And I think even more importantly is at $300 million for 2026. So, which if you looked at that same step a year ago, in terms of where that would have been, kind of in a two year forward view. It's $200 million more. So again, this quarter really derisks the plan to achieve the goals that we set out, which provides a solid foundation for accelerating growth, not only in \u201825, but even further beyond that. And I would say we were confident in what we said before about that, and we're even more confident now. Operator : The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Schneider : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you can maybe talk a little bit about the complexion of the bookings in the quarter. And roughly, how many customers kind of contributing to the sort of the 60% or 50% or 80% mark of that, meaning the concentration of customers in that booking. Can you maybe talk to any of the -- whether any of those customers of substantial size were, in fact, new customers in the quarter? Andrew Power : Thanks, Jim. So why don't I ask Colin to kind of walk through some of the highlights. Maybe Colin you can try to break it down to two categories, one by one. Colin McLean : Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jim. Appreciate it. Yeah. Obviously, successful quarter, a lot of impact across the board, both new customers, existing customers and growth. We have about 1,000 customers booked within the platform in Q3. A good chunk of those 149 were new logos. This predominantly came in the commercial segment. We think about the segmentation of customers within global large enterprise in commercial, the large number of new logos come out of that commercial basis, but we're putting more and more focus on large enterprise. So in that $66 million of bookings, we had about 52% of that on a large enterprise, which is an all-time high. So again, that's a growing segment with our business. Again, I think that references to what Andy's talking about the diverse demand that's hitting PlatformDIGITAL across digital transformation, cloud and AI. So we continue to see that characteristics at our pipeline. Current pipeline for Q4 aggregate all-time high, particularly key strong characteristics in the 0-1 megawatt variety. Maybe a little bit more context as to what we're seeing across the platform and just double down on one of the questions that proximity matters. So our core networks in terms of bookings variety 80% plus were in our primary markets, our top 20 markets. So we continue to see strength there, continue to see indirect focus, so about 26% of our bookings were indirect future pipeline, about 30%, so that's going to continue to grow. And frankly, our flexibility to support the various density and scalability requirements for our clients will continue to be a big value proposition for our clients. So this adds up to a pretty robust quarter, very robust in terms of number of customers, new logos and types of customers landing up on the business. Operator : The next question is from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Michael Elias : Hey. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations to whole Digital Realty team on a really exceptional quarter. I want to switch focus and actually talk about the enterprise. The great bookings in the enterprise segment. What I'm curious about is, kind of what changed there from the prior run rate of bookings where you were on? Was it that the enterprise backdrop got better for you guys or was it something that you shifted in terms of your go-to-market? And just as part of that, what are you seeing in terms of the ability to price up enterprise customers, i.e., what are you seeing on the renewal spread side with them? Are we getting past some of that price hike fatigue? Those are my questions. And again, congratulations to you guys. Andrew Power : Thank you, Michael. Before I -- Colin touched a little bit on this in his last question, but before I turn it back to him, going back to your pricing question, and this kind of dovetails what I think maybe Frank asked about spreads and bumps. I mean, we've been looking at, call it, making sure we have a strong value proposition for our customers. This has been many years in the work and building momentum, and you've seen the success grow. And certainly, this is a milestone quarter. But I don't -- definitely, this will not be a record in that category. We're going to build on that record, that is an incredibly important strategic priority to this company, given the long-term value it provided to customers and the growth it provides. If you look in the 0-1 megawatt signings category, we've been flat based on the cash mark-to-markets. They\u2019re up, call it, 4.5% on an LTM basis. I think they're up about 70 basis points just quarter-over-quarter. You can see that the asking rates as well. I think we'll have more -- we have more opportunity to go on the interconnection side in terms of continuing to make sure our value we bring to the customers is appropriately commercialized. And that's even with a record interconnection signing in this quarter. So -- we're looking at all levers. And again, it's about giving more value to the customer. It's about their infrastructure and their power densities. It is about helping them connect it all pain points. It's about being their one-stop global shop from no matter what side of the deployment of workflow be it, enterprise hybrid IT, cloud or certainly AI, which is starting to percolate in that category. Colin deserves a tremendous amount of credit as well. And -- but I'll turn it over to him to kind of walk through what his insights on the inflection this quarter as well. Colin McLean : Yeah. Thanks, Andy. I appreciate it. I think one point to make is this is not one quarter in the making. This is a multiyear transformation, a platform oriented company servicing service providers and enterprises. And the way that you do that is you make your platform more attractive. So we announced a couple of [indiscernible] this quarter. One in Dallas. We did a couple in Europe, in Zurich and Amsterdam, that's material in attracting enterprises. Andy mentioned that the digital transformation is now in full steam, but we still think it's early innings. So we think that our platform will continue to grow because enterprises see value in PlatformDIGITAL. One key metric that I'll leave you with, that's a really good sign of a platform-oriented approach of our exports were a record 43% 0-1 megawatt. That's material that shows customers sustain value, but they're expanding across the platform into other geos. So again, strong contribution across the board for the team to bring this to fruition. Operator : The next question is from Georgi Dinkov with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Georgi Dinkov : Hey. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. So I just noticed the development yields are now 12%, which is higher compared to the second quarter. And given the strong market rent growth, can we see development yields move even higher? And is there a cap on how high they can go? And also, can you just provide more color on what the contracts on the development pipeline look like in terms of land and caps on the renewals? Thank you. Andrew Power : Thanks, Georgi. So again, this goes back to the accelerated development CapEx sizably 50% higher. And we did that based on demand. So you could see, overall, we're close to north of 75% preleased. In North America, now 97% preleased. Some of the signings in North America, in particular, actually, I've called on the longer end of our sign commencing trail. So they were resigning capacity that the Shell is just getting delivered. Last quarter, we signed nearly 50-ish megawatt deal in the land state. So they're close to two years, so they elongated. So that means we didn't sell just the nearest term capacity blocks we sold at what the customer needed given the facts and circumstances. We're doing everything we can to maintain, if not improve our yields. That's a product of making sure we're scaling our infrastructure and economies of scale and where we deliver and obviously, seizing upon the right rates and translating to better returns as products in that development life cycle of to roll up. In today's market, we're looking to have, again, all the levers of the commercials in the discussion, rates, escalations, real estate, tax base tops and certainly, renewal options, we\u2019re not entertaining called capping when those contracts come to. Operator : The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Niknam : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the question. I will keep it to one question, and I know that was specified upfront. On the AI front, I know you mentioned there was about half of your bookings. Is there any contribution from enterprise or sovereign players or is it primarily traditional hyperscalers and newer AI model builders. Thanks. Andrew Power : First off, Matt, thank you for being a role follower. Really appreciate that. Chris, why don't you give a little percentage, 50% overall, but how much in the call it, enterprise and then give us a little more color on some of the AI demand we've seen upon in the quarter and also within the pipeline. Christopher Sharp : Yeah. No, I appreciate the question, Matt. And so there's a lot happening across AI, which I think is at the core of your question. So it's not just about the hyperscalers. And I think it\u2019s pretty important to understand that the demand is pretty broad across all of the segments. And one just to particular highlight, and I don't speak about any customer specific details. But one of the things that we have great history with NVIDIA, right? And so we've been DGX certified, one of the leading providers, 30-plus data center is already pre-certified, but what's important to us is just yesterday, we were able to host Jensen Wong, CEO of NVIDIA and a kickoff of the largest DGX supercomputer in Europe. And so, it's just very exciting to support Novo Nordisk Foundation in that overall effort. And like, one of the things that I think is pretty interesting that highlight it is that Jensen quoted that it was the factor of intelligence. So something like that is fundamental in showing this private AI deployments are very relevant in coming into our overall portfolio. And the last piece I\u2019d like to just say is just to highlight that, that Digital Realty is foundational in that, and we\u2019re able to do it in a sustainable way because that facility runs on 100% renewable power. Operator : The next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. Please go ahead. David Guarino : Thanks. On your greater than 1 megawatt new leasing in the Americas, rents on a GAAP basis were almost 225-kilowatt this quarter. I'm guessing Manassas in Chicago, you called out were below that number. But does that suggest that hyperscale rental rates in Ashburn are pushing close to that 225 or maybe even 250-kilowatt number? Just any color you could share on the relative spread between markets would be helpful. Andrew Power : So -- those are GAAP rates, just a reminder. So you got to take the duration of the lease. You know the drill, David, in terms and the bumps. So they've certainly pushed them over. I can tell you in Ashburn, we had multiple customers, call it, face rates in the call it, 175 or 200 or higher, just slightly over 200, and call it, 8 megawatts or higher type of capacity blocks. Where we go from here? I'm not sure, you're going to see this repeat itself immediately. But the other markets have been catching up, but I think we'll continue to catch up over time, certainly, the comparables in the Chicago, the Dallas that have always trailed, the Ashburn trailing the Santa Clara and now trailing in Ashburn. And I do think you're just going to see more and more markets coalesce at these higher rates over time. David Guarino : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nicholas Del Deo : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. You've obviously got a ton of development work underway that's going to grow. I guess, can you talk a little bit about the steps you're taking to ensure that you're able to deliver all that on time, on budget without hiccups? Andrew Power : Thanks, Nick. So, first off, it's very important that we just didn't call it the [indiscernible] income and just get it yesterday. This company has been solely focused on this business for 20 years now. And we've been in these markets that I really touched on. We've been consistently operating, assembling land, building and delivering for our customers for many, many years. And in green to the communities with the utility providers. As we saw this opportunity evolve in scaling certainly came to mind, and that is what we did. -- that was feeling our supply chain. Our teams have call it, a great relationships with their vendors and making sure that we are future proofing those supply chains and being very collaborative with our partners. If one utility, some switch gear that we have in one market, we can bring it to another market, we're bringing those economies of scale. We're certainly scaling our team as well operationally. We're delivering a lot of capacity for our customers, and we're investing in our team, in our systems and actually the great training development of our team along the way. And then lastly, the capital. Massively capital intensive business and the great work of our organization over the last year to supplement our use of public equity with some great private investment partnerships, both on the stabilizing development. We see a really fantastic runway of capital intensive growth here interesting the fruits of our labor in terms of the rates and the returns bearing fruit, and we see this playing out for years to come. And we want to make sure that we have stable partners to help fund this business to generate long-term growth for our customers and our shareholders. Operator : That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd now like to turn the call back over to President and CEO, Andy Power for his closing remarks. Andy, please go ahead. Andrew Power : Thank you, Gary. Digital Realty posted a remarkable quarter in 3Q, reflecting the strong demand environment and demonstrating how Digital Realty is meeting the challenge to support our customers around the world.
